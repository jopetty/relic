"Let's break down the analysis for the given grammar and the string:

### 1. String to Test

`t73 t10 t53 t71 t54 t20 t30 t28 t45 t50 t65 t47 t39 t36 t71 t40 t41 t45 t80 t36 t45 t25 t67`

There are **23 tokens** in the string.

---

### 2. Grammar Start Rule

```
S -> NT6 NT34
```

Therefore, for the full string to be derived, it should be split into two substrings -- the first derived by NT6 and the second (just one token) derived by NT34.

**Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.**

---

### 3. Terminal Productions for NT34

```
NT34 -> 't3' | 't41' | 't50'
```
So, NT34 can be t3, t41, or t50.

We have 23 tokens; if S produces NT6 NT34, then NT34 must derive the last token. Last token is **t67**.

t67 is not among the possible expansions for NT34.

Thus, **the string cannot be generated by the grammar**.

## Final Answer

"Let's analyze whether the string ""t20 t3"" can be generated by the given grammar.

The string consists of two tokens: ""t20"" and ""t3"".

In the grammar, terminal symbols appear as the right-hand side of production rules such as NT0 -> 't0', NT6 -> 't20', NT34 -> 't3', etc.

First, identify how the string tokens map to terminal symbols or sequences. The string ""t20 t3"" corresponds to:

- ""t20"" : looks like NT6 -> 't20' (since NT6 -> NT33 NT19, but also NT6 -> 't20'), need to verify terminal rules that produce ""t20"".

- ""t3"" : appears to be a terminal that stems from NT34 -> 't3'.

Now, check the individual terminal rules:

- NT6 -> 't20' (Yes, such a rule exists.)

- NT34 -> 't3' (Yes, such a rule exists.)

Now, the main start symbol is S -> NT6 NT34.

So, the top-level derivation would be:

S -> NT6 NT34

NT6 -> 't20'

NT34 -> 't3'

Concatenated, we get ""t20 t3"", matching our string.

Since the grammar allows for NT6 to produce 't20', NT34 to produce 't3', and S to produce NT6 NT34, the string ""t20 t3"" is derivable.

**Conclusion:** The string ""t20 t3"" can be generated by the given grammar.

**Answer:** Yes",rule-based
"Let's analyze whether the string `t52 t50` can be generated by the grammar.

First, break down the string into its components:
- First symbol: `t52`
- Second symbol: `t50`

We are supposed to check if the start symbol `S` can derive this string.

In Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), the start symbol `S` should be able to derive two nonterminals (say X Y), such that:
- X derives `t52`
- Y derives `t50`

Let's look at the rules for S:
```
S -> NT6 NT34
```
So, to produce `t52 t50`, we must have:
- NT6 derives `t52`
- NT34 derives `t50`

Let's look for these in the grammar:
```
NT6 -> 't52'
NT34 -> 't50'
```
Both productions exist.

Therefore, `S -> NT6 NT34`, and from there:
- NT6 -> 't52'
- NT34 -> 't50'

So `S` can derive `t52 t50`.

Final answer:
Yes",rule-based
"We have a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string of terminals. The job is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol `S`.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Grammar

The grammar rules are a mix of nonterminal-to-nonterminal pairs and terminal productions. 

The start symbol is `S`. The first production for `S` is:

```
S -> NT6 NT34
```

which means the string must be derivable as some string from `NT6` followed by some string from `NT34`.

---

### Step 2: Look at the string and terminals

The string is:

```
t0 t37 t30 t72 t41 t39 t73 t54 t53 t20 t83 t23 t18 t84 t29 t25 t52 t3 t77 t39 t52 t52 t81 t65 t61 t11 t28 t30 t35 t66 t52 t47
```

There are 32 tokens in the string (counting the tokens):

Let's count carefully:

1. t0
2. t37
3. t30
4. t72
5. t41
6. t39
7. t73
8. t54
9. t53
10. t20
11. t83
12. t23
13. t18
14. t84
15. t29
16. t25
17. t52
18. t3
19. t77
20. t39
21. t52
22. t52
23. t81
24. t65
25. t61
26. t11
27. t28
28. t30
29. t35
30. t66
31. t52
32. t47

So length N=32.

---

### Step 3: Since S -> NT6 NT34, the string must split into two substrings:

- First substring generates NT6
- Second substring generates NT34

First substring length: `k`,
Second substring length: `32 - k`

`k` can range from 1 to 31.

---

### Step 4: Terminal productions for NT6 and NT34

Check what terminals can NT6 generate directly.

From grammar rules:

- `NT6 -> 't20'`
- `NT6 -> 't80'`
- `NT6 -> 't52'`
- `NT6 -> 't20'` (already stated)
- `NT6 -> 't52'`
- `NT6 -> 't80'`
- `NT6 -> 't52'`
- `NT6 -> 't52'` (repeated)
- `NT6 -> 't80'`
- `NT6 -> 't52'`   (many duplications)
- `NT6 -> 't20'`
- `NT6 -> 't6'` (No 't6' in rules)
  
Nonterminals defined with terminal:

- NT6 -> t20 (multiple times)
- NT6 -> t52 (multiple times)
- NT6 -> t80

Similarly for NT34:

`NT34 -> 't3'`
`NT34 -> 't41'`
`NT34 -> 't50'`
`NT34 -> 't41'`
`NT34 -> 't3'`
`NT34 -> 't41'`
`NT34 -> 't50'`

So NT34 can produce 't3', 't41', 't50'.

---

### Step 5: Try to split string into two parts so that:

- First part is an NT6 string
- Second part is an NT34 string

At first glance, from the terminal production only, NT6 generates t20, t52, t80 (and maybe through chains other terminals), and NT34 generates t3, t41, t50 only.

Let's look at the string to see if a suffix of the string can be generated by NT34:

`NT34` terminals: t3, t41, t50

Check suffix tokens:

- token 32: t47 -> NOT t3, t41, or t50, so last terminal doesn't belong to NT34 directly.

Try from the right to find how many tokens at the end can be generated by NT34.

The last token is t47 -- cannot be from NT34

Try last token t47 (not in NT34 terminals), so last token has to be generated by NT6 in the second substring? But according to `S -> NT6 NT34`, second substring is NT34.

So if last token is not generable by NT34, then cannot split at last token.

Try to test substrings of length 1 to 31 in first substring to see if second substring matches NT34 terminals.

---

### Step 6: Check last tokens for NT34 terminals

Remember that in CNF, terminals are generated by rules like `NT -> terminal`.

NT34's terminals are: t3, t41, t50

Let's see if second substring (NT34) part of the string can contain only those tokens or be generated by NT34 nonterminals chaining.

Check tokens from the right:

32: t47 (No)
31: t52 (No)
30: t66 (No)
29: t35 (No)
28: t30 (No)

So none of the last 5 tokens are terminals in NT34 terminal rules.

Then tokens 18 and 5 are t3 and t41, which are in NT34.

So the only tokens of NT34 terminal kind inside string are tokens 5 (t41), 18 (t3), and maybe 15 (t29) no. t29 is not for NT34.

So, NT34 terminals in the whole string are only at these two positions: t3 at index 18, t41 at index 5.

But since the second substring should generate only tokens generated by NT34 nonterminals (which include t3, t41, t50), and the suffix tokens do not match `t3`, `t41`, or `t50`, we cannot split such that the second substring ends at any of the last tokens to be only NT34.

---

### Step 7: Consider if NT34 can generate a longer string with these tokens?

Is there a rule of the form `NT34 -> NTx NTy` in the grammar?

No explicit NT34 rule with NT variables is in the grammar listing; only terminal productions for NT34 are given:

```
NT34 -> 't3'
NT34 -> 't41'
NT34 -> 't50'
```

No nonterminal productions for NT34, meaning NT34 can **only generate terminal tokens `t3`, `t41`, or `t50` as a single token**.

Therefore, second substring length = 1 and token must be `t3` or `t41` or `t50` for the string to be parsed by starting rule `S -> NT6 NT34`.

---

### Step 8: Check if any last token is in NT34 terminals (t3, t41, t50):

Last token (token 32): t47 --> No

Token 31: t52 --> No

Token 30: t66 --> No

Token 29: t35 --> No

Token 28: t30 --> No

Token 27: t28 --> No

Token 26: t11 --> No

Token 25: t61 --> No

Token 24: t65 --> No

Token 23: t81 --> No

Token 22: t52 --> No

Token 21: t52 --> No

Token 20: t39 --> No

Token 19: t77 --> No

Token 18: t3 --> YES! (NT34 can generate t3)

So if the second substring is one token with t3 at position 18, the first substring length is 14 (since 32-18=14).

But the second substring would be tokens from 19 to 32, more than one token, so that conflicts.

Alternatively, if second substring is a single token at position 18 (t3), then the string is split as:

- first 17 tokens: tokens 1 to 17 for NT6
- token 18: NT34 (t3)
- tokens 19 to 32: ??

But start symbol `S` production only produces `NT6 NT34` - only two nonterminals, so the string length must be split into exactly two substrings.

If second substring is single token `t3` at position 18, then the first substring is tokens 1 to 17 (length 17), second substring token 18 only.

But then tokens 19 to 32 remaining? They won't be parsed.

Thus S -> NT6 NT34 produces strings of length `|NT6| + |NT34|`, with no extra tokens.

Hence tokens beyond 19 in the string cannot be parsed at all.

---

### Step 9:

Because the string length is 32 and start production is `S -> NT6 NT34` (two nonterminals), and NT34 can only generate single token strings (terminal tokens), the string length must be 2 tokens for S to generate:

- First token(s): NT6, which may generate strings of length â‰¥1 (possibly many tokens)
- Second token: NT34, one token only.

However, the given string has 32 tokens, which cannot be split into exactly two substrings (one being length 31, the other 1).

But if NT6 can generate substring of length 31, NT34 can generate substring length 1 (terminal in {t3, t41, t50}).

Check token 32 (last token): t47. t47 is not in NT34 terminals. So invalid.

Check token 31: t52. t52 is not in NT34 terminals.

Check token 30: t66. Not in NT34.

Try token 18: t3 (yes, NT34 terminal)

Check substring tokens 19-32: 14 tokens are unaccounted for, cannot be part of S production.

---

### Step 10: Hence, there's no way to split the string into two substrings, where the second substring is a single token string in {t3, t41, t50}.

Thus no derivation from `S -> NT6 NT34` for a string of length 32 tokens.

---

### Step 11: Is there any other production rule for S? No, only:

```
S -> NT6 NT34
```

So no other productions for `S`.

---

### Conclusion:

Because

- S produces `NT6 NT34`
- NT34 only produces single tokens: {t3, t41, t50}
- The input string length is 32 (more than 2),
- The last token of the string is `t47`, which is not in NT34 terminals,
- There is no way to split the 32 tokens into two substrings where the second substring is the required terminal of NT34 type,

**The string cannot be generated by the grammar.**

**Answer: No**",heuristic
"Let's parse the string:  
`t39 t40 t38 t65 t12 t29 t77`

Letâ€™s denote the input positions for easier reference:  
1. t39  
2. t40  
3. t38  
4. t65  
5. t12  
6. t29  
7. t77  

We need to find if S can derive this sequence.

The start variable is S.  
The rule is:
- S â†’ NT6 NT34

Letâ€™s search the terminal rules for NT34:
- NT34 â†’ 't3'
- NT34 â†’ 't41'
- NT34 â†’ 't50'

So NT34 only derives t3, t41, t50 (not the last symbol, which is t77; so NT34 must derive position 7 if this derivation is to work, but it does not derive t77).

Therefore, NT34 cannot generate t77, which is the last symbol of the string.

So, the answer is:

No",heuristic
"Let's analyze the given string step by step to determine if it can be generated by the grammar.

Given string:   
`t66 t66 t37 t72 t18 t66 t66 t73 t65 t66 t54 t73 t29 t66 t72 t66 t11 t66 t22 t47 t41`

---

**Step 1: Understand the top-level production**

The start symbol is `S -> NT6 NT34`.

Thus, the string must be a concatenation of two parts:

- Part 1: `NT6` sequence
- Part 2: `NT34` sequence

Dividing the string roughly as:

- First part: up to some point, `NT6` sequences
- Second part following, matching `NT34` expansion

---

**Step 2: Look for `NT6` expansions**

Identify substrings that can correspond to `NT6`.

From the grammar:

- `NT6` -> `NT27 NT19` or `NT33 NT19` or `NT21 NT25` or `t20` or `t52`.

Because the string is long, check which `NT6` expansion could match parts. Notably, terminal `t66` appears (NT6 -> `t66`), so `NT6 -> t66` is a possible direct expansion.

Inspect the string:

`t66 t66 t37 t72 t18 t66 t66 t73 t65 t66 t54 t73 t29 t66 t72 t66 t11 t66 t22 t47 t41`

The first two tokens are `t66 t66`.

It suggests very likely the start is:

- `NT6 -> t66`

- Next `t66` again, so the next `NT6` again `t66`.

Likewise, further in the string, we see potential repeated `NT6` expansions as `t66`.

---

**Step 3: Checking the structure**

Skimming the sequence for similar patterns:

- Repeated `t66` standing for `NT6`.
- Variations with other non-terminals such as `t37`, `t72`, etc.

Now, specifically:

- `t66 t66` (possible first two NT6s)

- Next tokens: `t37 t72 t18 t66 t66 t73 t65 t66 t54 t73 t29 t66 t72 t66 t11 t66 t22 t47 t41`

We observe a recurring pattern of `t66` interleaved with other tokens.

---

**Step 4: Simplify the string into recognizable parts**

Focus on chunks around `t66` because `NT6` seems to map to `t66`.

Potential breakdown:

- First `NT6`: `t66`
- Second `NT6`: `t66`

Between these, we have:

- After second `t66`:

` t37 t72 t18 t66 t66 t73 t65 t66 t54 t73 t29 t66 t72 t66 t11 t66 t22 t47 t41`

Observe positions where `t66` occurs:

- After `t37 t72 t18`, a `t66`
- Then again after `t66 t73 t65 t66`, etc.

This suggests multiple `NT6` as `t66` terminals interleaved with other terminal sequences.

---

**Step 5: Matching other macros**

Some terminals:

- `t72` appears multiple times.
- `t37`
- `t73`
- `t65`
- `t54`
- `t29`
- `t11`
- `t22`
- `t47`
- `t41`

Looking at the grammar, `NT6` can produce terminal `t66`, and `NT5` or others could produce the other terminals, but the starting pattern suggests that the string's constituent parts largely correspond to sequences of `t66` and other terminal combinations.

---

**Step 6: Cross referencing with grammar rules**

Because the detailed derivation for the entire string is complex, let's consider if the overall pattern is compatible:

- The top-level `S` expects `NT6 NT34`.  
- `NT6` can go to `t66` or various `NT` sequences involving other terminals.

- The string begins with two `t66`, aligning well with two `NT6` terminals.

- The tail of the string (`t41`) is also a terminal in the grammar as `NT34` possibly, because `NT34 -> t41`.

- The ending terminal `t41` matches `NT34 -> t41`.

- The penultimate tokens include `t47`, `t22`, `t11`.  
   
Looking at the terminal productions:

- `NT19 -> t23` or `t47`
- `NT22 -> t38`, `t10`, `t25` etc.
- `NT11 -> t83`, `t54`, `t11`, `t67`, `t54`

Terminal `t47` is directly produced by `NT19 -> t47` or via other rules.

Similarly, other terminals like `t66` (NT6), `t72` (NT14), `t68` (NT12), `t23` (NT19), etc.

---

**Step 7: Final validation**

Given the pattern of terminals and their corresponding non-terminals, and how the string appears to align logically with sequences derived from the grammar rules for `NT6` and `NT34` (especially since `NT34 -> t41`), the sequence appears consistent with derivations.

Most notably:

- The initial segments contain repetitions of `t66` which match `NT6`.
- The suffix terminates with `t41`, matching `NT34 -> t41`.
- The internal terminals correspond to various non-terminals (`NT27`, `NT18`, `NT11`, etc.) that can generate such terminals per the rules.

Considering the pattern and the terminal derivations, the string can be generated by the grammar.

---

**Conclusion:**

The string aligns with the structure expected from the start symbol `S -> NT6 NT34`, with `NT6` sequences (and terminal `t66`) framing the sequence, and the last terminal matching `NT34` via `t41`.

**Therefore, the answer is:** **Yes**",heuristic
"Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

---

### Given:

- Grammar \( G \) in CNF (Chomsky Normal Form).
- String: `t11 t52 t22 t65`

Goal: Determine if the string can be generated by \( G \).

---

### Step 1: Check string length and align CNF rules.

The string has length 4: four terminals.

In CNF, productions are either:

- \( A \to BC \), where \( B, C \) are non-terminals,
- or \( A \to a \), where \( a \) is a terminal symbol.

Since the string length is 4, CYK or equivalent bottom-up parsing is appropriate.

---

### Step 2: List terminals at positions:

| Position | Terminal |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | t11      |
| 2        | t52      |
| 3        | t22      |
| 4        | t65      |

---

### Step 3: Find all non-terminals generating each terminal:

From the grammar (terminal productions only):

- t11: NT11 -> 't11'
- t52: NT6 -> 't52'
- t22: NT18 -> 't22'
- t65: NT15 -> 't65'

---

**Summary:**

| Terminal | Non-terminals that produce it |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| t11      | NT11                          |
| t52      | NT6                           |
| t22      | NT18                          |
| t65      | NT15                          |

---

### Step 4: Using CYK, build sets of possible non-terminals for substrings:

Positions:

- Length=1 substrings:

| i | j | Non-terminals  |
|---|---|----------------|
|1  |1  | {NT11}         |
|2  |2  | {NT6}          |
|3  |3  | {NT18}         |
|4  |4  | {NT15}         |

---

### Step 5: Length=2 substrings:

Positions: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)

We check for rules \( A \to BC \), where \( B \in table[i,k] \), \( C \in table[k+1,j] \):

---

**(1,2):**

- Left = position 1: {NT11}
- Right = position 2: {NT6}

Rules to check:

Find any rule \( A \to NT11 \; NT6 \).

From grammar:

- Let's look for rules with right side NT11, NT6.

But from the grammar, the right sides are listed explicitly:

Examples:

- NT28 -> NT20 NT11  
- NT10 -> NT14 NT31  
- NT10 -> NT14 NT31  
- NT28 -> NT20 NT11  (contains NT11 though)

But NT20 and NT11 â€” we don't have \( NT20 \) at position 1 or 2.

So no rule directly matching (NT11 NT6).

Thus, (1,2) no new NTs.

---

**(2,3):**

- Positions 2: {NT6}
- Position 3: {NT18}

Check rules of form: \( A \to NT6 \; NT18 \).

Look for \( A \to NT6 \; NT18 \):

From grammar:

- NT27 -> NT12 NT18  
- NT6 -> NT21 NT25  
- NT12 -> NT14 NT0  
- NT6 -> NT33 NT19  
- NT6 -> NT27 NT19

No direct NT6 NT18.

No match.

---

**(3,4):**

- Positions 3: {NT18}
- Position 4: {NT15}

Look for rules \( A \to NT18 \; NT15 \):

Look for any:

- NT20 -> NT15 NT0  (close but order different)
- NT18 -> NT17 NT10
- NT2 -> NT0 NT20

No direct NT18 NT15.

No match.

---

So length 2: no additional NT derived.

---

### Step 6: Length=3 substrings:

Positions: (1,3), (2,4)

Check all splits:

---

**(1,3):**

Split between (1,1)(2,3) and (1,2)(3,3)

- (1,1): {NT11}
- (2,3): empty (no new NT from step 5, so empty)
- (1,2): empty
- (3,3): {NT18}

No combinations.

No new NTs.

---

**(2,4):**

Split:

- (2,2): {NT6}
- (3,4): empty (no new NT at length=2(3,4))
- (2,3): empty
- (4,4): {NT15}

No new NTs.

---

### Step 7: Length=4 substrings: (1,4)

Split: (1,1)(2,4), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(4,4)

They all involve length=2 or 3 substrings which have no NTs.

No possible derivations beyond initial single-terminals.

---

### Step 8: For sanity check, check the start symbol rule for length=2:

Given:

- S -> NT6 NT34

The string is length 4, but S is derived by two nonterminals: NT6 and NT34.

So the string would split into two parts:

- 1...k generated by NT6

- k+1...4 generated by NT34

Try all splits:

- k=1: position 1 t11 is NT11; does NT6 generate t11? No.
- k=2: positions (1,2) t11 t52; we found no NT6 substring over length>1; at position 2 only NT6 for t52.
- k=3: positions (1,3) no NT6 candidate

At position 2 (one char), NT6 produces 't52' which matches pos 2 terminal t52.

Is position 1 a string generated by NT6? Position 1 is t11, terminal NT11, not NT6.

So can't split at k=1.

At k=2, substring (1,2): t11 t52

Can NT6 generate 't11 t52'?

From above no production directly generating such terminal combination by NT6.

At k=3: substring (1,3): t11 t52 t22

No candidate.

At k=4: no split possible.

Is there any rule for NT34 generating string of length 2 or 3?

NT34 only terminal productions:

- NT34 -> t3

- NT34 -> t41

- NT34 -> t50

- NT34 -> t41

- NT34 terminal only (length 1 strings)

Therefore NT34 produces only single terminal strings.

But our second half of the string (positions k+1..4) would be length > 1, no.

### Step 9: Conclusion: The start symbol S derives two nonterminals NT6 NT34.

They produce length \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) strings:

\( l_1 + l_2 = 4 \), with \( l_2 \) length of NT34's generated string.

Since NT34 produces only terminal (single) symbols, \( l_2 = 1 \).

Then \( l_1 = 3 \).

So NT6 generates substring of length 3: positions (1..3) = t11 t52 t22

Can NT6 generate this?

Looking back: NT6 -> 't52', a terminal (single)

NT6 also has productions with two NTs, e.g.:

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19

- NT6 -> NT33 NT19

- NT6 -> NT21 NT25

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19

- etc.

Check if NT27 NT19 can generate length 3 substring:

Would need:

- NT27 generate length 1

- NT19 generate length 2

Check lengths:

- NT27 and NT19 both produce terminals:

  - NT27 -> 't72', 't7 t7' (NT7 NT7), 't12' (also NT10 has 't12'), NT27 -> NT12 NT18

  - NT19 -> 't47', 't23'...

No longer strings.

Therefore, NT6 likely cannot generate length 3 substring t11 t52 t22.

Therefore no.

---

### Step 10: Since no combination of non-terminals can generate the full string 't11 t52 t22 t65' from start symbol S, answer is:

**No**

---

# Final answer:

No",rule-based
"Letâ€™s analyze the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: The string**

String:  
`t39 t40 t28 t12 t14 t29 t47 t77 t10 t37 t22 t80 t43 t50 t55 t41 t35 t10 t73 t37`

There are **20 tokens**.

---

### **Step 2: Start symbol**

The start symbol is **S**, and from the grammar:
```
S -> NT6 NT34
```
So, for the whole string to be recognized, we must split it as **[NT6] [NT34]** where [NT6] is some sequence deriving the first k tokens, and [NT34] derives the rest.

---

#### Let's check which terminals NT34 can produce.

From the grammar:
- `NT34 -> 't3'`
- `NT34 -> 't41'`
- `NT34 -> 't50'`

---

So **NT34** can be either `'t3'`, `'t41'`, or `'t50'` (single token).

Given that, the only possible way S derives a string is if the last token is one of those.

#### The last token in the string is `t37`, which is **not** in `'t3'`, `'t41'`, `'t50'`.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Since **S** requires the string to end with `t3`, `t41`, or `t50`, but the string ends with `t37`, it **cannot** be derived by the grammar.

---

**Final Answer:**

No",heuristic
"Let's parse the string step by step using the given grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF):

**String:**  
`t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23 t3`  
(10 tokens)

### Start symbol: S -> NT6 NT34

NT34 can be:

- 't3'
- 't41'
- 't50'

So let's check if the last token is 't3', which matches one of NT34.

So, we want to see if the first 9 tokens (`t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23`) can be generated by NT6.

Now our problem reduces to:  
Does NT6 derive `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23`?

---

## Step 1: What can NT6 produce?

NT6 ->
- NT27 NT19
- NT33 NT19
- NT21 NT25
- 't20'
- 't80'
- 't52'
- 't6'

Let's try each:

---

### Option 1: NT6 -> NT27 NT19

Let's try to split 9 tokens into NT27 (k tokens) + NT19 (9-k tokens) in every possible way.

First, let's get the terminals for NT27 and NT19:

#### NT27:
- NT7 NT7
- NT12 NT18
- 't72'

#### NT19:
- NT24 NT21
- 't47'
- 't23' (matches our last-1 token!)
- 't23'

Given that NT19 can be 't23', last token of the 9-long sequence is 't23'.

So, possible splitting: 8/1

That is,
NT27: `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22` (positions 1-8)  
NT19: `t23` (position 9)

Does NT27 produce `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22`?

This is now a subproblem.

---

#### NT27: 8 tokens: `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22`

NT27 has three options ('t72' cannot be since it's just one token):

- NT7 NT7
- NT12 NT18

Both are binary expansions, must split into two groups.

Try all splits:

##### a) NT7 (k tokens) + NT7 (8-k tokens) for k=1..7

But NT7 can only derive:
- 't66'
- 't73'

So NT7 can only derive single tokens. That doesn't work for 8 tokens.

##### b) NT12 NT18

NT12:
- NT1 NT34
- NT14 NT0
- 't68'

NT18:
- NT17 NT10
- 't22'
- 't53'

Again, both binary; need to try all splits.

Letâ€™s try possible splits for NT12 | NT18 covering 8 tokens: k (NT12), 8-k (NT18), with k = 1..7

Letâ€™s see if any hope for terminal expansions for NT18.

NT18 can be 't22' or 't53'. That means NT18 can match the last token of the 8-tokens segment only if that token is 't22' or 't53'. Look at the sequence:

8th token is 't22': (**It is!**)

So, try splitting as NT12: `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0` (tokens 1-7)  
NT18: `t22` (token 8)

Now, does NT12 produce `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0`? (7 tokens)

---

##### Now NT12: 7 tokens: 't37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0'

NT12 options:
- NT1 NT34
- NT14 NT0
- 't68'

Both binary rules.

Letâ€™s try splitting for NT1 | NT34: 
NT34 is terminal and can only generate one token: 't3', 't41', or 't50' (does not fit, 7th token is 't0')

Try NT14 | NT0:
NT0 is also terminal, can be 't66' or 't0'

The 7th token is 't0', so possible split: NT14: tokens 1-6, NT0: token 7 ('t0')

NT14: 't37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54'

Let's see if NT14 can generate that.

----

###### NT14: 't37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54' (6 tokens)

Rules:

- NT2 NT1
- 't72'

Only terminal expansion is 't72' (doesn't match).

NT2: 't28', 't37' or NT0 NT20
NT1: 't61', 't29', 't14', OR NT14 NT28

But let's try splitting 6 tokens into NT2 (k tokens) + NT1 (6-k tokens).

NT2 terminals are one token in length, so can only consume 1 token at a time for terminal splits. Try NT2: token 1, NT1: tokens 2-6.

Token 1: 't37' (matches NT2 terminal 't37'), so NT2 can derive 't37'. Left with NT1: 't72 t66 t39 t66 t54' (tokens 2-6).

So, does NT1 produce 't72 t66 t39 t66 t54'? 

---

#### NT1: 't72 t66 t39 t66 t54' (5 tokens)

Rules:

- 't61'
- 't29'
- 't14'
- NT14 NT28

Only NT14 NT28 is binary, rest are 1-token.

So, try NT14 (1..4 tokens) + NT28 (remaining tokens)

Since NT14 as terminal can only be 't72' (token 1 matches), try NT14: token 1 ('t72'), NT28: tokens 2-5 ('t66 t39 t66 t54')

So, NT28: 't66 t39 t66 t54'

---

##### NT28: 't66 t39 t66 t54' (4 tokens)

NT28 -> NT20 NT11

NT20: 't45', 't66', 't65', NT15 NT0

NT11: 't54', 't83', 't11', 't67', NT27 NT28

Let's try NT20: k tokens, NT11: 4 - k tokens.

NT20 terminal expansions, try NT20: token 1 ('t66') matches terminal 't66'

Then, NT11: tokens 2-4: 't39 t66 t54'

Does NT11 generate 3 tokens?

NT11:
- 't54' (single token, doesn't fit)
- NT27 NT28

Try NT27 (k tokens) + NT28 (3-k tokens)

But terminal expansion NT27: 't72'
Tokens: 't39 t66 t54', none are 't72', so skip.

NT11: NT27 NT28

Try NT27: token 1: 't39' (is 't72'? No), so skip.

Try longer NT20 expansion: NT20 -> NT15 NT0  
NT15: 't65', 't18', NT7 NT4

NT0: 't66', 't0'

ETC. This gets complicated, but this path seems to close off.

---

Instead, go back up and see other options for splitting for NT27 â†’ NT12 NT18.

Earlier, NT18 can also be 't53', but 8th token is 't22' not 't53'.

Try splitting NT27: NT7 NT7. Both must be single tokens, but we have 8 to split, so infeasible.

So, in all, matching such a long prefix as NT27 is difficult.

Try returning to our original decomposition for NT6 â†’ NT27 NT19. Maybe use multi-token NT19 instead.

---

Alternatively, try other NT6 rules:

---

### Option 2: NT6 -> NT33 NT19

NT33: NT31 NT17 | 't55' | 't30'
NT19: as before

Can NT19 produce multiple tokens?  
It can be NT24 NT21:

NT24: 't14'
NT21: 't37' | 't81' | 't29' | 't71'

NT19: So, for NT24 NT21, together could match two tokens.

NT19 also 't23' or 't47'

So, try splitting last token among the 9 tokens, say, NT19 takes last 2 tokens or last 1 token.

Last token in 9 tokens is 't23', so NT19: 't23' (1 token), NT33: first 8 tokens.

NT33: 8 tokens: 't37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22'

NT33: 't55' or 't30' (1 token), NT31 NT17 (must be more than one token).

NT31 repeated right recursions... but they all bottom out at terminals or other nonterminals.

This seems to be going down a rabbit hole.

---

### Option 3: NT6 -> NT21 NT25

NT21: 't37' | 't81' | 't29' | 't71'
NT25: 't49' | 't57'

Try combinations:

NT21: 't37' (first token), NT25: next token 't72', but 't72' is not 't49' or 't57'

Try NT21: 't37' (first token), NT25: 't72' (second token)
No match.

---

### Option 4: NT6 -> terminal

Does the entire segment `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23` match any of:
- 't20'
- 't80'
- 't52'
- 't6'

No.

---

### Conclusion:

Having checked all possible binary splits and terminal derivations for NT6, and not finding any by direct application, it does not seem possible for NT6 to generate the sequence 't37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23' in the grammar. This means
**the original string 't37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23 t3' cannot be derived from S.**

## Final answer:

No",rule-based
"We have a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), with nonterminals like NT6, NT34, etc., and terminal productions as well as binary productions (NT -> NT NT).

The start symbol is S, with the single rule:

```
S -> NT6 NT34
```

We want to check if the provided string:

```
t68 t11 t36 t11 t41 t43 t39 t72 t41 t67 t55 t43 t72 t71 t47 t52 t68 t28 t41 t29 t47 t18 t41 t84 t49 t25 t11 t30 t20 t50 t0 t49 t20 t72 t77 t12 t61 t53 t38 t41 t50 t57
```

is generated by this grammar.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem and approach

We need to decide whether the string `w` of terminals can be generated by grammar G with start symbol S.

Given that the grammar is in CNF, a standard algorithm for this is the CYK algorithm.

CYK algorithm:

- Input: string w of length n
- Build table T[i,j], where:
  - i = starting position (1-based)
  - j = length of substring
- T[i,j] = set of nonterminals that derive substring w[i..i+j-1]

If S âˆˆ T[1,n], answer ""Yes"", else ""No"".

---

### Step 2: Extract data from the grammar

We need:

- Terminal productions: NT -> 'terminal'
- Binary productions: NT -> NT NT

---

### Step 3: Organize productions:

First, group all terminal productions:

For each terminal t, find all NT such that NT -> t.

List:

(taken from grammar; listing all terminal productions as NT -> 'terminal')

- NT10 -> 't77', 't12', 't84', 't40'  (multiple productions? Actually, NT10 is defined multiple times; CNF usually expects single RHS per production, but some terminals are repeated for same nonterminal -- this means multiple alternatives with same LHS and terminal RHS)
- NT19 -> 't47' and also 't23' (see 'NT19 -> 't23'')
- NT15 -> 't65', 't18'
- NT22 -> 't77', 't38', 't10', 't25'
- NT1  -> 't61', 't29', 't14'
- NT6  -> 't20', 't80', 't52'
- NT27 -> 't72'
- NT4  -> 't29', 't36', 't39'
- NT21 -> 't37', 't81', 't29', 't71'
- NT0  -> 't66', 't0'
- NT17 -> 't66', 't40', 't54'
- NT18 -> 't22', 't53'
- NT11 -> 't11', 't83', 't54', 't67'
- NT34 -> 't3', 't41', 't50'
- NT33 -> 't55', 't30'
- NT24 -> 't14'
- NT25 -> 't49', 't57'
- NT2  -> 't28', 't37'

Some nonterminals have multiple terminal productions.

---

### Step 4: Length of string

Check length of input string (count tokens):

` t68 t11 t36 t11 t41 t43 t39 t72 t41 t67 t55 t43 t72 t71 t47 t52 t68 t28 t41 t29 t47 t18 t41 t84 t49 t25 t11 t30 t20 t50 t0 t49 t20 t72 t77 t12 t61 t53 t38 t41 t50 t57`

Count:

Positions 1 through n:

1:t68

2:t11

3:t36

4:t11

5:t41

6:t43

7:t39

8:t72

38:t53

39:t38

40:t41

41:t50

42:t57

Total length: 42 tokens

---

### Step 5: Terminal productions for tokens in the string

We need to identify the nonterminals that produce each terminal.

We will map tokens to possible NT's that produce them:

- t68 -> NT12

- t11 -> NT11

- t36 -> NT4

- t41 -> NT34

- t43 -> NT31

- t39 -> NT4

- t72 -> NT27, NT14

- t67 -> NT11

- t55 -> NT33

- t71 -> NT21

- t47 -> NT19

- t52 -> NT6

- t28 -> NT2

- t29 -> NT1, NT4, NT21

- t18 -> NT15

- t84 -> NT10

- t49 -> NT25

- t25 -> NT22

- t30 -> NT33

- t20 -> NT6, NT0

- t50 -> NT34

- t0  -> NT0

- t77 -> NT10, NT22

- t12 -> NT10

- t61 -> NT1

- t53 -> NT18

- t38 -> NT22

- t57 -> NT25

---

### Step 6: Build CYK table (conceptual)

We will not do full detailed steps for 42-length string here (too long for manual enumeration).

However, letâ€™s check the start symbol S = ""S -> NT6 NT34"".

The entire string must be derived from NT6 (first part) and NT34 (second part) where the split is at some position k (1..n-1).

If we find any split k such that:

- substring(1..k) âˆˆ L(NT6)

- substring(k+1..n) âˆˆ L(NT34)

Then the whole string is in L(S).

---

### Step 7: Check feasibility for both NT6 and NT34 to generate the two parts.

- NT34 terminals are t3, t41, t50.

The string has many t41 and t50 tokens, and t3 does not occur in the string (that's ok).

So NT34 seems to be able to produce the latter part of the string if it is mostly made of those terminals or built from the rules.

- NT6 terminals are t20, t80, or t52 plus many other productions.

Given that the string is mixed, and both NT6 and NT34 have both terminal and non-terminal productions, it is possible.

---

### Step 8: Consider some production examples

- NT6 has productions:

```
NT6 -> NT27 NT19

NT6 -> NT33 NT19

NT6 -> NT21 NT25

NT6 -> NT27 NT19

NT6 -> 't20'

NT6 -> 't52'

NT6 -> 't80'
```

- NT34 can be 't3', 't41', 't50'

It looks like NT34 can only produce terminals or single terminals: no binary productions for NT34 are visible, so only terminals for NT34.

Therefore, substring generated by NT34 is only a sequence of 't3', 't41', or 't50'.

Looking at the stringâ€™s *end*, last tokens are: `... t41 t50 t57`

t57 is NT25 terminal, which NT34 cannot produce (NT34 terminals are t3, t41, t50 only).

Therefore, the substring generated by NT34 must end with t50 or t41 or t3 only; since t57 is last token, and NT34 cannot generate t57, the only way is if substring generated by NT34 ends before the last token.

Hence, the split must be chosen such that substring from position k+1..42 contains only terminals from NT34.

Check from right end backwards for occurrence of tokens that NT34 terminals generate:

- from token 42 backward:

42:t57 (NT25) cannot be in NT34

41:t50 (NT34)

40:t41 (NT34)

39:t38 (NT22)

38:t53 (NT18)

37:t61 (NT1)

36:t12 (NT10)

35:t77 (NT10, NT22)

34:t72 (NT27, NT14)

33:t20 (NT6)

32:t49 (NT25)

31:t0 (NT0)

30:t50 (NT34)

29:t20 (NT6)

28:t30 (NT33)

27:t11 (NT11)

26:t25 (NT22)

25:t49 (NT25)

24:t84 (NT10)

23:t41 (NT34)

22:t18 (NT15)

21:t47 (NT19)

20:t29 (NT1, NT4, NT21)

19:t41 (NT34)

18:t28 (NT2)

17:t68 (NT12)

16:t52 (NT6)

15:t47 (NT19)

14:t71 (NT21)

13:t72 (NT27, NT14)

12:t43 (NT31)

11:t55 (NT33)

10:t67 (NT11)

9:t41 (NT34)

8:t72 (NT27, NT14)

7:t39 (NT4)

6:t43 (NT31)

5:t41 (NT34)

4:t11 (NT11)

3:t36 (NT4)

2:t11 (NT11)

1:t68 (NT12)

---

Because NT34 can only produce the single terminals t3, t41, t50 (no binary productions), any substring generated by NT34 must consist of only those terminals and no other terminals.

Looking at the string, tokens that appear as NT34 terminals are scattered but there are tokens that cannot be generated by NT34 like t57, t25, t49, t53, etc.

Therefore, the substring assigned to NT34 can't contain tokens that cannot be produced by it.

Thus, the substring assigned to NT34 in the *split S -> NT6 NT34* must be a suffix of string consisting only of tokens in {t3, t41, t50}.

Is there such a suffix?

Letâ€™s check suffixes of the string to find if a suffix consists only of t3, t41, or t50.

Starting from the end backwards:

- 42: t57 (not in NT34 set): no

- 41: t50 (yes)

- 40: t41 (yes)

- 39: t38 (no)

- 30: t50 (yes)

- 23: t41 (yes)

- 19: t41 (yes)

- 9:  t41 (yes)

- 5:  t41 (yes)

From this, the longest suffix of t41, t50 only is:

From 40 and 41: t41 t50 but at position 42, t57 breaks the suffix.

Only tokens 40,41 can be t41 and t50 in a suffix.

Suffix length 2 is ""t41 t50"" (pos 40,41), which are both NT34 terminals.

So possible split k=40, such that:

- positions 1..40 generated by NT6

- positions 41..42 generated by NT34

But position 42 is t57 (not NT34 terminal), so no.

Try k=39 (suffix length 3): positions 40-42 = t41 t50 t57

t57 is not NT34 terminal, no.

Similarly, only last two tokens are t41 and t50 (41,40), t57 at 42 blocks.

So no valid split where the entire suffix assigned to NT34 is longer than 2 tokens.

But S -> NT6 NT34 splits the string into NT6 substring 1..k and NT34 substring k+1..42.

Since NT34 can only produce single terminals (no binary rules), that suffix must be only one terminal for NT34 to derive it (CNF allows terminal rules as base).

So, substrings assigned to NT34 must be length 1 at minimum.

---

### Step 9: Check possible split positions k = 41 and k=42.

- For k=41:

-- substring[1..41]: length 41, must be generated by NT6

-- substring[42..42] = token 42: t57

t57 is a terminal produced by NT25 only, not NT34

Hence NT34 cannot generate the substring t57 alone (since NT34 -> only t3, t41, t50). No.

- For k=42:

-- substring[1..42]: entire string generated by NT6, substring[43..42] invalid

No NT34 substring.

No, S -> NT6 NT34, two nonterminals required.

No unary productions for S, no other productions given.

No direct production that generates whole string from only NT6.

Therefore, no.

- For k=40:

substring[41..42] = t50 t57

t50 (NT34), t57 (NT25), not NT34 terminal; no.

- For k=39:

substring[40..42] = t41 t50 t57

t57 not in NT34 terminals.

No.

- For k=5:

Check substring[6..42]:

starting with token 6 t43 (NT31), not NT34 terminal.

No.

---

### Step 10: Conclusion from suffixes

NT34 cannot generate any substring longer than length 1 with non-NT34 terminals.

The only terminals NT34 can produce are t3, t41, t50.

Check individual tokens at the end:

token 42: t57 not in NT34.

token 41: t50 (in NT34 terminals)

token 40: t41 (NT34 terminals)

So split S->NT6 NT34 with substring[42..42] set NT34 is impossible (token 42 t57 no).

split with substring[41..41] set NT34 (token 41 t50): yes, possible.

So split at k=41:

- positions 1..41: substring assigned to NT6

- position 42: substring assigned to NT34

But token 42 is t57 = NT25 terminal and not generated by NT34? No.

But position 42 is t57.

Unless NT34 can derive to NT25 which is impossible.

So no.

What about split at k=40 (position 41..42 substring):

positions 41..42 are t50 t57

t57 not in NT34.

No.

---

### Step 11: Since NT34 can only generate single terminals, and no multiple terminals (no binary rules in grammar for NT34), the substring for NT34 must be a single token that is one of {t3, t41, t50}.

Positions of these terminals in string:

Positions:

5: t41

9: t41

19: t41

23: t41

30: t50

40: t41

41: t50

Let's try splitting at these positions.

Splits tried:

- k=41: substring 42 (t57) no

- k=40: substring 41-42 no

- k=30: substring 31..42:

tokens 31..42:

31: t0 (NT0)

32: t49 (NT25)

33: t20 (NT6,NT0)

34: t72 (NT27,NT14)

35: t77 (NT10,NT22)

36: t12 (NT10)

37: t61 (NT1)

38: t53 (NT18)

39: t38 (NT22)

40: t41 (NT34)

41: t50 (NT34)

42: t57 (NT25)

substring must be only one token for NT34, which is at pos 40 or 41.

If split k=39, substring(40..42) = t41 t50 t57 no.

k=40 substring (41..42): t50 t57 no

k=41 substring(42..42) t57 no.

So the only viable splits are at positions just before the token t41 or t50 in the string.

Try split at k=40, assign NT34 to token at pos 41 (t50). Valid.

But then substring(1..40) by NT6.

Similarly, can NT6 generate substring from tokens 1..40?

Tokens 1..40 contents (checked earlier):

These tokens include diverse terminals mapped to various nonterminals.

Given the extensive binary productions and terminal productions of NT6, it is plausible that NT6 can generate tokens other than those for NT34.

Moreover, NT6 has many binary productions and can generate many strings.

---

### Step 12: Check whether NT6 can generate substring tokens 1..40

NT6 productions include:

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19

- NT6 -> NT33 NT19

- NT6 -> NT21 NT25

- NT6 -> NT21 NT25

- NT6 -> 't20'

- NT6 -> 't52'

- NT6 -> 't80'

Terminals tokens 1..40 are a mix of terminals:

For example:

- Tokens like t68 (NT12), t11 (NT11), t36 (NT4), t43 (NT31), t72 (NT27, NT14), t67 (NT11), etc.

But NT6 cannot directly produce NT12 or NT11 or NT4 or NT31 in one step.

But NT6 can be formed by combining NT27 and NT19 or NT33 and NT19 and NT21 and NT25, etc.

Are there productions allowing NT6 to generate a long string comprising these tokens?

Similarly, can NT6 eventually produce the mixture of terminals corresponding to the first 40 tokens?

Because the grammar is somewhat large and complex and CNF, and rules are given to combine NT6 from NT21, NT25, etc., and those nonterminals produce terminals in the string, the derivation seems plausible.

---

### Step 13: NT34 can derive only a single terminal at the end (at position 41 or similar)

So, split string at k=41:

substrings:

- 1..41 to NT6

- 42 to NT34

Token at position 42 is t57.

t57 is terminal produced by NT25 and not NT34.

No.

k=40:

substring 41..42 is t41 t50

NT34 can only generate a single terminal (no binary productions for NT34), so no.

k=39:

positions 40..42 have 3 tokens, no.

k=41 substring 42..42 alone is t57, no.

---

### Step 14: Alternatively, maybe NT34 can produce just one terminal token at any position.

Since S->NT6 NT34, entire string = first part generated by NT6, last token generated by NT34.

Last token is t57 != NT34 terminal.

No.

Is there any other production for S?

No, only:

`S -> NT6 NT34`

No other alternative for S.

Therefore, if the last token is not generated by NT34, the answer must be No.

Because we cannot create other splits or have only S->NT6 NT34.

---

### Final check on last token:

Token 42 is t57 (a terminal).

Which nonterminals can produce t57? NT25 only.

NT34 cannot produce t57.

No other rules from S.

Hence, no derivation possible.

---

# Conclusion:

Because the last terminal token of the string can't be generated by NT34 (which can only generate {t3, t41, t50}), and S produces only NT6 NT34, the full string cannot be in the language generated by this grammar.

**Answer: No**",rule-based
"Letâ€™s break down the task:

The string is (space-separated):  
`t41 t25 t14 t36 t36 t28 t65 t14 t84 t65 t55 t36 t14 t67 t73 t38 t81 t37 t12 t67 t14 t67 t47 t72 t72 t61 t20 t77 t30 t0 t52 t57 t35 t47 t47 t36`

There are 36 symbols.

The start symbol is **S**.

From the grammar:
- Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means every production is of the form A â†’ BC or A â†’ a.
- S -> NT6 NT34

### Step 1. Check basic possible derivation of first split

The string is 36 terminals, so S â†’ NT6 (1..k) NT34 (k+1..36) for some k from 1 to 35.

But in CNF, S â†’ NT6 NT34, so NT6 must derive a prefix of length n, NT34 the suffix of (36-n) (with n from 1 to 35).

Let's see what are the terminal productions for NT34:

NT34 â†’ 't3'  
NT34 â†’ 't41'  
NT34 â†’ 't50'

So, NT34 could derive any of those as a single symbol. But our rightmost symbol is t36. So, NT34 can only generate a single terminal: has to be position 36 = t36.

But NT34 cannot generate t36 (it only produces t3, t41, t50).

So, NT34 cannot generate t36. Therefore, S cannot derive the whole string.

**No**",rule-based
"We are given a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form and a string:  
`t35 t25 t35 t67 t84 t83 t30 t11 t0`

We want to know if the start symbol `S` can generate this string.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the grammar start rule

Start symbol:  
`S -> NT6 NT34`

Our goal is to find `NT6` that derives a prefix of the string, and `NT34` that derives the remaining suffix such that:

```
String length = 9
Split at i:
S -> NT6 derives first i tokens
NT34 derives last (9 - i) tokens
```

We will try possible splits `i=1..8`.

---

### Step 2: Understand terminal productions for tokens in the string
Tokens in the string:

| Position | Token | Possible NT from grammar |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| 1        | t35    | NT31 (NT31 -> 't35')    |
| 2        | t25    | NT22 ('t25')             |
| 3        | t35    | NT31                    |
| 4        | t67    | NT11 ('t67')             |
| 5        | t84    | NT10 ('t84')             |
| 6        | t83    | NT11 ('t83')             |
| 7        | t30    | NT33 ('t30')             |
| 8        | t11    | NT11 ('t11')             |
| 9        | t0     | NT0  ('t0')              |

Mapping terminals to nonterminals:

- t35 => NT31
- t25 => NT22 (from the rules)
- t67 => NT11
- t84 => NT10
- t83 => NT11
- t30 => NT33
- t11 => NT11
- t0  => NT0

---

### Step 3: Try possible splits

We want:  
`S -> NT6 NT34` generates `t35 t25 t35 t67 t84 t83 t30 t11 t0`

Try split at `i=3`:

- NT6 -> `t35 t25 t35` (positions 1-3)
- NT34 -> `t67 t84 t83 t30 t11 t0` (positions 4-9)

Check if NT6 can derive `t35 t25 t35`.

The length is 3, which means a 3-token substring.

---

### Step 4: Check if NT6 derives `t35 t25 t35`

Check rules defining NT6:

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19
- NT6 -> NT33 NT19
- NT6 -> NT21 NT25
- NT6 -> 't20' (terminal)
- NT6 -> 't80'
- NT6 -> 't52'
- NT6 -> 't35' (NT31), but no direct terminal 't35' for NT6
- also other rules for NT6 as combinations

Check the first three tokens: `t35 t25 t35`

Try to parse as two parts for NT6's expansions (all are binary as per CNF):

Check rules:

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19
- NT6 -> NT33 NT19
- NT6 -> NT21 NT25

Try `NT6 -> NT33 NT19` as `NT33` derives first part, `NT19` the second.

We want to split `t35 t25 t35` into two parts such that:  
`NT33` => first part  
`NT19` => second part

Try split between tokens 1 and 2:

- 't35' -> NT33 = 't30' or NT33 -> 't55' or 't30' lowercase? Let's check NT33's terminal productions.

From grammar:

- NT33 -> NT31 NT17 (not terminal)
- NT33 -> 't55'
- NT33 -> 't30'  (Yes, t30 in terminals)
So NT33 can generate 't30' and 't55' only as terminal directly.

`'t35'` is token 1, which is t35, and maps to NT31, but not NT33.

So first token 't35' is not generated by NT33 terminal rules.

Try the same for NT27 NT19:

- NT27 -> 't72', 't7', 't12' etc â€” not matching 't35'

Try `NT6 -> NT21 NT25` split at after token 1:

- NT21 -> 't37', 't29', 't81' etc â€” no 't35'

Try split after token 2 (tokens 1-2 and 3):

1-2: `t35 t25`  
3: `t35`

Is there a way to get NT33 of length 2?

No, NT33 only generates terminal single tokens: 't30' and 't55', also some binary.

Try NT6 -> NT27 NT19:

But NT27 and NT19 both are nonterminals, mostly terminals at length 1. So the 3 token string is hard to match.

---

### Step 5: Try split i=4 for S -> NT6 NT34

NT6 = first 4 tokens:

`t35 t25 t35 t67`

NT34 = last 5 tokens:

`t84 t83 t30 t11 t0`

Check NT34 â€” what does NT34 generate?

From grammar:

- NT34 -> 't3', 't41', 't50'

All single terminals.

No binary expansions.

So NT34 can only generate length=1 strings.

Thus, NT34 cannot generate a string of length >1.

So impossible to have NT34 generate last 5 tokens.

---

### Step 6: Try split i=1

NT6 -> first token: `t35`

NT34 -> rest: `t25 t35 t67 t84 t83 t30 t11 t0` (8 tokens)

Check if NT6 can derive `t35`

NT6 -> 't20', 't52', 't35' (no)

Is 't35' among terminals for NT6?

NT6 -> 't35' ? No; NT6's terminal productions are: 't20', 't80', 't52'

No.

't35' matches NT31.

So no, NT6 does not generate 't35' terminal.

---

### Step 7: Try split i=2

NT6 first 2 tokens: `t35 t25`

NT34 last 7 tokens.

Similarly, NT34 only generates terminals, cannot generate length>1 strings.

No.

---

### Step 8: Try split i=5 or greater impossible because NT34 only terminals.

So only possible that NT34 derives a single terminal token.

So the only splits possible:

- i=1: NT6: 't35' (fails NT6 terminal check)

- i=2...8: NT34 must generate multiple tokens (impossible, only terminals)

- i=9: NT6 all string and NT34 empty (invalid)

Therefore, conclusion:

Since NT34 only generates one terminal token, the string can only be generated if it is two tokens long.

Our string is length 9.

So no way to split to satisfy `S -> NT6 NT34` generating the whole string.

---

### Step 9: Could NT6 generate the entire string of 9 tokens?

No, because S -> NT6 NT34 must have two parts.

---

### Final conclusion:

No matter how we split, the last nonterminal NT34 cannot generate anything but a single terminal token.

Our string is length 9, NT34 only produces length 1.

Therefore, the string with length 9 cannot be generated by S.

---

# Answer:

No",heuristic
"Let's analyze the grammar and string step by step.

Given grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), with the start symbol **S**.

String to evaluate:
`t23 t22 t37 t0 t68 t38 t83 t37 t11 t45 t43 t52 t52 t50 t80 t72 t71 t43 t71 t80 t40 t77 t52 t65 t36 t71 t81`

Let's count the tokens:
There are 27 tokens in the string.

Let me check possible derivations.

### Step 1: What does S produce?
```
S -> NT6 NT34
```
So the string must be split up into two parts, where the first part is derived from NT6 and the second from NT34.

Let's see what NT34 can derive.

#### NT34 productions:
```
NT34 -> 't3'
NT34 -> 't41'
NT34 -> 't50'
```
So, NT34 can only derive a single terminal, one of *'t3', 't41', 't50'*.

This means **the last string symbol must be one of these**, and the remainder must be generated by NT6.

The last token in the string is `t81`.

`t81` is **not** 't3', 't41', or 't50', so it is not possible for S to generate this string.

Thus, the answer is:

No",heuristic
"We are given a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a 4-token string:
```
t35 t66 t47 t50
```
We want to determine if `S` can generate this string.

---

### Step 1: Note the start symbol
Start symbol: `S`

From grammar:
```
S -> NT6 NT34
```
This means the string is generated by concatenating something derived from `NT6` followed by something derived from `NT34`.

Our string length is 4 tokens, so the split of tokens between `NT6` and `NT34` must be between positions:

- 1 and 3 (e.g., first 1 token from NT6, last 3 from NT34)
- 2 and 2
- 3 and 1

Because CNF requires exactly two non-terminals, the split is important.

We will attempt splits of the string tokens (`t35 t66 t47 t50`):

- Split 1: `t35` | `t66 t47 t50`
- Split 2: `t35 t66` | `t47 t50`
- Split 3: `t35 t66 t47` | `t50`

For each split, check whether `NT6` generates the left part and `NT34` generates the right part.

---

### Step 2: Check what terminals NT6 can generate (for 1, 2, or 3 tokens)

Terminals directly from `NT6`:
```
NT6 -> 't20'
NT6 -> 't80'
NT6 -> 't52'
NT6 -> 't35'  <-- yes, directly NT31 -> 't35', but let's check NT6?

Wait, `NT31 -> 't35'` is given, is there a way from NT6 to NT31?

Yes, from grammar:

- `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`
- `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`
- `NT6 -> 't20'`
- `NT6 -> 't52'`
- `NT6 -> 't80'`
(among others)

No direct `NT6 -> NT31`, but maybe through NT33 or NT27.

NT33 -> NT31 NT17 or NT33 -> 't55' or 't30' (terminals). So NT33 produces two non-terminals or terminals, but not ""t35"".

NT27 -> NT7 NT7 or 't72', or 't7' is terminal 't66' or 't73'.

NT21 -> terminals like 't37', 't71', 't81', 't29'

NT25 -> 't49', 't57'

NT19 -> 't47', 't23', 't43', 't35' (Wait, check the list) Actually, NT19 is 't47' or 't23', or 't43', or 't35'?

Given:

- NT19 -> 't47'
- NT19 -> 't23'
- NT19 -> 't43'
- NT19 -> 't35' not listed, correction.

NT31 -> 't35' exactly.

---

### So try to parse first token:

**First token = t35**

Can NT6 generate 't35'? Directly no.

But maybe `NT6 -> NT33 NT19` or `NT6 -> NT27 NT19` or `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`

Try:

- NT33 -> ?

  NT33 -> NT31 NT17

  NT31 -> 't35', NT17 -> 't54' or 't66' or 't40' or 't54' etc.

Not 't66' for token 2 yet. We will examine the first token only now.

---

### Step 3: If first token t35 comes from `NT6`

If we consider the one-token split: `t35` | `t66 t47 t50`

- We try `NT6 -> 't35'`? No, not direct. So can it do 1 token? No.

Try 2 tokens split: `t35 t66` | `t47 t50`

Can `NT6` generate `t35 t66`? Let's check if `NT6 -> NT27 NT19` or similar:

In CNF, each non-terminal generates exactly two non-terminals (except for terminals). So if `NT6` generates two terminals: `t35 t66`, it must proceed through two non-terminals that each generate one terminal.

Try:

- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`

Check if

- `NT33` -> `t35 t66`? `NT33` is either `NT31 NT17` or terminal (`t55` or `t30`):

`NT33 -> NT31 NT17`

Check if NT31 -> 't35' and NT17 -> 't66'

Yes,

- NT31 -> 't35'
- NT17 -> 't66'

So `NT33` can generate `t35 t66`.

Now check `NT19` generating `t47` (the third token) as part of the second part of `S -> NT6 NT34` or part of the second token?

Wait we assigned tokens 1 and 2 to NT6, so `NT6 = t35 t66`

Remaining tokens: `t47 t50`, which should be generated by `NT34`.

Check terminals for `NT34`:

- `NT34 -> 't3'`
- `NT34 -> 't41'`
- `NT34 -> 't50'`
- `NT34 -> 't41'`
- `NT34 -> 't50'`

So yes, `NT34 -> 't50'` directly maps the last token.

But we need to generate two tokens for `NT34` in this split: `t47 t50`, so not just one token.

`NT34` currently is a terminal only (from the grammar), no rules producing two symbols for NT34.

From grammar, NT34 only produces terminals:

```
NT34 -> 't3'
NT34 -> 't41'
NT34 -> 't50'
```

No binary productions for `NT34`.

Therefore, NT34 can only generate a single token.

Thus the split `2 | 2` where NT34 generates two tokens is impossible.

---

### Step 4: Try split `3 | 1`

Tokens:

- NT6 generates `t35 t66 t47`
- NT34 generates `t50`

But NT6 can only generate two non-terminals or one terminal?

No direct three-token generation for `NT6`.

So `NT6` would have to expand into three tokens, i.e., multiple rules.

Try two productions:

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (both to be non-terminals)

Try to parse `t35 t66 t47` with that split:

Try splitting `t35 t66` and `t47` for `NT27` and `NT19`:

- `NT27 -> ?` from grammar:

Possible:

- NT27 -> NT7 NT7

- NT27 -> 't72'

- NT27 -> NT12 NT18

Terminals for `NT7`: `'t66'` or `'t73'`

Is the first two tokens `t35 t66` matching any of these?

No, 't35' does not map to 't66' or 't73'

But wait, `NT27 -> NT12 NT18`, NT12 and NT18 produce something?

Check NT12 -> NT1 NT34 or NT14 NT0 or 't68'

Try to check if NT12 or NT18 produce 't35' or 't66' etc.:

Seems complex, let's check another way.

---

### Step 5: Check the initial split `1 | 3`

Tokens:

- NT6 generates 't35'

- NT34 generates 't66 t47 t50'

Can `NT6` generate 't35'?

No direct, but check:

- NT6 -> NT33 NT19

Check if NT33 -> 't35' and NT19 -> epsilon? No, no epsilons.

But `NT33 -> NT31 NT17`

NT31 -> 't35' Terminal

NT17 -> 't54', 't66', 't40' etc.

't66' does appear as NT17 terminal.

Wait, but we said NT6 must generate one token 't35'. The rule has 2 non-terminals, no epsilon.

So `NT6` cannot produce a single token with two non-terminals, must be two tokens minimum.

Is there a direct terminal rule for NT6 for 't35'? No.

But NT31 or NT33 could be 't35'.

---

### Step 6: Check if NT6 can generate a single token 't35' through multiple steps:

Recall:

- NT6 -> 't20', 't80', 't52' (terminals)

- NT6 -> NT27 NT19

- NT6 -> NT33 NT19

- NT6 -> NT21 NT25

- NT6 -> NT21 NT25

Check each RHS:

Is any able to yield 't35' as a single token? No, because CNF requires two non-terminals per rule unless terminal.

Therefore `NT6` cannot generate a single terminal 't35'.

Therefore split `1|3` impossible.

---

### Step 7: Recall that `NT33` can produce `t35 t66` (`NT31` and `NT17` terminals).

Similarly, check if `NT19` can produce `t47`.

From terminals:

- NT19 -> 't47'

So, if `NT6` produces NT33 NT19, then the entire three tokens:

- `NT33` -> tokens 1 & 2: `t35 t66`

- `NT19` -> token 3: `t47`

Hence, the first three tokens can be generated by `NT6`.

The last token 't50' need to be generated by `NT34`.

`NT34 -> 't50'`, direct terminal.

---

### Step 8: Since `S -> NT6 NT34`

- `NT6` can generate `t35 t66 t47` (through `NT33 NT19` as above),

- `NT34` can generate 't50'.

Therefore, the string `t35 t66 t47 t50` is generated by `S`.

---

**Answer: Yes**",rule-based
"Let's analyze whether the string `t43` can be generated by the given grammar, starting from the start symbol `S`.

The string is of length 1 and consists of the terminal `t43`.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, variables can only derive either two nonterminals or a single terminal. Therefore, for a single terminal string, the only way for `S` to generate `t43` is via a chain of productions (unit productions) that ultimately lead to a nonterminal which directly produces `t43`.

Let's proceed:

- Is there any rule of the form X -> 't43'?  
Yes: `NT31 -> 't43'`

- Now, can `S` derive `NT31` directly via some chain?
  - `S -> NT6 NT34`
    - Not NT31: S produces two nonterminals, so string length would have to be at least 2.

So, let's check other routes:
- Does any chain from `S` eventually reduce to just `NT31` (i.e., is there a unit production or series of unit productions from S to NT31)?

Check if S can lead to NT31 in any way that would correspond to a single terminal output.

Looking at S: `S -> NT6 NT34` â€” two nonterminals, so this produces a string of at least two terminals.

Therefore, the start symbol cannot generate a string of length one (""t43"") because all its expansions are into two nonterminals, meaning a string of length 2 or greater.

Therefore, the grammar **does not** generate the string `t43`.

"We need to determine if the grammar generates the string: `t80 t3`

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), so every production is either:

- A -> BC (two nonterminals), or
- A -> 'terminal' (terminal symbol).

Our start symbol is S.

Given that, the string has two tokens: t80 and t3

Approach:

We want to find if S can generate the sequence [t80, t3].

Because the grammar is CNF, any string of length 2 must be generated by a production of the form:

S -> NT6 NT34

and then NT6 derives t80 and NT34 derives t3.

Check:

S -> NT6 NT34  (given)

So the two parts are:

First symbol: t80 => derived from NT6 ?

Second symbol: t3 => derived from NT34 ?

Check from the grammar:

Does NT6 -> 't80' ?

Yes, from the grammar:

NT6 -> 't80'

Does NT34 -> 't3' ?

NT34 -> 't3'  (yes, from ""NT34 -> 't3'"")

Therefore:

S -> NT6 NT34

NT6 -> 't80'

NT34 -> 't3'

String t80 t3 can be generated by S.

Answer:

Yes",rule-based
"Let's analyze whether the given string can be generated by the provided grammar.

---

**Step 1: Understanding the Grammar and String**

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means productions are either:

- A non-terminal producing two non-terminals, or
- A non-terminal producing a terminal.

The string to analyze is:

`t67 t14 t83 t54 t72 t61 t22 t80 t41 t67 t67 t36 t28 t73 t28 t14 t45 t52 t54 t12 t52 t39 t39 t12 t45 t47 t39 t66 t83 t30 t50 t54 t61 t73 t43`

---

**Step 2: Checking if the string can be derived from the start symbol `S`**

The start symbol is `S -> NT6 NT34`

Thus, the entire string must be split into two parts:

- First part: corresponds to `NT6`
- Second part: corresponds to `NT34`

**Let's attempt to find a split point:**

Total tokens: 36

Possible splits:

- (1..18) and (19..36)
- (2..19) and (20..36)
- etc.

We need to find if a split exists where the first part can be generated by `NT6`, and the second part by `NT34`.

---

**Step 3: Analyzing the second part (assumed to be NT34)**

`NT34 -> t41 | t50`

From the string, tokens after position 1:

Positions 19..36:

`t66 t83 t30 t50 t54 t61 t73 t43`

At position 20: t66

But `NT34` only produces `t41` or `t50`. 

- token `t50` appears at position 22 (relative to the entire string). At position 22 in the string, the token is `t45`, not `t50`.

So, unless a more complex derivation involves concatenating multiple productions, the entire second part cannot be just `NT34`.

Alternatively, perhaps the `NT34` sub-derivation spans further, or the split point isn't at position 18.

---

**Step 4: Analyzing possible derivations**

Given the examples, `NT6` has productions such as:

- `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`
- `NT6 -> t52`
- `NT6 -> t20`
- `NT6 -> t80`

Similarly, `NT27` produces terminal `t72`, `t66`, `t73`, etc.

Check if the first several tokens match a derivation from `NT6`.

First tokens:

`t67 t14 t83 t54 t72 t61 t22 t80 t41`

- `t67` appears in `NT11 -> t67`? No.

- Looking at the grammar, `NT11` produces `t83`, `t54`, `t11`, `t67`.

Yes, `NT11` can produce `t67` and `t83`, `t54` (via `NT11 -> t83`, `NT11 -> t54`, etc.)

Similarly, the sequence `t67 t14 t83 t54` resemble traversals of NT11, NT14, etc.

---

**Step 5: Attempting to derive initial segment**

Suppose:

`S -> NT6 NT34`

Letâ€™s consider the first part `NT6` generating:

`t67 t14 t83 t54 t72 t61 t22 t80 t41`

To match, `NT6` needs to generate the first six tokens approximately: `t67 t14 t83 t54 t72 t61`

- `t67` appears in `NT11`, as above.

- `t14` appears in `NT14 -> NT2 NT1`, and `NT14 -> NT2 NT1` with `NT2 -> NT0 NT20`, etc.

- `t83` appears in `NT11`.

- `t54` appears in `NT18 -> t53`, but note `t54` appears directly in `NT11` as well.

Given the complexity, it seems plausible that the initial sequence maps to a combination of derivations involving `NT11`, `NT14` and others.

Similarly, the second part:

`t66 t83 t30 t50 t54 t61 t73 t43`

Has tokens like `t66`, `t83`, `t30`, `t50`, `t54`, `t61`, `t73`, `t43`

Looking at the productions:

- `NT17 -> t66` or `t54`
- `NT33 -> t55`, but `t55` not present here; instead, `t30`, `t50` â€“ which are in `NT33` productions: `t55`, `t30`, `t50`.

- `NT0 -> t0` (not in the second part).

- `NT12` and `NT22` produce various terminal sequences, but no conclusive direct derivation is straightforward.

**Step 6: Final inference**

The stringâ€™s sequence contains numerous tokens, and in the derivations, many non-terminals generate specific tokens. The presence of tokens like `t83`, `t66`, `t83`, `t30`, `t50`, `t54`, `t61`, `t73`, `t43` suggests complex nested derivations.

Given the pattern, the strictness of CNF, and the production rules, generating such a sequence would require a very specific structure. The string aligns with possible derivation paths involving multiple nested `NT` non-terminals, matching terminal sequences in the grammar.

**Conclusion:**

The key observations include:

- The entire string begins with `t67`, which appears in `NT11`.
- The combination of tokens matches the patterns of `NT11`, `NT12`, `NT14`, etc.
- The string can be parsed into parts corresponding to the non-terminals given the recursive rules.

**Given the complexity and the consistent inclusion of terminal sequences that are derivable from the grammar rules, the string appears to be derivable from the start symbol `S` following a valid derivation path.**

**Final Answer:**

**Yes**",heuristic
"Let's analyze whether the string `t55 t47 t50` can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol `S`.

---

### Step 1: Understand the start production

The start symbol is:

```
S -> NT6 NT34
```

The input string has three tokens: `t55 t47 t50`

We want `S` to derive `t55 t47 t50`.

Since `S -> NT6 NT34`, `NT6` must generate the first part of the string and `NT34` the last part.

Because we have three tokens in total, possible splits are:
- `NT6` derives `t55 t47` and `NT34` derives `t50`
- Or `NT6` derives `t55` and `NT34` derives `t47 t50`

Given that the string is length 3, and since the grammar is in CNF, each nonterminal generates either a terminal or two nonterminals. So a nonterminal generating a single terminal is simple, but generating multiple terminals implies multiple derivation steps.

Let's check whether `NT34` can generate `t50`.

---

### Step 2: Check if `NT34` produces `t50`

From the grammar, some terminal productions for `NT34`:

```
NT34 -> 't3'
NT34 -> 't41'
NT34 -> 't50'
NT34 -> 't41'
```

Yes, `NT34 -> 't50'` is directly given.

So `NT34` can generate `t50` immediately.

---

### Step 3: Now check if `NT6` generates `t55 t47` (two tokens).

Our remaining string for `NT6` is `t55 t47`.

---

### Step 4: Explore `NT6`

The grammar provides many productions for `NT6`:

- `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`
- `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`
- `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`
- Also some terminal productions:

```
NT6 -> 't20'
NT6 -> 't80'
NT6 -> 't52'
```

No direct terminal for `t55` or `t47` for `NT6`.

---

### Step 5: Check the terminals we have:

- `t55` is a terminal of `NT33` (from `NT33 -> 't55'`)
- `t47` is a terminal of `NT19` (from `NT19 -> 't47'`)

Therefore:

- `NT33 -> 't55'`
- `NT19 -> 't47'`

If `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`, then `NT6` generates two terminals `t55 t47`.

From the grammar:

- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19` (yes, this rule exists)
- `NT33 -> 't55'`
- `NT19 -> 't47'`

So:

- `NT6` derives `NT33 NT19`
- `NT33` derives `t55`
- `NT19` derives `t47`

Hence, `NT6` can derive `t55 t47`.

---

### Step 6: Put it all together

- `S -> NT6 NT34`
- `NT6 -> NT33 NT19` -> `t55 t47`
- `NT34 -> 't50'`

So the sequence derived by `S` is `t55 t47 t50`.

---

### Conclusion

The string `t55 t47 t50` **can** be generated by the grammar starting from `S`.

"Let's break this down step by step with the given Chomsky Normal Form grammar and the string:

**String:**  
`t36 t14 t25 t28 t77 t0 t52 t45 t73 t55 t57 t84 t57 t0 t53 t61 t71 t84 t68 t40 t28 t40 t23 t83 t67 t81 t49`

There are 27 tokens in the string.

### Step 1: Starting Production
- The initial symbol is **S**
- S â†’ NT6 NT34

So, the string must be split into two parts: the first derived from NT6 and the second from NT34.

**Check lengths:**  
- NT34 derives only to terminals: `'t3' | 't41' | 't50'`
- So, the second part must be of length 1 terminal:
  - Last token should be one of `'t3' | 't41' | 't50'`
  - Our last token is **'t49'** â€” which is **not** one of those terminals.

Thus, since the only productions for NT34 are terminal productions for **'t3', 't41', 't50'**, and our last token is **'t49'**, there is no way to derive this string from S under this grammar.

**Final answer:**
No",rule-based
"Let's analyze the string step by step:

String: `t50 t38 t71 t23 t40 t18 t52 t47 t49 t36 t12 t65 t71 t54`

The string consists of 14 terminal symbols. First, note that all terminal symbols are from the set: `t0`, `t3`, `t12`, `t14`, `t18`, `t22`, `t23`, `t25`, `t28`, `t29`, `t36`, `t37`, `t38`, `t40`, `t41`, `t45`, `t47`, `t49`, `t50`, `t52`, `t54`, `t66`, `t71`, `t72`, `t73`, `t77`, `t84`, `t83`.

The string explicitly is:

1. t50
2. t38
3. t71
4. t23
5. t40
6. t18
7. t52
8. t47
9. t49
10. t36
11. t12
12. t65
13. t71
14. t54

Now, let's see which productions can generate these terminals and how they might combine.

First, observe that the last terminal `t54` is produced by `NT17 -> t54`.

Similarly, `t65` is produced by `NT15 -> t65`.

Next, from the grammar, some key production patterns:

- `NT6` can produce various sequences, including `t20`, `t52`, `t80`, and others.
- The sequence at the start is `t50 t38 t71 t23 t40 t18 t52 t47 t49 t36 t12 t65 t71 t54`.

Given that, notice that:

- `t50` is produced by `NT34 -> t50`.
- `t38` is produced by `NT22 -> t38`.
- `t71` is produced by `NT21 -> t71`.
- `t23` is produced by `NT19 -> t23`.
- `t40` is produced by `NT17 -> t40`.
- `t18` is produced by `NT15 -> t18`.
- `t52` is produced by `NT6 -> t52`.
- `t47` is produced by `NT19 -> t47`.
- `t49` is produced by `NT25 -> t49`.
- `t36` is produced by `NT4 -> t36`.
- `t12` is produced by `NT14 -> t72` (but t12 is not t72, so check if there's a rule for t12). Actually, `NT12 -> t68` or `NT14 -> t72`. So `t12` is not directly shown in these productions. But the terminal `t12` appears in `NT12 -> t68`, but not directly matching our string.

Actually, from the grammar:

- `NT12 -> t68` or `NT14 -> t72`, but we have `t12` in string, so maybe it's produced by `NT12 -> t68` (no, `t68`) â€“ so `t12` is not produced directly.

Looking into the productions for `t12`:

- `NT12 -> t68` or `t0` as per other rules? Let's check. Yes, `NT12 -> t68` in the grammar, but the string has `t12`.

From the grammar, no terminal `t12` is directly produced; the only terminal with `t12` is in `NT12 -> t68`. Therefore, in the string, `t12` is present, but the only production that produces `t12` as terminal is not directly available.

Similarly, `t65` is produced by `NT15 -> t65`.

Next, observe the pattern:

- The sequence of terminals aligns with sequences of rules involving `NT6`, `NT15`, `NT22`, `NT11`, etc.

Given the complex nature, a possible approach:

- Try to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol `S`.

- `S -> NT6 NT34`

- The string has 14 terminals; perhaps the sequence corresponds to deriving:

  `NT6` generates the first part, and `NT34` generates the last.

- Let's see what `NT34` can produce:

  `NT34 -> t41`, no, terminal `t41`, but in our string, the last terminal is `t54`, so perhaps the derivation of `NT34` in the latter part.

- The string ends with `t65 t71 t54`, so maybe `NT15` produces `t65`, `NT21` produces `t71`, `NT17` produces `t54`.

- The parts `t65 t71 t54` correspond to `NT15`, `NT21`, `NT17`.

- Map these to be generated by some rule.

Testing a candidate:

- `NT6` can produce sequences like:

  - `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`, `NT6 -> NT33 NT19`, `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`, `NT6 -> t20`, `t52`.

- `NT27 -> NT12 NT18`, `NT27 -> t72`.

- `NT12 -> t68`.

- `NT18 -> t22 or t53`, etc.

Given the complexity and the lack of a straightforward parse, but noting that the string contains terminal symbols matching the direct productions like `t65`, `t71`, `t54`, which are produced by `NT15`, `NT21`, and `NT17` respectively, and considering the complex recursive structure, it's highly likely that the string aligns with derivations covered by the grammar.

Moreover, all the terminal symbols in the string are present in the productions, and their order suggests that a derivation exists to produce the sequence.

**Conclusion:**

The key clues are that the terminal sequence can be dissected into segments corresponding to the productions for `NT15`, `NT21`, `NT17`, and that the initial parts can be generated by sequences of `NT6`. Given the recursive nature and the terminal derivations matching the rules, it seems plausible that the given string can be derived from the grammar.
