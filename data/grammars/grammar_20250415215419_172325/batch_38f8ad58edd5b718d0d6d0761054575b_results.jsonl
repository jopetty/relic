{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given context-free grammar generates the string \"t45\". Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so bear with me.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. So, the start symbol is S, and the string to check is \"t45\".\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that S can produce NT35 NT45. That's the first rule. So S directly breaks down into two parts: NT35 and NT45. Now, I'm trying to see how this can lead to \"t45\".\n\nWait, but the string is just one terminal symbol, \"t45\". So I need to see if \"t45\" can be derived from either of the options in S's rules. Let me check the productions starting with NT45. Looking through the rules, there's an NT45 -> NT59 NT5. Hmm, so to get \"t45\" from NT45, I would need to get \"t59\" and \"t5\" somehow.\n\nBut wait, NT59 can produce \"t17\" according to the rule NT59 -> 't17'. So if I go that way, I'm stuck with \"t17\" and \"t5\", which doesn't help because I end up with \"t17t5\" instead of \"t45\". So that path doesn't work.\n\nLet me look at the production for NT45 a different way. Maybe there's another rule that can lead to \"t45\". Wait, let me check all NT45 rules. No, the only production is NT45 -> NT59 NT5, which as I saw, leads to \"t17\" and \"t5\". So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the rules again. Maybe there's another way to get \"t45\". Looking back, S starts with NT35 NT45. So maybe I should follow that path.\n\nNT35 can produce NT15 NT1 according to the rule NT35 -> NT15 NT1. Then, NT15 can produce NT44 NT33 or NT1 NT4. Let's see. If I go NT15 -> NT44 NT33, then NT44 leads to... looking at the rules, NT44 -> 't45'. Oh, that's promising! So if I have NT44, which produces \"t45\", then the string starts as \"t45\". So then I have the rest of the string, but wait, the string is only \"t45\", so I have to make sure that the entire derivation results in just \"t45\".\n\nWait, let's break it down. Starting from NT35, which goes to NT15 NT1. Then NT15 can go to NT44 NT33, producing \"t45\" and \"something\", but I need the entire string to be \"t45\". Hmm, that might not work because I end up with another part after \"t45\". Alternatively, maybe NT15 can go to NT1 NT4. Let's see.\n\nIf NT15 goes to NT1 NT4, then NT1 can produce several things. Let's see the rules for NT1. NT1 has several productions, like NT1 -> NT10 NT4, NT10 -> 't73', NT25 -> 't29', etc. Wait, but none of these directly produce \"t45\". For example, NT10 is 't73', which is a terminal, so that's just one symbol. But I'm trying to get \"t45\", so maybe this path isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, NT4 can go to 't45' according to the rule NT4 -> 't45', right? So if I have NT4, that directly gives \"t45\". So putting it all together, let me see:\n\nS starts with NT35 NT45. NT35 goes to NT15 NT1. Then NT15 can go to NT44 NT33. NT44 -> 't45', and NT35's other part is NT1. Now, NT1 can go to... let's see, one of its productions is NT1 -> NT4. Then NT4 can go to 't45'. Wait, so if I have NT4 going to 't45', does that mean the entire string from NT45 would be \"t45\"?\n\nHold on, let's try to see this step by step. S starts with NT35 NT45. Let's take NT45 first.\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5. NT59 produces 't17', and NT5 produces 't5'. So that gives \"t17t5\", which isn't \"t45\". So that path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, looking at S's other production: S can also go to NT35 NT45 directly. Wait, no. Wait, S's first rule is S->NT30 NT53. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar rules start with S->NT30 NT53, S->NT35 NT45. So S branches into either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So let's revisit the possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S->NT35 NT45. NT35 -> NT15 NT1. Then NT15 -> NT44 NT33 or NT1 NT4.\n\nIf NT15 goes to NT44 NT33, then NT44 -> 't45', and NT33 might lead to something else. Let's see what NT33 does. Looking at the rules, NT33 has a production: NT33 -> 't62' 't7'. That's two terminals. So if I have NT33, it produces 't62t7', which would add two symbols. So if I take that path in NT35's decay, we'd have 't45t62t7', which is way more than \"t45\". So that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if NT15 goes to NT1 NT4, then we have NT1 and NT4. NT1 can produce NT10 NT4, which leads to 't73' and then NT4 can produce 't45'. So let's see:\n\nS->NT35 NT45\n\nNT35->NT15 NT1\n\nNT15->NT1 NT4\n\nNT1->NT10 NT4\n\nNT10->'t73'\n\nNT4->'t45'\n\nSo putting this together, we'd have 't73t45'. That's \"t73t45\", but the string we're checking is just \"t45\", so that's too long. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the initial assumption that the string is \"t45\" can only come from NT45 directly, but looking at the NT45 rule, it only branches into two non-terminals. So that's not possible because NT45 never produces a single terminal, it always goes to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT45->NT59 NT5, and NT59->'t17', NT5->'t5'. So NT45 produces \"t17t5\". Similarly, in other NT45 rules, like NT45->... I don't think any other rule directly or indirectly leads to a single 't45'.\n\nWait, looking at another point, maybe the initial NT30 branches into 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. Wait, but NT30 is a non-terminal, so it can only produce those strings, but they are also non-terminals. So if I take S->NT30 NT53, then I get 't90' and 't53', which when combined gives \"t90t53\", which isn't \"t45\". Alternatively, S->NT35 NT45 gives \"t45\" somewhere, but it's not a direct path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string \"t45\" is part of a larger string. But the question is whether \"t45\" is generated by the grammar, meaning that it can be the entire string.\n\nBut given that NT45 doesn't produce a terminal directly, it can't produce \"t45\" as the entire string. The only non-NT rule that produces a terminal is other non-terminals, but all those eventually lead to a string that includes more than just \"t45\".\n\nWait, let me check the rule for NT4: NT4->'t45', yes, but NT4 is a non-terminal. So how can I have a production that leads to \"t45\" as part of a larger string. But for the entire string to be \""}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of production rules that replace non-terminals with other strings of non-terminals and terminals. In Chomsky normal form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it's all in CNF. The start symbol is S, which can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So S is quite structured, and the string we're looking for is a single terminal symbol 't28', which isn't S. So the string must derive from S through a series of productions, breaking down each non-terminal into terminals.\n\nI need to see if any of the non-terminals derive directly to 't28' or if there's a chain of productions leading to it. Let me look at the production rules for each non-terminal to see if 't28' appears.\n\nStarting with NT15: it produces NT1 NT25 (from NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25), and looking at NT25's production, it's NT32 NT56. So NT25 can lead to more non-terminals. Similarly, NT15 also produces NT44 NT33. Wait, NT33 goes to NT62 NT7. NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16, and NT16 \u2192 't72'. So none of these directly give 't28'. Hmm.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT28, wait, does it? Let me check. The production list: NT56 \u2192 t45? Or is it NT56 \u2192 NT28? Looking back, the grammar has NT56 \u2192 NT45, wait no, line 18: NT56 \u2192 t28. Wait, no.

Wait, no, actually the productions are structured with NToptions. Wait, for example, I see:\n\nNT530 -> 't90';\nWait, no. Looking at the provided grammar, let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the user separated the rules with the same number of spaces.

Each line is a production. So for example, NT30 has three production options: it can go to 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT1 can go to 't10' or 't73' etc.\n\nLooking for 't28'. Does any production directly produce 't28'? Let me scan the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 t28? Line: NT56 -> 't45'? Wait, no. Wait, the third line after NT53 is NT30 -> 't27'. Hmm, let me check each terminal rule.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', 't28' (wait, does NT30 have t28 in its rules? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through each production under NT...:\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', and others? Wait, looking at the given rules, under NT30, there's 't27' but no 't28'. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar, it's split with each production on a new line. Let's see:\n\nStarting with S, then NT43, NT15, etc.\n\nLooking at the production rules for non-terminals, each non-terminal is followed by -> and some options.\n\nAt the bottom, under NT30, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't14'; is there another one? Let me see if there's 't28' anywhere.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I don't immediately see a production that has 't28' as a terminal. Let me check each of the terminal productions:\n\nUnder NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25.\n\nUnder NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7.\n\nUnder NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT28. Wait, is that right? Wait, the rule is NT56 \u2192 't45', or NT56 \u2192 something else?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the list:\n\nLooking for NT56: in the rules, I see:\n\nLine: NT56 -> 't45'\n\nIs that correct? Or perhaps I missed another production for NT56.\n\nWait, the user's grammar includes a rule for NT56: NT56 \u2192 't45', which is a terminal. So NT56 can produce t45.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT27: is it even a non-terminal? Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should work backwards from 't28' to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but 't28' is a terminal, so we need to see if there's a path from S to 't28' through a series of productions. Alternatively, maybe 't28' appears in a production of some non-terminal that's derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't28' is part of a longer string that is generated by S.\n\nWait, but the string we're testing is just 't28', which is a single symbol.

The string I'm checking is `t59 t14`, and the grammar is pretty complicated with a bunch of production rules. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. All the rules look like S \u2192 NT X, where each NT is a non-terminal, and X is another non-terminal or a terminal. The terminals are the words starting with 't', like 't90', 't53', etc. The non-terminals are everything else, like S, NT30, NT15, etc.\n\nThe given string is `t59 t14`. So I'm going to think about whether this string can be produced by starting with the start symbol, which in CNF is usually S, and then expanding according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce two things:\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals, each expanding into a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe string I'm checking is two terminals: `t59` and `t14`. So I need to see if both of these can be derived from S via the production rules.\n\nLet me look at the production rules that can lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at NT59, I see that NT59 can be derived from NT53 NT5 (since NT59 -> NT53 NT5, but wait, checking the grammar again, I see NT59 -> NT17 NT1. No, wait, correcting that. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nWait, the given grammar includes:\n- NT59 -> NT17 NT1\n- NT17 -> NT28 NT? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the relevant parts.\n\nSo, for example:\n- NT59 -> NT17 NT1\n- NT1 -> 't89', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree or try to see how 't59' can be derived. Let's think about the possible paths.\n\nLooking at the grammar, we have:\n\nNT59 -> NT17 NT1\n\nBut I don't see a direct rule for NT17. Let me check all the rules for NT17:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT17 is only mentioned in NT59: NT59 -> NT17 NT1\nBut I don't see any production for NT17. So that's a problem. Because to get 't59', I'd have to expand NT59, but NT59 can only go to NT17 NT1, and if NT17 can't go anywhere else, then NT59 can't produce a terminal. Hence, 't59' can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. The rules for NT59: only NT59 -> NT17 NT1.\n\nSo if I have to derive 't59', I need NT59 to expand into some terminals. But NT59 can only go to NT17 and NT1, but if NT17 has no production, then it can't be expanded further. So unless NT17 is a terminal, which it's not (since NT17 is a non-terminal as per the initial definitions), it can't be reduced.\n\nTherefore, 't59' cannot appear in any string derived from this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check if any of the rules lead to 't59' being a terminal. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produce a terminal like 't59':\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT59 -> NT17 NT1, but what about elsewhere? Is there any rule that directly results in 't59' as a terminal? From the given rules, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't59', except via the production NT59 -> NT17 NT1, where NT17 is another non-terminal.\n\nSo, since 't59' can't be derived directly, it can't be part of any string produced by S. Therefore, the string `t59 t14` is not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a production that leads to 't59' indirectly, but based on the rules, I don't see any that do so.\n\nAnother approach: consider the entire string `t59 t14` and see if it can be built starting from S. S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Each of these non-terminals will expand into more parts.\n\nBut since S starts the string, and the string I'm checking is `t59 t14`, which starts with 't59', I need to see if any of the expansions can lead to 't59' as the first symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, let's see what NT30 and NT35 can produce:\n\nLooking at NT30:\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nWait, wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the NT30 rule is listed multiple times:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nSo, NT30 can directly produce 't90', 't53', or 't14' as terminals. So, S -> NT30 NT53 could, in a single step, produce a string that starts with one of these terminals.\n\nFor 't59' to be the first symbol, perhaps S splits into NT30 and something else that can produce 't59'. But looking again, NT30 can't produce 't59', only 't90', 't53', or 't14' as direct terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT35:\n\nNT35 can be derived into NT15 NT1, and looking at NT15 and NT1.\n\nBut let's get back. The string I'm trying to produce is `t59 t14`. So the first symbol is 't59', which must come from some expansion in the grammar. But in the given rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't59'. The only NT that produces 't59' is NT59, but that's via NT59 -> NT17 NT1, which is a chain that probably can't reach a terminal.\n\nWait, unless there's a way for NT17 to produce a terminal, but I don't see any NT17 rules. So, unless I'm missing something, I don't see 't59' being produced by any NT, so the string can't start with 't59'.

{"custom_id":"request-23","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string \"t73 t28\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's good.\n\nThe string to check is \"t73 t28\". I notice that each token is a terminal, so I need to find a sequence of productions that can generate this exact sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce \"t73\" and \"t28\". \n\nStarting with \"t73\":\n- From the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't73'. So the non-terminal NT10 can produce t73.\n\nNow, looking at \"t28\":\n- Checking the grammar, I see NT15 -> 't28' and also NT15 -> NT11. Wait, NT11 has a production NT11 -> 't28'. So NT11 can directly produce t28, and NT15 can produce t28 through NT11.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, looking more carefully, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> 't12' (from another line) and also NT15 -> 't11' which is 't7' according to some other production (NT7 -> 't7'), but that's another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map out the productions for each non-terminal to avoid confusion. Let me try to list each non-terminal and its possible productions.\n\nStarting with NT1:\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT4 can go to 't45' or 't38' depending on the production. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT4 has production: NT4 -> 't45' in one place, and another production like NT4 -> 't33' and further? Or perhaps NT4's production is 't45' or another.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar line by line to make a detailed list:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n3. NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n4. NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n5. NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n6. NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n7. NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n8. NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n9. NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n10. NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n11.

Wait, looking back, NT4 seems to have production NT4 -> 't45' in one case and NT4 -> 't33' or NT4 -> 't45' again. Let me check line 25: NT4's production is possibly multiple. Wait, line 4: NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me redo this more carefully.\n\nFirst, list all the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nNT1:\n- NT10 NT4 (line 12, 12 is S, so maybe I should focus on NT1's production)\nWait, looking back:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 12: NT10 -> 't73' (directly)\nLine 19: NT1 -> 't89' (directly)\nLine 4: NT15 -> NT1 NT25 (does this mean NT15 is a production of NT1 and NT25? Or perhaps NT15 is a non-terminal that can be split into NT1 and NT25?)\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled here. Maybe the best approach is for each non-terminal, list all possible production rules where LHS is that non-terminal.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nNon-terminal NT1:\n\nLooking for all production rules where LHS is NT1. I see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4 (line 12)\n- NT1 -> 't89' (line 19)\n\nSo NT1 can either produce \"t89\" or the combination NT10 and NT4.\n\nWait, wait, line 12 is NT10 -> 't73', which I think is a production for NT10, not NT1. So earlier I was miscounting. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking again through the grammar, line numbers 12 to 26, etc., but perhaps a better way is to check each line for LHS as a specific non-terminal.\n\nLet's redo:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n3. NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n4. NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n5. NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n6. NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n7. NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n8. NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n9. NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n10.

NT30 -> 't53' (I think this is a duplication, line 17, NT30->'t53' but line 18 is also NT30->'t14'; so perhaps NT30 has multiple terminal productions)\n18. NT30 -> 't14'\n19. NT1 -> 't89'\n20. NT53 -> 't7' (line 21: NT53->'t7'; but here, line 22 says NT53->'t7' in line 21, line 27, etc. Wait, line 16 is NT53->'t91', line 28: NT53->'t59', line 37: NT53->'t80', line 39: NT53->'t7' via another rule.

The ones that are a bit confusing are in NT15, NT35, etc. Wait, actually, most have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, so this seems to be in CNF.\n\nNow, the string is `t27 t28 t10`. I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start from the top symbol S, which can only go to NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string starts with either NT30 or NT35 connected to another NT.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't27', which must come from NT30 because looking at the productions, NT30 can derive to 't27', 't90', 't53', or 't14'. So the first part is definitely NT30 -> 't27'.\n\nNext, after NT30, we have NT53. Because the string is `t27 t28 t10`, the second token is 't28', which must come from NT53.\n\nLooking at NT53's productions, I see that NT53 can go to 't7', 't59', or 't91'. 't59' is an option because 't28' is part of the string. Wait, but in the string, the third token is 't10'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after NT30 comes NT53. So the second token must come from NT53. But let's look at NT53's productions:\n\nNT53 -> 't7', 't59', or 't91'. None of these are 't28'. Hmm, that's a problem. So that would suggest that after NT30, the next token can't be 't28'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I can see that NT30 has a production to 't27', and NT10 has a production to 't73' or 't43'. Wait, but in the string, after 't27' is 't28', not 't10'. So perhaps I need to see if there's a path where NT53 can produce 't28'.\n\nWait, no. From the list, NT53 only directly goes to terminals t7, t59, or t91. So if NT53 is in a derivation, the terminal it produces is one of those. So 't28' isn't directly produced by any of the NT rules. That suggests that the string might not be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's see if 't28' appears in any of the productions. Looking through the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT53 -> 't59'\n\nWait, but where does 't28' come from? Let me check the productions again. Hmm, in the original grammar, NT25 -> 't29', which isn't relevant. NT56 -> 't45', NT30 can go to 't27', 't90', etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT rule directly producing 't28' except perhaps if I look for something else. Wait, in the given string, the second token is 't28', which comes from NT53, but NT53 can't produce 't28' directly. So maybe this string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again.\n\nSo the first symbol is NT30, which goes to 't27' \u2014 that's fine. Then, what comes next in the string is 't28', so we need NT53 to derive to 't28' through some intermediate steps. But looking at the NT53 rules, there's no direct way.

{"custom_id":"request-41","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to test is `t38 t91 t31`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. Each production rule has either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals on the left, and only single terminals on the right. This means that every step in the derivation doubles the length of the string, as each production replaces a symbol with two others.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, which has two production rules:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nOR\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals, each derived into some sequence of symbols, ending up with the terminals. The string I'm given is three tokens: `t38`, `t91`, `t31`. So, that's three symbols, which is odd, as starting from S, each step adds an even number of symbols. Wait, but no, actually, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the number of tokens can vary depending on how deep the derivation goes. But in this case, the string has three tokens, which is odd, so maybe that's a hint.\n\nWait, no, let me think. Starting from S, which is two non-terminals. Each non-terminal production will split into two, so the total number of symbols would be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. But that might not hold because some productions might introduce terminals directly. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the number of symbols doesn't necessarily follow a power of two, but each step in the derivation can produce a string of varying lengths.\n\nWait, but the example string is three symbols. Let me check the possible derivations. Starting from S, which expands to either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So each of these is two symbols, which are themselves non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT30, in the grammar, there's a production like NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14' (I have to check the rules). Let me check the given grammar rules:\n\nLooking through, I see that NT30 has several rules:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nSo NT30 can be a terminal or can split further into other non-terminals. Same with other symbols.\n\nThe string `t38 t91 t31` has three tokens, which are all terminals. Let me check if these terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I need to see if any production has 't38', 't91', or 't31' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT4 -> 't45' and NT4 -> 't53'\n\nNT59 -> 't17'\n\nNT9 -> 't38'\n\nWait, here's one: NT9 -> 't38'\n\nSo 't38' is a terminal produced by NT9.\n\nSimilarly, 't91' appears in NT7 -> 't91'\n\nAnd 't31' is from NT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, but in the string, the order is t38, t91, t31. So each of these terminals is produced by a specific non-terminal. Let's break it down:\n\nt38 comes from NT9 -> 't38'\n\nt91 comes from NT7 -> 't91'\n\nt31 comes from NT16 -> 't31'\n\nSo, the string would have to correspond to a derivation where NT9, NT7, NT16 are somehow linked.\n\nWait, but in the start symbol S, the first expansions are into two non-terminals, so for the string to be three symbols, one of the non-terminals must produce a terminal on the left, and the other must produce a non-terminal that itself produces two terminals.\n\nWait, no, because each production is either one non-terminal or two non-terminals. So, if S -> NT30 NT53, then NT30 and NT53 are either terminals or can split further.\n\nFor the string to be t38 t91 t31, which is three symbols, perhaps the S starts as NT30 followed by NT53. Let's say NT30 is 't38' (from NT9), and NT53 is derived into NT7 and NT16 or something else.\n\nWait, but NT30 has options, like 't90', 't53', 't14'. If I take NT30 -> 't38', that's possible, but wait, looking back, I see NT9 -> 't38', but in the NT30 rules, there's no NT30 -> NT9. Let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT30 -> NT9. The NT9's production is to 't38'. So that means to get 't38', I have to have NT9 in the derivation.\n\nBut then, how can 't38' be part of NT30? Because in the NT30 rules, the only way to get a terminal is via NT9, which is a different symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Each non-terminal can produce different symbols. So, for instance, S can split into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's say I take the S -> NT30 NT53 option.\n\nNow, I need to derive 't38 t91 t31'. So NT30 must produce 't38', and NT53 must produce the other two symbols, but that can't be because NT53 would be a single symbol, producing two more.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Since the string has three symbols, it must come from a derivation starting with S, which splits into two parts. Each part can be either terminal or another non-terminal. So, the total number of symbols is two, but perhaps some of those non-terminals can further split.\n\nLet me imagine the structure:\n\nS (2 symbols) -> NT(1) NT(2)\n\nEach NT can split into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nEach NT can produce terminals or split again.\n\nSo, for the string t38 t91 t31 to be generated, it has to be built from a sequence where the NTs split in such a way that the terminals are laid out correctly.\n\nWait, but t38 is a terminal, so it could come directly from a NT that produces 't38'. Let's look back at the grammar rules.\n\nLooking for 't38':\n\nIn the provided rules, I see that NT9 -> 't38'\n\nSo, to get 't38', the NT9 must produce it.

So, for example, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14', or further into other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have productions that may produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nTo get each of t38, t91, t31, we need to see if each can be produced by some NT.\n\nt38: NT9 -> 't38'\n\nt91: NT7 -> 't91'\n\nt31: NT16 -> 't31'\n\nSo, each of these terminals is produced by a different NT.\n\nBut in the grammar, S -> NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nSo, to get the string t38 t91 t31, perhaps the derivation is as follows:\n\n1. Start with S -> NT30 NT53\n\n2. Now, each of these must be expanded, but we have to get the string t38 t91 t31.\n\nWait, but let's see how NT30 and NT53 can contribute to the string.\n\nIf NT30 produces 't38', that's one symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-60","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t27 t17 t27 t66\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what's given and how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with a series of productions. Each production seems to split a non-terminal into two other non-terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S through these productions.\n\nLooking at the string \"t27 t17 t27 t66,\" I notice that each token is a terminal symbol. So, I'll need to see how these terminals can be generated from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which has two productions:\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo the string starts with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Since the string begins with t27, I need to find which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I scan through each non-terminal to see how t27 can be derived.\n\nLet's check NT30: \n- The rules under NT30 are \"t90,\" \"t53,\" and \"t14.\" None of these are t27. So NT30 can't produce t27.\n\nNext, NT35:\n- The only rule is NT15 NT1, so NT35 -> NT15 NT1. Since t27 isn't a terminal here, it's part of a non-terminal chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. I think I should check each production step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string and see if each terminal can be generated by some production of the non-terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is binary, so every step reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nThe string has four terminals: t27, t17, t27, t66. So we need a derivation that results in four terminals. Since each production splits into two, starting from S which splits into two non-terminals, each of those may split into two more, leading to four terminals. Alternatively, maybe some non-terminals can split into terminals directly.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t27: Looking for productions that produce t27. Scanning through the grammar.\n\n   NT10's rule: NT10 -> t73. Not t27.\n\n   NT25: NT25 -> t29. No.\n\n   NT44: NT44 -> t76. No.\n\n   NT9: NT9 -> t38. No.\n\n   NT4: NT4 -> t45. No.\n\n   NT46: NT46 -> t66. Oh, wait, that's interesting. So NT46 can produce t66. So in the string, the last term is t66, which would come from NT46.\n\n   The second last term is t27. Checking NT30: NT30 has t90, t53, t14. Not t27.\n\n   NT17's rules: Wait, do any non-terminals produce t17? Let's check.\n\n   NT16: NT16 -> 't72'. No.\n\n   NT7: NT7 -> 't91'. No.\n\n   NT56: NT56 -> 't45'. No.\n\n   NT32: NT32 -> 't77'. No.\n\n   NT1: NT1 has several rules, but do any produce t17? Let's see the rules for NT1:\n\n   Looking through NT1's productions, I don't see t17 being outputted. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe t17 comes from one of the non-terminals on the left.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to look for a derivation that could produce the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t27 t17 t27 t66.\n\nSince the string is four tokens, let's see how that could happen. Starting from S, which splits into two non-terminals. So the first split would be two non-terminals, each of which might split again into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, we have four terminals, so maybe S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nLet's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nSo NT30 and NT53. NT30 would have to produce t27 somehow. But from NT30's productions, it only goes to terminals like t90, t53, t14. None of these are t27. So this path doesn't work.\n\nCase 2: S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nSo NT35 is derived as NT15 NT1, and NT45 -> NT59 NT5.\n\nWait, let me break that down.\n\nWait, S -> NT35 NT45, and NT35 -> NT15 NT1, and NT45 -> NT59 NT5.\n\nThen the string starts with NT35 and NT45, which split into NT15, NT1, NT59, NT5.\n\nNow, from NT15, which has productions NT15 -> NT12, and others, like NT15 -> NT44 NT33. Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps with t27.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if t27 can be generated by any of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT25 has a production NT25 -> t29. That's close, but not t27.\n\nChecking NT17: Wait, do any non-terminals produce t17?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any non-terminals that produce t17. The rule for NT32 is 't77', NT1 has rules but none output t17. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for each production whether it can lead to t27.\n\nLooking at NT30: NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'. None are t27. So t27 must come from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t27.\n\nLooking at the rule NT9: NT9 -> t38. Not t27.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if any can produce t27, t17, etc.\n\nLooking for t27: Is there any production that directly goes to t27?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production that ends with t27. So t27 must be a terminal in some other non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT15 appears in some rules: NT15 -> NT12, NT1 -> NT10 NT4, and other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this by seeing which non-terminals can derive t27.\n\nLooking for Non-Terminal (NT) X where X directly goes to a terminal which is t27. So X -> t27.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t27. So t27 must come from a non-terminal that in turn splits into more NTs, until we get to a terminal.\n\nSo for example, maybe NT30 could produce t27 through a chain, but looking at NT30's productions, it only goes to t27 if there's a rule where NT30 -> something that leads to t27, but in the given rules, NT30 doesn't have t27. Wait, wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules again, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nNone of these are t27. So any non-terminal that starts with NT30 cannot directly produce t27. So t27 must come from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking for any non-terminals that can produce t27. Wait, perhaps through NT1, which has a rule like NT1 -> NT10 NT4, but I don't see how that would get to t27.\n\nWait, let me think again. t27 is the first token in the string, so it must come from the first non-terminal in the split from S.\n\nWait, if S splits into NT30 and NT53, then NT30 is split into something, which then splits again to get to t27. Or maybe NT30 is a terminal in some way.\n\nWait, no, all non-terminals need to split into terminals or more non-terminals, but in the end, all must terminate into terminals.\n\nBut given that NT30 only splits into t27, t53, or t14, which don't include t27, maybe this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is quite complex, and the string is `t66 t28 t45 t7`. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any rule. So each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. NT are other non-terminals, and they produce combinations of NTs or terminals. So the string starts with NT30 and NT45, but wait, the given string starts with t66. That suggests I should look for where t66 is derived from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16. Hmm, does any non-terminal produce 't66'? Let me scan through the rules again. Oh, here's NT56 \u2192 NT28 t45. Wait, no, the syntax is a bit mixed. Let me look for NTs that directly produce a terminal.\n\nI spot NT56 \u2192 t28 t45. Similarly, NT30 has multiple rules like \u2192NT35 NT1, \u2192t90, etc. Wait, NT30 can produce t90, t53, t14 directly. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 t73, and others produce t's.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t66 t28 t45 t7. Let's look for which NT produces t66. Looking at NT62 \u2192 t43 t16. But wait, t66 isn't shown here. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the notation. Wait, the left-hand side of the production is written as NT followed by numbers, like NT62. Does NT62 produce something?\n\nWait, looking closely, I see NT56 \u2192 NT28 NT45, which is two non-terminals, and then other rules where NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, t66 comes first. So, where is 't66' introduced? Looking at the NT rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces 't66'. However, perhaps it's produced indirectly through a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string is built from the start symbol S, which produces NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So starting from S, we split into two NTs, and each can go deeper until we get to the terminals.\n\nBut let's try to see the possible trees.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to see if the string can be broken down into the parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet's break the string into tokens: t66, t28, t45, t7.\n\nWait, t66, so that's the first token. Looking at the productions, I don't see any rules that produce t66 directly. So perhaps it's constructed from NTs. Let me look for NTs that can produce t66. Hmm, in the NT rules, I don't see NT66 as a terminal. So maybe it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps t66 is from a combination. For example, NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16. If NT43 produces t40, maybe, but that doesn't give t66. Another option: NT56 \u2192 NT28 NT45, but that gives t28 and t45.\n\nWait, how about looking for NT62 and how it breaks down. NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16; then NT43 \u2192 NT40 or perhaps a terminal? Wait, looking at NT43's rules: NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT1, etc., and in the end, some of them produce terminals. For example, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT1: but let's see if any of these NTs produce t66.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to see which NT productions include t66.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT rule that has t66 as a direct production. So, perhaps t66 is part of an intermediate step. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT, NT30, can produce t90, t53, t14, etc. But wait, none produce t66. Maybe I need to see if an NS rule produces a combination that includes t66.\n\nWait, another approach: The string starts with 't66 t28 t45 t7'. So, to form this, the first NT (say, X) must produce this t66 and then another NT or terminal. But since t66 is a terminal, X must directly produce it. If no NT directly produces t66, then it's not in the language.\n\nWait, checking through the rules again. Looking for any NT with 't66' in any of their productions. Let me check each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45: both are non-terminals, so no.\n\nNTs:\n\n- NT30: various, including 't90', 't53', 't14', but none is 't66'.\n\n- NT35: 't15', etc., no 't66'.\n\n- NT43: various, but no 't66'.\n\n- NT15: similar.\n\n- NT45: 't59', 't5...', etc.\n\n- NT35: 't1 NT4', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NT rules for 't66':\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT28 NT45\n\nSo, NT62 and NT56 don't produce any t66. Hmmm. Wait, another thing: maybe the initial 't66' comes from an NT (say, X) which is derived from another NT and a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, X \u2192 NT Y, where X is a terminal 't66'. So, if X is NT62, then NT62 must directly produce 't66', but looking at NT62's rules, all produce two NTs except perhaps 't62' if that's a terminal. But in the rules, I don't see 't62' as a terminal. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16 and some non-terminals; no t62 is produced as a terminal.\n\nSo, if no NT directly produces 't66', then the first token cannot be formed, meaning the string can't be in the language.\n\nTherefore, the string `t66 t28 t45 t7` cannot be generated by the given grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are quite complex, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically means that each production rule has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side. Looking at the provided rules, it seems they all fit this structure, with only two exceptions: some rules have three non-terminals on one side, like NT30 -> 't90', but wait, no, wait\u2014the initial part showed some rules like S -> NT30 NT53, which are two non-terminals, but then some NT rules like NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because in CNF, the right-hand side should be either two non-terminals or one terminal. But in the grammar, some right-hand sides are terminals, which is allowed but limited. So, in CNF, the rule can have a single terminal, but not more than two non-terminals. So the presence of rules like NT30 -> 't90' seems okay since it's a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t17 t73 t80 t28 t53`. I believe this string is a sequence of terminals, each presumably corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by a series of substitutions.\n\nThe approach will be to try to break down the string into the possible productions. Since the grammar is context-free, we can parse the string top-down, starting from S and trying to replace symbols until we get the entire string.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the relevant production rules that produce terminals because we need terminal strings:\n\nLooking through the grammar, many rules have terminals. Let me list the ones that produce terminals:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't89'\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't91'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't29'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't59'\n- NT56 -> 't28'\n- NT11 -> 't28'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT32 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT59 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT4 -> 't45'\n- NT46 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't53'\n- NT15 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't33'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n- NT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, I think I might have misread some. Let's correct that.\n\nActually, in the grammar, some symbols produce terminals. For example, S is defined with two non-terminals on each side, but some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo for each terminal in the string, we can check if there's a production rule that directly produces that terminal. Let's see:\n\nt17: looks like NT59 -> t17 (from NT59 -> 't17')\nt73: NT10 -> t73\nt80: NT53 -> t80\nt28: NT56 -> t28\nt53: NT30 -> t53 (as well as others)\n\nBut I need to see if the sequence can be generated.\n\nSo let's try to see possible paths.\n\nThe string is t17, t73, t80, t28, t53.\n\nLet me start from the string and see if it can be matched by any rule, then backtrack until I can derive it from S.\n\nThe entire string is 5 tokens: t17, t73, t80, t28, t53.\n\nFirst, consider the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLet me consider S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nIf S is NT30 followed by NT53, then the entire string must be the expansion of NT30 and NT53. But the string is 5 tokens, so perhaps NT30 expands into t17 and NT53 expands into four more terms? Or maybe I need to look at the rules step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can expand to two products, but the string is a single sequence. So maybe I should look at how the string can be generated by sequentially expanding the symbols.\n\nWait, the entire string is a single string; so if S is the start, it must directly produce the entire string, or the string must be the result of expanding S's productions.\n\nBut looking at S's rules, S can only produce two non-terminals each time: S->NT30 NT53 or S->NT35 NT45.\n\nSo for example, S could expand to NT30 NT53, each of which is a non-terminal that can themselves expand.\n\nSo perhaps the string is the result of expanding S and its sub-productions all the way down to terminals.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down according to S's productions.\n\nLet me see: if S->NT30 NT53, then the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT30 and NT53.\n\nSimilarly, if S->NT35 NT45, the string must be a concatenation of expansions of NT35 and NT45.\n\nSo let's compute what each possible S production would expand into.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nThen the string must be (everything from NT30) followed by (everything from NT53).\n\nCase 2: S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nThen the string must be (everything from NT35) followed by (everything from NT45).\n\nSo let's see if the given string fits either case.\n\nOur string is t17 t73 t80 t28 t53.\n\nLet me try Case 1: suppose the string is the concatenation of NT30 derivations and NT53 derivations.\n\nSo we need to split the string into the part from NT30 and the part from NT53.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that NT30 and NT53 each may expand into multiple terminals or further non-terminals. So unless they directly produce the right number of terminals, this might not fit.\n\nLet me see what NT30 and NT53 derive into.\n\nLooking back at the NT30 rules:\n\nNT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14', 't53' again (duplicate), etc. Wait, I think that some rules for NT30 like NT30 -> 't90', NT30 -> 't53', and NT30->'t14'. There are possibly more rules. Wait, looking at the original grammar, let me list all NT30 rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n\nWait, no, looking in the provided grammar, under NT30: \"t90\" appears twice. Wait, no, in the original grammar, I see:\n\nThe first list is under S:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nThen under NT43, NT15, etc., so perhaps the grammar also has NT30 having rules like NT30 -> t30, etc., but in the provided grammar, the initial part is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, let"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t32 t33 t33 t28 t17`, and the grammar consists of a bunch of productions. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided has all non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right, except for some that have multiple non-terminals on the right side. Wait, actually, looking at it again: some productions have two terminals, like NT1 -> 't10' or NT53 -> 't7'. But in CNF, each production should have at most two non-terminals on the left. Wait, no: in CNF, each production results in a single non-terminal, so each production is either A \u2192 a (with a being a single terminal or non-terminal) or A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see some rules like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which have two non-terminals on the right. That's fine, but other rules have combinations like NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25, which again are two non-terminals. So, the grammar seems to follow CNF except where a non-terminal is directly connected to a terminal. Wait, actually, in the grammar, some non-terminals are connected to terminals, like NT30 \u2192 't90' or NT30 \u2192 't53' or 't14', etc. So these are terminals on the right side of a production. This would mean that NT30 can produce any of those terminals, or combinations via other non-terminals.\n\nSo the string we're trying to check is `t32 t33 t33 t28 t17`. I need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals. For each terminal in the string, I'll look at the production rules that produce it.\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\n- 't32' is produced by NT32, but looking at the grammar, the rule is NT25 \u2192 't21' (Wait, let me check again). Oh, I think I might be mixing up the NT25 production. Wait, let me check each NT rule:\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't89', 't10', 't4'\n- NT53 -> 't7', 't59', 't1', 't53', 't59', etc.? Wait, actually, looking back, I think I might have to re-examine how each NT is connected.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should make a list for each terminal to see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLet's list the production rules that end in each terminal.\n\n- 't32' comes from NT32? But looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT32. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check all the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 appears to have several rules, including NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4, etc.\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56, as per the list.\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT15 \u2192 NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the rules are multiple.

CNF has production rules where each rule either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. That means every non-terminal on the left side can only expand into two other symbols on the right. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process and makes it easier to apply algorithms like CYK, but I don't need to use a parsing algorithm here. Instead, I can try to trace back from the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe given string is `t53 t66 t29 t77 t29 t33`. Let's split this into individual tokens: t53, t66, t29, t77, t29, t33. Each of these is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe grammar has two initial productions for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-102","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t76 t53 t45 t17 t72 t24\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules for non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT3, etc.) that expand into other non-terminals or terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). The start symbol is S, so the string needs to be derived starting from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two main production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo any valid string must start with the production of NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nThe given string is \"t76 t53 t45 t17 t72 t24\". Let's split this into the sequence of symbols: [t76, t53, t45, t17, t72, t24]. I need to see if this can be derived from either S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nFirst, let's check if the string starts with NT30 followed by NT53. The first symbol is 't76', so I need to find if 't76' can be derived from NT30. Looking at the production rules for NT30, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nWait, that's it. So NT30 can only be replaced by 't90', 't53', 't14', or 't27'. But the first symbol in the string is 't76', which isn't any of those. So \"t76\" comes from somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a sequence of symbols, but in the grammar, NT30 might be a non-terminal that can produce multiple things, including other NTs.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar seems to have each NT directly pointing to a sequence of other NTs or terminals. So, to get a terminal symbol, you have to fully expand that NT until you reach terminals.\n\nSo for example, let's take NT30. Its production rules are:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nSo 't76' is not a direct production by NT30. That suggests that \"t76\" might not come directly from NT30.\n\nWait, but maybe NT30 can produce some NT that eventually leads to 't76'. Let me see if there's a path.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see if any of the NTs have 't76' as a terminal. From the productions, I see:\n\nThe productions that end with 't76' aren't directly listed. Let me check each production for terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT46 -> 't66' (no)\n- NT4 -> 't45' (no)\n- NT62 -> 't43' (no)\n- NT5 -> 't9' or 't43' (no)\n- NT16 -> 't31' (no)\n- NT7 -> 't91' (no)\n- NT53 has several, but checking each:\n  - NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n  - NT53 -> NT17 NT72\n  - NT53 -> NT59 NT5\n  - NT53 -> NT91 (which is 't91')\n  - Also, NT53 was in NT7, which is 't91'.\n\nWait, maybe NT53 can produce 't91', which is 't91' but the string has 't76'. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see: does any NT directly expand to 't76'? Let's check all the rules again.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't76'. Only NT16 produces 't31', NT15 produces 't12', etc. So 't76' is not a terminal in any of the production rules. Wait, but the given string includes 't76', so how does that come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the production rules again. Oh, wait, is there a rule that leads to 't76' indirectly?\n\nWait, maybe the rule NT71 or something, but looking through the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't76' directly. So the string has 't76' which isn't a terminal in the grammar. That seems problematic.\n\nWait, did I copy all the rules correctly?\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe given grammar is as follows:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\n\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\n\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\n\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\n\nNT16 -> 't72'\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't89'\n\nNT53 -> 't7'\n\nNT7 -> 't91'\n\nNT56 -> 't45'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nNT10 -> 't73'\n\nNT25 -> 't29'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT53 -> 't59'\n\nNT56 -> 't28'\n\nNT11 -> 't28'\n\nNT59 -> 't17'\n\nNT32 -> 't77'\n\nNT1 -> 't10'\n\nNT59 -> 't28'\n\nNT15 -> 't12'\n\nNT10 -> 't32'\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nNT4 -> 't45'\n\nNT46 -> 't66'\n\nNT53 -> 't91'\n\nNT9 -> 't38'\n\nNT4 -> 't53'\n\nNT15 -> 't38'\n\nNT4 -> 't33'\n\nNT59 -> 't24'\n\nNT9 -> 't20'\n\nNT53 -> 't80'\n\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, hold on! I see now. The production NT44 -> 't76' is present. Let me check that.\n\nYes, NT44 -> 't76' is a rule.\n\nSo, that means if an NT44 appears in a sentential form, it can produce 't76'. But looking at the string again, the second symbol is 't53', which suggests it comes from NT53.\n\nWait, the given string is \"t76 t53 t45 t17 t72 t24\".\n\nSo first is 't76' which can come from NT44.\n\nWait, but in the start symbol S, the production rules are either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So unless the parser can start with NT44, which isn't an option, how does 't76' come into play?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the string structure. Let me consider the string as a series of symbols generated by the NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is parsed as a sequence derived from the NTs, so each symbol is generated by an NT. So the entire string would have to be derived from S.\n\nWait, so let's think in terms of a derivation.\n\nIf the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nSuppose we choose the NT30 path: NT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't14', or 't27'. But the string starts with 't76', which isn't any of these. So that path can't be used.\n\nNow, let's consider the other production: S can be NT35 NT45.\n\nNT35 can produce what? Looking at the rules:\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT35 -> NT33 ... but no, more rules here.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT35 has two production rules:\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nand\n\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nWait, but I think earlier I included more possibilities, but maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-120","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string `t90 t53 t89 t17 t90 t90 t29` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar has two initial productions:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45. Let me parse the string and see which rule could potentially generate it.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with `t90`, which corresponds to the production NT30 -> 't90'. So the first part of S is satisfied by NT30.\n\nThe next symbol is `t53`, which comes from NT53 -> 't53'. So the first part of the S -> NT30 NT53 rule is satisfied, meaning we have S followed by NT53. So far, we've generated `t90 t53`.\n\nWait, but the first part of the S production is NT30, so the entire tree would be S -> NT30 (which becomes 't90') and NT53 (which becomes 't53'). So the first two tokens are 't90 t53', which matches the beginning of the string.\n\nBut looking at the original string, after 't90 t53', the next token is 't89'. Let me see what NT89 could produce. But wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT89. The next part is 't89', which I'm not sure how that fits in. Maybe I miscounted, but the string is actually `t90 t53 t89 t17 t90 t90 t29`.\n\nWait, that's seven tokens. The first two are 't90 t53', which we've covered. Then we have 't89 t17 t90 t90 t29'. Hmm, but according to the S production, after generating 't90 t53', we should have finished, but the string continues. So perhaps there's a mistake. Wait, maybe I misread the string. Let me check again: the string is `t90 t53 t89 t17 t90 t90 t29` which is seven tokens. Oh, but S -> NT30 NT53 would produce two tokens, so after the initial two, perhaps we need to see how the rest of the string is generated.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. The S production starts the entire string. So the entire string must be generated by applying the rules correctly.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to break down the entire string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t90, t53, t89, t17, t90, t90, t29.\n\nBut the first two tokens must be either S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45. So for the first case, after 't90', the next is 't53'. That works because NT30 -> t90 and NT53 -> t53.\n\nBut then after that, we have more tokens: 't89 t17 t90 t90 t29'. How can these be generated?\n\nWait, perhaps the production of S can be applied again, but that would require S to produce more symbols. But according to the grammar, S can only produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So after generating 't90 t53', which is S, the string continues, which implies that there's a further expansion beyond S.\n\nWait, that might not fit because S is the start symbol, and everything must be generated from S without any other non-terminals left unprocessed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check the productions more carefully to see if after generating S->NT30 NT53, which gives two tokens, but the string has seven, which requires more productions. Wait, but the grammar as given is a context-free grammar, so all non-terminals must be expanded, and each production can only produce terminals, so each symbol in the string must be either a terminal or part of a non-terminal that resolves to it.\n\nWait, maybe I got the grammar wrong. Let me look again:\n\nThe grammar has S as the start symbol, and S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So each production of S generates two non-terminals. Then those non-terminals must be expanded further into their respective productions, each of which could produce two non-terminals or, in some cases, terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, for example, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. Similarly, other NT symbols have productions that can sometimes result in terminals and sometimes in other NT symbols.\n\nSo perhaps the string 't90 t53 t89 t17 t90 t90 t29' can be broken down as follows:\n\n- The first token is 't90' from NT30. So that's the first part.\n- The second token is 't53' from NT53, making it S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nNow, the third token is 't89', which would need to come from another NT symbol, perhaps. But S only produces two non-terminals, so maybe we have to have more productions or maybe the string is longer than what's generated by the initial S.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the string is not produced by S, but I think it must be. Because the start symbol is S, the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this by building a parse tree. Let me try to do that.\n\nStart with S, which can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nTake the first alternative: S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nNow, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14', etc.\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT30 has the productions:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14' (from NT30 -> 't27')\nWait, wait, I need to clarify that. Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking back, the grammar's NT30 -> 't90' is listed, and also NT30 -> 't53', and NT30 -> 't14' via NT30 -> 't27'?\n\nWait, let's make sure. The NT30 productions are listed as:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'  (since it's written as NT30 -> 't27' in another line, but I think in the initial list, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar as given includes lines like:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'  (is this correct?

I remember from my studies that when dealing with such grammars, the standard approach is to see if we can derive the string starting from the start symbol (in this case, S) using the production rules.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It's a form where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't go on the right-hand side. Looking at the provided grammar, all the rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so it's in CNF, which is good because that simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe string given is `t90 t40 t73 t10 t53 t73 t33`. Let's notice that this is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if this sequence can be derived by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Okay, that's our starting point. So the string must be generated from one of these two possibilities.\n\nLet me write down the two options for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nI need to check both, but let's see which one can lead to the target string. The string starts with t90, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, several productions end with terminals. For example, NT30 can be t90, t53, or t14. Similarly, NT1 can expand to t10, etc.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first production: NT30 \u2192 NT30 NT53. That might not be directly helpful because it could lead to more non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether the string starts with t90, so perhaps S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is the way to go.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t90, so which rule allows NT30 to produce t90? Let me check the NT30 productions. Oh, looking here, NT30 has several options: t90, t53, t14, and more. So yes, S \u2192 NT30 NT53 could be a starting point, and one of NT30's rules is t90, which matches the first token.\n\nSo, let's expand S as NT30 NT53. Our string starts with t90, so perhaps NT30 expands directly to t90, and the rest of the string is built from NT53.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then we need to produce `t90` followed by the rest of the string: `t40 t73 t10 t53 t73 t33`. Wait, but that's seven tokens, right? Let me count the tokens: the string is `t90 t40 t73 t10 t53 t73 t33`, which is seven 't's. But S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which is two non-terminals, so when expanded, each non-terminal will produce a number of tokens. Hmm, I think I need to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string t90 t40 t73 t10 t53 t73 t33. Starting with S, which expands to NT30 NT53. So the first token should come from NT30. As above, NT30 can produce t90. So, let's tentatively replace S \u2192 NT30 NT53, and then see if NT30 can produce t90.\n\nSo, NT30 \u2192 t90. Now, the remaining string is t40 t73 t10 t53 t73 t33, and we have the other NT53 to expand from. So the next production after NT30 is NT53.\n\nNow, the next token is t40. Let's see what NT53 can produce. Looking at NT53's rules: according to the grammar, NT53 can produce t7, t59, or t91. But wait, in the target string, the next token is t40, which isn't one of those. So that's a problem. So NT53 cannot produce t40 directly.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake here? Let me double-check. The second token is t40, so the second part (after S's first production) is NT53, which needs to produce t40. But looking at the grammar, none of NT53's rules directly produce t40. Let me list NT53's rules:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT53 -> t7\nNT53 -> t59\nNT53 -> t91\n\nSo no, none of these produce 't40'. Hmm, that suggests that this path doesn't work. Maybe we need to backtrack. Perhaps S doesn't expand to NT30 NT53; perhaps S expands to NT35 NT45.\n\nLet me try that option. S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Then, the first token should come from NT35 or NT45. The first token of the string is t90. So let's see what NT35 can produce. Let me look at NT35's rules:\n\nLooking back, NT35 has several rules, for example, it can produce t15, t1, etc. Wait, do any of them produce 't90'? Let's check:\n\nNo, from the grammar, NT35 can produce, for example, NT15 NT1, but nowhere does it produce 't90'. Alternatively, looking at NT35, according to the provided rules, it can't produce t90 directly. The start symbol S's first expansion options produce t90 via NT30, which we saw doesn't work for the second token.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Perhaps in the grammar, some non-terminals can produce multiple things, and sometimes they can expand into other non-terminals and eventually terminals. So maybe after S \u2192 NT35 NT45, the first token from NT35 is something else, and then the NT45 can produce the t90.\n\nWait, no. The string is `t90 t40 t73 t10 t53 t73 t33`, so the first token is t90. So to get a t90 as the first token, the production must start with that, so if I choose S \u2192 NT35 NT45, then one of NT35 or NT45 must produce t90. Looking at NT35's productions, do any produce t90? Or is it NT45?\n\nLooking at NT45's rules: I see NT59 NT5 is one of the options, and t76, etc. Wait, looking again:\n\nNT45 has the rule NT53 NT15, and some others. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT45's rules are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 t53 NT5\nWait, no, looking at the list:\n\nIt's actually several rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT45 -> t45\nWait, no, looking again: the provided grammar includes:\n\n- NT35 -> t15 NT1\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me make a list of NT X productions:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nNT30 can produce multiple terminals:\n\n- 't90', 't53', 't14', and other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut perhaps I should make a structured approach to see what the first non-terminal can produce t90.\n\nFrom the previous, NT30 can produce t90, as well as t53 and t14. But in this case, the string starts with t90, so maybe S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is the way to go.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that after NT30 \u2192 t90, the next token is t40, but NT53 doesn't produce t40 directly. So that seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT30 can produce another non-terminal which can then produce t40. Let me check NT30's other productions.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT30 NT53\nNT30 \u2192 NT14 \u2192 which eventually might produce some terminal, but more likely leads to more expansions.\n\nWait, NT30 can produce NT14, and then NT14 can produce something. Let me check NT14's productions. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT14 as a non-terminal. Wait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, the provided grammar includes:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90' among others.\n\nSo, maybe I should only focus on the given"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. That should make parsing easier, maybe with something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just doing a manual check, I'll go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the string to evaluate:\nt53 t32 t10 t40 t17 t77 t12 t38\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of production rules. I think the best approach is to break down the string into smaller parts and see if each part can be derived from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me look at the top-level rules. The grammar starts with S, and S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string should start with either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t53. Let me check the production rules that produce t53.\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT30 -> t53 and NT16 -> t72. Also, NT53 -> t59 and others, but I don't see NT53 -> t53. Wait, looking again, I see NT30 is a non-terminal that can produce t53 as per `NT30 -> 't53'`. So the first token is t53, which must have come from NT30.\n\nSo, the first part is NT30 -> t53. So the string starts with t53, which comes from NT30.\n\nWait, but looking back, the grammar shows that NT30 has multiple productions: NT30 -> 't53', 't14', 't27', 't90'. So t53 is possible, but what's the rest?\n\nThe string is t53 t32 t10 t40 t17 t77 t12 t38. So after t53, we have t32, which is another terminal.\n\nI need to see if the rest of the string can be broken down into the productions of NT30.

So, after t53, the next part would be t32 t10 t40 t17 t77 t12 t38, which should be derived from NT53.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT53 has some rules. Let me check what NT53 can produce. From the rules, I see NT53 -> NT46 NT1 and NT53 -> 't59'. Also, looking at the end, I see NT53 -> 't7', but that's a terminal, not a non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1  \nNT53 -> 't59'  \nNT16 -> 't72'  \n...  \nWait, I'm getting confused, perhaps I should list all the rules for NT53.\n\nLooking back, the rules for NT53 are:\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1  \n- NT53 -> 't7'  \n- NT16 -> 't72'  \nWait no, that's NT16.

{"custom_id":"request-167","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the string `t24 t33 t73 t29 t31 t7 t38 t77 t89` is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the grammar and see how the string can be derived from it. Chomsky normal form typically has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production rule either breaks down a non-terminal into two others or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the rules are either combining non-terminals or ending with a terminal. For example, the rule S -> NT30 NT53 involves two non-terminals on both sides. I might need to expand these non-terminals to see if they can reach terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string in question is a sequence of terminals (like t24, t33, etc.). So, each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My job is to see if the grammar can produce this exact sequence through some series of derivations.\n\nLet me list out the production rules first to see how each non-terminal might relate to terminals or other non-terminals:\n\n- NT43 has production rules leading to NT53 NT11, which further to NT53 NT1. Wait, that might not help because NT53 and NT1 might go further. Let me check more systematically.\n\nStarting with the top-level rule S. S can be replaced by either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So, S is a combination of two non-terminals. But looking at the string, S is the start symbol, so in the initial step, S must be broken down into NT30 and NT53, then each of those would be further expanded until they reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: `t24 t33 t73 t29 t31 t7 t38 t77 t89`. That's nine tokens. So, the derivation will involve expanding S into two non-terminals, and then each of those further, until we have nine terminals.\n\nLet me think about the length of the string. Each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two. So, the length of the string after each expansion can increase by one each time. Starting with length 1 (S), then after the first split, we have two non-terminals, so the string could have 2 tokens. Then, each non-terminal may split again, increasing the length by one each time they split. But wait, the length of the string is the number of terminals derived. So, each time a non-terminal is split into two other non-terminals, the string's length increases by one. Because the non-terminals are replaced by their replacements eventually.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Each time a non-terminal is replaced by two other non-terminals, each of those can themselves either be replaced or be terminals. So, the string length increases by one for each time we have to split a non-terminal that isn't yet a terminal.\n\nSo, the string has nine terminals. Let's count how many splits are needed. Starting from S (1 symbol, length 1 of the string as it's non-terminal). Each split increases the number of symbols in the current string by one. Because S splits into two non-terminals, so the string now would have two. If each of those are split to two more, the string becomes four, then eight, then potentially more. But in our case, the string is nine tokens. So, the number of splits required would be from 1 up to 9. Let me see: 1 becomes 2 (split once), then 4 (split twice), 5 (split on one of them). Wait, perhaps another way: the number of terminals is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^k where k is the number of splits. But that might not directly apply here because some non-terminals may produce terminals and others may produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps this approach is too vague. Let's instead look at each terminal in the string and see if they match any production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\nt24, t33, t73, t29, t31, t7, t38, t77, t89.\n\nI'll need to trace each of these back through the possible derivations.\n\nStarting with t89: looking at the grammar, there's a production rule NT1 -> 't89'. So, this could come directly from NT1. So, t89 in the string must be derived from NT1. Let me check: Yes, in the grammar, NT1 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't89'. So, if there's a t89 at the end, it's from NT1.\n\nSimilarly, t73 is a terminal. I need to see how t73 is derived. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 is 't73'. So, that must come from NT7.\n\nt77: Looking through the grammar, is there an NT77? Looking at the production rules, I don't see any NT77 as a terminal or non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT30 -> 't24', which is a terminal. Similarly, other NTs are mapped to terminals. For example, NT30 -> 't24', NT30 -> 't33', NGT10 -> 't73', etc. So, each of these NTs correspond to specific terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each of these NT rules maps to a specific terminal. So, for example, NT30 can produce either 't24' or 't33' or 't30'? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't27'\n\nWait, sorry, the production rules for NT30 are multiple:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nWait, but in the provided list, it's written as:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't33'\nNT30 -> 't24'\n\nWait, no, let me scan through the production rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT30: \nIt seems NT30 has three production rules: 't90', 't14', and 't27'.\n\nWait, but looking more carefully:\n\nLine 7: NT30 -> 't90'\nLine 14: NT30 -> 't14'\nLine 16: Not applicable?\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse through all the production rules to see what each NT leads to.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53 or S-> NT35 NT45.\n\nThen NT43 -> NT53 NT11 or other rules.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for each terminal in the string and see where they come from.\n\nLooking at t24: is there a non-terminal that directly produces it? Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT46 -> 't66' and others, but let's see. Wait, NT27 would be a candidate. Wait, I need to see if any NT's production ends in 't24'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11 (not terminal)\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT5 -> 't91' or others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note all production rules ending with a terminal.

Wait, no, looking at line 22:\n\nLine 22: NT53 -> 't7'\n\nBut I also see NT53 -> 't59', 't91', etc. Wait, perhaps I should transcribe each production for each non-terminal and see which produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a list of all NTs and their terminal productions. Let's try:\n\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4, NT53 -> 't7', NT35 -> NT15 NT1, etc. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to create a map of each NT to its possible terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar step by step:\n\n1.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal.

Looking through the productions, I see NT59 has several rules, but wait, in the grammar provided, do any of the non-terminals directly produce t59?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t59. Let me check again. Looking at the productions for NT59, no, none of them produce a terminal directly. Hmm, that's confusing because the string starts with t59. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully. Let me list all the terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT35 -> 't15', 't1 NT4', 't53', 't1 NT4', etc.\nWait, maybe I should group the terminals more clearly.\n\nWait, let's make a list of all terminals in the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14' \u2192 so t90, t53, t14\n- NT35 -> 't15', 't1 NT25', 't53', 't1 NT4', 't15' \u2192 t15, t1, t25, t4\n- NT43 -> 't46', 't1' \u2192 t46, t1\n- NT15 -> 't12' \u2192 t12\n- NT53 -> 't7', 't59', 't91' \u2192 t7, t59, t91\n- NT25 -> 't29' \u2192 t29\n- NT44 -> 't76' \u2192 t76\n- NT9 -> 't38' \u2192 t38\n- NT4 -> 't45' \u2192 t45\n- NT15 again \u2192 t12\n- NT46 -> 't66' \u2192 t66\n- NT53 again \u2192 t91\n- NT9 again \u2192 t38\n- NT59 \u2192 't28' \u2192 t28\n- NT4 again \u2192 t45, t33 \u2192 t45, t33\n- NT16 \u2192 't31' \u2192 t31\nWait, but in the given string, the first terminal is t59.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process. Each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, which makes it easier to handle with parsers like recursive descent or shift-reduce parsers.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the target string. The grammar consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT30, NT15, etc.) and terminals (like 't28', 't76', etc.). The start symbol is S, and the string to check is a sequence of these terminals: t28, t76, t38, t80, t72, t10, t12, t27, t38, t73.\n\nSince it's a CNF grammar, any string derived from it must be generated by a series of productions that reduce each non-terminal into terminals. The input string has 10 elements, so each must correspond to a terminal in the grammar. Let me check if each of these are in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- t28 is produced by NT15, NT11, NT59, etc. So it's there.\n- t76 is produced by NT4. Check: NT4 \u2192 t45. Wait, that's 't45', not 't76'. Hmm, did I look correctly? Let's search for 't76'. Oh, yes! NT4 \u2192 t45, but wait, in the list I provided, NT46 \u2192 t66. No, I don't see t76 except in the string. Wait, did I miss something? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules provided, NT45 is a rule, and NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, but that leads to terminals. Hmm. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23? No, wait, the user's grammar has NT46 \u2192 t66. But the string has t76. Is there any rule that produces 't76'? No, I don't see it. Wait, did I miss a rule? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT45\n- NT46 \u2192 NT66\n\nSo, NT4 is NT45, which is NT59 NT5, leading to t76? Wait, no.\n\nWait, NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. Where do these go? Looking further down:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 't91'? Wait, let me trace:\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach non-terminal can be broken down into terminals or other non-terminals. The string we're looking at is a series of terminals, so each element must correspond to a terminal production or be part of a path leading to terminals.\n\nI think the key is to build a parse tree where each non-terminal is expanded until only terminals remain. Since the string is 10 elements long, the parse tree could be a combination of productions, each contributing one or more terminals.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. Each token must come directly from a terminal in the grammar or be produced via a non-terminal step.\n\nLooking at the string: t28 t76 t38 t80 t72 t10 t12 t27 t38 t73.\n\nLet's see each token:\n\n1. t28: produced by NT15, NT11, etc.\n2. t76: Looking through the grammar rules, is there a rule that directly produces t76? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT46 \u2192 t66. No t76. But wait, there's NT23 \u2192 NT25 NT16? Hmm, wait, the user's grammar includes NT23? No, in their provided list, under NT23, perhaps.\n\nWait, the user\u2019s grammar list goes from NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14' etc. Let's look for 't76' in the rule list.\n\nI don't see 't76' being directly produced by any NT. So perhaps the string contains a token that's not in the grammar. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me carefully check each rule again.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT45\n- NT46 \u2192 NT66\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1, etc.\n\nWait, 't76' is in the string. Is there any NT that produces 't76'? Scanning all the right-hand sides, I don't see 't76' appearing except in the string itself. So unless there's a rule I missed, 't76' isn't directly a terminal in any production.\n\nTherefore, since 't76' isn't a terminal in any of the non-terminals' productions, the string contains a symbol that can't be derived from the grammar. Thus, the string is not in the language.\n\nAnother way to look at this is to see if the parser needs to reduce a non-terminal into 't76', which isn't possible because 't76' is not derived from any NT.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains 't76', which is not a terminal in the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-205","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or one non-terminal on the left and two symbols on the right (which can be terminals or non-terminals). That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that helps here. I think I just need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to check is: t89 t73 t10 t14 t38 t33 t40 t33 t28 t28 t40.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has the following production rules:\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo any valid string generated by S must be a combination of NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. That gives me two main branches to consider.\n\nLet me write down what each NT rule produces, hoping to find a path that leads to all terminals in the string.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT30. The NT30 rules are:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n\nWait, so it can generate three different things. Similarly, NT53 has:\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't59'\n- NT56\n- NT32\n- NT40\n- NT12\n- NT4\n- NT66\n- NT91\n\nWait, no, looking back, it's more like each NT has multiple production rules. Let me list all NT definitions to understand better.\n\nStarting with NT30:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n\nAh, so it can terminate as t90, t53, or t14.\n\nNext, NT35 has several productions:\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT35 -> NT4 NT33\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nHmm, so it depends on how it's derived. Let me see where NT35 and NT45 go.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 has:\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT45 -> NT53 NT1\n- NT45 -> NT56 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT53 NT4\n- NT45 -> NT12 NT5\n- NT45 -> NT9 NT43\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for paths that can result in the given string.\n\nThe string is: t89 t73 t10 t14 t38 t33 t40 t33 t28 t28 t40.\n\nI need to see if these terminals can be produced by a sequence of NT productions starting from S.\n\nLet's think about starting with S. Since S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45, the string must start with one of these combinations. Let's see:\n\nIf S generates NT30 NT53, then the first part is NT30 and the second is NT53.\n\nAlternatively, if S generates NT35 NT45, then the first part is NT35 and the second is NT45.\n\nThe string starts with t89. Let's check which NTs can produce t89.\n\nLooking at NT30: t90, t53, t14. Doesn't produce t89.\n\nLooking at NT35: what can it produce? Hmm, looking back, NT35's productions are:\n\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT35 -> NT4 NT33\n\nWait, but none of these directly produce t89. So maybe NT35 can't produce t89. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up which NTs can generate which terminals.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the first symbols might be t89, which comes from NT9? Let me check: Are any NTs that produce t89?\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed some. Checking the NT rules:\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce t89, perhaps. Looking through each:\n\n- NT1 -> 't89' (Yes, so NT1 can produce t89.)\n\nWait, but where does NT1 come into the bigger picture?\n\nLet me clarify all NT productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT9 -> 't38'\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNT15 -> 't12'\n\nNT59 -> 't17'\n\nNT32 -> 't77'\n\nNT1 -> 't10'\n\nNT59 -> 't28'\n\nNT15 -> 't38'\n\nNT4 -> 't45'\n\nNT46 -> 't66'\n\nNT53 -> 't91'\n\nNT9 -> 't20'\n\nNT53 -> 't80'\n\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nOther NT rules:\n\nNT30: 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nNT35: NT15 NT1, NT1 NT4, NT4 NT33, NT1 NT4\n\nNT45: NT59 NT5, NT53 NT1, NT56 NT32, NT53 NT4, NT12 NT5, NT9 NT43\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some, but it's clear that NT1 can produce t89. But in which cases?\n\nLooking at S's rules, the only productions are NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So if a string starts with t89, which comes from NT1, then that would imply that the production chain must involve reaching NT1, which is probably part of a deeper derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S production leads to NT1, but I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a possible derivation path for the given string.\n\nThe string is: t89 t73 t10 t14 t38 t33 t40 t33 t28 t28 t40.\n\nLet's see if this string can be built from the NT rules.\n\nStarting from S, which can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's take the first option, S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nSo the first part is NT30, the second is NT53.\n\nNT30 can be 't90', 't53', or 't14'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't89', so that's not any of these, so S can't be NT30 NT53 in this case. Therefore, S must be NT35 NT45.\n\nSo now, the string starts with NT35 and then NT45.\n\nLooking at NT35, it can be:\n\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\n- NT35 -> NT4 NT33\n\nI don't see a direct production rule for NT35 that starts with 't89', so perhaps this branch is not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Maybe the NT35 can't produce t89 directly, so perhaps the first step is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe S generates NT35 NT45, and within that, the first NT35 might produce a derivation that starts with t89 through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT35 can produce a sequence that includes t89, but I'm not sure since the direct productions don't have t89.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach: perhaps t89 is produced by NT1, which in turn is part of a rule. For example, looking at NT1:\n\nNT1 -> 't10'\n\nBut we also have NT15 -> NT44 NT33, and NT15 -> 't12', NT15 -> 't38', etc. Hmm, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's first part is generated by a deeper derivation involving NT1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is not possible because none of the NTs can generate t89 except NT1, and to get to NT1, you have to go through certain productions that might not align with the string.\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, does any NT rule produce t89?

{"custom_id":"request-204","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is important because it simplifies certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm. But I don't know if I need to use that here. \n\nThe given string is `t31 t89 t45 t33 t17 t33 t80 t27 t45 t66 t80`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it using the given production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production rules for S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. The string starts with t31, which is a terminal. I need to see if this corresponds to one of the terminals in the productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal (like NT30, NT35, etc.) has productions that expand into terminals and other non-terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be broken down into a derivation path from S.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals. Let's list them out:\n\nt31, t89, t45, t33, t17, t33, t80, t27, t45, t66, t80.\n\nI need to check if this sequence can be derived by expanding S using the given rules.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's check which option is more promising.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t31. Let's see if any production leads to t31.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT30 has a production that includes t30 (like NT30 \u2192 't30'), but also check other non-terminals:\n\nWait, let's correct that. The grammar's productions are listed with arrows, so for example:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have productions into terminals like t1, t3, etc.\n\nSo looking for t31, I see that one of the non-terminals is NT16, which has a production NT16 \u2192 t31. Similarly, there are other NT productions with t31. Let's check:\n\nYes, NT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nSo, wherever NT16 appears in the derivation, it can produce t31.\n\nNow, the first part of the string is t31. Let me see where t31 comes from.\n\nSo, if in the initial expansion S \u2192 NT35 NT45 or S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then each component will produce some non-terminals, which will then expand further.\n\nGiven that the first token is t31, which comes from NT16 \u2192 t31, I need to see where in the initial productions t31 could appear. But wait, the start symbol isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal. So the first step is to expand S into two non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Then each of NT30 and NT53 can produce various non-terminals. Let's see what's possible for each.\n\nNT30 has productions: 't90', 't53', 't14', and 't27' (wait, looking back, NT30's productions are:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27'\n\nWait, the given grammar lists several for each NT. For NT30, the productions are:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nSo, NT30 can expand to any of these four terminals: t90, t53, t14, t27.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 has several productions, including 't7', 't59', etc. Let me list them all:\n\nNT53 productions:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't7', 't59', 't1', 't4', 't59', 't1', 't33', 't77', 't91', 't7', 't59', 't17', 't7', 't59', 't80', 't31'.\n\nWait, that seems too many. Let me clarify. The grammar lists several for each NT. For example:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't59', NT53 \u2192 't7' etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to go line by line.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT53, the productions are:\n\nLine 10: NT53 \u2192 't59'\n\nLine 11: NT53 \u2192 't7'\n\nLine 12: NT56 \u2192 't45'\n\nWait, wait, let's check each NT's productions:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1.

Hmm, the string is \"t17 t59 t53 t66 t76 t29 t14 t20 t66 t91 t14 t77\". \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make things a bit easier because I don't have to worry about more complex structures. The start symbol is S, and from the production rules, S can go to NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So S directly generates pairs of non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t17, t59, etc., so I need to see if each 't' can be derived from a non-terminal. Looking at the NT rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce 't's. For example, NT59 \u2192 t17, NT53 \u2192 t59, etc. So the first step is to see how these 't's can be generated.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string has 12 tokens, but since each production is two non-terminals, the total number of symbols in the generated string should be twice the number of steps from the root. Wait, no\u2014each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. So the length can vary. The string length here is 12 tokens, but I don't know how that relates yet.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nt17, t59, t53, t66, t76, t29, t14, t20, t66, t91, t14, t77.\n\nI think I should start from the start symbol S and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nS can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into the string. Let me see:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t27 or t14 or t30. Wait, looking back, NT30 \u2192 't27', 't53', 't14'. So in the string, the first token is t17, which isn't directly produced by NT30. So if we choose NT30 \u2192 t30, that would give t30, which isn't present in the string. So maybe we need to go deeper.\n\nLet's try expanding NT30. Suppose we pick the rule NT30 \u2192 NT53 (from the production NT30 \u2192 NT53). Wait, looking at the productions, I think I might have misread that. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nThen for NT30: NT30 \u2192 't27', 't53', 't14'\n\nSo nt30 in the string is either t27, t53, or t14. But our string starts with t17, which isn't any of those. Hmm. So maybe the first choice is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the first production might be S \u2192 NT35 NT45, which gives us two other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t17, which could come from NT59 \u2192 t17. So maybe the first part of the string is generated from NT59. But how do we get there? Let me see.\n\nMaybe the string is broken down as a sequence of steps, each step replacing a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language, but since the grammar is small, maybe I can manually try to find a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, think about terminals and non-terminals. Each production is either a terminal or a non-terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals. Therefore, each non-terminal in the derivation must be expanded into the correct sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t17: it comes from NT59 \u2192 t17. So the first part of the string comes from NT59.\n\nTo get t17, we have NT59 \u2192 t17. So the first NT in S's right-hand side must expand to t17.\n\nWait, let's see. The start symbol S can expand to either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. The first alternative is NT30 and NT53. The second is NT35 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t17, it must come from one of these. Let's see if t17 is in any of the non-terminals available.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT59 \u2192 t17. So t17 is produced by NT59. Therefore, if the string starts with t17, it must come from NT59. So one of the non-terminals generated by S must derive to NT59.\n\nLooking back, S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So which of these can produce NT59?\n\nWait, NT59 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. So in S's production, S can produce NT30 and NT53. Or NT35 and NT45.\n\nSo to get NT59, we need to expand one of these into NT59. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: NT30 \u2192 t27, 'nt53', 'nt14'. So if S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then the first non-terminal is NT30, which can derive to t27, nt53, nt14. None of these are NT59, so that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Now, looking at NT35's productions: NT35 can go to NT15 and NT1, or NT15 \u2192 NT1 and NT25, etc. Wait, let me list all the NT35 productions.\n\nActually, looking again: the productions for NT35 are:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to track each symbol step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into two parts, as S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45, each producing two non-terminals which in turn produce the symbols in the string.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t17, which is NT59, perhaps the first part comes from NT59, meaning that one of the NTs in S's expansion is NT59.\n\nWait, but in S \u2192 NT30 NT53, if either of those is NT59, then that would be a problem because NT30 can't directly produce NT59, only t27, t53, t14. Similarly, NT35 can't produce NT59 directly, but let's see what NT35 can produce.\n\nLooking through the production rules for NT35:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n\nSo NT35 can't directly produce NT59. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the string is constructed by expanding S into two non-terminals, each of which must eventually produce parts of the string. So the entire string must be generated by expanding S into two non-terminals, each of which must generate a substring that matches the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to break down the string into two parts, each part corresponding to one of the productions of S.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nOption 1: Assume S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nThen, the string is generated by NT30 and NT53. So the string can be split into two substrings, one from NT30 and one from NT53.\n\nBut the entire string is 12 symbols, so that doesn't directly align since each NT can expand into multiple symbols.\n\nWait, each NT can produce a combination of NTs and terminals. So perhaps the string can be thought of as the concatenation of the strings derived from NT30 and NT53.\n\nBut manually tracking this is complicated. Maybe a better approach is to check for possible conflicts or steps that would make this impossible.\n\nAlternatively, check if the string adheres to the grammar's rules by seeing if each step reduces correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in reverse, using the CYK algorithm approach.\n\nBut since I'm not fully confident, I'll try a step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me start by seeing if the entire string can be produced by S.\n\nThe string: t17 t59 t53 t66 t76 t29 t14 t20 t66 t91 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check each production more carefully.\n\nLooking through all productions, I see NT45 -> t45 is not present. Instead, NT45 is a non-terminal only on the left side of other productions. Wait, no, in the grammar as given, all productions for non-terminals have the right-hand side as two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something? Let me re-examine.\n\nWait no, actually the grammar is given in a specific format. Let me list them properly:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't89'\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't91'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't29'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't59'\n- NT56 -> 't28'\n- NT11 -> 't28'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT32 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT59 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT4 -> 't45'\n- NT46 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't53'\n- NT15 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't33'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n- NT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this by breaking down the string into tokens and seeing if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t45, t33, t80, t17, t12, t29, t38, t45, t90, t32, t14, t10.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t45\n2. t33\n3. t80\n4. t17\n5. t12\n6. t29\n7. t38\n8. t45\n9. t90\n10. t32\n11. t14\n12. t10\n\nNow, I'll try to match these tokens against the possible terminal productions.\n\nFirst token: t45. Looking through the grammar, which production produces t45?\n\nLooking through the list: I see NT56 -> t45. So t45 could come from NT56. Also, NT30 has several productions converting to 't's, such as 't90', 't53', etc.\n\nBut wait, t45 is a terminal, so it must come from a production that has a terminal as its right-hand side. From the list above, the productions that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT56 -> t45\n- NT30 -> t90\n- NT30 -> t53\n- NT30 -> t14\n- NT1 -> t89\n- NT1 also has multiple 't's in its productions, like t10, t4, etc.\n- NT59 -> t17\n- NT9 -> t38\n- NT7 -> t91\n- NT44 -> t76\n- NT4 -> t45\n- NT46 -> t66\n- NT53 -> t91\n- NT9 -> t20\n- NT32 -> t77\n- NT16 -> t31\n- NT15 -> t12\n- NT10 -> t73\n- NT25 -> t29\n- NT4 -> other t's.\n\nSo, t45 can come from several non-terminals:\n\n- NT56 -> t45\n- NT4 -> t45\n- NT53 -> t91, but no, that's not t45. Wait, no, looking again, NT4 -> t45 is a production. So NT4 can produce t45.\n\nSo the first token, t45, can come from either NT56 or NT4.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only place NT56 appears is as NT56 -> t45. Also, looking at the grammar, all non-terminals that have 't' in their productions are only on the left side of the rules, and their right-hand sides are t's, except that they themselves are non-terminals on the left.\n\nWait, no, I think I might be confusing. Let's clarify: the productions are in the form NT -> something, so NT is a non-terminal, and the RHS can be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for NT15, for example, it's productions are to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the first set of productions are S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45, so S is the start symbol, which branches into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking further, I see that NT45 has a production NT45 -> t45, but actually, looking again, I don't see that. Wait, no, from the list above, I don't see any production NT45 -> t45. Instead, looking through all NT45 productions, I only see NT45 as a left-hand side, e.g., S -> NT35 NT45, but not as a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm confused because in the list above, all the productions for non-terminals seem to have two non-terminals on the right side except for some which have 't' as the first symbol, like NT62 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't9', etc.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. For example, NT5 -> NT9 NT43 is a production, but also NT5 has a terminal production?\n\nWait, looking at the list, I think I miswrote some.

I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is in the language it defines. The string is `t14 t38 t17 t31 t20 t76 t53 t24 t24 t53 t40 t14 t20`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The grammar given has S producing different combinations. Each non-terminal seems to be defined recursively, sometimes expanding into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of several terminals: t14, t38, t17, etc. My approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, maybe starting from S and breaking down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me list out the production rules to have them handy:\n\n1.

Starting with S, which can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the beginning is t14, which can come from NT30 (rule 16), because NT30 \u2192 t14. So the first part is S \u2192 NT30 (t14) followed by NT53. Let me see what NT53 can be.\n\nLooking at NT53's productions: it can produce t7, t59, or t91 (rules 20, 23, 30). None of these are t38, so perhaps the other alternative for S is better. Wait, maybe I need to see where else t38 comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT25 NT1 (rule4), and NT25 has a production leading to t29 (rule18). Also, NT1 (rule12) ends with NT10 \u2192 't73' (rule17). But I'm not seeing where t38 comes from. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking again: Does any non-terminal ever produce 't38'? Let me check. Oh, NT15 \u2192 't12' (rule15), but that's a terminal. Wait, no, wait: NT15 has a production rule where it becomes NT25 NT1 (rule4). Then, NT25 is 't29' (rule18), but also, maybe another production.\n\nWait, another possibility: looking at the string, after t14 comes t38. So the first part is t14, which would correspond to NT30, but then the next part would need to be something that starts with NT53, which could be 't7', 't59', or 't91'. But t38 is in the string, which isn't among these.\n\nSo maybe the initial production is the other option for S, which is S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at NT35: according to the rules, it can be NT15 NT1 (rule6) or NT1 NT4 (rule10). Let's see:\n\nIf the string starts with NT35, which would produce something that starts with a terminal. Let's see what NT35 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, for NT35:\n\n- Option1: NT15 NT1. NT15 can be... Let's see: NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25 (rule8), or NT44 NT33 (rule8 again? Wait, rule8 is the production for NT15? Let me check: rule8 says NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25. Hmm. Wait, rule8 is NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25. So to produce NT15, we have to break it further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to figure out a path where I can reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me start by considering the first part of the string: t14 t38 t17 t31 t20 t76 t53 t24 t24 t53 t40 t14 t20.\n\nLet's see the sequence. The first token is t14, which is produced by NT30 (per rule16: NT30 \u2192 't14').\n\nSo that part is covered by NT30. Then, the next is t38, which needs to be the next part. But S's first production for S is either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. If I choose S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the next symbol after 't14' is 't38'. So the NT53 part needs to be 't38', but looking at the rules for NT53, it only produces 't7', 't59', or 't91', which don't include 't38'.\n\nSo this seems problematic. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the other production for S: S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Then, after S, the first symbol is 't14' which can come from NT30. Wait, but S is producing two non-terminals. So perhaps S \u2192 NT35 followed by NT45?\n\nWait no, because each production for S is NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So if S \u2192 NT35 NT45, the string starts with T35 followed by T45, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT30 NT53 (first option). So the string starts with 't14' from NT30, which is allowed. The next part is NT53, which needs to produce 't38', but NT53 only produces 't7', 't59', 't91'. So this is a problem. So perhaps the first part is S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSo let's see: S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Then, the first part is NT35, which needs to produce the first symbol 't14'. But looking at NT35's productions: NT35 can be made via NT15 NT1 (rule6) or NT1 NT4 (rule10).\n\nLet's explore both options.\n\nFirst, NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. Then, we break down NT15 and NT1.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25 (rule8). So, after NT15, we get NT1, then NT25.\n\nNT1 can produce 't10' (rule12: NT1 \u2192 't10'), and NT25 \u2192 't29' (rule18). So the expansion is 't10' and 't29'. But the string starts with 't14', which is not 't10' or '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-243","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I need to check is `t66 t31 t53 t72 t14 t24 t76 t28 t27 t32 t38 t17 t40`. \n\nHmm, the first thing I notice is that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals. I think I should start by building a parse tree from the given string to see if it can be derived using the grammar rules. Let me list the production rules first to get a clear picture.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, and the initial productions are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, S must produce two non-terminals: either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. That means the string generated by S must consist of two parts, each corresponding to one of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 13 tokens, so it's a sequence of 13 terminals. Let's see if it can be split into two parts, maybe the first part corresponds to NT30 and the second to NT53, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but NT30 and NT53 are both non-terminals, and each of them can produce other non-terminals. Let me check how they proceed.\n\nStarting with NT30. According to the rules:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo, NT30 can directly produce terminals like 't90', 't53', etc. But since the string starts with 't66', which doesn't match any of these, perhaps NT30 isn't the starting point here. Wait, but S starts with either NT30 or NT35. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nSo, the first part would be NT30, which needs to derive 't66', but looking at NT30's productions, none produce 't66'. So this split might not work. \n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the first part is NT35 and the second is NT45. Let's see if NT35 can produce 't66'.\n\nLooking at NT35's rules:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n\nSo, NT35 is a bit tricky. It could lead to NT15 NT1 or NT1 NT4. Let me explore NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. Then, NT15 has options:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n\nHmm, this could get complicated. Alternatively, NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4. Let's see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 't45' or NT5 \u2192 't9', etc.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Let me approach this differently. Maybe I should parse the string from the end, using reverse engineering. Starting from the last token, 't40', and see if it can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, which terminals are produced by which non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't66'\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n- NT15 \u2192 't12' or 't38'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT9 \u2192 't38'\n- NT32 \u2192 't77' (but 't77' isn't in the string)\n- etc.\n\nWait, our string ends with 't40'. Let me look for where 't40' comes from. Checking the rules, I don't see any production directly leading to 't40'. So maybe I should look for a non-terminal that produces 't40' indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't40' comes from NT4 \u2192 't45' or other rules. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at all productions, none seem to produce 't40' directly. That might mean that 't40' is part of a longer chain.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that 't40' is the result of a non-terminal that eventually resolves to it. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't40'. So maybe 't40' comes from a chain where the non-terminal produces other non-terminals, which in turn produce 't40'. But that would require that non-terminal to be part of a longer derivation, which seems unlikely since 't40' is a terminal in the string but not directly produced by any rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again to see if any non-terminals produce 't40'. Scanning through:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't89' or 't73' or 't10' or 't32' or 't7' (no)\n- NT53 \u2192 't7' or other 't's, but not 't40'\n- NT46 \u2192 't66'\n- NT53 \u2192 't59' (no)\n- NT56 \u2192 't28'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29' or 't27' (no)\n- NT43 \u2192 't40', oh wait! NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nYes! So NT43 directly produces 't40'. So in the string, the last token is 't40', which must come from NT43. Now, I need to check if the preceding tokens can form a sequence that leads to NT43.\n\nBut looking at the string, before 't40' is 't17'. So the token before that is 't17' followed by 't40'. Let me see if 't17' can be the result of a production that eventually leads to NT43.\n\nLooking at NT59's rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT17\n- NT9 \u2192 NT59 etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me check NT17.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't17'. Wait, NT17 isn't a non-terminal; 't17' is a terminal. So maybe 't17' is a result of NT59 \u2192 NT17. Or wait, checking NT59's rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT17 (so NT59 produces 't17' when it resolves to a terminal)\n- NT59 can also produce NT9 and NT17? Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT17 is one of the productions, but isn't that correct?\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me list NT59's productions:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT17\n- NT59 \u2192 NT53\n\nHmm, so NT59 can produce NT17 or NT53. When resolving, NT17 is a terminal ('t17'), and NT53 is a non-terminal.\n\nSo if NT59 \u2192 NT17, then the string would have 't17' as a token. That would link 't17' to NT59.\n\nSo in the string, before 't40' is 't17', so perhaps the sequence 't17 t40' corresponds to NT59 \u2192 NT17 (which is 't17') and then NT59 \u2192 NT43? Wait, no, because NT59 is producing 't17' and then we need to get to 't40'. So maybe the entire path from 't17' to 't40' goes through NT59.\n\nBut wait, 't17' is produced by NT59, and 't40' is produced by NT43. So the path would be NT59 \u2192 't17', then another step to 't40'? But NT59 can only go to NT17 or NT53. So if NT59 \u2192 NT53, then NT53 could produce 't40' only if there's a rule for that. But looking at NT53's rules, they all produce terminals or other non-terminals. None of them directly produce 't40'. \n\nWait, that's a problem. So 't40' must come from NT43, which requires that the production leading to it is a non-terminal that eventually produces 't40'. So, maybe in the parse tree, the last part is NT43.\n\nSo maybe the last two tokens are 't17' (from NT59) and 't40' (from NT43).

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it makes parsing a bit easier, but I'm not sure if that really helps here. The string to evaluate is: `t89 t33 t89 t29 t53 t80 t12 t59 t32 t7 t90 t10 t17 t90`. \n\nFirst, I think I should parse this string token by token using the rules provided. Each rule in the grammar allows a non-terminal to split into two other non-terminals, and eventually, these non-terminals will resolve into terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two production rules:\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the string starts with t89, which is a terminal symbol. Let's see which production rule would produce t89. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT30 can produce t53, t90, t27, t30, etc. Specifically, rule 13 says NT30 -> t90, which is not t89.\nRule 15: NT30 -> t27, rule 16: NT30 -> t14, rule 17: NT30 could produce other things like t19.

Looking at the provided grammar rules, the NT30 entries are:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n\nHmm, so none of the rules for NT30 directly produce t89. So the first part of the string starts with t89, which must come from another non-terminal. Maybe I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t89.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT1 -> 't89' (rule 14)\n- NT53 -> 't7' (rule19), but wait, no, in the rules, NT30 has t90, t53, t14, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions (last set before 't7' etc):\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- S rules, then NT43, NT15, NT45, etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all terminal symbols from all rules.\n\nLooking through all rules, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt90 (from NT30), t53 (NT30), t14 (NT30), t7 (NT53), t1 (NT1), t25 (NT25), t32 (NT32), t77 (NT32), t38 (NT9 and NT15), t45 (NT56), t66 (NT46), t80 (NT43), t79 (NT4?), wait no, let's list all the terminals:\n\nWait, from the grammar:\n\nNT43-> NT53 NT11: but NT53 can be t7, and NT11 is, looking at the terminals, does NT11 ever resolve to anything else? Looking through all rules, I don't see NT11 having a terminal. Wait, let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal eventually resolves to some terminals:\n\n- NT30: t90, t53, t14\n- NT35: t15, t45?\nWait, no, NT35 can produce NT15 and NT1, and NT1 is t10, etc. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track what each non-terminal resolves to in terms of the string.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t89, t33, t89, t29, t53, t80, t12, t59, t32, t7, t90, t10, t17, t90.\n\nFirst, the first token is t89, which comes from NT1 (rule 14). So, in the parse, S must split into something that includes NT1. Looking at the S rules: S can split into NT30 | NT35 and NT45.\n\nWait, but S can be split into two parts, so maybe it's better to try to parse the string step by step, considering possible splits.\n\nStart with t89: comes from NT1. So, in the parse tree, the first part must be NT1.\n\nLooking at how NT1 is produced: From the rules, looking for NT1 -> ...:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the relevant rule is line 37: NT1 -> 't89' (rule 14), which is a single production. Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nRule 14: NT1 -> 't10' but no, wait, wait, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through each line, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- Line 37: NT1 -> 't10' (rule 46)\n- Line 14: Not sure. Wait, maybe I'm mixing line numbers. Let me look at all NT1 entries.\n\nWait, in the grammar, how many rules for NT1 do we have? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- Line 37: NT1 -> 't89' (probably line 8, I'm counting mentally, but I think it's in there)\nWait, no, let me list all rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production rules for NT1 are:\n\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25 (line 15?)\nWait, maybe I'm getting too confused. Let's check again.\n\nActually, the user provided the grammar as follows:\n\nThe grammar is a list of lines, each line representing a production rule. Each production is of the form A -> B C, except for the terminals which are just written as A -> 'tX'.\n\nSo, each line is of the form A B C or A -> 'tX'.\n\nSo, the grammar starts with S -> NT30 NT53 (line 1?), S-> NT35 NT45 (line 2?), and so on.\n\nThe NT1 productions are:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- Line 15: NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\n- Line 26: NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n\n- Line 40: NT1 -> 't10'\n\n- Line 41: NT33 -> NT7 -> 't28' (is this NT1?) No, this is from NT33, which is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, line 26 says NT1 -> NT10 NT4; line 40 says NT1 -> 't10'.\n\nSo NT1 can either split into NT10 and NT4 or directly into 't10'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the start is t89, which comes from NT1, and the rule is NT1 -> 't89', so that's why we look at NT1 in that way.\n\nBut in the initial S rule, S splits into NT30 and NT53. So S can't directly produce t89 because the first production would involve two non-terminals, but t89 is a single token. So perhaps the parse tree will be broken in such a way that the S production will produce parts that include t89.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself here. Let me approach this differently.\n\nThe string starts with t89, which is a terminal. Let me see which non-terminals can produce t89. From the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 can produce t89. So in the parse tree, the first part must come from NT1 -> 't89'.\n\nNow, let's look at the string again: t89 t33 t89 t29 t53 t80 t12 t59 t32 t7 t90 t10 t17 t90.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals. The first t89 comes from NT1, which via the rule is t89. So in the parse tree, S must expand into something that includes NT1 as the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the S rules: S can expand into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nSo after S expands, it's NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t89, which is from NT1, but in the S rule, S isn't NT1; it's NT30 and NT53. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the parse tree is such that NT30 or NT53 can derive a token that leads into NT1.\n\nWait, no, because S is the start symbol and expands first. So S must expand into two non-terminals, the first of which must derive into t89 or the second must.

{"custom_id":"request-259","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes things a bit easier because I know each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. The string to evaluate is `t73 t53 t7 t59 t33 t80 t66 t12 t10 t38 t20 t10 t27 t76`. \n\nFirst, I should remember how CNF works. Each production has two non-terminals on the right side, except for the terminals. Since the string consists of terminals (all the 't' followed by numbers), the approach is to see if I can break down the string into sequences of these productions. Essentially, each production corresponds to a pair of non-terminals, and I need to see if the entire string can be derived by expanding these step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. The only productions from S are `S \u2192 NT30 NT53` and `S \u2192 NT35 NT45`. So, from S, I can expand into either the concatenation of NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45.\n\nThe string starts with 't73', which is a terminal. So I need to see which NT production ends with 't73'. Looking at the rules for NT:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't73', so if I have NT30, it directly becomes 't73'.\n- NT10 \u2192 't73' as well. Wait, but NT10 appears in the string later as 't73' is 't73' in position 1, and later there's 't73' again as the third element. Let me check all NT rules.\n\nWait, the NT10 rule is not in the first set. Looking back, the NT10 \u2192 't73'. So NT10 can derive 't73'.\n\nNow, the string starts with NT30. So the first part is 't73' from NT30. Now, what's before NT30? Actually, since S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the string is the concatenation of NT30 production and NT53 production.\n\nWait, no, the string is a linear sequence, so it's the concatenation of the two parts produced by each NT. So NT30 and NT53 each produce a string, and the entire string is their concatenation.\n\nLooking at the string `t73 t53 t7 t59 t33 t80 t66 t12 t10 t38 t20 t10 t27 t76`.\n\nSo, after 't73' from NT30, the next part is 't53', which is from NT53? Wait, NT53's productions would produce 't59' or other terminals, but in the string, after 't73' comes 't53', then 't7' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the hierarchy. Let's take S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So the entire string should be NT30's derivation followed by NT53's derivation.\n\nSo first, NT30 should produce a string, and then NT53 should produce another string, concatenated together.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't73', which is from NT30. So that's the first part. Then the second part of NT53's derivation would start with the next token, which is 't53'. So 't53' must be the first symbol of NT53's production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT53 has several productions. Let's list them:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1, which becomes 't66' 't7'. But 't53' is a terminal. So in the productions, NT53 can only go to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT53's rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 \u2192 would expand to 't66' 't7'\n- NT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5 \u2192 but NT5 isn't in the grammar; wait, NT5 isn't listed as a rule. Maybe I need to check all rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT53 has several productions:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1: \u2192 't66' 't7'\n- NT53 \u2192 NT7 NT9: Wait, I see NT7 \u2192 't91' and NT9 \u2192 't38', so NT53 can go to NT7 NT9, which would be 't91' 't38'\n- NT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5: but NT5 isn't in the rules. Wait, in the original grammar, NT5 isn't present except in the very first set where S has some rules.

The rules as given are:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5 (Line 14)\nBut looking through the rules, I don't see any NT5. It seems NT5 isn't present except in S's initial rules as S-> NT35 NT45, which uses NT35, NT45.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me verify.

Since the grammar is given, I need to see if I can split the string into the correct non-terminal symbols that can derive down to the terminals.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string more clearly:\n\nt28, t10, t77, t33, t80, t17, t91, t73, t24, t20, t40, t59, t59, t33, t80\n\nI'll try to group these into possible non-terminals starting from the rightmost symbols because in the parse tree, leaves go from left to right, and non-terminals are built up from the leaves.\n\nLooking at the last symbol, t80, I check the grammar to see which non-terminals have production rules that can end with t80. Let's see, NT59 \u2192 t17 and t91, and NT9 \u2192 t38. But t80 doesn't appear as a terminal in any rule directly. Wait, but in the grammar, some non-terminals do derive into terminal strings. So, I need to see if any rule produces t80. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t40, so that's a direct production. But t40 is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the rules are in terms of non-terminals. Let me list all the terminal symbols in the grammar. The terminals are 't28', 't10', 't77', 't33', 't80', 't17', 't91', 't73', 't24', 't20', 't40', 't59', 't9', 't45', 't66', 't31'.\n\nSo, for example, NT40 \u2192 t40, so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT59 \u2192 t59, which is a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT17, NT91 \u2192 which can produce t17 and t91, so that might be relevant. Similarly, NT59 can also produce NT17 and NT91, but that's two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the string in reverse to see if it can be generated. Sometimes parsing an ambiguous grammar can be tricky, but since it's in CNF, there might be a unique way to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to think recursively. The first symbol in the input is t28. So, what non-terminal rules produce t28? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56 \u2192 possibly relevant if t32 or t56 is involved.\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT44 \u2192 NT45 NT33 (since NT44 \u2192 NT45 NT33)\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT9 \u2192 NT20 NT43\n- NT43 \u2192 NT40 T something?\n- And looking at the terminals, I see t28 appears in a few places, but as a terminal, not as a rule for a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up each symbol in the string and see if they can be part of the right sentential forms.\n\nWait, the string starts with t28, which is a terminal symbol. So that must come from a rule that has all terminals as the second symbols in a production. But in the grammar provided, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is directly replaced by t28. Let me check all the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\nNT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\nNT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nNT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\nNT16 \u2192 't72'\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\nNT10 \u2192 't73'\nNT25 \u2192 't29'\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't59'\nNT56 \u2192 't45'\nNT11 \u2192 't28'\nNT59 \u2192 't17'\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\nNT1 \u2192 't10'\nNT59 \u2192 't28'\nNT15 \u2192 't12'\nNT10 \u2192 't32'\nNT44 \u2192 't76'\nNT4 \u2192 't45'\nNT46 \u2192 't66'\nNT53 \u2192 't91'\nNT9 \u2192 't38'\nNT4 \u2192 't53'\nNT15 \u2192 't38'\nNT4 \u2192 't33'\nNT59 \u2192 't24'\nNT9 \u2192 't20'\nNT53 \u2192 't80'\n\nAh, here we go. NT11 \u2192 't28' is a rule. So the first symbol t28 must come from NT11. Therefore, the leftmost symbol t28 is generated by NT11. So, we can replace t28 with NT11.\n\nNext, the string after replacing t28 with NT11 is: NT11, t10, t77, t33, t80, t17, t91, t73, t24, t20, t40, t59, t59, t33, t80.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t10. So, let's see which non-terminals produce t10. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\n- NT30 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo, NT1 can produce t10 directly as well as via other routes. Alternatively, NT30 can directly produce 't10'. So, I've got a choice here between NT1 and NT30 for generating t10.\n\nBut since we're parsing from left to right, and we've just consumed t10 and replaced it with NT11 and possibly NT30, let's see. Wait, no, actually, after the replacement of t28 as NT11, the next step is to parse t10, which is the next symbol. So, t10 could be generated by NT1 or NT30.\n\nBut in this context, since we're dealing with a leftmost derivation, meaning we expand the leftmost non-terminal first, I think we should consider expanding NT11 first, but NT11's production is NT11 \u2192 NT53 NT11. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the production is NT11 \u2192 NT53 NT11. No, actually, looking back, the production is NT11 \u2192 NT53 NT11 is not correct.

{"custom_id":"request-286","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because it makes parsing easier, and we can possibly use algorithms like CYK for parsing, but since I'm not doing actual parsing here, I'll try a different approach.\n\nThe string to check is: `t14 t90 t45 t10 t27 t7 t77 t27 t27 t29 t38 t32 t38 t20 t53`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So any valid string derived from S must start with either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLet's break down the given string into tokens: t14, t90, t45, t10, t27, t7, t77, t27, t27, t29, t38, t32, t38, t20, t53.\n\nI'll check each token to see if it's a terminal that can be directly derived from a terminal production. Let's scan the rules to see which terminal productions exist.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t14, t90, t53\nNT35 \u2192 t15 (but t15 is further broken down), t1 (which is further broken down)\nWait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't14', 't53' \u2014 so NT30 can produce these terminals directly.\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1 \u2014 so it's not terminal yet.\nSimilarly, other NT productions are to other non-terminals except for some that have terminals, but I need to see if the entire string can be broken down into the initial productions.\n\nWait, let me go through the given string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t14. Looking at the grammar, NT30 can produce t14, so that's good. So the first part of the string is derived from NT30.\n\nSo after t14, we have t90. So the next token is t90. NT30 can also produce t90, so that's fine. So the first two tokens (t14, t90) are produced by NT30, which is part of the S's production.\n\nNext is t45. Looking at S \u2192 NT35 NT45 or S \u2192 NT30 NT53. We're past the first NT, which is NT30 now. Wait, S is NT30 NT53, so after the first NT30, the next should be NT53. But the string has t45 next, which is the third token. Wait, no, let's clarify.\n\nWait, the string is t14 t90 t45 t10... So let's think in terms of the NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string recursively, splitting into the leftmost non-terminal and matching the productions.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be derived.\n\nThe string is: t14 t90 t45 t10 t27 t7 t77 t27 t27 t29 t38 t32 t38 t20 t53.\n\nFirst, S can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the first t14, which comes from NT30. So S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nSo the first two symbols after S are t14 and t90, which match NT30's possible terminals. So after S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the string starts with t14 t90.\n\nNext, after t14 and t90, we have t45. Since S is NT30 NT53, after NT30, the next part is NT53. So after t14 t90 (from NT30), the next symbol is t45, which should come from NT53.\n\nLooking at NT53 productions: NT53 \u2192 t7, t77, t79?

But wait, S is NT30 NT53, so after NT30 (t14 t90), the next part should be NT53, which must produce t45.\n\nBut looking at NT53's productions, the terminals are 't7', 't77', etc., not t45. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because of the variable names. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is: t14 t90 t45 t10 t27 t7 t77 t27 t27 t29 t38 t32 t38 t20 t53.\n\nSo, after t14 t90 (from NT30), the next token is t45, which should come from NT53. But in the given grammar, NT53 can produce 't7', 't77', etc., but not t45. That's a problem because the next token is t45, which can't be produced by NT53.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nThe user listed:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5\nNT53 \u2192 't7'\nNT53 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo no, NT53 doesn't have a production that directly produces t45. That suggests that the fourth token, t45, can't come from NT53. So perhaps the initial assumption that the string starts with NT30 is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with a different production. Let me check the other S production: S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSo perhaps before looking at the string, I should check if both possible S derivations could be a fit.\n\nLet me try each possible S production.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nStarts with t14 (NT30's t14), then t90 (NT30's t90).

Wait, no, actually, in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow that because each rule starts with a non-terminal followed by two non-terminals or a terminal sometimes, depending on the arrows\u2014actually, looking at it, it's more like each rule has two non-terminals on the left side of the arrow, but with a mix of two non-terminals and a terminal on the right. Wait, no, no\u2014the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side has two non-terminals or one terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53\u2014so two non-terminals on the right. Hmm. Wait, but that can't be in CNF because in CNF, productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where BC are two non-terminals and a is a terminal. So having two non-terminals on the right doesn't fit\u2014unless all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right. Wait, let me check that. Maybe the grammar is actually in a form where each production is of the form NT \u2192 some non-terminals or perhaps the strings can also have terminals as options. Maybe it's a mix, which would complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the grammar is in a form where each step can reduce two symbols at a time, but it's not strictly CNF. Alternatively, perhaps each production only has one non-terminal on the left, and the right side can have either two non-terminals or a combination of non-terminals and terminals. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps it's okay because the parsing will account for the terminals as well.\n\nOkay, moving on. The string to evaluate is: t28 t31 t53 t89 t17 t28 t45 t7 t24 t45 t12 t76 t73 t53 t20 t76.\n\nSo, 16 elements in the string. Let me list them: t28, t31, t53, t89, t17, t28, t45, t7, t24, t45, t12, t76, t73, t53, t20, t76.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do that, I'll try to build the parse tree step by step, starting with the start symbol S and seeing if I can reach the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Let's see if the string starts with the symbols that can come from this production.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first element is t28. So we need to see if t28 can be the first symbol produced by any of the possible productions of NT30 or NT35.\n\nLooking at the NT30 productions: The rules for NT30 include:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nAlso, in the string, there's a t28 in the fifth position, so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the entire string is: t28, t31, t53, t89, t17, t28, t45, t7, t24, t45, t12, t76, t73, t53, t20, t76.\n\nHmm. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t28. So perhaps the first production is NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, which ends with a 't1' or some terminal. But that's not matching t28. Alternatively, maybe the first production is NT30 \u2192 t28? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT30 has rules leading to t90, t53, t14, and also NT30 can be replaced by other non-terminals. But wait, in the grammar, for example, NT30 \u2192 't90', which is a terminal, so that's an option. Similarly, NT30 \u2192 't53', which is another terminal. Also, NT30 \u2192 't14', another terminal, and also NT30 \u2192 NT25, which is a non-terminal. So if the start symbol S produces NT30 NT53, then the first two symbols would be NT30 and NT53. But if NT30 is replaced by 't90', 't53', or 't14', or another non-terminal like NT25, then perhaps the parsing can proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible derivations.\n\nLet's list all the productions and terminals available, and see if I can map the string to the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\n1: t28\n2: t31\n3: t53\n4: t89\n5: t17\n6: t28\n7: t45\n8: t7\n9: t24\n10: t45\n11: t12\n12: t76\n13: t73\n14: t53\n15: t20\n16: t76\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nSo after S, we have NT30 and NT53.\n\nNow, let's look at NT30. NT30 can be replaced by 't90', 't53', 't14', or NT25.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 can be replaced by 't7', 't59', 't1', or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t28, which isn't among the direct terminals of NT30 or NT53.\n\nSo maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Let's explore that.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT35 NT45, then the first two symbols would be NT35 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT35's rules: NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT33, NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT1, etc.\n\nBut again, the first symbol is t28, so NT35 must produce t28 as one of its possible terminals. Looking at NT35's rules, I don't see any terminal 't28' directly. So that might not work.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the production starts with a non-terminal that can expand into t28. Let's look for a non-terminal that can derive t28 as a terminal. Looking at the production rules, many non-terminals like NT15, NT53, etc., produce terminals, but I don't see t28 directly as a terminal in any rule.\n\nWait, let me check again: the grammar defines several NT rules with terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT12, which could be 't12', which is in the string (position 11: t12). But t28 isn't directly listed as a terminal in any NT production except perhaps somewhere.\n\nWait, looking back, in the NT productions:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT12 (so possible 't12')\nNT10 \u2192 't73'\nNT25 \u2192 't29'\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't59'\nNT56 \u2192 't45'\nNT59 \u2192 't17'\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\nNT59 \u2192 't59' (also other rules, but some are terminals?)\nWait, actually, it's more like each production for NTX can either produce a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar notation. For instance, NT30 \u2192 't90' is a production where NT30 derives to the terminal t90. Similarly, NT30 \u2192 't53' is another production. So looking for 't28', is there any NT rule that produces 't28'?\n\nLooking through, it seems that 't28' is not a terminal in any of the NT rules. Because in the grammar, 't28' doesn't appear as a terminal on the right-hand side of any rule. So if the string includes 't28', that would imply that some non-terminal must directly produce 't28'.\n\nBut checking all the NT rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't28'.

{"custom_id":"request-294","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules that rewrite non-terminals (NT) into other non-terminals or terminals ('t' followed by numbers). The goal is to parse the string using this grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. That simplifies the parsing process because each rule produces exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, either both non-terminals (indicating a two-step expansion) or a single terminal (indicating a terminal symbol in the string).\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t17 t12 t89 t72 t24 t66 t10 t73 t72 t59 t24 t73 t91 t24 t7 t12`. It's a sequence of terminals, so the parser will need to match these tokens in sequence by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parsing can be done using a method like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for such grammars. The CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell represents whether a particular substring can be derived from a particular non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can use recursive parsing or top-down backtracking with memoization. However, given the complexity of the grammar and the string, a table-based approach like CYK might be more manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps I'll follow:\n\n1. **Tokenize the String**: The string is already split into individual terminal symbols, so the tokens are: t17, t12, t89, t72, t24, t66, t10, t73, t72, t59, t24, t73, t91, t24, t7, t12.\n\n2. **Identify Non-terminals and Terminals**: In the grammar provided, the left-hand sides (LHS) of the production rules are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of non-terminals or terminals. Looking through the productions, the non-terminals are: S, NT43, NT15, NT45, NT35, NT25, NT15, NT53, NT33, NT1, NT62, NT5, NT30, NT30, NT30, NT10, NT25, NT43, NT53, NT56, NT11, NT59, NT32, NT1, NT59, NT15, NT10, NT44, NT4, NT46, NT53, NT9, NT4, NT15, NT4, NT59, NT9, NT53. Wait, some of these may be typos, but generally, any symbol that's not a 't' is a non-terminal.\n\n3. **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**: Every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each production has exactly one non-terminal on the LHS and exactly two symbols on the RHS. The RHS can be two non-terminals, or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals. However, in CNF, the RHS can only consist of terminals, but in this case, it seems some productions might not strictly follow CNF because some RHS have two terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, some productions have two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT30. Yes, that's two non-terminals. So all productions are either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, as required by CNF.\n\n4. **Building theCYK Table**: The CYK algorithm processes the string by filling a table where each cell [i][j] represents the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring from position i to j.\n\n   a. **Initialization**: For each terminal symbol in the string, if there's a production A \u2192 a, then the non-terminal A can generate just that terminal a. So, for each i, if the ith symbol is a terminal, check which non-terminals have a production to that terminal.\n\n   b. **Filling the Table**: For each substring of length 2 or more, determine if there's a non-terminal A that can produce that substring by combining two smaller substrings.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long (16 symbols). That might be tedious manually, but let me try to see if I can spot any patterns or find specific rules that could help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can start from the top-level symbol S and see if I can derive the entire string by recursively expanding each symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level non-terminals are S, which branches into two parts: either NT30 NT30, NT35 NT45, etc. So the string is generated by starting from S and expanding each part.\n\nLet's look at the string. The first symbol is t17. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t17.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's collect all production rules that have a terminal on the RHS:\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 t17 (twice)\nNT9 \u2192 t38\nNT44 \u2192 t76 (I see two NT44 productions, maybe it's a typo)\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe productions with terminals are:\n\nNT59 \u2192 t17\nNT59 \u2192 t28\nNT9 \u2192 t38\nNT44 \u2192 t76 (appears twice)\nNT4 \u2192 t45\nNT46 \u2192 t66\nNT53 \u2192 t91\nNT15 \u2192 t12\nNT10 \u2192 t73\nNT25 \u2192 t29\nNT43 \u2192 t40\nNT53 \u2192 t59 (appears multiple times)\nNT30 \u2192 t14 (multiple times)\nNT1 \u2192 t89, t10, t4\nNT53 \u2192 t7 (multiple times)\nNT7 \u2192 t91\nNT56 \u2192 t45\nNT11 \u2192 t28\nNT59 \u2192 t17, t28\nNT15 \u2192 t12\nNT10 \u2192 t32\nNT44 \u2192 t76\nNT4 \u2192 t45, t53\nNT46 \u2192 t66\nNT53 \u2192 t91\nNT9 \u2192 t38\nNT4 \u2192 t53\nNT15 \u2192 t38\nNT4 \u2192 t33\nNT59 \u2192 t24, t28, t7\n\nWait, I think the productions are:\n\nLooking again, for terminals:\n\nNT59 \u2192 t17\nNT59 \u2192 t28\nNT30 \u2192 t14\nNT1 \u2192 t89\nNT1 \u2192 t10\nNT1 \u2192 t4\nNT53 \u2192 t7\nNT7 \u2192 t91\nNT56 \u2192 t45\nNT11 \u2192 t28\nNT59 \u2192 t17\nNT59 \u2192 t28\nNT15 \u2192 t12\nNT10 \u2192 t32\nNT44 \u2192 t76\nNT4 \u2192 t45\nNT46 \u2192 t66\nNT53 \u2192 t59\nNT9 \u2192 t38\nNT4 \u2192 t53\nNT15 \u2192 t38\nNT4 \u2192 t33\nNT59 \u2192 t24\nNT9 \u2192 t20\nNT53 \u2192 t80\nNT16 \u2192 t31\n\nSo NT59 can produce t17, t24, t28.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t17. So, the first symbol must come from NT59 \u2192 t17. So the first part of the string starts with NT59.\n\nNow, looking at the first two symbols: t17 and t12.\n\nWait, the first part is t17, t12, t89, etc. So maybe the first NT59 expands into something that includes t17 and t12.\n\nBut NT59 produces t17, t28, or t24. t17 and t12 don't match those, so perhaps the first NT59 is the start of a production that produces a larger substring.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The entire string must be generated by a series of expansions starting from S, which splits into two parts of two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t17.

I notice that the start symbol is S, which can derive into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string must start with either NT30 or NT35 followed by NT53 or NT45. Let's check the string: it starts with t66, but I don't see any transitions from S directly to t66. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The NT symbols might be derived into terminal strings. Let me check the production rules. Looking through the rules, many of the NT productions end up being terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't38', NT5 -> 't9', etc. So perhaps the NTs are expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nLet me start breaking down the string. It might help to parse it using the grammar. The string is a sequence of 17 tokens, all of which are terminals. So I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nStarting with S, it must expand into two NT symbols: either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT30 NT53\n- NT30 then needs to produce some part of the string. Let's see what NT30 can do. Looking through the rules, NT30 can be t90, t53, t27, t30. But in the string, the first token is t66, which isn't any of these. So maybe this path is wrong.\n\nCase 2: S -> NT35 NT45\n- NT35 can produce t15, t1, t4, etc. Similarly, NT45 can produce t59, t9, t28, etc. Let me look at the first part of the string. The first token is t66. Wait, but neither NT35 nor NT45 directly produce t66. So perhaps the parse tree is deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe S directly produces a terminal, but no, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are binary, so S would have to derive to two NTs. So perhaps the initial expansion doesn't produce t66 directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. The NTs like NT30, NT35, etc., might derive into sequences that include t66 and others. Let me see if any of the NTs can produce a combination that includes t66.\n\nLooking at the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT5 -> 't9'\n- NT15 -> 't1' or 't12' or 't44' and so on. None of these seem to produce t66.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that some NTs derive into another NT which eventually produces t66. Let's check all NTs to see if any can derive into a production that includes t66.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t66. Hmm, I don't see any NT directly going to t66. But perhaps in the rules, there's an NT that can produce a t66 through multiple expansions. For example, maybe NT16 -> 't31' or so. Wait, let's check all productions:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nI see that NT16 -> 't31', and NT30 -> 't27', etc. Wait, perhaps one of the NTs is derived into a chain that builds up the sequence, ending in t66.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NTs can derive into sequences that form the required tokens. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t66 t24 t73 t17 t24 t24 t53 t53 t7 t77 t32 t90 t59 t12 t45 t90 t80\n\nThat's 17 tokens.

Let's try each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT30 NT53\n\nSo NT30 must derive into a sequence that starts with t66. But looking at the rules for NT30:\n\nNT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't27', or 't30'. None of these are t66, so this path might not be possible unless NT30 can expand further into more NTs. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form allows exactly two symbols per production, so NT30 can only be expanded into two NTs, not into terminals directly unless one of its productions includes a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initialNT30 expands into other NTs that in turn produce more NTs until reaching terminals. Let me see if any path starting with NT30 can produce t66. But looking at the rules, NT30 only goes to terminals like t90, t53, t27, t30, which don't include t66.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through all NTs to see which produce t66. Wait, maybe NT16 -> 't31', NT59 -> 't28', NT53 -> 't91', etc. I don't see any NTs that directly produce t66, which suggests that t66 is not in the language.

Or maybe another path)\n\nWait, looking carefully, I just noticed that NT30 has a production: NT30 -> 't30', which might be 't30', but t30 isn't in the string. So I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Some NTs seem to have multiple production options, some of which are terminals, others that produce more NTs. For example, NT30 can expand into 't30', which is probably 't30'. But in the string, the tokens are t66 t24 t73 etc. So if none of the NTs directly produce t66, then t66 can't be part of the language.\n\nWait, but perhaps the NTs can be expanded into sequences that include t66. For example, maybe some NT produces a chain that leads to t66 through multiple expansions. Let me check all possible expansion paths.\n\nLooking deeper into the NT53 production, I see that NT53 -> 't53' and also has production NT53-> 't46'NT1.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal, or a single non-terminal producing two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which has two main productions:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the first step is to generate all possible derivations from S. Each production then breaks down into more non-terminals until we reach the terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be generated by expanding S through these rules. Let's try to build the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's take both paths and see if any can lead to the string.\n\nFirst path: S -> NT30 NT53\n- NT30 can produce 't53', 't90', or 't27' as per the rules. The string starts with 't59', which isn't any of these, so this path might not work. Let me note that and check the second production.\n\nSecond production: S -> NT35 NT45\n- Let's see what NT35 and NT45 can produce. \n\nLooking at NT35's productions:\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1 and NT33 NT1, based on the grammar. Hmm, but the string starts with 't59'. Wait, maybe I picked the wrong path. Let me backtrack.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider a different path entirely. Let me make a tree.\n\nThe string starts with 't59', so I need to find a non-terminal that leads to 't59' as a terminal. Looking at the productions, I see NT59 in a few places:\n\n- NT59 -> NT45 NT28\nBut that's in another part. Wait, looking at the grammar provided, I don't see 't59' as a terminal directly. Instead, I see NT59 -> NT45 NT28. But 't59' is mentioned in the last rule, `NT59 -> 't59'...` Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT59 are:\n\n- NT59 -> NT17\n- NT59 -> NT28\n\nWait no, actually looking closely, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar rules provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that several NTs have rules leading to other NTs or terminals. For example, NT59 -> 't59' or something? Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT59 -> NT17\n- NT59 -> NT28\n\nWait, but none explicitly show 't59' as a terminal. Hmm, but earlier the user mentioned that the grammar has certain rules where, for example, NT11 -> 't28'. Maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, there are multiple entries where NT... lead to a terminal like 't7', 't9', etc. But I don't see 't59' as a terminal directly. But looking at the user's last part of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 -> 't59' is not present. Instead, NT59-> NT17 and NT59-> NT28. Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list provided by the user:\n\nThe grammar rules are listed as:\n\nNT> productions, with some terminal outputs. For example:\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't27'\n...\nLooking at the user's grammar, let's parse each rule:\n\n- NT30 can produce 't53', 't90', or 't27'.\n- NT7 produces 't91'.\n- NT5 -> 't9' and 't43'.\n- Wait, this might take a while to parse all the rules, but I need to find which non-terminals lead to 't59' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me scan through the provided rules.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't72' (Wait, that's t72, not 59)\n- NT35 -> 't45' (Wait, no, earlier rules show, for example, S->NT35 NT45, and then looking at the NT35-> NT15 NT1... but that's internal. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to check all the NT productions for a rule that results in 't59' as a terminal. Let's list all the NTs that have terminal rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> 't7' (in the user's list)\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT59 -> (does NT59 have a terminal? From the list, I see NT53 -> NT... but not 't59'. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided by the user:\n\nHere are some specific cases:\n\n- NT9 -> 't38' (Yes, so 't38' comes from NT9)\n- NT53 -> 't7' (Yes, 't7' from NT53)\n- NT7 -> 't91' (Yes, 't91' from NT7)\n- NT5 -> 't9' and 't43' (yes)\n- NT44 -> 't76' (yes)\n- NT4 -> 't45' (yes)\n- NT15 -> 't12' (yes)\n- NT1 -> 't10' (yes)\n- NT32 -> 't77' (yes)\n- NT62 -> 't43' and 't16' (yes)\n- NT77 -> ... wait, I need to find where 't59' comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps 't59' comes from NT59 as a terminal? Let me check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT59-> NT17 and NT59-> NT28.\n\nWait, but none output 't59' as a terminal. Hmm, this is confusing because the user mentioned 't59' as a terminal in the string, but in the grammar, I don't see a rule that makes an NT produce 't59' directly. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, looking again, the user's grammar doesn't list a rule where any NT ends with 't59'. Therefore, perhaps 't59' isn't a valid terminal in this grammar, but the user provided it in the string. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't59' doesn't appear in any of the production rules as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and 't59' should come from another NT rule, but I didn't see any such rule.\n\nWait, perhaps 't59' isn't listed as a terminal but as a part of a longer production. Let me think. Maybe the string starts with 't59', but according to the grammar, is there a way to get 't59' as part of a two-token production?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in my approach. Maybe I should backtrack from the string and see if each step can be reduced using the grammar rules.\n\nSo, the first token is 't59'. We need to find a way to get to 't59' from some NT production. Since the only NT that leads to a terminal is, for example, NT30 leading to 't53', 't90', or 't27', none of which is 't59'. So how is 't59' possible?\n\nUnless I missed a rule where some NT produces 't59', but I don't see that.\n\nWait, maybe looking for where an NT produces another NT that in turn produces 't59'. But if there's no rule for that, it's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the NT rules to see if any NT's production ends with 't59'. Alternatively, perhaps I should see the first step.\n\nAnother approach: the initial string has 't59', which should match the first symbol of a production. Let's see what S can yield.\n\nS can generate either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nIf S->NT30 NT53, then the first symbols would be whatever NT30 produces and NT53.\n\nLooking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-310","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing, though in this case, I might not be using a parser but rather trying to manually check.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t72 t73 t28 t72 t73 t28 t53 t32 t12 t91 t7 t32 t32 t90 t77 t12 t59 t24`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't' symbols followed by numbers. Each of these 't' symbols likely corresponds to a particular non-terminal or terminal in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, there are several NT (non-terminals) with productions that replace into other NTs and terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which suggests that S can be split into two parts. Each of these NTs might be further split into more symbols.\n\nI think a possible approach is to try to parse the given string back to the start symbol S using the grammar rules. If I can successfully break down the entire string into S, then the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me break the string into individual tokens for clarity:\nt72, t73, t28, t72, t73, t28, t53, t32, t12, t91, t7, t32, t32, t90, t77, t12, t59, t24.\n\nLooking for places where the string can be split into two parts, since most of the non-terminals are two-symbol productions.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\n1. Looking at the first token, t72. From the grammar:\nNT16 \u2192 t72. So NT16 is t72.\n\n2. Next token is t73. From the grammar, NT16 also has another t73. Also, NT16 \u2192 t73. So t73 can be represented as NT16.\n\n3. Third token is t28. Looking at the grammar, NT15 \u2192 t28. So t28 is NT15.\n\nWait, but another rule says NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4. Hmm, so I might have gone wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for rules that lead directly to t28. Checking grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions for t28.\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t28 appears. So yes, NT15 can directly be t28. But there's also NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4. So there are two possibilities: NT15 can be either t28 or a combination of NT1 and NT4.\n\nBut in the string, after t72 t73 t28, perhaps the third token is t28, which is NT15.\n\nSo the first three tokens: t72 (NT16), t73 (NT16?), t28 (NT15).\n\nWait, no, because NT16 only produces t72 and t73. So maybe the first two tokens are both NT16, and the third is NT15.\n\nSo breaking down:\n\nThe first two tokens are t72 (NT16) and t73 (also NT16). So S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which may not be the case here. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT16 NT16? Wait, no. Looking at the grammar, S is defined as:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo S must consist of two non-terminals. So each of the possible S productions have two non-terminals. Therefore, the entire string should be split into pairs according to the grammar.\n\nWait, but the given string has 18 tokens, which is even, so that might fit. However, let me try to split it into pairs.\n\nLet's attempt to split the string into pairs, starting from the beginning.\n\n1. t72 t73\n2. t28 t53\n3. t32 t12\n4. t91 t7\n5. t32 t59\n6. t24\n\nWait, but that's six pairs, but the string has 18 tokens, so each pair is two tokens. Wait, no, 18 tokens would make 9 pairs. Hmm, but perhaps I should look for the top-level production. The start symbol is S, which can split into two non-terminals.\n\nSo the first step is to split the entire string into two parts, each part being a substring generated by one of S's productions. S can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So I need to find if the first part is generated by NT30 and the second by NT53, or vice versa.\n\nSo let's consider the first two tokens: t72, t73. Wait, if the first part is t72 t73, that would be a pair. Looking at the grammar, NT16 \u2192 t72 and NT16 \u2192 t73. But NT16 is a single non-terminal. So if the first part is generated by NT16, and the second part by another NT, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe NT30 and NT53.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find a way to split the string into two parts, each being generated by one of the two options of S.\n\nLet me try to see if the first part can be NT30 and the second NT53.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions:\n\nThe grammar shows:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\nNT30 \u2192 't27'\nNT30 \u2192 't30'\nWait, no, that's not correct. Looking back, the grammar has several entries for NT30:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT30 -> 't30'\n\nSo NT30 can generate a terminal 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', or 't30'. So that's not helpful because the first part needs to be a production of NT30, but 't90' and 't53' are in the first two positions, so maybe that's possible.\n\nBut let's see, if the first part is 't72 t73', which is two tokens, and each corresponds to NT16, as each of those can be t72 or t73.\n\nSo perhaps the first two tokens (t72, t73) are generated by NT16, and the rest by some other NTs. But S's productions have two non-terminals, so perhaps the second part would have to be another pair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can't be split that way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong and should instead try to work from the entire string and see if it can be reduced back to S using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the entire string step by step, considering possible splits.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\n1: t72\n2: t73\n3: t28\n4: t53\n5: t32\n6: t12\n7: t91\n8: t7\n9: t32\n10: t59\n11: t24\n\nWait, earlier I thought there were 18 tokens, but looking again, the string is: \n\n`t72 t73 t28 t72 t73 t28 t53 t32 t12 t91 t7 t32 t32 t90 t77 t12 t59 t24` \n\nCounting the commas, that's 18 tokens. Let's number them 1 to 18.\n\nSo 18 tokens, each represents a symbol.\n\nSo the entire string has 18 symbols, which is 9 pairs. So S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So each of the two parts must be generated by one of those non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider if the first 9 tokens can be split into a pair that's generated by NT30 and the next 9 by NT53. But that might not make sense because it's more about how the grammar can break down the symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be generated by a series of splits.\n\nLet me consider starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t72, which as we saw earlier is NT16. So perhaps the first part of the string is generated by NT16, and the rest by another NT."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar does look like CNF because all the rules on the left side of the arrow have two non-terminals, except where the right side ends with a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t33 t72 t76 t17 t27 t14 t10 t29 t24 t80 t76 t32 t28 t33 t45 t59 t7 t38`.\n\nSo, each token in this string should correspond to a terminal symbol generated by some production rule. If I can break down the entire string into these rules, it would mean the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the rules end with a terminal.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a parse tree for the given string and see if it fits any of the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t33. From the grammar, t33 is the result of NT33, which splits into NT62 and NT7. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t33, which according to the given grammar, comes from NT33, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. In the given grammar, let's list all the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT30 can produce t90, t53, t14, t73, t27, t25, t32, t89, t28, t59, t24, t10, etc. I see multiple options for NT30.\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, and so on, eventually leading to t7, t9, etc.\n\n- NT15 \u2192 ... ends with t12, t1, etc.\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, if any of the non-terminals can directly produce t33, then we can see. Looking through the list of rules, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25, but that leads to t89 eventually.\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t76.\n\n- NT16 \u2192 t31.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way. Let me check the 't33' in the string. To get t33, perhaps it's part of a larger production. For example, NT33 might produce t62 and t7, but in the given grammar, I don't see a rule for NT33. Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, the user provided a series of lines for the grammar. Let me go through each line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n\nOh, here we go: NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33.\n\nSo, NT15 can produce NT44 and NT33. Now, looking at NT44: the lines say NT44 \u2192 NT45, which in turn does other things. Wait, but looking through the rules:\n\nWait, let me go line by line to make sure I get all the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at NT30:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't89' (among other rules for NT1)\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n\n- And others, including NT30 \u2192 't27' and others.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar provided, NT30 has several production rules that produce terminal symbols, including t30 \u2192 t33, which is one of the options: NT30 \u2192 't53' and 't27'; wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under 'NT30', the productions are:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't89'\n\nNT53 -> 't7'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nNT10 -> 't73'\n\nNT25 -> 't29'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT53 -> 't59'\n\nNT56 -> 't45'\n\nNT30 -> 't28'\n\nNT11 -> 't28'\n\nAnd so on. Wait, so looking back, NT30 has multiple production rules that produce various terminals. Specifically, I see:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t90\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t53\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t14\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t89\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t7\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t27\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t29? No, NT25 has production NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56.\n\nWait, perhaps I should systematically list all the production rules to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me try to list all the non-terminals and their production rules:\n\n1. S:\n   - S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n   - S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-327","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t28 t33 t29 t91 t20 t53 t31 t29 t29 t59 t27 t53 t20 t80 t40 t7 t45 t24 t27`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like the non-terminals are on the left side, like S, NT1, NT30, etc., and each rule defines how a non-terminal can expand into other symbols, which could be other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers except for the last part.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string is either a terminal or derived from one. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the given string: `t28 t33 t29 t91 t20 t53 t31 t29 t29 t59 t27 t53 t20 t80 t40 t7 t45 t24 t27`. Since all elements are terminals except maybe some non-terminals, but in this string, I don't see any non-terminals; all are 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo the string should be analyzed step by step, starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S produces NT30 and NT35. So any valid string must start with either NT30 or NT35.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t28. So I need to see if either NT30 or NT35 can derive t28.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: in the given grammar, NT30 can produce several terminals. Checking, I see NT30->'t90', 't53', 't14'. Wait, no, in the list, under NT30, there are multiple rules. Let me list them:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. But in the string, the first symbol is t28, which is not among these. So starting with NT30, the first token can't be t28. That suggests the string might not start with an NT30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S produces both NT30 and NT35. So perhaps the string starts with NT35. Let's check NT35's productions.\n\nLooking at NT35's rules: \n\nNT35 -> NT43 NT11\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nSo NT35 can produce combinations of non-terminals. For example, it can produce NT43 and NT11, each of which can further derive terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, this might get complicated because when we expand the non-terminals, they might further expand into other non-terminals and terminals. So each step could produce more symbols until all are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to parse the string according to the grammar. Since the string is fully made of terminals, I need to see if the leftmost symbols can be matched by the productions starting from S.\n\nMaybe it's helpful to build a parse tree in a bottom-up manner, trying to match the string.\n\nLet me think about the entire process step by step.\n\n1. The string is a sequence of terminals. Since it's a context-free grammar with all productions in CNF, we can try to find a decomposition that matches the string as a sequence of leftmost terminals being derived from the grammar.\n\n2. The string has length 20. Let's note the order:\n\nt28, t33, t29, t91, t20, t53, t31, t29, t29, t59, t27, t53, t20, t80, t40, t7, t45, t24, t27.\n\n3. The first symbol is t28. Looking at NT30's production: t28 isn't a direct production of NT30. Because NT30 produces 't90', 't53', 't14' directly. So if the first symbol is t28, then perhaps the start symbol S cannot directly generate t28. So maybe this string is invalid. But wait, maybe NT30 or NT35 produces t28 through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT30 can go directly to 't90', 't53', 't14'. Similarly, NT15 can produce 't12' and 't10' etc. Is there any non-terminal that can produce t28?\n\nLooking through the non-terminals: Let me list all non-terminals and their direct terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, the non-terminals and their productions to terminals:\n\n- NT10 -> 't73' (from NT10->'t73')\n- NT1 -> 't10', 't4', 't89', 't10' multiple times\n- NT5 -> 't45' (since NT53->'t59' isn't directly but via other paths. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding. The grammar is given, so each non-terminal has multiple productions, some of which are terminals, others non-terminals.\n\nI need to list for each non-terminal, which terminals and other non-terminals they can produce.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\nS -> NT30 NT35\nSo NT30 and NT35 are the starting points.\n\nNT30 productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14' directly.\n\nSo if the first symbol is 't28', then it must be derived from NT35, because NT30 doesn't directly produce 't28'. Now, does NT35 have a production that can lead to 't28' somewhere? Looking at NT35's productions:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT43 NT11\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\nNT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n\nSo NT35 can split into two non-terminals. Now, these other non-terminals can lead to more expansions.\n\nLet's try to see: for example, NT43. Looking through the grammar, NT43 is produced by:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT40 NT1 (from NT40?)\n\nWait, NT43: Let's find all productions where the left side is NT43.\n\nFrom the given grammar, looking for NT43: \n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT14\u2192't14'\nNT43\u2192't40' (wait, in the given grammar, there is NT43-> 't40')?\n\nWait, checking:\n\nWait, the initial grammar part is:\n\n```grammar\nS -> NT30 NT35\nS -> NT35 NT45\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n...\nNT43 -> NT40 NT1 ?

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t72 t72 t72 t40 t28 t12 t40 t29 t20 t12 t66 t59 t28 t29 t14 t38 t59 t12 t53`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S according to these rules.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT30 NT53 and S -> NT35 NT45. So the string must start with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with three t72's. Looking at the grammar, I see that t72 is a terminal. Wait, but in CNF, the only terminals that can appear are those that are leaves in the parse tree. So, each NT must expand into terminals.\n\nFrom the rules given, let's see which NTs produce t72. Scanning through the production rules, I notice that NT16 -> 't72'. So, for example, NT16 can produce 't72'. Also, NT62 can produce 't72' via the rule NT62 -> NT43 NT16, and since NT16 is t72, that's how t72 comes into play. Wait, but NT62 is 't43' 't16', meaning NT43 and NT16. So, if NT62 expands, NT43 is another non-terminal, which might produce other things. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, some NTs directly produce a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16, so if NT62 is expanded, it's NT43 and NT16. Since NT16 is 't72', that would produce 't72' if NT43 is a terminal. Wait, but looking through the rules, NT43 is also a rule that doesn't produce terminals. For example, NT43 -> NT53 NT11. So that complicates things because NT43 itself can't be a terminal.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In Chomsky normal form, the right-hand side of the productions must consist of exactly two non-terminals or one terminal, right? So any non-terminal that has a terminal on the right must be a production that directly outputs that terminal. But in this grammar, the non-terminals seem to produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals or sometimes terminals. \n\nWait, some rules like NT30 -> 't90' or NT30 -> 't53' or 't14' suggest that NT30 can produce a terminal directly, as well as other non-terminals. So that seems correct for CNF because a production can have a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nBut for the given string, starting with t72 three times, how would that happen? Each t72 would require that the corresponding NT in the grammar can produce 't72'. Let's check:\n\nLooking at each NT that can produce 't72' or lead to 't72':\n\n- NT16 -> 't72' (explicitly)\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16: So if NT43 can produce a terminal that eventually leads to something else. Wait, NT43 is produced by NT53 and NT11. Both of those I don't see producing 't72' directly. Not sure if this is leading anywhere.\n\nBut since the string starts with t72 three in a row, perhaps it's coming from some NT that produces multiple t72's through its expansion. Wait, but in CNF, you can't have two terminals in a single production; each production is two non-terminals. So how do you get multiple terminals in a row?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial S is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, each of which will eventually produce the required terminals. So for the string to start with t72, the first production must be S -> NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Then, each of these NTs must expand into the necessary terminals.\n\nLooking at the start, the string is `t72 t72 t72 ...`. So S must expand into two NTs, each of which must produce three t72's? But wait, no\u2014each NT expansion is separate, and the string is a concatenation of all the terminals generated by the two NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing how the string is built. Each NT in the production contributes a part of the string. So S -> NT30 NT53 would expand into the concatenation of NT30's expansion and NT53's expansion.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t72 three times, that means the first NT (say NT30) must expand into t72 three times, and then the second NT (NT53) must also expand into some numbers of terminals, perhaps t72 again, but in the given string, after three t72s, it's followed by t40, so maybe the first NT produces three t72s and the second produces some other terminals.\n\nWait, but let's check which NTs can generate t72:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs that can produce 't72' directly are:\n\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16 (then NT43 produces NT53 NT11, NT53 produces NT1 NT4, etc.)\n\nWait, but NT16 is a terminal, so that's straightforward. Let me see if any NTs produce NT16:\n\nLooking, I don't see any rule where a NT produces NT16 directly or indirectly except NT62.\n\nSo, if any NT produces NT16, which in turn produces 't72', then that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, NT62 can be expanded into NT43 and NT16, which would produce 't72' when NT16 is expanded. But NT43 itself isn't a terminal but another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let me see if any NT directly produces 't72' through multiple steps.\n\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT53 -> NT1 NT4\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT10 -> NT73\nNT73 -> ... Hmm, but I'm not sure if that leads to 't72'.\n\nAlternatively, NT43 could lead to NT53 and NT11.\n\nLet's take one possibility: If the S starts with NT30 and NT53. So let's process NT30:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' OR 't53' OR 't14'\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar as written: Each line is a production, like S -> NT30 NT53, etc. Then the NTs have their own productions.\n\nWait, for example, NT30 has several productions:\n\nIn the grammar, under the NT30 rules, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nSo NT30 can produce t90, t53, or t14.

Let me see. But when I look at the NT53 rules, I don't see it producing t72 directly. NT53 can produce:\n\nNT53 -> NT1 NT4\nNT53 -> NT15 NT1\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT53 -> NT91\nNT53 -> NT59\nNT53 -> NT29 ... etc.\n\nHmm, none of those directly produce 't72', except perhaps through other NTs.

{"custom_id":"request-328","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t73 t45 t7 t38 t89 t24 t32 t10 t33 t59 t90 t89 t7 t40 t33 t66 t29 t38 t20 t33`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe goal is to see if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The grammar has two initial productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45. The string provided starts with `t73`, which is a terminal. Looking at the NT30 production: NT30 \u2192 't73', right? So, in the first case, when S \u2192 NT30 NT53, NT30 would produce 't73'.\n\nThat's a good start. Now, after 't73', the next symbol in the string is 't45'. So, the second part must be NT53 \u2192 't45'. Checking the NT53 productions, there's at least one rule: NT53 \u2192 't59'. Wait, that doesn't help because we have 't45', not 't59'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps NT53 has a production that starts with a terminal. Let me check the NT53 rules.\n\nLooking at the NT53 rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 NT91\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n- Other rules don't have NT53 starting as a terminal except for NT53 \u2192 't7'. But the string after 't73' is 't45', so that would require NT53 to produce 't45', but I don't see any rule that does that. The NT53 rules either generate terminals like 't7', 't59', or other non-terms. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try the other initial option for S: S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Let's check if the initial symbols can fit here. The first symbol is 't73', so NT35 \u2192 't73'? Looking at the NT35 rules:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\nNT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nNT35 \u2192 NT45 NT5 \u2192 but that's followed by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the NT35 rules as given, the initial productions show NT35 can transition to other NTs, but none of them directly produce a terminal. The only terminal in NT35 is perhaps something else. Wait, in the provided rules, under NT35, the productions are NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4, NT35 \u2192 NT45 NT5. None of these seem to produce a terminal immediately. So, starting with S \u2192 NT35 NT45 would start with non-terminals, but the string starts with 't73', which is a terminal. So maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps the other initial step is better.\n\nWait, but in the first step, S can produce NT30 NT53, which are two non-terminals. So the string must start with NT30 followed by NT53, each expanded into terminals. So, in the string, the first token is 't73' which corresponds to NT30 \u2192 't73', so that's good. Next, after 't73', the next token in the string is 't45', so the second part is NT53 \u2192 't45'? But in the given grammar, does NT53 have a production that directly gives 't45'? Looking through the NT53 productions:\n\n1. NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n2. NT53 \u2192 NT91\n3. NT53 \u2192 't7'\nWait, is there a rule that says NT53 \u2192 't45'? It doesn't seem so. So, how does NT53 reach 't45'? Maybe through a series of productions that eventually terminate with 't45'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, perhaps the way it happens is through NT53 producing something that eventually ends with 't45'. Let me try following the production chain.\n\nStarting with NT53, suppose it produces NT46 NT1. Then NT46 can be expanded. From the list, NT46 \u2192 't66'. So NT46 \u2192 't66', so NT53 becomes 't66' NT1. Next, NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4. NT10 \u2192 't73'? Wait, no. Wait, let's check NT10:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't73', yes. So if NT10 is 't73', then NT1 \u2192 NT10 't73' and NT4. NT4's productions include NT4 \u2192 't45'. So this would mean:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 't73' and NT4 \u2192 't45'. So the whole chain would be:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 \u2192 't66' 't73' NT4 \u2192 't66' 't73' 't45'.\n\nSo that would mean NT53 could potentially produce 't66 t73 t45'. But in the string after 't73', the next token is 't45', not 't66 t73'. So this seems conflicting because the string is `t73 t45 t7...`, so after 't73' comes 't45', but according to NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1, which leads to 't66 t73 t45', which would add 't66', which doesn't match the string. So that path might not be the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT53 doesn't have a production that includes 't45'. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the NT53 productions:\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT53 has a production: NT53 \u2192 't91'. But 't91' is not present in the input. Hmm. The input after 't73' is 't45', so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I was wrong in thinking that S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is the correct path. Let's explore S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nNT35 can produce NT15 NT1 or NT1 NT4 or NT45 NT5. None of these seem to start with a terminal, so maybe this would produce two non-terminals. The string starts with 't73', so maybe the S \u2192 NT35 NT45 path is not feasible since NT35 doesn't immediately expand into a terminal. Therefore, perhaps the first path is the only viable one, but then we're stuck because NT53 doesn't have a production leading directly to 't45'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think recursively. Let's try to expand the first two tokens: NT30 and NT53.\n\nNT30 \u2192 't73' (good), and NT53 needs to be expanded into 't45', but since it doesn't directly produce 't45', perhaps it requires a longer chain. Let's try expanding NT53 step by step.\n\nNT53 can be expanded as NT46 NT1.\n\nNT46 expands to 't66' (NT46 \u2192 't66'), so NT53 becomes 't66' NT1.\n\nNT1 expands to NT10 NT4.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't73' (as per production: NT10 \u2192 't73').\n\nNT4 expands to 't45' (NT4 \u2192 't45').\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps would be:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 \u2192 't66' NT1 \u2192 't66' NT10 't45' \u2192 't66' 't73' 't45'.\n\nTherefore, NT53 would generate 't66 t73 t45', which would mean after NT30 generates 't73', NT53 would generate 't66 t73 t45', so the overall string after the initial NT30 would be 't66 t73 t45'.

Similarly, for NT1 \u2192 't10', etc.\n\nSo, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So any valid string must begin with the breakdown of S into these components.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't38', which must be the result of some production. Let's check the productions that produce 't38'. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't17' (no)\n- NT4 \u2192 't45' (no)\n- NT15 \u2192 't1' (no)\n- NT32 \u2192 't77' (no)\n- NT9 \u2192 't38' (yes, production 44: NT9 \u2192 't38')\n\nSo the first token is 't38', which is produced by NT9. That means somewhere in the derivation, we have NT9 generating 't38'. \n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT9 is a non-terminal because it's on the left side of some productions. Let's check where NT9 appears on the left:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT9 is on the left in production 14: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43. So NT9 \u2192 ...? Wait, no.

NT9 \u2192 't20'\n50. NT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, I think I misnumbered earlier. Production 14 was NT30 \u2192 't90', 15 \u2192 't53', 16 \u2192 't14', then 17-22 are more. Let me list all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't38' (production 45)\nNT9 \u2192 't20' (production 49)\n\nSo NT9 can be expanded into either 't38' or 't20'. So in our string, the first token is 't38', which must be produced by NT9. Therefore, the derivation must have NT9 \u2192 't38', so the first part of the string is matched by this.\n\nSo far, the string is 't38 ...', which we've matched. Now the remaining string is 't17 t80 t73 t33 t7 t66 t20 t28 t28 t12 t24 t80 t32 t77 t91 t53 t59 t20 t80'.\n\nNow, looking at the next token, which is 't17'. We need to see what non-terminals can produce 't17'. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't17' (production 41)\n\nSo 't17' must come from NT59. So our current state is: NT9 \u2192 't38', then NT59 \u2192 't17'. But wait, NT9 is a non-terminal, so in the grammar, is NT9 a parent to something else? Or is NT9 a terminal? Wait, NT9 is a non-terminal because it's on the left side of production 14: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43. So NT9 cannot be a terminal; it must be expanded into some other symbols. But wait, production 45 says NT9 \u2192 't38', which is a terminal, and production 49 says NT9 \u2192 't20', also a terminal.\n\nSo in the grammar, NT9 is a non-terminal that can be expanded into terminals. So the production NT9 \u2192 't38' is allowed because it's a single terminal, but in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the left.

Let me start by understanding what the grammar looks like and the string I'm supposed to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. CNF is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows us to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I might not be familiar with all that, I'll try a different approach.\n\nThe string given is: `t12 t77 t90 t28 t33 t76 t90 t45 t24 t27 t17 t77 t27 t53 t10 t53 t29 t90 t24 t14 t53`.\n\nI notice the string is a sequence of tokens split by spaces, each starting with 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's composed of non-terminals (like S, NT30, NT35, etc.) and terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). Each production rule in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. So, for a string like this, the derivation tree must have a height such that the number of symbols in the string is compatible.\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't12', which is a terminal symbol, that suggests that the starting non-terminal S must derive to a sequence that includes these terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two production rules:\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nI need to check if any of these can lead to the given string. Let's pick the first one: S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nSo, the string starts with t12, which would have to come from either NT30 or NT53, depending on which production we use.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 NT43 NT10 (from the rule NT30 \u2192 NT43 NT10)\n- NT30 \u2192 NT10 (from another rule: NT30 \u2192 t27. Wait, no, looking back, I see that under NT30: there are multiple rules, but some might be direct terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT30 can produce terminals like 't90', 't53', 't14' directly.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules for NT30:\nNT30 \u2192 NT43 NT10\nNT30 \u2192 NT30 becomes... Wait, no, the grammar seems to have NT30 with several production rules that either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, looking back, each line is a production rule for a non-terminal. So, for example, NT30 has multiple entries:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT43 NT10 (from line 3)\nNT30 \u2192 NT10 (maybe from another line)\nNT30 \u2192 't90' (from line 4)\nNT30 \u2192 't53' (from line 5)\nNT30 \u2192 't14' (from line 7)\n\nWait, that's confusing. It seems that NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14' directly, in addition to combining with other non-terminals. Similarly, NT10 is another non-terminal with its own productions.\n\nSo, going back, S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So, the first part is NT30 and the second is NT53. The string starts with 't12', so either NT30 must produce a terminal that starts with 't12' or NT53 must produce a terminal starting with 't12'. But wait, looking at NT30's rules, 't90', 't53', 't14' are terminals, so 't12' isn't among them. Let's check NT53's rules:\n\nLooking at NT53's rules:\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 t7 (from line 15)\n- NT53 \u2192 t70 ? Wait, looking back, the rules for NT53 are:\n\nFrom the initial provided grammar, under NT53:\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 (line 1)\n- NT53 \u2192 t7 (line 15)\n- NT53 \u2192 t59 (line 19)\n- NT53 \u2192 t91 (line 23)\n- NT53 \u2192 t9 (line 30? Wait, not sure. Wait, line by line.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT53 productions:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 (line 16: the production is S \u2192 NT46 NT1)\nWait, no, in the initial grammar, it's under NT53: let's see:\n\nThe initial grammar is a list of lines. Each line is a production for a non-terminal, I think. For example, S appears twice:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nThen NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11 (line 3)\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25 (line 5)\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5 (line 6)\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1 (line 7)\nNT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7 (line 8)\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4 (line 9)\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16 (line 10)\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43 (line 11)\nNT16 \u2192 t72 (line 12)\nNT30 \u2192 t90 (line 13)\nNT30 \u2192 t53 (line 14)\nNT30 \u2192 t14 (line 15)\nNT1 \u2192 t89 (line 16)\nNT53 \u2192 t7 (line 17)\nNT7 \u2192 t91 (line 18)\nNT56 \u2192 t45 (line 19)\nNT30 \u2192 t27 (line 20)\nNT10 \u2192 t73 (line 21)\nNT25 \u2192 t29 (line 22)\nNT43 \u2192 t40 (line 23)\nNT53 \u2192 t59 (line 24)\nNT56 \u2192 t28 (line 25)\nNT11 \u2192 t28 (line 26)\nNT59 \u2192 t17 (line 27)\nNT32 \u2192 t77 (line 28)\nNT1 \u2192 t10 (line 29)\nNT59 \u2192 t24 (line 30)\nNT9 \u2192 t38 (line 31)\nNT4 \u2192 t45 (line 32)\nNT46 \u2192 t66 (line 33)\nNT53 \u2192 t91 (line 34)\nNT9 \u2192 t20 (line 35)\nNT53 \u2192 t80 (line 36)\nNT16 \u2192 t31 (line 37)\nWait, that seems off. I think each line represents a production for that non-terminal.\n\nSo, for NT53, the productions are:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 t7\n- NT53 \u2192 t59\n- NT53 \u2192 t91\n- NT53 \u2192 t59 again (line 34)\nWait, that repetition doesn't make sense.

{"custom_id":"request-339","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t27 t73 t24 t73 t73 t20 t73 t45 t32 t72 t72 t80 t77 t31 t91 t72 t77 t27 t80 t38 t31`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string properly. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning every production has two non-terminals on the left side or a terminal on the left. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it has two productions: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So, the string must start with either \"t90\" (from NT30) or \"t45\" (from NT35).\n\nThe string starts with \"t27\", which is not \"t90\" or \"t45\", so that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let me check the grammar rules again. Oh, wait, I see NT30 has multiple rules: NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't27', 't53' again, and 't27'. So, does that mean NT30 can produce 't27' as well? That would imply the string could start with \"t27\", but I thought S only produces NT30 NT53. Hmm, perhaps there's a non-terminal that can produce multiple options.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: S is the start symbol, so S generates either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the first part of the string should come from either of these. Since the initial symbol is S, the first part of the string must come from the first symbols of NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nIn the given string, the first token is \"t27\". Looking at the grammar, does NT30 produce \"t27\"? Let's check NT30's productions: NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't27', 't53' again, and another 't27'. So yes, NT30 can produce \"t27\". Similarly, does NT35 produce any terminal? NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. So the first token after S would be \"t27\", which comes from NT30.\n\nSo the first part of the string is \"t27\". Now, the next token is \"t73\". Let's see what can produce \"t73\". Looking through the grammar, \"t73\" comes from NT16 in the production NT16 \u2192 't73'. So where does NT16 come from? Looking at the productions, NT16 \u2192 't73', so it's a direct terminal. How is NT16 generated? Looking at the rules, NT16 is defined as NT16 \u2192 't73' (from the line \"NT16 -> 't73'\"). So it's a terminal, not a non-terminal. That suggests that the production for NT16 is terminal, meaning in the string, it just appears as \"t73\".\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, non-terminals are expanded into other symbols, while terminals are leaves. So if NT16 is a non-terminal, why is it directly producing a terminal? Or is NT16 a terminal? That can't be because the grammar is in CNF, so all productions must have two non-terminals on the left unless it's a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The grammar as written has lines like \"NT16 -> 't73'\". So in this grammar, are \"t\" strings considered terminals? Yes, they are. So NT16 is a non-terminal that directly produces \"t73\", which is a terminal. So that's allowed. So in this grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, which are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nSo, going back, the first part after S is NT30. NT30 can generate \"t27\" directly. So the first token is \"t27\".\n\nNow, the next part after \"t27\" is \"t73\". How does that get parsed? Let's look at how \"t73\" is generated. Looking at the grammar, \"t73\" is produced by NT16, which is a non-terminal that directly generates it. So the production would be NT16 \u2192 't73'. So the next step is to look at the expansion of NT16, which is just \"t73\".\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT16 is defined as 't73', so it's a production rule where the non-terminal NT16 produces a terminal \"t73\". So in this case, the next part is directly matched as \"t73\".\n\nSo after \"t27\" comes \"t73\", which is generated directly by NT16. So far, so good.\n\nNext, the string has another \"t73\". How is that generated? Since NT16 again produces \"t73\", it's another direct production.\n\nSo now, after two \"t73\"s, the next token is \"t73\" again. Same reasoning: another NT16 \u2192 't73'.\n\nSo the first three tokens are \"t27\", \"t73\", \"t73\". Each of these is matched via NT30 \u2192 \"t27\", then NT16 \u2192 \"t73\", and again NT16 \u2192 \"t73\". So that part checks out.\n\nThe next token is \"t20\". So how does \"t20\" get generated? Looking at the grammar, I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces \"t20\". Looking through the rules, I see NT59 \u2192 't28', NT44 \u2192 't76', NT15 \u2192 't12', NT4 \u2192 't45', etc., but \"t20\" is not immediately obvious. Wait, maybe it's generated through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT59 \u2192 't28', and then NT15 \u2192 't12', but that's not leading to \"t20\". Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing \"t20\". Did I miss it?\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions to see if any produce \"t20\". Looking at the grammar, the terminals are 't27', 't73', 't24', 't73', etc., but I don't see a production rule where any non-terminal directly produces \"t20\". Hmm, that's a problem because the next token is \"t20\", and I don't see how it gets generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again. I have:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't7' (from \"NT53 -> 't7'\", line 13)\n- NT9 \u2192 't38' (line 14)\n- NT4 \u2192 't45' (line 15)\n- NT46 \u2192 't66' (line 16)\n- NT53 \u2192 't59' (line 17)\n- NT59 \u2192 't17' (line 18)\n- NT32 \u2192 't77' (line 19)\n- NT1 \u2192 't10' (line 20)\n- NT59 \u2192 't28' (line 21)\n- NT15 \u2192 't12' (line 22)\n- NT10 \u2192 't32' (line 23)\n- NT44 \u2192 't76' (line 24)\n- NT4 \u2192 't53' (line 25)\n- NT15 \u2192 't38' (line 26)\n- NT4 \u2192 't33' (line 27)\n- NT59 \u2192 't24' (line 28)\n- NT9 \u2192 't20' (line 29)\n- NT53 \u2192 't80' (line 30)\n- NT16 \u2192 't31' (line 33)\n\nOh, wait! I see now. Line 29 is NT9 \u2192 't20'. So NT9 can produce \"t20\". So after the earlier steps, we have:\n\nAfter \"t27\", \"t73\", \"t73\", the next token is \"t20\", which is produced by NT9 \u2192 't20'. So that must mean that the next non-terminal is NT9, which produces \"t20\". So perhaps the production is something like NT9 \u2192 something that includes \"t20\". But wait, NT9 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal?\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT9 is a non-terminal because"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar starts with S, and then there are several production rules for different symbols like NT15, NT25, etc.\n\nThe string given consists of a series of tokens like 't40', 't12', etc. I notice that these are terminals, so the goal is to parse the string using the non-terminals and their productions until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me list the productions again to make sure I have them all:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't89'\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't91'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't29'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't59'\n- NT56 -> 't28'\n- NT11 -> 't28'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT32 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT59 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT4 -> 't45'\n- NT46 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't53'\n- NT15 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't33'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n\nWait, I see that some non-terminals have multiple productions, some have only one terminal, and some have multiple non-terminals. For example, S -> NT30 NT53 is directly linked to 't90' and 't7' because NT30 and NT53 have a production to a terminal, respectively. So each production S will generate two non-terminals, which then should be replaced by terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string is quite long, with 21 tokens. Since S can split into two parts, each part will generate a left and right part of the string, respectively. I think I need to model this as a parsing problem where the string is split starting from S, and each step involves splitting the current string into left and right, and checking if each can be generated by one of the productions.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I can model this as a recursive descent parser or use memoization to track the possibilities. However, since I can't code, I'll try to manually map it.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string starts with 't40', so looking at the grammar, 't40' is the result of NT43, which is derived from NT43 -> 't40'. So the parse tree would start with S -> NT30 NT53. Let me see:\n\n- 't40' is the end of NT43, which comes from NT43 -> 't40'.\n\nNow, moving to the next part of the string. After 't40', the rest is from the right side of S, which is NT53.\n\nSo after 't40', the next part should come from NT53.\n\nLooking at NT53, I see multiple productions:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1 \u2192 [NT46 (t66), NT1 (t10)]\n- NT53 -> t7 \u2192 [t7]\n- NT35 -> t59 \u2192 [t59]\nBut wait, NT53 has two main options: it can be split into NT46 and NT1, or it can be 't7'. But in this case, after 't40', the next tokens are 't12', 't33', etc. So the first option may not fit, because after 't40', we have 't12' which doesn't match 't7'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT53 can directly produce 't7' if needed. But in our case, the first token after 't40' is 't12'. So perhaps the S split is correct, and the right part is NT53 producing 't12', 't33', etc.\n\nWait, let me think again. NT53 can produce 't7' or other non-terminals. But the next token after 't40' is 't12', which suggests that NT53 must produce something starting with 't12' or further.\n\nLooking back, wait, the string after 't40' is 't12 t33 t89 t53 t73 t10 t77 t31 t31 t12 t12 t17 t7 t7 t72 t76 t77 t32 t17 t28 t40'.\n\nWait, that's 21 tokens, so after 't40', it's 20 tokens. Let me re-express the entire string for clarity:\n\nt40 t12 t33 t89 t53 t73 t10 t77 t31 t31 t12 t12 t17 t7 t7 t72 t76 t77 t32 t17 t28 t40.\n\nWait, no, I'm miscounting. The initial string is 21 tokens: t40, t12, t33, t89, t53, t73, t10, t77, t31, t31, t12, t12, t17, t7, t7, t72, t76, t77, t32, t17, t28, t40.\n\nSo, after 't40', it's 20 tokens. So, S is split into two parts: the left is 't40' (from NT43 -> t40), and the right is the rest 20 tokens.\n\nSo the right part, from NT53, must produce the remaining tokens.\n\nNow, looking at the starting symbol, S -> NT30 NT53. But wait, earlier I thought S splits into NT30 and NT53, each taking two parts? Or maybe each production of S is treated as starting the parse. Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a leftmost or rightmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split is S -> NT30 NT53, so each of those can be considered as separate subtrees.\n\nWait, but for context-free grammars, you can parse sequentially, so perhaps the entire string is built by S, and S can derive in two parts. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps I should break down the string into the two parts that S produces, which are NT30 and NT53. So the string should be split into the first part generated by NT30 and the second part generated by NT53.\n\nSo let's see: the first token is 't40', which is generated by NT43, but perhaps that is part of the NT30 derivation. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, the production S -> NT30 NT53. So S can derive into NT30 first, and then NT53. Each of these will generate parts of the string.\n\nSo the string is the concatenation of the strings derived by NT30 and NT53.\n\nSo, the first part is derived by NT30, and the second by NT53.\n\nNow, NT30 has"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that's the form that's easiest to work with for these kinds of derivations. \n\nLet me look at the grammar first. It seems to have a bunch of non-terminals (NTs) and terminals that are 't' followed by a number, except for S. Wait, S is rewritten into some non-terminals, but looking closer, the right-hand sides of the rules for S are combinations of these NTs and sometimes terminals. For example, S can derive NT30 NT53, which are both non-terminals, but NT30 can also derive 't90', 't53', or 't14' directly.\n\nThe provided string is a series of 't' followed by numbers: t17 t24 t90 ... up to t31. Hmm, so I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nFirst, I think about the structure of the grammar. The initial symbol is S, which immediately branches into two non-terminals: NT30 and NT53. So any string derived from S must start with the string derived from NT30 followed by the string derived from NT53.\n\nLet me check the first part of the string: t17. So I need NT30 to derive a string that includes t17 at some point, and then NT53 should derive the rest of the string after that.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT30: It can directly go to 't90', 't53', or 't14'. But looking at the string, the first token is t17, which isn't directly a terminal reachable from NT30. Wait, does that mean the grammar doesn't produce t17 anywhere? Let me check all the productions for NT30.\n\nYes, looking through the NT30 productions: 't90', 't53', 't14' are the terminal options. So none of the NT30 productions result in t17. That's a problem because the string starts with t17, which should be derived from NT30. Since NT30 doesn't produce t17, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. \n\nWait, but am I missing something? Could t17 be derived through some intermediate steps? Let me see if any non-terminals produce t17. Looking through all productions, I don't see any NT producing 't17' directly. Are there any indirect routes?\n\nLooking through each production, let's see:\n\n- NT24: No, the productions don't go up to t24 except in certain NTs.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the string again. The first token is t17, which comes right after S (assuming starting with NT30 followed by NT53). But NT30 can't produce t17, so that's a dead end. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, immediately, the presence of t17 as the first token in the string makes it impossible for the grammar to generate it.

It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S has two productions: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So, every string derived from S must be formed by expanding these initial non-terminals into terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either a number (t seems to be a typo, maybe it's a terminal letter or just a marker) followed by a number, like 't31', 't7', etc. Wait, actually, each token seems to be a concatenation of 't' and numbers. Maybe each 't' is a symbol, but the grammar might be using 't' as a terminal, or maybe it's a typo. Hmm, the grammar's productions have 't' in them as terminals, so I think 't' is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see 't72', 't90', etc., which suggests that 't' followed by numbers is a terminal. So, each token like 't31' is actually a single terminal symbol 't31', not 't' followed by other symbols. That's a bit confusing because in the string, it's written as `t31 t7 t91...`, which could mean tokens separated by spaces, each being something like 't31', 't7', etc. Alternatively, maybe 't' is a separate terminal, and the rest are numbers. But the grammar only has 'T's as terminals, so 't' might be the only terminal, and each 't' followed by numbers is part of the terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, the only terminals are single-character letters, like 't7', which would be 't' followed by '7' as separate terminals. But in the string, each element is like 't31', which would be more than two terminals. Maybe the string is actually a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, each as a single terminal. So for example, 't31' is a single terminal, which is different from 't' and '3' and '1' individually. That makes sense because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, no. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar has productions like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, where NT are non-terminals, and some productions are to terminals like 't72', 't90', etc. So each production results in a single terminal symbol. So 't72' is a terminal. So when looking at the string, 't31' would require a production rule that directly produces 't31' as a single terminal. But in the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't31'. All the terminals in the grammar end with 't' followed by two digits, except for 't7', 't91', etc. Wait, no, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only terminals are 't7', 't91', 't53', 't7', 't59', 't46', 't4', 't10', 't32', 't80', etc. So 't31' is not a terminal in the grammar. Thus, the string has a token 't31', which might be a problem because in the grammar, 't31' might not be a terminal. So perhaps the grammar can't generate 't31' as a terminal, so the string has a 't31' which isn't allowed, making the answer 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's see the production for NT9 -> 't38' but there's no NT9 in the string. The string has 't31', which is not a terminal in the grammar, since looking through all the productions, I see NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', etc., but not 't31'. Similarly, NT31 isn't even a non-terminal; it's just part of the 't31' terminal which isn't present in the grammar.\n\nSo 't31' is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it includes 't31', which is not allowed. Thus, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Is there a way to derive 't31'? Let me check all the productions to see if any NT directly produce 't31'.

Wait, the grammar does not have any NT that produce 't31'. So 't31' cannot be a terminal in the grammar, meaning the string has a token that isn't possible, so 't31' can't be generated.

The grammar has several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. This structure is useful for certain parsing algorithms, but for this problem, I don't need to parse but rather to check if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe given grammar starts with the start symbol S, which has two main production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals.

It starts with 't12', which is a terminal. \n\nWait, the first production rule of S is S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So, the leftmost symbols would be derived starting with NT30 and NT53, both non-terminals. Therefore, the first part of the string generated by this grammar should be a sequence of terminals that comes from expanding NT30 and NT53. \n\nBut the given string starts with t12 t12. So, I need to see if t12 can be derived from NT30 or NT53. Looking through the production rules for NT30 and NT53:\n\nFor NT30, the production rules listed are:\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nHmm, so NT30 can be a terminal 't90', 't53', or 't14'. So, if the string starts with 't12', that doesn't match any production of NT30, since 't12' isn't listed. That's a problem because the first symbol in the string is 't12', but NT30 and NT53 don't produce 't12'. \n\nWait, let me double-check the production rules. Looking at NT15, which might be involved. But the string starts with t12, which isn't a terminal from NT30 or NT53. So, perhaps the string cannot be generated because the starting symbol S's first production requires NT30 and NT53, which don't generate t12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the string isn't starting with the correct symbols from S's production. The string starts with t12 t12, but S can only start with NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. NT30 can be t90, t53, or t14. NT35's production rules include NT15 NT1, and so on. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, every expansion step should only produce two symbols at a time, either terminals or non-terminals. So, the string is a series of terminals, and each must be the result of an expansion from the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, the first step is either S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Let's take the first one: S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Now, each of these non-terminals must expand into a terminal or another non-terminal. \n\nLooking at NT30, it can be either 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT53 can be checked for its production rules. Looking through the list, NT53 produces 't7', 't59', or 't1'. Wait, no, in the production rules, NT53 has several: NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1; NT53 \u2192 NT91; etc. None of these are terminals. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me list all the NT53 productions:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT53 \u2192 NT91\nNT56 \u2192 NT28 (Wait, no, NT53 is involved here)\nWait, NT53's production rules from the given list include:\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 NT91\n- NT53 \u2192 NT7 NT2 (Wait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.)\n\nLooking back, the production rules:\n\nNT53:\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 NT91\n- NT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT91 (Wait, that's a repeat. Or perhaps I need to look more carefully. Maybe I need to list all for NT53.\n\nFrom the given list:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT53 \u2192 NT91\nWait, I see NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 and NT53 \u2192 NT91. Then, other non-terminals like NT59 are further expanded. So, for example, NT46 \u2192 NT66, which might be terminal? Let me check NT66's productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT66: I don't see any NT66 in the given list. Wait, looking at the list, perhaps NT62 has productions, but NT66 is not there. Hmm, so maybe NT66 is a dead end? Or perhaps I misread. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given productions, I see NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16, and NT16 \u2192 't72', as one of the productions. So, perhaps NT66 is produced by some other rule. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in copying the rules. Let me go back.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\nAh, I see:\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\nHT16 \u2192 't72'\n\nWait, but NT66 isn't present in the list. So, perhaps there was a mistake, but in our case, we have NT66 in the string.\n\nWait, no, let me check the string: the string has 't66' in it. Looking back, the given rule includes NT46 \u2192 't66' as one of NT46's productions. Because in the list, I see NT46 \u2192 NT66. But wait, no, looking at the list, it's:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, the given list for NT46 is:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't66'\n\nSo NT46 directly goes to 't66'. Therefore, if NT46 is expanded, it produces 't66', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, going back: S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Let's say S expands to NT30 NT53. Now, each of these must expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: t90, t53, t14. The string starts with t12, which isn't any of these. So, that's a problem. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because NT30 and NT53 don't produce t12.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the string is not starting with a production from S's first rule but from another path. But no, because S's productions are the only way to start. So, the first two symbols must come from the S's first production, which is NT30 NT53. Neither of these non-terminals produce 't12' as their terminal, so it's impossible for the string to start with t12 t12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with another part, but that's impossible because S must start with NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. The string's first symbols must be the result of expanding these. Since none of the productions of NT30 or NT53 produce t12, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a production for NT30 or NT53. Looking again:\n\nNT30's productions are:\n\n- 't90'\n- 't53'\n- 't14'\n\nNo 't12' there. So, that's confirmed.\n\nSimilarly, NT53's productions include:\n\n- 't7', 't59', 't1', etc., but no 't12'.\n\nSo, the first two symbols of the string, 't12 t12', cannot be derived from S's first production rules. Therefore, the string cannot be a member of the language.\n\nI think that's the case.

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific Context-Free Grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what I know about CNF and how to parse strings using it.\n\nCNF is a form of CFG where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing because each production either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. But wait, in this grammar, some productions have multiple non-terminals on the right-hand side, so maybe I need to break them down further to fit the CNF structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a bit complex, but I notice that all the productions either result in a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, some might already be in CNF, but I should check each production to confirm. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is in CNF because it's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11 is also CNF, and so on. However, looking at some lines, I see something like NT30 -> 't53' and others like that. Oh, wait, those are terminal productions, so that's fine.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to derive the given string using this grammar. The string is: t32 t29 t14 t38 t91 t7 t27 t76 t45 t33 t73 t45 t33 t17 t29 t45 t27 t80 t29 t77 t40 t72 t66 t72. That's a long string with 24 tokens. Each token corresponds to a part of the derivation.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I should use a method like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can manually construct a parse tree or use a memoization approach. However, manually building a parse tree for a string with 24 tokens would be tedious, so perhaps I can approach this by breaking down the grammar into smaller parts and seeing how the terminals might be connected.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions to get a better idea. The non-terminals are S, NT30, NT35, NT43, NT15, NT45, NT33, NT1, NT5, NT62, NT56, NT7, NT30, NT30, NT30, NT1, NT53, NT7, NT56, NT11, NT59, NT32, NT1, NT59, NT15, NT10, NT44, NT4, NT46, NT53, NT9, NT4, NT15, NT4, NT59, NT9, NT53, NT16, NT5, NT1, NT62, NT53, NT9, NT53, NT56, NT11, NT59, NT32, NT1, NT59, NT15, NT44, NT4, NT46, NT53, NT9, NT53, NT56, NT11, NT59, NT32, NT1, NT59, NT15, NT44, NT4, NT46, NT53, NT9, NT53, NT56, NT11, NT59, NT32, NT1.\n\nWait, that's a lot of non-terminals, but actually, some are repeated. I think I listed all possible non-terminals. Now, perhaps I can represent the grammar in a more organized way, grouping by starting non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S. S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So any valid derivation starts with either of these.\n\nEach production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, for each terminal in the string, it must come from a production that ends with that terminal. For non-terminals, it must split into two other non-terminals whose productions can lead us closer to the string.\n\nI think the best approach is to represent the grammar as pairs and then use a top-down parser, tracking how the string can be derived from S. Alternatively, since the string is given, I can try breaking it down and see if I can reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string token by token. The string is: [t32, t29, t14, t38, t91, t7, t27, t76, t45, t33, t73, t45, t33, t17, t29, t45, t27, t80, t29, t77, t40, t72, t66, t72].\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\n1. t32: Looking at the grammar, t32 is produced by NT32 \u2192 't77', but wait, looking back, NT32 \u2192 't77'. Hmm, wait, in the given grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 't77'. But in our string, we have t32, which would correspond to NT32. But looking through the productions, there is no NT32 that directly produces t32. Wait, let me recheck. The given grammar has, for example, NT32 \u2192 't77'. Oh, no t32 is present in NT30's productions: NT30 can go to 't53', 't27', etc. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like NT30 -> 't32' (twice), NT30 -> 't53', and others. So, NT30 can produce 't32' among others.\n\nSo, t32 would come from NT30 \u2192 't32'. Then, after t32, we have t29. So after NT30, the next production is NT30 \u2192 't32' and what about the next part? Wait, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, so S is split into two non-terminals: NT30 and NT53. So the string would be a combination of the symbols derived from NT30 and NT53.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string as a series of non-terminals, each of which can split into two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me try to represent the string as a sequence of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent the string as a list and see how it can be built from S step by step, trying to match substrings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help. Let me try to see.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT30 NT53 first.\n\nSo, we have the initial node as S, with children NT30 and NT53.\n\nNow, NT30 can produce 't32' or other options, but let's pick 't32' since that's the first token in the string. So, NT30 \u2192 't32'. That would produce the first token t32.\n\nNow, the next part would come from NT53. So, after 't32', we have to get t29. So, we need to look at the derivation from NT53.\n\nWhat can NT53 produce? Checking the grammar, NT53 has multiple productions: -> 't7', -> 't1', 't4', etc. Wait, no: in the given productions, for example, NT53 \u2192 't7' is one production, and others like NT53 \u2192 't59' through various productions. So how does NT53 derive a string starting with t29?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me better approach this by trying to see each token in the string and see if it can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet me note down each token and see what non-terminal can produce it.\n\n1. t32: comes from NT30 \u2192 't32'.\n2. t29: comes from NT35 \u2192 't29' or NT62 \u2192 't43' \u2192 't16' \u2192 't72' (no, that's way too long). But perhaps from NT29. Wait, looking at the grammar, is there an NT29? No. Wait, I'm looking for NT that can produce t29. Checking the productions:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't29' (production: NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25; NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56; NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33; NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4; etc. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let's look for NT that can produce t29.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll note that all the rules in the grammar are of the form NT X \u2192 NT Y NT Z or NT X \u2192 a terminal. So, every non-terminal production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, or a single terminal. \n\nLooking at the string to parse, it's a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nThe string is: t59 t27 t72 t72 t14 t17 t59 t33 t72 t33 t91 t28 t33 t33 t31 t10 t89 t77 t29 t20 t73 t45 t12 t73.\n\nI'll try to approach this as a parsing problem, using a bottom-up or top-down method. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be feasible. Alternatively, I could try to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me see what the top-level production is. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So, the beginning symbols must be derived from one of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t59. Let me check which productions end with t59. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT59 isn't present. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT59 \u2192 t17. So that's t17, not t59. Hmm, that might not be directly helpful. Let me check other productions that might lead to t59 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT17, but it doesn't directly produce t59. Wait, NT59 \u2192 t17? Let me check the rules again. The user provided many rules, so let me look for NT59 in the grammar. Yes, in the list, there's NT59 -> t17. So if S \u2192 NT35 NT45, the first symbols from NT35 and NT45 could lead to t59.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for where t59 appears as a terminal. Let's see the rules where t59 is generated:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t59. So, when NT53 is expanded, it produces t59 as the terminal.\n\nAlso, NT59 \u2192 t17, but that would produce t17, not t59. So perhaps another approach.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is t59. So, I think I need to find a production that starts with t59. From the grammar, the only ways to get t59 as a terminal are through NT53 \u2192 t59. So perhaps S \u2192 NT35 NT45 can expand to include t59. Let me check:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT35 NT45, then S expands to NT35 followed by NT45. So the first symbol would be the start of NT35's derivation. If NT35 can produce t59, that's possible, but let me check.\n\nLooking at the production for NT35, it seems NT35 can be expanded in multiple ways. For example, NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, and NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25, etc. But in the string, the first symbol is t59, which is produced only by NT53. Therefore, the immediate left-hand side must involve NT53.\n\nWait, that's confusing because S can only derive NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the first two symbols in the string must come from either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. \n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is t59. So, if the first part is NT53, which can produce t59, then the initial production would be S \u2192 NT35 NT45, but then both NT35 and NT45 would contribute to the first symbol, which is t59.\n\nBut looking at the first symbol being t59, which can only come from NT53. So unless there's some NT35 or NT45 production that can generate a symbol starting with t59, which doesn't seem to be the case because the rules are all about non-terminals followed by symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Then, to have t59 as the first symbol, NT45 would need to produce t59, but from the rules, I don't see any production for NT45 that ends with t59. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT45\u2192 NT59 NT5. So if NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, then the first symbol would be from NT59, which when expanded, might produce t17, but that's not t59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is NT30 \u2192 t53, but that's not relevant here because the first symbol is t59, which is from NT53. So, perhaps the parsing starts with S \u2192 NT35 \u2192 NT... \u2192 t59, but I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string has 24 symbols. Since each production in the grammar either produces one terminal or two non-terminals, the derivation tree could have 24 leaves, but since some productions produce two non-terminals, the total number of steps would result in the correct number of symbols.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the string corresponds to the leftmost derivation steps. For a context-free grammar in CNF, the minimum number of productions to be applied (excluding the terminals) is equal to the number of symbols minus one. So, if the string has 24 symbols, the number of productions needed would be 23. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string from the left, looking for possible starting symbols.\n\nGiven S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nIf the first part is NT30, then NT30 can produce 't53'. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: NT30 can be t90, t53, or t27. Wait, no, looking back: In the rules, NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', and some others. Wait, looking through the rules, for NT30, the productions are:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90' (so produces t90)\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- Also, NT30 can be split into other combinations? Wait, no: NT30 is a non-terminal, and in Chomsky Normal Form, each body has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So in the grammar, NT30 \u2192 't90' is an atomic production, as well as other similar ones. So NT30 can only directly produce one terminal each production.\n\nLooking at the first symbol being t59, which comes from NT53. So the first step would have to be S \u2192 NT35 NT45, because S \u2192 NT30 NT53 would require the first symbol from NT30, which would produce t90, t53, etc., but our first symbol is t59, which isn't produced by NT30.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So the first two parts to derive are NT35 and NT45.\n\nNow, the first symbol of the string is t59, which comes from NT53. So to get t59 as the first symbol, the NT45 in S must somehow lead to t59. But looking at the productions for NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. So if NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, then the next step would be to derive NT59, which produces t17, not t59. So that can't directly produce t59 as the first symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT45 can produce a terminal. Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, which is two non-terminals. So to get t59 as a symbol, we'd need to have another production that directly gives t59. But in the initial step, we're using S \u2192 NT35 NT45.

So all the productions here are in CNF except I see some that might have more than two non-terminals, but looking closer, no, they seem to split into two parts each time.\n\nWait, some productions might be more complex, like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which is two non-terminals. The string starts with 't76', which I need to trace back through the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the productions for clarity:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't59'\nNT56 -> 't28'\nNT11 -> 't28'\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT32 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT59 -> 't28'\nNT15 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't45'\nNT46 -> 't66'\nNT53 -> 't91'\nNT9 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't53'\nNT15 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't33'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, some NT entries have multiple options, like NT30 can go to 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT1 can be 't89' or 't10', etc.\n\nSo the string is a series of tokens: t76, t33, t77, t77, t66, t72, t33, t24, t14, t38, t77, t32, t59, t89, t90, t32, t38, t90, t53, t89, t32, t27, t12, t59, t80.\n\nI'll need to see if each of these tokens can be derived by the grammar step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two parts, so the string should consist of a sequence where each step branches into two symbols, until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThis is essentially like building a parse tree where each node has exactly two children until we reach leaves which are terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is ambiguous, there could be multiple ways to parse the string. So the approach is to see if there's any valid parse tree that results in the given string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSo the string starts with t76, which I need to find where it appears as a terminal. Looking at the productions, 't76' is the terminal for NT44: NT44 \u2192 't76'.\n\nSo for the first part, t76, it must come from NT44. Now, looking back, how does NT44 derive 't76'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT44 has a production: NT44 \u2192 't76'. So the chain starts with NT44 \u2192 't76'.\n\nThen, looking at the next token, t33. But since the grammar produces two symbols at a time, after 't76', the next should be another symbol or part of another production. But in the string, the next token is t33, so maybe the next step is looking for an NT that produces 't76' and something else.\n\nWait, maybe the first two symbols should be part of a single production. Let's think again. Each step in the CNF grammar splits into two symbols, which could be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar's S \u2192 NT30 NT53, and the string starts with t76 t33.\n\nSo perhaps NT30 is generating t76, and NT53 is generating something else. Wait, but looking at the NT30 productions: NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', or 't14'. None are producing 't76', so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Then NT35 would produce something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to do this step by step.\n\nThe string is a series of 26 tokens, which suggests that the parse tree has a certain depth. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe string is: t76, t33, t77, t77, t66, t72, t33, t24, t14, t38, t77, t32, t59, t89, t90, t32, t38, t90, t53, t89, t32, t27, t12, t59, t80.\n\nStarting with S, which can be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nSuppose we take S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Then, the first token is t76, which would have to come from NT30. Looking at NT30's productions: NT30 can be 't90', 't53', or 't14'. None of these produce 't76', so S \u2192 NT30 can't be the start. Therefore, the first production must be S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT35 NT45. The first token is t76, which would have to come from either NT35 or NT45. Let's check NT35's productions: NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, so that's two non-terminals. No terminal, so that can't produce 't76' directly. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the first token is a terminal. So, the first production is S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So the two parts would be NT35 and NT45. Each of these can either be terminals or split further.\n\nLooking at NT35: it can split into NT15 and NT1. Then NT15 can split into NT44 and NT33. NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT33 \u2192 't77'. So in this path, NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1 \u2192 (NT44 NT33). Then NT44 \u2192 't76', NT33 \u2192 't77'. So the first two tokens would be t76, t77.\n\nBut in the string, the first two tokens are t76, t33. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT30 NT53, but as we saw, NT30 can't produce t76.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the entire string is built from two non-terminals at each step, each of which can be terminals or non-terminals that split further.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, building the tree.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.

Let me think through the steps I need to take to solve this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to parse or derive strings.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can see that all the production rules follow this structure. Each rule on the left side (like S, NT43, NT15, etc.) has either two non-terminals or a terminal.

I'll start from the beginning and see where the rules can apply.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t27. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT30 has productions to t27, t53, t14. Wait, the user wrote two lines for NT30: `NT30 -> 't90'`, `NT30 -> 't53'`, and `NT30 -> 't14'`, so that's three options.

Oh, in the grammar, NT10 has two rules: `NT10 -> 't73'` and `NT10 -> 't32'`.

Let me split the string correctly.\n\nWait, the string is: t17 t59 t14 t91 t77 t66 t27 t24 t32 t38 t53 t53 t17 t45 t14 t45 t14 t59 t12 t14 t72 t73 t59 t33 t80 t73.\n\nWait, maybe I should list the tokens in order and see which rules they come from.\n\nLet me list the string as a sequence:\n\n1. t17\n2. t59\n3. t14\n4. t91\n5. t77\n6. t66\n7. t27\n8. t24\n9. t32\n10. t38\n11. t53\n12. t53\n13. t17\n14. t45\n15. t14\n16. t45\n17. t14\n18. t59\n19. t12\n20. t14\n21. t72\n22. t73\n23. t59\n24. t33\n25. t80\n26. t73\n\nI think this might be too many steps, but perhaps I can start by breaking the string into factors according to the grammar.\n\nThe grammar starts with S which splits into two main parts, either NT30NT30 or NT35NT53.\n\nWait, wait, looking back: S-> NT30 NT30 or S-> NT35 NT53. So the string must start with either NT30 NT30, but in the string, it starts with t17 t59, which could be NT59 and NT? Hmm.\n\nWait, NT30 has several productions, including NT30 -> t90, NT30 -> t53, and others. But t17 is not any of those. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT30's productions:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT30 -> 't38'\n\nWait, but t17 isn't in there. Hmm, that's a problem. Then how does t17 appear in the string? Maybe I'm getting mixed up here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that S starts with either NT30 or NT35. Let me check the NT35 productions.\n\nNT35 has rules:\n\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nSo if S is NT35, the first production could be NT35 -> NT15 NT1.\n\nLooking at NT15, let's see:\n\nNT15 can produce NT4 NT33 or 't12'.\n\nWait, t12 is from NT15, right? Looking at the rules, yes: NT15 -> t12.\n\nSo if S is NT35, then the first part could be NT35 -> NT15 -> t12. But the string starts with t17, which is from NT59, not NT15. Therefore, this suggests that S cannot produce t17 unless S is using NT30.\n\nWait, but S's options are NT30 or NT35. So the first part of the string is t17, but that's from NT59, which is a separate non-terminal. Unless there's a rule that allows NT30 to reach NT59, but looking through the rules, NT30 has several rules but none of them directly lead to NT59. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through NT30's productions:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't27', 't38'. None of these produce non-terminals, right? So if the string starts with t17, which comes from NT59, but NT30 doesn't produce NT59. Therefore, it's impossible for S, which must start with NT30 or NT35, to produce the first t17 because it can't get there.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S-> NT30 NT30, S-> NT35 NT53.\n\nThen:\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\n\nNT1-> NT10 NT4\n\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\n\nAnd then several NTs mapping to terminals like 't72' etc.\n\nWait, looking for where 't17' is produced: from NT59, as per one of the lines: NT59 -> t17. So the string starts with t17, which must come from NT59.\n\nBut how does NT59 get into the parse? S must be either NT30 or NT35.\n\nSo if S is NT35, it splits into NT35 and NT53.\n\nWait, but then the left side must be NT35, leading to either NT15 NT1 or NT1 NT4.\n\nIf S is NT35, and produces NT15 NT1, then the first symbol would be the start of NT15.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t17, which is from NT59, which isn't directly reachable from S, because from S, you go through NT35 or NT30, neither of which leads to NT59.\n\nAlternatively, could the string have a production that requires NT30 to generate t17? But looking at NT30's rules, it only has four terminal options: t90, t53, t27, t38. None of these are t17. Therefore, it's impossible for NT30 to produce t17.\n\nSince the string starts with t17, which can't come from NT30's rules, the grammar can't generate this string. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe there's a longer way or a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe S starts as NT35, which can produce NT35 -> NT15 NT1. Then NT15 could produce t12, but the string's first symbol is t17. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, NT15 might produce NT44 NT33, leading to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t14 t12 t53 t32 t91 t12 t33 t76 t91 t31 t66 t45 t91 t32 t24 t31 t32 t89 t90 t32 t12 t77 t80 t29 t76 t45`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a grammar in CNF has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. This structure allows for an efficient parsing method, like the CYK algorithm. However, since I don't have to parse the string myself, I'll approach it differently.\n\nThe approach I can take is to look for a possible leftmost derivation or to identify any conflicts or inconsistencies that the string might have with the given grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has two options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT30 or NT35 followed by NT53 or NT45 respectively. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't14'. Now, I need to see if 't14' can be derived from NT30 or NT35, since S starts with either NT30 or NT35.\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT30 has multiple rules. Let's see which one can produce 't14'. Looking through the productions for NT30:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 NT53 NT10 (from line NT30: 't27' is also present, but I think each production is a separate rule. Wait, let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, each production is a separate rule. For NT30, there are several rules, but in this case, looking for the rule where NT30 directly produces 't14'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT30 has several productions, including NT30 \u2192 't90', NT30 \u2192 't53', and NT30 \u2192 't14'. Oh, so NT30 can directly go to 't14', which matches the first token. So that's promising.\n\nSo the first step would be S \u2192 NT30 NT53, and then NT30 \u2192 't14', leaving us with NT53 to produce the rest of the string starting after 't14'. \n\nNow, the next tokens are 't12', 't53', 't32', etc. So after 't14', the next part starts with 't12', which should come from NT53, since after the first rule, we have NT53 as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at NT53, its productions are:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 NT35 NT1\n- NT53 \u2192 NT45 NT59\n- NT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT91 NT7\n- NT53 \u2192 NT62 NT16\n- NT53 \u2192 NT53 NT...

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, especially in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLet me see the grammar provided. It's a bit extensive, with rules like S -> NT30 NT53 and multiple other productions leading to terminals and other non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers: `t29 t29 t40 t89 t72 t90 t38 t38 t66 t91 t33 t31 t40 t45 t29 t40 t45 t7 t20 t72 t40 t77 t33 t38 t59 t73 t80`.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the string into tokens: each part is a 't' followed by a two-digit number, like 't29', 't40', etc. So the string is a sequence of these tokens.\n\nNow, the grammar's starting symbol is S, and S has productions like NT30 NT53. So any string generated by this grammar will be built by expanding S into these non-terminals, which then produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string from the beginning, trying to find a way to break it down into the productions defined. Since the string is quite long, maybe I can look for the initial parts and see if they can be matched to top-down parsing rules.\n\nLooking at the first part: t29 t29 t40. Hmm, I don't immediately see a production that directly leads to t29 t29, but t29 must be a terminal somewhere. Let's check the grammar rules. Looking through the NT rules, I see NT25 -> 't25'? Wait, no, in the given grammar, I don't see any NT rules that directly produce 't29'. Hmm, that's odd. So perhaps t29 is a terminal in the grammar? But in the provided grammar, I only see some NT rules and some terminal rules like NT30 -> 't30', NT30 -> 't53', etc. Wait, does any NT rule produce 't29'? Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see things like NT25 -> 't29'? Wait, no. Wait, in the initial list of rules: \n\nLooking line by line:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nWait, here it is: NT25 -> 't29'. So NT25 is a rule that produces the terminal 't29'. That's important. So that means when we have a 't29' in the string, it could be generated by NT25.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't29', so maybe part of the derivation starts with NT25. Let me see if the first part of the string can be matched by expanding NT25.\n\nNT25 -> 't29'. So that would match the first 't29'. Then the next part is another 't29', so we'd also need another NT25. But how do they come together? Let's see, the grammar only gives us options for NT25: from looking at the rules, it seems there's an NT25 rule that goes to 't29' and another? Or maybe it's only that single rule? Wait, in the given grammar, I think the rule is NT25 -> nt30 nt56? Wait no, looking back:\n\nLooking at NT25: \"NT25 -> 't29'\". So that's it. Because in the initial list, under NT25: NT25 -> 't29'. So the only production for NT25 is 't29'.\n\nSo if the first token is 't29', which is NT25. Now, the next token is 't29' again, which would need another NT25. So that would imply that after the first NT25, we have another NT25. But in the grammar, how do you get from NT25 to two NT25s? It must come from a production that splits into two NT25s, but in the given rules, I don't see such a production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT25 only produces 't29'. So if you have NT25, you can only derive 't29'. But 't29' followed by another 't29' would require two NT25s, which is not possible because NT25 can't produce more. Therefore, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first t29 comes from a different NT rule. Wait, looking again: the string starts with 't29 t29', but in the grammar, is there a rule that combines to produce t29 t29? Let me think differently: perhaps the entire string is generated by expanding S in multiple steps.\n\nWait, S can go to NT30 NT53. So the first expansion would be S => NT30 NT53. Then each of those NTs can be expanded further. Let's try to see if the string can be built that way.\n\nSo the first production is S => NT30 NT53. Now, NT30 and NT53 can each be expanded into their respective rules.\n\nLooking at NT30, in the grammar: NT30 has multiple rules, like -> 't90', -> 't53', -> 't14', etc. So NT30 can produce several terminals. Similarly, NT53 has multiple productions, like -> 't7', etc.\n\nWait, but in our case, after S, we have two NTs: NT30 and NT53. Let's see, the first token is 't29', which is part of the string. So maybe NT30 somewhere needs to produce 't29'. But looking at the NT30 rules: t29 isn't among them. From the given grammar, I don't see NT30 being a rule that produces 't29'. Oh, wait, in the initial grammar, I see NT25 -> 't29', but not NT30. So 't29' can't come from NT30. Hmm, so that might not be the right path.\n\nWait a minute, the string starts with 't29 t29 t40 ...'. So two 't29's in a row. Since 't29' can only come from NT25, which can't split further, I guess that the only way to have two consecutive 't29's is that each 't29' comes from a different NT25, but how? Because in the grammar, NT25 only produces 't29', so you can't get two NT25s in a production unless they are present in a parent production.\n\nWait, but S -> NT30 NT53, which means after expansion, both NT30 and NT53 would have to produce these terminals. But if 't29' doesn't come from NT30 or NT53, it must come from some other non-terminal, perhaps indirectly. But in the given grammar, it seems that 't29' is only produced by NT25. So perhaps the whole string cannot be generated because it requires two 't29's, which can't come from the same or different NT25s within the S's production.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after S, the NT30 and NT53 each can produce multiple branches. Maybe NT30 could produce 't29' through some chain of productions, but looking at NT30's rules, I don't see any indirect way to get 't29' from NT30. Similarly, NT53's rules don't include 't29' directly or indirectly. So perhaps the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again at the grammar rules.

Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slowly.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to check is a sequence of tokens. Each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol, so I need to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbols (S in this case) down to the terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t28 t29 t17 t33 t33 t40 t29 t31 t89 t73 t7 t12 t20 t28 t90 t33 t10 t12 t66 t31 t72 t12 t17 t45 t7 t24 t20`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions: NT30 NT53, or NT35 NT45. So the string should start with two parts that come from either S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nLet me see how the string begins: it starts with t28. So I need to see which production could lead to t28.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT15 -> NT1 NT25, but that's probably not relevant here. Let me list the relevant non-terminals and their productions.\n\nWait, I think I need to first look at the NT productions and see which can derive to specific terminals.\n\nLet me list all NTs and what they produce:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', 't30' (wait, actually in the grammar, NT30 has multiple productions to terminals and other NTs). Wait, the grammar as given seems a bit messy in formatting, but each line represents a production.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45. Then the NTs have various productions, some to terminals and others to combinations of NTs.\n\nEach production is of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ or NTX -> terminal.\n\nSo for example, NT30 has multiple productions to terminals: 't30' (wait, no, the first NT30 line says -> 't90', then another line has NT30 -> 't53', then another line says NT30 -> 't14', etc. So each NT30 line is a separate production. So NT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', 't30'\u2014but wait, maybe I'm misparsing the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar is written in a way that each line is a production, so for NT30, there are multiple lines. Let's parse them:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' (probably an error, as NT30 can't derive a single 't90' if it's multi-token? Wait no, in the problem, the string is a list of tokens, so I think each 'tXX' is a single terminal symbol. Wait, the grammar productions are written as NTX -> NTY NTZ, which means two non-terminals, so each production step produces two non-terminals. But the string is a list of terminals, so I need to see how these non-terminals can generate the given sequence.\n\nWait no, because the start symbol S is producing two NTs, each of which may produce sequences of symbols. So the total expansion will be sequences of these NTs expanding into terminals and other NTs.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should map out the possible trees or try to see what sequences of symbols can come from each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree for the string could help. Let me consider the start symbol S, which branches into two parts: either NT30 and NT53, or NT35 and NT45.\n\nSo the string should be the combination of the two sequences derived from each NT.\n\nSo the string length is 25 tokens. Each NT expansion will produce a certain number of tokens. Let me think about how each NT can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the first production S -> NT30 NT53, the string would consist of the expansion of NT30 followed by the expansion of NT53, concatenated.\n\nSimilarly, for S -> NT35 NT45, the string would consist of NT35's expansion followed by NT45's expansion.\n\nNow, the string provided is 25 tokens. Let me see if I can split it into two parts: the first n tokens from NT30 and the next (25-n) tokens from NT53, for some n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT30 and NT53 each generate a certain number of tokens, and their concatenation is the entire string. Let me count how many tokens the string has. The string is: t28 t29 t17 t33 t33 t40 t29 t31 t89 t73 t7 t12 t20 t28 t90 t33 t10 t12 t66 t31 t72 t12 t17 t45 t7 t24 t20. Hmm, count: let me see, that's 26 tokens? Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the string is: \n\n`t28 t29 t17 t33 t33 t40 t29 t31 t89 t73 t7 t12 t20 t28 t90 t33 t10 t12 t66 t31 t72 t12 t17 t45 t7 t24 t20`\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me count: 28,29,17,33,33,40,29,31,89,73,7,12,20,28,90,33,10,12,66,31,72,12,17,45,7,24,20. That's 27 tokens. Hmm, so the string length is 27. Therefore, when split between NT30 and NT53, the sum of their derived token counts should be 27. Or alternatively, the other starting production.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the string length. Let me count again: the string as written is a sequence of words separated by spaces. Let me count:\n\n1. t28\n2. t29\n3. t17\n4. t33\n5. t33\n6. t40\n7. t29\n8. t31\n9. t89\n10. t73\n11. t7\n12. t12\n13. t20\n14. t28\n15. t90\n16. t33\n17. t10\n18. t12\n19. t66\n20. t31\n21. t72\n22. t12\n23. t17\n24. t45\n25. t7\n26. t24\n27. t20\n\nYes, 27 tokens. So if S is expanded into NT30 and NT53, the sum of tokens from NT30 and NT53 is 27. Alternatively, if it's NT35 and NT45, the sum would be 27 as well. Let me check the production rules for each NT to see what they can generate.\n\nStarting with NT30. The production rules for NT30 are:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90' (but that's a single terminal; in a context-free grammar, that would mean NT30 can produce a single terminal symbol, which would be a single 't90'.)\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT30 -> 't30'\n\nWait, but in the original grammar, it's written as multiple lines, which I think represent multiple production options. So, NT30 can be any of these: 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', 't30'. So NT30 can directly produce any of these tokens in a single step.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT35:\n\n- NT35 -> 't15' NT4\n- NT35 -> 't1' NT25\n- NT35 -> 't1' NT4\n- NT35 -> 't45' NT5\n- etc. (Wait, looking back, the production lines for NT35 are: NT35 -> NT15 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This simplification makes it easier to analyze the grammar, especially for parsing.\n\nThe provided grammar consists of several production rules starting with S and other non-terminals (NTs). Each rule either splits a non-terminal into two others or into a terminal.

Or is it a series of different rules for the same non-terminal? Wait, the initial grammar has S and other non-terminals. The structure seems a bit unclear, maybe I should parse each rule correctly.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. Each line is a production rule. For example, the line `S -> NT30 NT53` is one rule, `S -> NT35 NT45` is another. Then each NT has its own rules:\n\nLooking for NT30, for example:\n\n`NT30 -> 't90'` (which is a terminal)\n`NT30 -> 't53'`\n`NT30 -> 't14'`\n\nSimilarly, NT1 has:\n\n`NT1 -> 't89'`\n`NT1 -> 't10'`\n`NT1 -> 't4'`\n\nWait, that can't be right, as NT1 is a non-terminal and can't produce multiple terminals directly. Or perhaps I'm misreading the production rules.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try to parse each line correctly.\n\nThe grammar is given in parts, with the initial S rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nThen, the non-terminals:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n\nWait, but in the initial description, each production starts with a non-terminal and then has the right-hand side. For example, the line `S -> NT30 NT53` is S producing NT30 and NT53, which are themselves to be expanded.\n\nBut in the case of NT30, the productions are:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, but NT30 is a non-terminal, so it cannot produce a terminal directly unless it's explicitly listed. So, for example, NT30 can directly produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't89'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT1 has several production rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n\nNT1 \u2192 't89'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, that seems to be a series of rules for NT1, some recursive and some sending to terminals.\n\nSo, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt14 t73 t53 t33 t40 t33 t89 t77 t32 t73 t12 t53 t28 t32 t32 t90 t53 t10 t77 t14 t33 t38 t20 t45 t45 t38 t40 t53\n\nI need to parse this string step by step, ensuring that each symbol can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll approach this by splitting the string into tokens:\n\n['t14', 't73', 't53', 't33', 't40', 't33', 't89', 't77', 't32', 't73', 't12', 't53', 't28', 't32', 't32', 't90', 't53', 't10', 't77', 't14', 't33', 't38', 't20', 't45', 't45', 't38', 't40', 't53']\n\nNow, starting from S, which can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t14. So the first part of S must be either NT30 or NT35, which produce t14 or whatever.\n\nLooking at the possible options for NT30: 't14' is one of them.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation adds exactly one non-terminal symbol, which should eventually be replaced by terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the initial step would involve S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. \n\nLet me pick one of these paths. Let's try S \u2192 NT30 NT53 first.\n\nNow, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14' according to the rules. Similarly, NT53 can produce 't7' or 't59'. \n\nSo, if NT30 becomes 't30' (but wait, no, in the productions, NT30 is a non-terminal that can produce terminals. So, when deriving, for example, NT30 \u2192 't90', or 't53', or 't14'.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 can produce 't7' or 't59'.\n\nSo, if I choose, for example, NT30 \u2192 't90' and NT53 \u2192 't7', then the string starts with t90 t7. But in our target string, the first symbol is t33, so that path might not be the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT30 \u2192 't53' and NT53 \u2192 't59', but then t53 and t59 would lead to something else, but again, the first symbols in our string are t33, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for the entire string as a sequence of terminals that can be generated by merging two non-terminals at each step.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the rightmost derivation, but maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down into the production rules given.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminals: t33, t45, t31, etc. So perhaps I can parse this string from left to right, using the grammar to see if each part can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals, and the string is a combination of these. So the length of the string should be 2^n for some n, where n is the number of steps. But the string here has 21 elements, which is odd, so that might be impossible. Wait, wait, no. The start is S, which is two non-terminals. Each application of a production rule replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols. So the total number of symbols in the derived string should increase by 1 each time. So starting with S (1 symbol), after one step: 2 symbols, then 3, then 4, etc. So the length of the string should be something like 2^n. 2^5 is 32. But our string has 21 symbols, which is not a power of 2. So that's a problem. Hmm, that might mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, because the number of symbols should follow the power of 2 growth.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time you apply a production, the number of symbols increases by one. So starting from S (1 symbol), after 1 production, it's 2 symbols, then when you produce each of those non-terminals, you add one each time. But depending on the productions, maybe the string can have any length that is 1 + k, where k is the number of productions applied. Wait, no. Let me get this straight.\n\nIn CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So starting with S (1 symbol), each application of a production replaces a single symbol with two, so the length increases by 1. So the possible lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., but each time you can only add one symbol at a time. So the total length after n productions is n+1.\n\nBut here, our target string has 21 symbols. To get from 1 (S) to 21, we need 20 productions. So that's possible. Because the number of symbols grows as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\nWait, but actually, each production increases the number of symbols by one. So yes, 21 can be achieved by 20 productions.\n\nSo the issue is not the length but whether the terminals can be matched correctly.\n\nWait, another thing: in the grammar, many non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. So each non-terminal can be a terminal in one production and another non-terminal in another.\n\nSo, maybe the string can be built by combining non-terminals into terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string using the grammar, maybe using a top-down approach.\n\nThe string is: t33 t45 t31 t17 t72 t80 t24 t29 t91 t17 t31 t24 t76 t20 t38 t32 t38 t72 t10 t27 t20 t14 t12 t10 t24 t59 t20 t80.\n\nWait, actually, the string is: \"t33 t45 t31 t17 t72 t80 t24 t29 t91 t17 t31 t24 t76 t20 t38 t32 t38 t72 t10 t27 t20 t14 t12 t10 t24 t59 t20 t80\"\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how many symbols that is. Let me count:\n\nt33 (1)\n\nt45 (2)\n\nt31 (3)\n\nt17 (4)\n\nt72 (5)\n\nt80 (6)\n\nt24 (7)\n\nt29 (8)\n\nt91 (9)\n\nt17 (10)\n\nt31 (11)\n\nt24 (12)\n\nt76 (13)\n\nt20 (14)\n\nt38 (15)\n\nt32 (16)\n\nt38 (17)\n\nt72 (18)\n\nt10 (19)\n\nt27 (20)\n\nt20 (21)\n\nt14 (22)\n\nt12 (23)\n\nt10 (24)\n\nt24 (25)\n\nt59 (26)\n\nt20 (27)\n\nt80 (28)\n\nWait, the string has 28 symbols? Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"t33 t45 t31 t17 t72 t80 t24 t29 t91 t17 t31 t24 t76 t20 t38 t32 t38 t72 t10 t27 t20 t14 t12 t10 t24 t59 t20 t80\"\n\nLet me count the words:\n\n1. t33\n\n2. t45\n\n3. t31\n\n4. t17\n\n5. t72\n\n6. t80\n\n7. t24\n\n8. t29\n\n9. t91\n\n10. t17\n\n11. t31\n\n12. t24\n\n13. t76\n\n14. t20\n\n15. t38\n\n16. t32\n\n17. t38\n\n18. t72\n\n19. t10\n\n20. t27\n\n21. t20\n\n22. t14\n\n23. t12\n\n24. t10\n\n25. t24\n\n26. t59\n\n27. t20\n\n28. t80\n\nSo there are 28 symbols.

The string is a series of \"t\" followed by numbers, and I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But wait, no, Chomsky normal form usually has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production is either A -> BC or A -> a.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, all the productions on the right side have two non-terminals except one for NT1, which has a terminal. Wait, no, actually, most of them are non-terminals. For example, S -> NT30 NT53, S->NT35 NT45, and others. Then, many NT rules, like NT43-> NT53 NT11, but some are like NT15->NT1 NT25 or NT1->NT10 NT4, and some NT rules end with a terminal, like NT30->'t90', or 't53', etc.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production must have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, if a production has a single terminal, that would mean the rule has A -> a, which is allowed. So, in this grammar, some rules have a terminal on the right side, like S-> NT30 NT53 (two non-terminals), but then NT30 can be a terminal or another production. Wait, no, NT30 can be a terminal because it has rules like NT30->'t90', NT30->'t53', NT30->'t14'. So, that makes sense because in Chomsky normal form, non-terminals can have productions that end in terminals.\n\nSo, the start symbol is S, and the string we have to check is t10 t89 t33 t10 t27 t10 t29 t40 t20 t12 t59 t53 t76 t89 t10 t77 t90 t12 t89 t66 t59 t73 t10 t90 t12 t12 t10 t14 t20.\n\nI need to parse this string into a sequence of terminals and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is given, perhaps building a parse tree would help.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can represent the production of S as NT30 NT53. So the first two symbols derived from S should be either NT30 and NT53. Let's check the string.\n\nThe string starts with t10 t89. Looking at NT30's rules, NT30 can go to 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Also, NT30 can be derived via other rules, but the initial token is t10. So t10 is a terminal, so it's part of NT10.\n\nWait, but S's production is either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the first two symbols in the string would be derived from NT30 and NT53 or from NT35 and NT45.\n\nBut in the given string, the first is t10, then t89. So perhaps the first production is from NT10 and NT89. Wait, but in S's rules, S can only produce NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. So the string's first two terminals should be either the first part of some NT rules that combine into two terminals.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because S is split into two non-terminals, each of which may expand into multiple symbols when using multiple production steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start with S and see what could generate the given string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at S, it can be split as NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let me first check if the string starts with NT30 NT53.\n\nSo the first symbol is t10. Let's see which NT rule t10 is part of. Looking through the grammar, NT1 has rules: NT1->NT10 NT4, and also NT1->'t89', etc. Wait, let me list the NT rules that can produce 't10':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an NT rule for 't10' except in NT1->'t10 NT4'. Wait, no, the individual NT rules are listed as NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'; NT1->'t73', 't89', 't10', etc.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT30 has 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT1 has 't73', 't89', 't10'\n- NT5 has 't53', 't43'\n- NT53 has 't28', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT15 can be 't25' (from NT25->'t29')?

I need to see if there's a way to derive this string using the grammar.\n\nStrategy: Start from the string and try to parse it using the reverse process, i.e., see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nFirst, note that S produces either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So, the entire string must be composed of two parts: one part from NT30 and another from NT53, or one from NT35 and another from NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 25 tokens. Let's see:\n\nIf S is NT30 NT53, then part1 is from NT30 and part2 from NT53. Alternatively, if S is NT35 NT45, part1 from NT35 and part2 from NT45.\n\nBut wait, the grammar allows multiple steps, so perhaps the string could be broken down into more than two parts, but according to the initial productions, each non-terminal only expands further non-terminals. So the entire string must be built by a series of such steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must come directly from the initial S via two main parts.\n\nBut looking at the string, the last part is t17, which is a terminal. So perhaps the entire string can be reduced by seeing if it's possible.\n\nLet's go through the string from the end.\n\nThe last token is 't17'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't17'? Checking the productions, NT59 -> 't17'. So, the last part of the string must come from NT59.\n\nSo, the end part is 't17', coming from NT59. So before that in the string, the token before t17 is 't53', then 't53', then t72, etc.\n\nWait, let me write the string as a list:\n\n['t24', 't31', 't40', 't20', 't45', 't80', 't59', 't45', 't72', 't53', 't17', 't80', 't12', 't32', 't66', 't10', 't73', 't73', 't12', 't40', 't28', 't45', 't53', 't72', 't90', 't72', 't45', 't53', 't17']\n\nSo, the last token is 't17' which is produced by NT59. So, the last part is generated by NT59. Before that, the next token is 't53', which in the string is the 9th last token (since the total length is 25,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-435","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string is quite long with a bunch of tokens like 't29', 't10', etc. Hmm, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if each pair of symbols can be produced by the given rules. The string is: t29 t10 t29 t91 t32 t7 t38 t72 t66 t29 t38 t32 t29 t32 t73 t28 t73 t20 t10 t77 t10 t77 t32 t28 t89 t77 t40 t32 t45 t17.\n\nI think the approach here is to break down the string into pairs or check if each symbol can be derived from the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So starting from the start symbol S, which in the given grammar has two productions: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSo the string starts with t29. Looking at the grammar, I need to see where 't29' appears. Let me look through the productions. Under NT25, I see it produces 't29'. So 't29' can come from NT25.\n\nNow, the first part is t29 t10 t29... Let's see, each non-terminal must be expanded into terminals, and the expansions are based on the productions. Let's take the first 't29' which comes from NT25. Then 't10' comes next. Let me check NT10's productions. Wait, looking back, I see NT10 has a production: NT10 \u2192 't73'. So that would be 't73' not 't10'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT10: NT10 -> 't73'. Oh, but in the string, after t29, it's t10. So how does that happen? Maybe I missed something in the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at NT1: NT1 can produce NT4, which then could go to other terms. Wait, maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, and the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1, where n is the depth of the tree. Wait, let me check the string length. Wait, the string has 31 tokens. 2^5 -1 is 31, so it suggests that the derivation tree would be a five-level tree. So maybe the derivation is of length 5 steps.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into pairs of symbols that correspond to the productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. The string starts with t29, which I think comes from NT25. So the first symbol is from NT25, which is derived from NT25 -> 't29'. So that leaves me with NT25 as the first non-terminal symbol, and next symbols should come from the expansions of NT25 and NT30 or whatever it produces.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to see if each symbol in the string can be mapped to a rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map the string step by step. Let me list the string:\n\nt29, t10, t29, t91, t32, t7, t38, t72, t66, t29, t38, t32, t29, t32, t73, t28, t73, t20, t10, t77, t10, t77, t32, t28, t89, t77, t40, t32, t45, t17.\n\nWait, but parsing this as a string, since the grammar is in CNF, we can build the parse tree level by level.\n\nLet me consider the structure:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can be derived from S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nEach of these non-terminals must then be expanded, and so on, until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, each part of the string must fit into the productions of these non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to walk through the string.\n\nAssuming the first production is S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nSo NT30 and NT53 must expand into the string. Let's look at the first few symbols: t29 t10 t29...\n\nWait, so if S is NT30 followed by NT53, then the first part would be the expansion of NT30, then the expansion of NT53.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, what is NT30's production? Looking back, in the grammar, under NT30, there are several productions: NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't27', etc. Wait, but in the given grammar, I think there was multiple options for NT30. Wait, looking back, no, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I have:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nBut the way it's presented might not be clear. Wait, in the problem, it's written as:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nSo, those are three separate productions for NT30.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 has a production: NT10 -> 't73'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two symbols are t29 t10.\n\nHmm. So perhaps starting with S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nLet me try assuming S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nThen the first symbol must come from NT30's expansions, which could be 't90', 't53', 't27', etc.\n\nBut the first symbol is t29, which isn't directly in the productions of NT30. So that means that perhaps S is starting with another production. Let me see the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the productions of S are S -> NT30 NT53 and S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nSo both options start with some non-terminal. Let me see the production for NT35.\n\nNT35 is the first symbol in the other option. Let's see what NT35 expands to. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1.\n\nSo that would be a two-symbol production. So S could be derived as NT35 NT45, leading to NT35, then NT45.\n\nNow, looking at NT35's production, it's NT15 and NT1. So the string would start with NT15 and NT1.\n\nWait, but NT1's production? NT1 can be derived from NT15 and NT4, perhaps. Let me see.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT15 -> NT12\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 ... Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps starting with S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSo, the first part is NT35, which is NT15 followed by NT1. So the first two symbols are from NT15 and NT1.\n\nBut the string starts with t29, t10. So NT15 would have to produce a terminal symbol, but looking at NT15's productions: NT15 -> NT12, NT15-> NT44 NT33, NT15-> t12, etc. Hmm, wait. Let me check the grammar properly.\n\nLooking at the grammar again:\n\nNT15 can produce:\n\n\u2192 NT12\n\n\u2192 NT44 NT33\n\n\u2192 't12'\n\nAlso, other NT15's as per the grammar: (looking back at the user's message?)\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar productions. Let me list them all to make sure.\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\n\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n\nNT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except for the start symbol. Since the start symbol here is S, the productions for S have two non-terminals each, and others have either two or one non-terminals, probably because they are terminals, I think.\n\nLet me look at the grammar and the string. The string is: `t7 t91 t45 t66 t29 t28 t27 t91 t10 t53 t45 t17 t53 t12 t66 t72 t77 t73 t14 t29 t28 t10 t10 t31 t28 t12 t72 t32 t38 t33`.\n\nFirst, I should note that in Chomsky normal form, when a symbol is a terminal, its production may just produce that terminal. So for example, S can produce certain non-terminals, which in turn can derive into a string of terminals.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar, starting from S and applying the productions until I get the entire string. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see if the string can be broken down into substrings that match the productions. Since the string is long, this might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can map each symbol in the string to their possible origins. Let me list the string as a sequence: t7, t91, t45, t66, t29, t28, t27, t91, t10, t53, t45, t17, t53, t12, t66, t72, t77, t73, t14, t29, t28, t10, t10, t31, t28, t12, t72, t32, t38, t33.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53 (twice)\n\nSo the first step is to see what S can produce. Each S production is a combination of two non-terminals. Let's see the options:\n\nS can be NT30 followed by NT53, or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t7. Looking at the productions, for example, NT16 -> 't72', but that's not t7. Wait, let's check the productions for each symbol.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nFor example, NT15 -> NT1 NT25.\n\nLooking for 't' symbols:\n\nI see that NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14'.\n\nWait, in the initial productions, NT30 is listed several times with different terminals:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 can produce 't7', 't59', 't17'.\n\nAlso, NT59 -> 't59' -> 't28'? Wait no, let's check each production step by step.\n\nWait, let me go through the productions line by line.\n\nFirst few:\n\n```S -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't59'\nNT56 -> 't28'\nNT11 -> 't28'\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT32 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT59 -> 't28'\nNT15 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't45'\nNT46 -> 't66'\nNT53 -> 't91'\nNT9 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't53'\nNT15 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't33'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT16 -> 't31'\n```\n\nSo each production for non-terminals leads to certain terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with t7. Looking at the productions, 't7' comes from NT16 and NT53. Specifically, NT53 can produce 't7' (since looking at the productions, NT53 can go to 't7' or 't59' or 't17').\n\nSo the first step is to consider whether the string starts with NT53 or another rule.\n\nWait, because S is the start, and S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT30 NT53. Let's check if the first two symbols are compatible.\n\nThe string's first symbol is t7. Suppose that t7 comes from NT53. So the first is NT53, which then should be followed by NT30 or something else?\n\nNo, actually, the production S is NT30 and NT53 together, and the string would have the result of NT30 followed by NT53, expanding each into their respective strings.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting this wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the string is divided into two parts corresponding to NT30 and NT53, then each NT30 and NT53 would expand into a sub-string.\n\nIn that case, looking at the start of the string: First symbol is t7, which might come from a production of NT53. Then after that, the first symbol is t7, so if NT53 is producing t7, then the next symbol (t91) would come from the expansion of NT30.\n\nWait, but wait: looking at the grammar, S can produce NT30 NT53, so the entire string would be the concatenation of the derivations of NT30 and NT53.\n\nFor example, S -> NT30 NT53: when expanded, it becomes (NT30 derived string) followed by (NT53 derived string).\n\nSo the string should be the concatenation of two parts: first part is what NT30 expands to, second part is what NT53 expands to.\n\nLet me see. Let's see the first few symbols: t7 t91 t45 t66...\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPart 1: Expanding NT30. What does NT30 derive?\n\nLooking at NT30 productions, it can be t90, t53, or t14.\n\nWait, but in the first step, NT30 could be a terminal, or it could go to another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but NT30 expands to a terminal, but according to the productions, NT30 has several productions to terminals. For example, NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. In the given grammar, I see that some rules like NT30-> 't90' are actually terminal productions, which is not typical for a grammar in CNF, as in CNF all productions should have two non-terminals.

Let me look through all the rules and find which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\n- NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'.

Looking through the list, I don't see NT44 having a production that ends in a terminal except for rule 36: NT44-> 't76'? Wait yes, rule 36: NT44 -> 't76'. So NT44 is a terminal 't76'.\n\nAnd rule 8: NT15-> NT44 NT33.

{"custom_id":"request-446","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a series of production rules, and the string to check is quite long with all these 't' words. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have specific productions where each non-terminal (A) is rewritten as two terminals or two non-terminals. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that because each left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is quite long, and it's a list of 't' words separated by spaces. My task is to parse this string into the correct order according to the grammar. Since this is a CNF grammar, the parsing can be tricky, but perhaps I can find a way to build the string step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The grammar has two initial productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo the first step is choosing between these two options, but since the string starts with 't33', maybe I should see if that can fit into any of these.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT30 can derive to 't30' or other non-terminals. For example, NT30 \u2192 't90' or 't53' or 't27', and others. So perhaps NT30 will expand into a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 can derive to 't53', 't91', 't72', etc. So perhaps S \u2192 NT30 NT53 would expand into something like t30 followed by something else.\n\nThe given string starts with t33, which I think is a terminal, so let's check if any non-terminals can produce t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT33 \u2192 't33'. So that's a direct production. Hmm, but how does that connect into the larger string?\n\nWait, the string starts with t33, but according to the start symbol, S is either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. How can the string start with t33? That seems problematic unless one of those production paths includes t33, but I don't see how S directly produces t33.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. The string starts with t33, but S can't directly produce t33 because all its productions produce two non-terminals. So perhaps the first production is a combination that eventually leads to t33 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, no, S produces two non-terminals, each of which can expand into strings. So for the string to start with t33, either the first non-terminal (NT30 or NT35) must produce a string that starts with t33, or the production chain somehow leads to t33 as the first symbol.\n\nBut looking at NT30, one of its productions is NT30 \u2192 't27', another is 't53', and others. So to get 't33', perhaps one of the NT symbols can expand to t33 through a chain of productions. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT33: it directly produces 't33'. Now, where does NT33 come from? Looking through the productions, I don't see any direct productions that lead to NT33 except maybe from NT31 through NT9 or something? Wait, let me scan all the productions for NT33.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't72'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't27'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't59', 't91'\n- NT56 \u2192 't45', 't28'\n- NT11 \u2192 't28'\n- NT59 \u2192 't17', 't28'\n- NT32 \u2192 't77'\n- NT1 \u2192 't10'\n- NT59 \u2192 't28'\n- NT15 \u2192 't12', 't10'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32', 't44', etc.\n\nWait, no, looking back, I don't see NT33 directly connected to other NTs except in:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25, etc.\n\nWait, I'm looking for NT33's parents. The only NT that directly produces NT33 is NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, but that doesn't help. Wait, looking at all the NT rules, I think I might have missed some.\n\nWait, actually, I see that NT33 can be derived from NT45 and NT7? Or perhaps not. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, in the list, I don't see any NTs that directly have NT33 except in NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1, and NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7. So, NT33 is a non-terminal that must be derived from NT62 and NT7, but where do those come from?\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT16 \u2192 't72'\n- So NT62 would produce something like NT43's expansion plus 't72'. But where does NT43 come from?\n\nAlso, NT7 \u2192 't91'\n\nSo, let's think, for t33 to be the first symbol, it must come from NT33, which must come from NT62 NT7, which then comes from NT43 (from NT62's expansion) and NT16 (which is 't72').\n\nSo, NT43 \u2192 't40' (from the rules, I think NT43 \u2192 't40'). So NT43 is 't40', and NT7 is 't91'. So NT62 would produce 't40' followed by 't72'? Or wait, NT62 is 't72'? No, NT16 is 't72', and NT62 is 't43 followed by t16', which are 't40' and 't72'. So NT62 \u2192 't40 t72'.\n\nThen, NT59 \u2192 't17' or 't28'. Wait, but how does NT59 get derived?\n\nWait, stepping back. The string starts with t33, which is part of NT33. To produce t33, the NT33 must be expanding to 't33'. So the expansion of NT33 starts with 't33', followed by what comes from its second part, which is NT7.\n\nWait, NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7. So NT62 is 't40 t72' and NT7 is 't91'. So NT33 would expand to 't40 t72 t91', meaning the string part would be 't40 t72 t91'. But the string starts with 't33', not 't40'.\n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps t33 is the direct expansion of NT33. So if NT33 can produce 't33' directly, then the initial part of the string could be 't33'.\n\nWait, looking back, yes, the grammar has NT33 \u2192 't33'. So that's a production. So perhaps that's the start: NT33 \u2192 't33', then followed by what comes from its other part.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT33 is a non-terminal, and it's only defined as NT33 \u2192 't33'. So that makes NT33 produce 't33'. So the string 't33' would be exactly that, but in our case, the string is longer, so we have 't33 t27 t66 t10 ...'\n\nWait, that can't be because S can't produce a single non-terminal; it's always expanding to two non-terminals. So 't33 t27' would come from NT30 NT53, which would be something like NT30 (which is 't27') and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the NT46 production: NT46 \u2192 NT59 NT5. Wait, but NT46 also has a terminal production t66? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking for '40' in terminals: NT40? Wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT43 \u2192 t40?\n\nWait, let me go through all the grammar rules and see if any NT produces t40.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t76 (I think)\nWait, no. Wait, the list has:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\nWait, looking through:\n\nI see NT46 \u2192 t66. So that's a terminal. Also, NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. NT45's production is a combination. Wait, but t40 is in the string. Where does t40 come from?\n\nLooking again, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t66? Or wait, in the list, I see multiple NT productions ending with certain terminals:\n\nWait, looking for NT \u2192 t40:\n\nLooking through each NT, for example, NT43 \u2192 t40 (yes: NT43 \u2192 t40), NT1 \u2192 t89, NT33 \u2192 t62, etc. So NT43 can produce t40.\n\nSo to get the first token t40, there must be a path where NT43 starts, and then t40 is produced from somewhere else.\n\nBut the string starts with t40, so the derivation would have to produce t40 somewhere at the start. But since S is a combination of NTs, perhaps the derivation begins with S, then splits into NT30 and NT53, or NT35 and NT45.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t40. Let's think: Maybe the NT43 is involved because NT43 can produce t40. So how can we get t40 as the first symbol?\n\nWait, if S is expanded into NT30 and NT53, which are both non-terminals. So perhaps in the derivation, the NT30 and NT53 each expand into other components, which then produce the tokens in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has been broken down into tokens corresponding to the NT productions, but let's think step by step.\n\nThe string is: t40 t20 t10 t91 t76 t20 t76 t38 t33 t12 t38 t14 t14 t27 t90 t59 t59 t10 t53 t59 t20 t77 t12 t32 t33 t66 t27 t33 t14 t24 t27 t14.\n\nFirst token: t40. So we need to see if there's a way to produce t40 as the first step.\n\nLooking at the first step, starting with S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So the string starts with S, which splits into NT30 and NT53. Then, each of these NTs must produce the respective tokens. Since the string starts with t40, we need to see how the first NT, say, NT30, expands, and then NT53.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t40, then t20. So perhaps the expansion is S \u2192 NT30 NT53 \u2192 [something] something, where the first component starts with t40, then t20, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the t40 comes from another NT node.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token t40 is produced by NT43. So if we have NT43 in the expansion, it can produce t40. So let's see: What is NT43?\n\nLooking at grammar: NT43 \u2192 t40 | NT15 NT1. So if NT43 is the starting point for a part of the string, it can directly produce t40. But in the start symbol, we have S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nHmm, perhaps S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is used, and NT30 and NT53 each expand into sequences that produce the tokens.\n\nBut the string starts with t40, so let's try to see how that could happen.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is such that each NT production eventually resolves into a sequence of terminals. Since in Chomsky normal form, each non-terminal produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut to directly get a terminal, we can follow the derivation steps.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, t40: Which NT can produce t40? NT43 \u2192 t40.\n\nSo perhaps in the derivation, we have a production like A \u2192 NT43, and NT43 \u2192 t40. But S cannot produce NT43 directly; S produces NT30 and NT53. So how does the t40 in the string fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t40 is part of a larger production that is generated by an NT which eventually produces t40 somewhere in the string.\n\nWait, maybe the process is the reverse of a parse tree. Let me think: To see if the string can be generated, we can try to build a parse tree where each step expands a non-terminal into terminals and non-terminals that match the string.\n\nBut that's a bit tricky without knowing the exact structure. Maybe another approach is to see which terminals in the string can only come from certain NTs.\n\nLooking at the string, let's note each token and see which NTs can generate them.\n\nList of tokens:\n\nt40, t20, t10, t91, t76, t20, t76, t38, t33, t12, t38, t14, t14, t27, t90, t59, t59, t10, t53, t59, t20, t77, t12, t32, t33, t66, t27, t33, t14, t24, t27, t14.\n\nSo first, t40: produced by NT43.\n\nt20: Looking for which NT can produce t20. Looking through the grammar, NT10 \u2192 t73 (no). Let me see:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 t20. Let's check all NT rules:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t76 (no)\n- NT16 \u2192 't72' (no)\nWait, from the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 t59, but also:\n\nLooking for NT that produces t20 directly. There's NT15 \u2192 some production, but no direct t20.

Wait, but the terminal is t77, but in the string, it's t27?\n\nWait, no. Wait line 13: NT27 -> 't77'\u2014so that's a terminal, t77, but in the string we have t27. So that can't be. Alternatively, are we referring to something else?\n\nWait, in the grammar, we have:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43: line 11\nNT7 \u2192 't91' : line 10, so NT7 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-453","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break down what I need to do here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S and has two initial productions: S -> NT30 NT53 and S -> NT35 NT45. That means any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminal symbols\u2014either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. But wait, looking at the string, it starts with 't76 t91...' Hmm, none of the non-terminals in the initial productions are terminals. So maybe I need to trace how each of these NT symbols resolves into terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so each part of the string must correspond to the results of expanding the non-terminals in the grammar. My plan is to work backwards: start from the string and see if it can be broken down according to the productions, ensuring each part matches.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be divided into parts that match the right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions. Let's list out the productions to see possible RHS lengths. The productions can be of two types: productions for NT that have two children, so each step reduces the number of symbols by one. The string has 32 tokens, so it's a bit long, but manageable.\n\nLet me list the productions again and see their RHS structures:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53 (two symbols)\n2. S -> NT35 NT45 (two symbols)\n3. NT43 -> NT53 NT11 (two symbols)\n4. NT15 -> NT1 NT25 (two)\n5. NT45 -> NT59 NT5 (two)\n6. NT35 -> NT15 NT1 (two)\n7. NT25 -> NT32 NT56 (two)\n8.

NT16 -> 't72' (terminal, length 1)\n16. NT30 -> 't90' (terminal)\n17. NT30 -> 't53' (terminal)\n18. NT30 -> 't14' (terminal)\n19. NT1 -> 't89' (terminal)\n20. NT53 -> 't7' (terminal)\n21.

NT9 -> 't20' (terminal)\n46. NT53 -> 't80' (terminal)\n47. NT16 -> 't31' (terminal)\n\nWow, that's a lot of productions. I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT16 -> 't72', and others have multiple options, like NT43 can be NT53 NT11, which themselves can be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSince the string is quite long, maybe I should look for the longest possible expansion steps. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to parse the string by matching the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this as a parsing problem. I can try to parse the given string from left to right using the grammar. If I can parse the entire string, it's in the language; otherwise, it's not.\n\nLet me list the string again:\n\nt76 t91 t59 t77 t24 t45 t20 t12 t20 t31 t28 t77 t66 t72 t40 t73 t77 t12 t29 t10 t90 t80 t77 t77 t76 t80 t24 t24 t77 t72 t40 t29\n\nBreaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial symbol S must expand into either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Both are two symbols in the RHS.\n\nSo the string starts with 't76 t91...' which would correspond to NT30 and NT53 or something else. Let me see what NT30 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT30, it has three productions:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90' (terminal)\n- NT30 -> 't53' (terminal)\n- NT30 -> 't14' (terminal)\n\nWait, but NT30 is a single symbol, so in the initial expansion, S would produce a pair of NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45, each of which expands into one of their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take a different approach. Let's consider that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so each token must be the result of a NT production.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't76'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't76'. Looking down the list, I see NT62 -> 't43' NT16, but that's not terminal. Wait no, looking again, NT46 -> 't66' is a terminal, NT59 -> 't28', NT32 -> 't77', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list, I see that NT44 -> 't76' is a production. Yes, NT44 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't76'. So 't76' can be matched by NT44.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT44 hasn't been listed as a production in the initial list. Let me check again the productions:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\n40. NT4 -> 't45'\n41. NT46 -> 't66'\n42. NT53 -> 't91'\n43. NT9 -> 't38'\n44. NT4 -> 't53'\n45. NT15 -> 't38'\n46. NT4 -> 't33'\n47. NT59 -> 't24'\n48. NT9 -> 't20'\n49. NT53 -> 't80'\n50. NT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, no, NT44 isn't listed as an NT, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, under the productions, I think I miscounted. Let me list all NT productions with their RHS:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n3. NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n4.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Each production rule in the grammar seems to break down symbols into other symbols or terminal strings. Terminal strings are the ones that get replaced by actual tokens, which in this case seem to be things like 't90', 't73', etc.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Most of the non-terminals (NT) have productions that split into two other NTs. The goal is to see if the entire string can be derived by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe given string is: `t73 t53 t31 t38 t80 t38 t7 t73 t24 t33 t59 t27 t77 t89 t59 t33 t89 t10 t33 t66 t66 t76 t28 t17 t28 t24 t40 t53 t27 t24 t7 t59 t12`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't73', so I'll check where 't73' comes from. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminal NT16 produces 't72' on the right side, but 't73' isn't directly a terminal of any non-terminal except NT10 maybe? Wait, NT10 is 't73' directly. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT10 -> 't73'. Yes, so NT10 is a rule that produces t73. So the string starts with NT10, which makes sense because the first token is 't73'. \n\nNext, let's look at the first two tokens: t73 followed by t53. I need to see how these could be produced. Let's see what rules have t73 or t53 as their right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT30\n- S -> NT53 NT53 (but not sure if relevant here)\nWait, maybe more relevant: The first token is t73, which comes from NT10. The next is t53, which comes from NT53 -> 't53' as per the rules.\n\nSo the first two tokens could be from NT10 -> t73 and NT23 -> t53, but wait, looking at the grammar, I need to find how t53 is derived.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT30 has a production that includes t53, but also, NT25 -> t29, which is part of NT25 producing 't29'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me step back.\n\nThe entire string has 33 tokens, so I need to parse it to see if each non-terminal can be expanded into the given sequence. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, so it's a binary tree derivation.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S can derive NT30 NT30 or NT53 NT53. Let me check which one fits. The first token is t73, which comes from NT10. So if S expands to NT30 NT30, one of the NT30s needs to derive t73. But looking at the NT30 rules, NT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't14', or 't73'. Oh, so there's a path for NT30 to directly produce 't73', which is what we have.\n\nWait, so perhaps S -> NT30 NT30, and each NT30 is used to generate the t73 and another part.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nStart with S -> NT30 NT30.\n\nFirst token is t73 from NT10, but wait, NT30 has a production that includes 't73'? Let me check: NT30 can produce 't73' via the rule NT30 -> 't73'. So yes, if an NT30 is expanded to 't73', that's acceptable.\n\nSo the first token is t73 from NT30. The next token is t53, which would require that the second NT30 produces 't53'. So let's say the second NT30 is expanded to 't53'.\n\nWait, but NT30's productions are: t90, t53, t14, t73. Yes, t53 is one of them, so that's possible.\n\nSo S -> NT30 (t73) and NT30 (t53). But wait, the string starts with t73 t53, which would fit if the first NT30 is t73 and the second is t53. So that makes sense for the first two tokens.\n\nNow, after t73 t53, the next tokens are t31, t38, t80, etc. So I need to see how the rest of the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the second NT30 that became t53, perhaps that's a terminal, so the next symbols must be produced by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, the second token is t53 from NT30, which is a direct expansion. Then the third token is t31. So I need to see what comes after t53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, after the initial S -> NT30 NT30, the second NT30 produces t53, which is a terminal, so that's done. Now, what about the first NT30 that produced t73? After t73, the next token is t53, but after that comes t31, which is the third token.\n\nWait, no, the string is t73 t53 t31 t38... So after S->NT30 (t73) and NT30 (t53), the next symbols are t31, which must come from another expansion.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT30 can produce 't73', 't53', 't14', or 't73' again (I think there are two rules for NT30 -> t73, one as an actual production and another as a possible for another NT). Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back, the NT30 rules are:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT30 -> 't73'\n\nSo yes, four options. So for the first NT30 producing t73, the second NT30 producing t53.\n\nBut after that, the next token is t31. So where does t31 come into play? Let's see if any non-terminal leads to t31.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't31'. Wait, maybe it's produced via a chain. Let me think: perhaps some combination.\n\nWait, the string after t53 is t31, so perhaps after the second NT30 (which is t53), the next symbol comes from another NT. But S doesn't derive more symbols beyond its two components; so perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption about S is wrong. Maybe S is splitting into NT30 NT30, and each NT30 is further expanded. Let's try to see.\n\nThe string is t73 (from NT30), then t53 (also from NT30), then t31. Since the first S gives two NT30's, and each can expand into terminals or non-terminals. But the third token is t31, so it must come from another NT. But wait, S is the start, and after two NT30s, there are no more symbols. So I must have made a mistake in assuming S produces t73 and t53.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT30 is t73, and the second NT30 is expanding further. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe S is not starting with NT30 NT30 but with another possibility. Looking back, S has two production rules: S -> NT30 NT30 and S -> NT53 NT53.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t73 t53 comes t31. If S is S -> NT53 NT53, then the first token t73 would come from NT53. Let me check the NT53 rules.\n\nNT53 has several productions, including 't53', 't7', 't91', etc. So if a NT53 is expanded to 't73', it would be using a certain rule.

{"custom_id":"request-459","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm looking at this problem where I have to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how CNF works. CNF is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier for certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to verify a single string, I might not need that.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's a set of production rules that generate non-terminals into either other non-terminals or terminal symbols (indicated by the presence of 't' followed by a number). The start symbol is S, which branches into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Each of these non-terminals then further break down into other combinations or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t90 t32 t12 t28 t12 t66 t76 t20 t77 t14 t24 t80 t27 t10 t24 t14 t27 t7 t38 t80 t90 t89 t72 t12 t24 t91 t91 t31 t89 t7 t53 t33 t45.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, so my job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules provided.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This means that the derivation of the string will have a tree structure where each node is either a terminal or a non-terminal, and each non-terminal has exactly two children. This structure implies that the length of the string will be 2^n, where n is the number of steps in the derivation. However, in this case, the string has 34 tokens. Let me check if 34 is a power of two. Well, 2^5 is 32, which is close, but 34 is not a power of two. Wait, but maybe the starting symbols combine in such a way that the lengths can grow in different ways.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each production rule for a non-terminal either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, starting from S, each step can either produce two symbols (potentially terminals or non-terminals that will produce terminals at deeper levels). So the number of symbols doubles at each step. However, if some non-terminals produce terminals directly, they don't contribute to the count but contribute to the string.\n\nBut in this grammar, some non-terminals produce two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11, etc.) and others produce terminals (like NT1 \u2192 't89'). So the overall length of the string isn't necessarily a power of two because some steps produce terminals, stopping the doubling.\n\nWait, that's more accurate. The key is that each time a non-terminal produces two non-terminals, the count will increase, but when a non-terminal produces a terminal, it stops contributing to the count beyond that point. So the total number of symbols can vary, but it's not necessarily a strict power of two. So perhaps the length of the string is 34, which is 2*17, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. I should attempt to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nI think a good way to approach this is to start from the start symbol S and see if it can produce the given string. To do that, I'll consider the productions for S: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT30 and NT53, or by NT35 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first two tokens are 't90' and 't32'. Let me check which NT rule can produce 't90' followed by something.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT30 has productions: NT30 \u2192 't90', NT30 \u2192 't53', NT30 \u2192 't14', etc. Wait, the initial rule for NT30 is actually part of S's rule? Let me check: The question says the grammar is in CNF, so all non-terminals appear on the left. Wait, the grammar starts with S -> NT30 NT53, etc. So NT30's productions are given as:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' (terminal)\nNT30 -> 't53' (terminal)\nNT30 -> 't14' (terminal)\nand others like NT30 \u2192 't27', etc. Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, the lines under NT30 are:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT30 -> 't10'  ? No, wait, looking more carefully, the user provided a list of production rules, starting with:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't59'\nNT56 -> 't28'\nNT11 -> 't28'\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT32 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT59 -> 't28'\nNT15 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't45'\nNT46 -> 't66'\nNT53 -> 't91'\nNT9 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't53'\nNT15 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't33'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nSo looking at NT25, it has NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56, and NT32 \u2192 't77', NT56 \u2192 't45'. So S would produce NT35 NT45. Let me see what NT35 and NT45 produce.\n\nLooking at NT35: NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. So NT35 will produce a pair of NT15 and NT1.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT35 NT45 would be NT35 producing NT15 NT1 and NT45 producing NT59 NT5. So the initial string starts with 't90 t32', which is not matching NT35 NT45's initial productions, because NT35 starts with NT15 NT1, which might produce certain terminals, but the string starts with 't90', which is from NT30.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Let me check what NT30 and NT53 produce.\n\nLooking at NT30: it can produce 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. The first production for NT30 is 't90', but wait, looking back, the user provided NT30 as multiple rules: NT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. Wait, actually, the first production line under NT30 is NT30 -> 't90', and the others are other terminals. So NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't14', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't90', which would correspond to NT30's production NT30 \u2192 't90'.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This usually makes generating and recognizing easier.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t10 t38 t90 t76 t59 t14 t29 t33 t91 t53 t27 t76 t80 t12 t40 t77 t45 t38 t27 t33 t33 t40 t7 t53 t40 t32 t53 t53 t20 t59 t66 t28 t12 t73`.\n\nWow, that's a long string with 38 tokens separated by spaces. Each token is an 't' followed by a number. I think each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So the string must start with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Let me check what the string starts with. The first token is 't10', then 't38'. Hmm, does either NT30 or NT35 lead to 't10' and 't38' at the next steps?\n\nLooking at the productions for NT10: I see NT10 \u2192 't73' and some others. Wait, I need to go step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't10 t38'. So S must derive 't10 t38...' but wait, S starts with NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let me check what NT30 and NT53 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT30 has several productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 t90\n- NT30 \u2192 t53\n- NT30 \u2192 t14\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then the first part could be NT30 \u2192 t10? Wait, no. Looking at NT10's productions, it goes to t73 and some other non-terminals. So perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions for each non-terminal to see what they can generate.\n\nLet me try to map each non-terminal to their productions. Starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nNT30 has:\n- 't90'\n- 't53'\n- 't14'\n\nWait, 't90' is a terminal, so NT30 can directly produce 't90', but the string starts with 't10 t38 t90...', which doesn't match. Hmm. So maybe NT30 is expanding to something else, not directly t90.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: looking back, the grammar is given with lines and lines, each production for a non-terminal. So for NT30, looking at the list:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nSo those are terminals. So if S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then NT30 could produce t90, t53, or t14. Similarly for NT35 and others.\n\nBut the string starts with 't10', which is a terminal. So looking for where 't10' is produced. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, 't10' is a terminal for NT10. So which non-terminals can produce 't10'? Let me see:\n\nLooking for NT10 in the productions:\n\nNT10 has:\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT10 \u2192 NT4\n- NT10 \u2192 NT25\n- NT10 \u2192 NT44\n\nSo 't10' is not a terminal for NT10; instead, NT10 can produce other things. Hmm, that means 't10' must be produced from some other non-terminal that has a production leading to 't10'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for each non-terminal, looking through all their productions to see if any produce a terminal. For example, if a non-terminal A has a production A \u2192 'a', then it can produce 'a'.\n\nSo, starting from the string, the first token is 't10', which is an 'a' in the grammar. So we need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't10'. Looking through the productions again:\n\nI see NT25 \u2192 't29', NT15 \u2192 't12', NT1 \u2192 't10', and several others.\n\nAh, here's one: NT1 \u2192 't10'. So if at some point, the parser can derive 't10' by expanding NT1.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is 't38', which is a terminal. Looking for productions for NT38? Wait, no, in the grammar, is there a non-terminal that produces 't38'? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't28'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT4 \u2192 't45'\n- NT15 \u2192 't12'\n- NT4 \u2192 't53'\n- NT15 \u2192 't38'\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't38'\n- NT46 \u2192 't66'\n- NT53 \u2192 't91'\n- NT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, looking at NT15: two productions:\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT15 \u2192 't38'\n\nSo NT15 can produce 't38' directly. So in the string, after 't10' comes 't38'. That could be from NT15.\n\nBut how do we get to NT15? Let's think step by step.\n\nThe entire string is: t10 t38 t90 t76 t59 t14 t29 t33 t91 t53 t27 t76 t80 t12 t40 t77 t45 t38 t27 t33 t33 t40 t7 t53 t40 t32 t53 t53 t20 t59 t66 t28 t12 t73.\n\nThat's a lot, so I'll need to parse it in steps.\n\nAlternative approach: reconstruct the parse tree step by step, starting from the string and working backward to S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to track where in the string each production could match.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps building an abstract syntax tree (AST) or trying to see if each step can be matched.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parser, keeping track of the positions in the string and seeing if S can cover the entire string.\n\nSince it's a CNF grammar, each step of production appends symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. But in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal can only produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, in this case, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So when parsing, each production of S contributes either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45.\n\nThen, each NT... has their own productions, which could be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be built by expanding S into these non-terminals, each of which expand into smaller parts, until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can try to match from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t10 t38 t90...\n\nSo S must expand into NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Looking at the options:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53: the first part is NT30. The first token is t10, which comes from NT10 \u2192 t10. But how can NT30 produce t10? Because NT30's productions are terminals 't90', 't53', 't14'. None of these are t10. So if S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the first symbol would have to be one of t90, t53, or t14, which are not in the string. So the first symbol is t10, which is produced by NT10, so S cannot be expanding to NT30 NT53 because that would not produce t10.\n\nThus, the other option is S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nThen, the first two symbols would be the two parts produced by NT35 and NT45.\n\nSo, NT35 has two options:\n\nNT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems like the start symbol is S, which can derive into two options: either two NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Each of these NT symbols then proceed to break down into other NT symbols until they eventually produce terminals or other NT structures until they end up as terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of t followed by two-digit numbers. So, the string is like a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'll need to parse the string using the grammar. Since CNF grammars are efficient for parsing with algorithms like CYK, but given the length of the string, it's going to be a long string, so maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nLet me first write down the string clearly:\n\n1. t27\n2. t31\n3. t59\n4. t91\n5. t53\n6. t73\n7. t73\n8. t73\n9. t89\n10. t66\n11. t20\n12. t38\n13. t38\n14. t29\n15. t59\n16. t90\n17. t72\n18. t90\n19. t73\n20. t73\n21. t59\n22. t40\n23. t38\n24. t59\n25. t90\n26. t20\n27. t32\n28. t14\n29. t12\n30. t91\n31. t28\n32. t90\n33. t27\n34. t77\n\nSo, 34 elements in total.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if the string can be divided into segments that match the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the entire string must be derived from one of these two paths.\n\nLet me first look at the first few symbols: t27, t31, t59, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal expansion leads to two steps. Let's see:\n\nFor example, S -> NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the first step would need to generate two non-terminals, each of which would then produce more symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t27. So I need to find a production that ends with t27. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at all the rules, Nterminal43: NT43 -> NT53 NT11, which includes t53 and t11. Wait, but none directly produce t27 except maybe through other steps.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar rules more carefully. Let's list out all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14' (three options)\nNT10 -> 't73', 't27', 't10' (three options)\nNT35 -> 't15', 't4', 't33' (three options)\nNT45 -> 't59', 't43', 't56' (three options)\nWait, but I think the initial approach might be too time-consuming given the length. Maybe a better idea is to see what the grammar produces in terms of terminals. Let me list all the possible terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt27, t31, t59, t91, t53, t73, t73, t73, t89, t66, t20, t38, t38, t29, t59, t90, t72, t72, t73, t73, t59, t40, t38, t59, t90, t20, t32, t14, t12, t91, t28, t90, t27, t77.\n\nWait, let's make a list:\n\nt27, t31, t59, t91, t53, t73, t89, t66, t20, t38, t38, t29, t59, t90, t72, t73, t73, t59, t40, t38, t59, t90, t20, t32, t14, t12, t91, t28, t90, t27, t77.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar's productions leading to terminals:\n\nND30 can produce t90, t53, t14.\n\nNT10 can produce t73, t27, t10.\n\nNT35 can produce t15, 't4', t33.\n\nWait, but some have t4 which is 't45'? Wait no. Let me correct that. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nWait, the provided grammar is given as many rules. Maybe it's easier to collect all the production rules that directly produce terminals. Otherwise, they might all be rules leading to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the rules are all either A->BC or A->a, I think.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, there are rules like S -> NT30 NT35, which are A->BC, and other rules like NT30 -> 't90', which are A->a.\n\nSo, each rule is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So the grammar has a mix.\n\nGiven that, the terminals are generated directly by rules ending in 't'.\n\nSo, listing all the 'a's:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT30: 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nNT35: 't15', 't45' (from NT45?), or maybe I need to look.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, let's parse each rule:\n\nLooking through the entire provided grammar:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't59'\nNT56 -> 't28'\nNT11 -> 't28'\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT32 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT59 -> 't28'\nNT15 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't45'\nNT46 -> 't66'\nNT53 -> 't91'\nNT9 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't53'\nNT15 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't33'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nThus, the terminal symbols ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has specific production rules that make parsing easier, although I'm not going to use a parser here. \n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So any string generated by this grammar must start with one of these combinations. Looking at the string provided, the first token is t33. So I need to see if t33 can be derived from either NT30 or NT35.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT30 and NT35. NT30 can produce a few terminals directly: t90, t53, t14, t32, etc., but I notice that NT30 also has a rule that branches into other NT symbols, so it's possible that t33 is a result of a derivation path within NT30. Similarly, NT35 has a rule that branches into NT15 and NT1.\n\nThe string starts with t33, which according to the grammar, must come from either NT30 or NT35. Let me check if there's a production that leads to t33 directly or via a series of steps.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT30, I see that it can go to t90, t53, t14, t32, etc., but not t33. So t33 must come from a non-terminal that's reachable via NT30. Wait, let me check NT1, which has a production that can lead to t10, t89, t4, etc. NT1 also has a rule that goes to NT15 and NT25. NT15 has a rule to NT12 or others. Wait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, let me first think about the structure of the string: it has a bunch of tX tokens, possibly representing terminal symbols. The string length is 34 tokens, which suggests a certain structure. Since the grammar is CNF, each production can be expanded into two steps.\n\nThe first step is to see what the initial S can produce. For the initial step, the first token must be part of either NT30 or NT35. So the string starts with t33, which must be part of NT30 or NT35.\n\nLooking at NT30's rules: I see multiple options, including t90, which is the second token. Also, NT30 has a production to NT30 -> NT38 t91, but I need to check each possible way t33 could appear in NT30. Wait, no, looking again, the productions for NT30: \"NT30 -> 't90'\", \"NT30 -> 't53'\", \"NT30 -> 't14'\", \"NT30 -> 't32'\", \"NT30 -> 't77'\", \"NT30 -> 't59'\", \"NT30 -> 't14'\", \"NT30 -> 't32'\", \"NT30 -> 't53'\", \"NT30 -> 't27'\", \"NT30 -> 't10'\", \"NT30 -> 't29'\", \"NT30 -> 't77'\", etc. Wait, no, actually, upon closer inspection, the grammar has NT30 as a non-terminal and some of its productions include terminal tokens directly. For example, \"NT30 -> 't90'\", which would produce t90. Similarly, \"NT30 -> 't53'\", etc.\n\nBut the string starts with t33, which is not directly produced by NT30 or NT35 based on the rules listed. So this suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because t33 isn't a terminal, but I need to double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me list out all the production rules more systematically. The start symbol is S, which is NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Each production of NTxxx leads to other NT productions or terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT1 rule: it has productions like NT1 -> NT10 NT4, NT1 -> NT44 NT33, etc. So NT1 can produce t33, as \"NT1 -> NT44 NT33\" and \"NT1 -> 't44'\". Wait, no, looking again: under NT1, the rules include NT1 -> 't10', NT1 -> 't89', NT1 -> 't4', and others. Wait, more accurately, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT15: NT15 -> NT12, etc., as well as NT15 -> NT1 NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the string and see if each token can be generated by some production.\n\nThe string is: t33, t29, t91, t14, t77, t90, t38, t73, t59, t20, t29, t40, t33, t91, t45, t20, t14, t24, t17, t90, t14, t76, t72, t59, t76, t7, t77, t59, t76, t66, t90, t45, t10, t80, t59.\n\nEach t token represents a terminal. So every symbol in the string must be the result of some NT production expanding into that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t33. The NT productions: NT1's rule is \"NT1 -> 't44'\", and \"NT1 -> 't38'\". Wait, no, looking again, NT1 has \"NT1 -> 't10'\", \"NT1 -> 't89'\", \"NT1 -> 't4'\". So none of those directly produce t33. Similarly, other NTs: perhaps I need to see if any NT can produce t33.\n\nLooking at NT12: does it produce t33? In the grammar, I don't see NT12 having a production to t33. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start building the parse tree step by step, considering that each production in CNF generates exactly two symbols. Let's try to see if the string can be built by following the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if all the terminal symbols in the string can be reached by the grammar. For example, if the string starts with t33, and none of the initial S productions directly produce t33, then perhaps the string cannot be derived, but that's not necessarily correct because maybe t33 is part of a longer derivation within NT30 or NT35.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that t33 is a derivation from NT1, given that NT1 can produce t38, which is part of the string. Let me see: the string starts with t33, which perhaps comes from NT1 -> NT25 NT43. Then NT25 could be 't29' directly or through other paths.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach is to see if there's a chain of productions that can generate the string. Let's take the string token by token and see if each can be matched by some NT production.\n\n1. t33: Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production that produces t33 directly. Instead, I see NT1 has \"NT1 -> 't44' NT4\" and others, but not t33. Wait, then perhaps t33 needs to be produced by an NT that eventually can derive it, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t33 as a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, looking again at the grammar: under NT1, there is \"NT1 -> 't38'\". So t38 is directly produced by NT1. In the string, we have t38 after t33. Maybe that's part of a derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me check the grammar again more carefully. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for NT1: I see \"NT1 -> 't38'\". So t38 can be a terminal. Then in the string, t38 comes after t33, t29, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the parse tree would start with S -> NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Then each part is built from their productions.\n\nSo let's try to see if the string can start with either NT30 or NT35.\n\nThe first token is t33. So if S generates NT30 NT53, then t33 must come from NT30. So within NT30's derivations, does it ever produce t33?\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: I don't see any direct 't3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no: the first token is t80, so perhaps the derivation would start with S -> NT30 NT53, but NT30 could be 't90', 't53', or 't14', and NT53 could be t80. Wait, but the first token is t80. So perhaps the initial step is S -> NT30 NT53, with NT53 being t80. That would mean the first production is the second option: S -> NT35 NT45, but that doesn't help because then S would need to split into NT35 and NT45, which would then produce 't80' but those are in different parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by working backwards from the string. Each 't' token is a terminal, so each must be derived directly from an NT that produces that literal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t80. From the grammar, NT53 can produce t80. So that part is NT53 -> t80.\n\nSo the string would start as S -> NT35 NT45 or NT30 NT53. Let's see which one can lead to t80 as the first token.\n\nIf S -> NT30 NT53, then the first token is produced by NT30. Looking at NT30's productions: 't90', 't53', or 't14'. None of these are 't80', so the first token would have to be from NT53. Therefore, the first production must be S -> NT35 NT45, but NT35 and NT45 can't produce t80. Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the first production is S -> NT35 NT45, but then the first token would be NT35, which can't be t80. Therefore, maybe the correct initial step is S -> NT30 NT53, and the first token is NT30, but that can't be t80. Alternatively, perhaps the derivation is not starting with S -> NT30 or NT35, but perhaps via other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going about this wrong. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t80 t66 t14 t20 t33 t31 t28 t7 t14 t66 t10 t91 t32 t77 t91 t66 t59 t59 t91 t10 t12 t27 t7 t40 t91 t76 t72 t7 t66 t31 t77 t17 t10 t17 t40.\n\nI notice that there are multiple t91's, t72's, t7's, etc. Maybe we can build a parse tree by looking for the possible NTs that can produce these.\n\nStarting from the left, t80 must come from NT53 -> t80, as no other NT directly produces t80.\n\nSo the first part of the string is S -> NT35 NT45 or S -> NT30 NT53. Since t80 comes from NT53, the production must be S -> NT30 NT53. So the first token comes from NT53, which is t80.\n\nTherefore, the starting production is S -> NT30 NT53, and the first token is t80.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production has two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the grammar is probably structured with all rules having two parts, either both non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some symbols are rewritten into other symbols until they reach terminal tokens like 't20', 't77', etc. The string starts with t20 and ends with t73, so I need to trace how these tokens can be formed from the non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the grammar has two productions: S -> NT30 NT53 and S -> NT35 NT45. So the string must come from one of these two paths.\n\nLet me pick the first option, S -> NT30 NT53, and see if that can produce parts of the string. NT30 has productions: 't90', 't53', 't27', and 't20'. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, NT30 can go to 't90', 't53', 't27', and 't20'. So, for the first token, t20, that's possible directly from NT30.\n\nNow, looking at the next token, t77. I need to see if t77 can be derived from the non-terminals in the second part after S. Wait, the second part after S is NT53.\n\nWait, so S is split into NT30 and NT53. So each part of S generates their own sequences. So, in the string, each token after the first (from NT30) would come from the NT53 part.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t20. From NT30, that's possible via production NT30 -> 't20'.\n\nNext token is t77. NT53's productions: looking at the grammar, NT53 can be NT46, NT7, and some others. Wait, the possible productions for NT53 are: NT53 -> NT46 NT1, NT53 -> NT7. Let me check. Wait, in the grammar, NT53 has rules:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT53 -> NT7\nWait, do any of these go to 't77'? Let me see. NT7 is a terminal, and according to the grammar, NT7 is 't7'). Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see NT7, but in the grammar, none of the non-terminals other than NT7 generate 't77'. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the grammar does have NT30, NT35, etc., that can go to terminals. Let me see which ones can produce 't77'. Looking at the rules, in NT30, it goes to 't77'? Wait, in the initial list, there was NT30 -> 't77', but no. Wait, wait, looking back: the grammar's initial rules include NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't27', 't20'. So, NT30 cannot go to 't77'. Hmm. So the second token is t77, which would have to come from somewhere, but the NT53 part.\n\nLooking at NT53, the possible productions are:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT7\n\nWait, but does any NT53's production generate a terminal 't77'? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial list, the rules include NT30 -> t90, t53, t27, t20. No t77. So where does t77 come from? Oh wait, I must have misread. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot NT35 -> 't25'? Wait no. Wait, wait. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nAh, at the bottom, I see NT25 -> 't29', NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't27', 't20'. NT62-> 't43' etc. Wait, maybe I missed where 't77' appears. Alternatively, perhaps t77 comes from a non-terminal that can derive it.\n\nWait, no, in the initial rules I see NT30 has some terminal options, but I don't see 't77' there. So perhaps 't77' comes from a non-terminal that leads to 't77' via rules.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed a rule that produces 't77'. Looking back at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't77' in the production rules of terminals.\n\nIn the non-terminal productions (the S and NT rules), do any of them have 't77' as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see a production for 't77' as a terminal, except perhaps in the list of terminals, but I think in the initial problem statement, the user lists all the productions, and then the string.\n\nWait, the initial list starts with S and all the productions. The terminals, like 't77', 't91', etc., are only in the string, right? So perhaps the grammar does not have a rule that directly produces 't77' as a terminal. Then, unless a chain of non-terminals steps into 't77', which it can't because all non-terminals step down to terminals without further non-terminals, which they can't because every production ends with terminals except for these rules.\n\nWait, no. All productions here are either two non-terminals (Chomsky normal form) or a terminal, perhaps. Wait, let me check: the grammar has rules like NT30 is split into two non-terminals, etc., but maybe some can lead to terminals or further splits.\n\nWait, let's think structure. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, any path that cannot derive 't77' must be impossible, but in the string, it's present, so it must be generated somehow.\n\nSo perhaps there's a non-terminal in the grammar that can produce 't77'. Let me search the production rules to see if any non-terminal's production includes 't77'. Looking again:\n\nNT30: t90, t53, t27, t20\nNT1: to t10, t4, etc.\nNT53: to NT46 NT1 and NT7\nNT79? Wait, I don't see any non-terminal rules going to 't77'. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe initial list:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't27', 't20'\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nLooking for any production of a non-terminal that ends with 't77' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me search:\n\nNT53 isn't producing 't77'.\n\nLooking at NT62: NT62 -> 't43' NT16\n\nNT16: 't31'\n\nHmm. Maybe I should trace back the possible path.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps 't77' is supposed to come from a chain, but each NT can only go to terminals or other NTs that would have to resolve down. Since each step is a single production, but perhaps a path like NT53->NT46 NT1, etc.\n\nWait, let's look at the possible steps for generating the second token, which is t77.\n\nSo, in the second part of the string, after S's first part (which is generating t20 in NT30), comes t77. So that t77 would come from NT53.\n\nSo, can NT53 produce t77? Looking through the production rules, NT53 can be NT46 NT1 or NT7. So, unless NT46 or NT1 can produce t77, which seems impossible because NT7 is 't7' as a terminal, and NT46 maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there's a path where NT53 goes to NT77 elsewhere.\n\nWait, I don't see a production rule for any non-terminal that goes directly to 't77', so perhaps the only way 't77' could be generated is if there's a non-terminal that can derive 't77' via further splits. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two NTs or a single terminal."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several production rules for non-terminals like S, NT43, NT15, etc., eventually leading to terminals like t7, t77, t32, and so on. The start symbol is S, which has productions leading to various non-terminals, as noted in the grammar.\n\nThe string given has a series of terminals, and I need to check if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar. So, I should see if each terminal in the string can be obtained by expanding the non-terminals until I get all terminals.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual terms:\n\nt7, t77, t32, t7, t12, t33, t80, t14, t12, t38, t31, t32, t76, t77, t17, t20, t33, t59, t38, t7, t27, t53, t73, t12, t20, t91, t45, t89, t76, t89, t32, t80, t73, t28, t73, t31.\n\nI need to see if there's a way to expand S into this sequence. The first step is to see the possible productions from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce:\n1. NT30 NT53\n2. NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the initial expansion from S will be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Each of these non-terminals can then be further expanded.\n\nLet's consider the first possibility: S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nNT30 and NT53 can each be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals. I'll check their productions.\n\nLooking at NT30, in the grammar, I see:\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nSimilarly, NT53 has:\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n- NT53 \u2192 't59'\n- NT53 \u2192 't1'\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first term is t7. So, from S \u2192 NT30 NT53, perhaps NT30 goes to t90, t53, or t14, and NT53 goes to t7, t59, etc.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t7, so perhaps we use S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nWait, let me clarify: in the grammar, S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the initial step is to choose one of these.\n\nLet's first consider S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nThen NT30 can be 't90', 't53', or 't14', and NT53 can be 't7', 't59', etc. But in the string, the first term is t7, which is produced directly by NT53 when NT53 \u2192 't7'. So maybe this path could lead to the first t7.\n\nBut let's look at the full string: the first term is t7, so that could come from NT53 \u2192 t7. Then NT30 could be, say, 't90' or 't53' or 't14'.\n\nWait, but if NT30 is 't90', then the next would be t77, which is not a terminal, so we need to see how that is generated. Wait, no, t77 is in the string, so we need to see if any non-terminal can produce 't77'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT7 \u2192 't77' from the production NT7 \u2192 't77'. Wait, but in the grammar provided, the rule is NT7 \u2192 't77'? Or is that another rule? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 is produced in... Hmm, actually, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT77 as a terminal. Wait, the string has \"t77\", but looking at the grammar, perhaps it's produced by some NT. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't77'?\n\nWait, I don't see that. The grammar rules given don't have an NT7 producing 't77'; for example, the rule 'NT77' isn't present. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLooking again through the grammar:\n\nI see nt7 \u2192 t77. Wait, no. Let me go through each production.\n\nLooking for 't77' in the grammar: I see in the start, for example, the first rule is S->NT30 NT53.\n\nLooking at NT30: NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'.\n\nLooking at NT15: it has \"\u2192 NT1 NT25\" and other rules.

{"custom_id":"request-499","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. My task is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. The string is quite long, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided has S as the start symbol, and various non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: `t73, t77, t20, t24, t72, t28, t20, t89, t76, t33, t29, t91, t29, t31, t91, t10, t31, t73, t31, t73, t53, t76, t24, t53, t76, t33, t14, t90, t27, t20, t7, t12, t7, t73, t91, t89, t33`.\n\nI notice that the string has spaces, but in the grammar, it's just a series of symbols. I might have to split it into individual tokens without the spaces. Let me list out each token: t73, t77, t20, t24, t72, t28, t20, t89, t76, t33, t29, t91, t29, t31, t91, t10, t31, t73, t31, t73, t53, t76, t24, t53, t76, t33, t14, t90, t27, t20, t7, t12, t7, t73, t91, t89, t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So, the string must start with a derivation that eventually leads to S, which is the start symbol. But since the string is a series of terminals, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived through the given rules.\n\nWait a minute, in the grammar provided, each production is for a non-terminal. The terminals seem to be specific strings like 't73', 't77', etc. So, the string is a direct sequence of terminals. I'm a bit confused because in standard CNF, the terminals are usually single symbols, but here, each 't' is followed by two digits. So, perhaps each 't' plus two numbers is a terminal symbol.\n\nFor example, 't73' is a terminal. So, in the grammar, are these terminals defined anywhere? Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', or 't14'\n- Similarly, other NT rules have some symbols, but most of the right-hand sides (RHS) are non-terminals. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check if all the RHS of the grammar rules are non-terminals or terminals. The production rules are like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which means S is replaced by the concatenation of NT30 and NT53. Similarly, S can also be replaced by NT35 NT45.\n\nThen, for example, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11. So, each non-terminal seems to be split into other non-terminals, except for some that are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, for the string given, I need to parse it from left to right, using the grammar to see if each part can be derived.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't73'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce a terminal: I see NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT16 \u2192 't73'. So, both NT30 and NT16 can produce 't73'. That might be useful.\n\nSimilarly, 't77' appears. I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't77'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal's RHS as 't77'. So, maybe 't77' is not directly produced by any rule. Wait, that can't be because the string has 't77' as the second token.\n\nThis means that 't77' must be derived from some non-terminal that can split into other non-terminals until it becomes 't77'. Wait, but how? Let me see.\n\nLooking again, maybe I missed some rules. Let me list the RHS terminals:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't73'\n\nOther non-terminals don't directly produce any terminal except those. So, the terminals possible are t73, t90, t53, t14, and others? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't73'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't59'\n- NT56 \u2192 't45'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'?\nWait, wait, in the grammar, NT30 appears multiple times with different R.H.S. Let me list all NT30 rules:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT30 can be represented more than once in the rules. Also, there's another line: 'NT30 -> 't27''. Oh, I see. So, let me re-express all the rules for NT30:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n\nAh, okay, so NT30 can produce four different terminals. Similarly, NT16 \u2192 't73' is one, and so on.\n\nWait, but the string has more than just a few tokens. So, let's see: for the second token 't77', since no non-terminal directly produces 't77', then maybe 't77' is not part of the language? But that can't be because the string is given as input.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again. Oh, I see: in the grammar, the productions are like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, etc. But in some cases, a non-terminal is on the RHS alongside two other symbols. For example, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11. So, each rule is a production where the LHS is a single non-terminal, and the RHS is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some of the RHS are combinations of two non-terminals. For example, NT16 \u2192 NT31 NT91. Wait, no, looking at the rules, actually, all RHS are either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, let's clarify. The provided grammar seems to have all right-hand sides as either a terminal or two non-terminals, except for some that have 't73', etc. Wait, looking back:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't73'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29'\n- NT43 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It looks like the start symbol is S, which can produce different combinations of non-terminals. The grammar has several productions, each of which is left-hand side (LHS) being a single non-terminal and right-hand side (RHS) being two non-terminals. All the non-terminals eventually produce terminal symbols, which are the lowercase 't's and numbers in the string.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminal symbols: t31, t32, t53, etc. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. I think the best approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nThe string starts with t31, so I should look at the productions that can produce t31. Let me go through the grammar to find NT that produce t31. Scanning the rules, I see NT31 -> NT16 t7. So, NT31 can produce t31 only if it can produce NT16 leading to t7. Wait, but NT16 has a production that goes to t31, right? Let's see: NT16 -> 't72', which is a terminal. Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me list the productions properly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT31: Actually, I don't see NT31 being a non-terminal. Let me reread the grammar. Oh, maybe I misread. The given grammar seems to have a mix of S and NT rules. Let me look for NTs that produce t31.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT16 -> 't72', which is t72, not t31. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t31. So I must find a non-terminal that can produce t31.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has a production NT16 -> 't72'. But I'm seeing in the string t31, so I need to find which non-terminal can produce t31 through its productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't immediately see NT31.

Let me try S -> NT30 NT30 because the first symbols in the string are t31, which isn't from NT30, as the production for NT30 could produce t30, t53, etc. Wait, looking more closely:\n\nNT30 has multiple productions: 't90', 't53', 't14', 't30'. Wait, 't30' is a terminal? No, let me see. Looking at the string, the first token is t31, which isn't produced by NT30, as NT30's RHS are 't90', 't53', etc., but not 't31'. So perhaps S -> NT35 NT45 is more promising.\n\nLooking at NT35:\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4 or 't10'\n\nWait, this seems to be getting complicated. Maybe I should use a bottom-up approach, looking at the string and trying to match from the end.\n\nThe string ends with t89 t20 t80 t17 t89 t24 t7. Let me see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking at NT53 -> t7. So if the last symbol is t7, it's part of the string t72. But in the string, the last is t7, which would come from NT16. So t7 comes from NT16. But NT16 produces t72, but that contradicts because the last symbol is t7, not t72. Wait, maybe I have to trace back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for where t7 is in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT16->'t72', and NT56->'t45', and some others.\n\nWait, another approach: the given string is all lowercase letters except for the numbers. So, maybe there's a rule that can produce a substring, but perhaps we can track from the end.\n\nThe last symbol is t7, which comes from NT16, but as per the rule, NT16->'t72', which is t72, but our string ends with t7. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up symbols and numbers in the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make sure that I correctly parse the rules. Let me list each NT and its productions:\n\n- S: NT30 NT30, NT35 NT45\n\n- NT43: NT53 NT11\n\n- NT53: NT46 NT1\n\n- NT35: NT15 NT1\n\n- NT33: NT62 NT7\n\n- NT1: NT10 NT4, or just 't89'\n\nNo, wait, looking again: NT1's RHS is:\n\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n\n- or NT1 -> 't89'\n\nAh, so NT1 can produce 't89'. So in the string, the 20th symbol is 't89'. That could come from NT1.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the previous symbol before 't89' is 't12', which I think is NT15.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should map the string into symbols and see which non-terminals could produce them.\n\nLet me list the string as:\n\nt31, t32, t53, t31, t38, t80, t38, t28, t91, t17, t29, t32, t20, t14, t66, t24, t28, t31, t32, t10, t59, t27, t38, t12, t20, t53, t53, t7, t90, t29, t89, t20, t80, t17, t89, t24, t7.\n\nThat's a lot. Let me see if I can find a path through the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t31: Looking for which NT can produce t31. I don't see any NT production directly to t31, so maybe through a chain. Let's say NT16 -> t7, which is t16, but t31 is something else.\n\nWait, perhaps t31 is part of a non-terminal's RHS. For example, NT16 has a production that leads to t72. But in the string, t31 comes at the start.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-express the grammar more clearly:\n\nThe grammar defines S and multiple NTs. Each NT has specific productions.

It's given as a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so each token is a single 't' followed by a number. Let me list them out numerically to see the sequence of numbers:\n\n89, 33, 24, 89, 24, 91, 38, 90, 31, 10, 20, 91, 91, 59, 91, 7, 24, 77, 38, 53, 33, 91, 29, 91, 12, 40, 20, 66, 38, 14, 20, 27, 29, 40, 12, 17, 29, 90.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these numbers connected by 't's. The grammar has S and NT terminals. Each production in the grammar seems to be structured such that non-terminals (NT) are expanded into other non-terminals or specific tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So S expands into two non-terminals, each of which has their own productions.\n\nI think it would help to build the parse tree step by step. Let's start with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nSo the string must start with NT30 and NT53. Let's check the string. The first token is t89. Looking at the NT rules, which NTs produce t89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only NTs that produce t89 are NT4 and NT15. Wait, let me check:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t45 or t53\n- NT15 \u2192 t1 NT25\nWait, I need to find which NTs produce t89.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4. Not producing t's.\n- NT1 \u2192 some other NTs, but no t's.\n- NT4 \u2192 t45 or t53. Not t89.\n- Looking further in the NTs, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces t89.

{"custom_id":"request-512","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It looks like all the non-terminals on the left side of the rules are on the left, and the right side consists of exactly two non-terminals or terminals. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, that fits because each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t90 t12 t31 t17 t89 t45 t27 t28 t29 t17 t77 t91 t80 t14 t20 t40 t66 t72 t32 t7 t32 t20 t59 t89 t17 t73 t17 t89 t20 t38 t91 t33 t29 t17 t66 t32 t89 t27`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens separated by spaces. I'll need to parse this string step by step using the grammar rules to see if it can be derived.\n\nLet me start by listing the grammar rules again to see what's allowed:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo the start symbol S can only produce two non-terminals, either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. The string must start with the terminal symbols that come from these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t90. I need to check which production can generate t90.\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT30 -> 't90', so NT30 can be replaced by t90. Also, NT30 -> 't53' and others, but those might lead elsewhere. So if S -> NT30 NT53, NT30 becomes t90, and then NT53 needs to produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, let me check the NT53 rules. NT53 can go to several things, including 't7', 't59', 't71', etc. I see that NT53 has several productions, including some terminals and non-terminals. Let me see what NT53 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT53:\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT91 (from 't7' perhaps)\n- NT53 -> NT59 (which goes to 't28'?)\n- NT53 -> NT16 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT66 (from 't66')\n- NT53 -> NT32 (from 't32')\n- NT53 -> NT32 (other rules)\n\nWait, I need to parse the entire string. Maybe a better approach is to use a recursive descent parser approach. I can start from S and try to reduce the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the first token t90. The first rule I can use is S -> NT30 NT53. So I need the first part of the string to match NT30, which is t90.\n\nAfter t90, the next part comes from NT53. So the rest of the string after t90 should be the sequence produced by NT53.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a two-step process: first, the string starts with t90, which matches NT30, and then the remaining string is the string generated by NT53.\n\nSo, the remaining string after t90 is: `t12 t31 t17 t89 t45 t27 t28 t29 t17 t77 t91 t80 t14 t20 t40 t66 t72 t32 t7 t32 t20 t59 t89 t17 t73 t17 t89 t20 t38 t91 t33 t29 t17 t66 t32 t89 t27`.\n\nNow, I need this to come from NT53. Let me see what productions are available for NT53.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT53 can go to NT46 NT1\nBut wait, in the rules, I see NT53 -> NT46 NT1. So I can expand NT53 into NT46 NT1 next. Then I can see if the first token of the remaining string matches NT46 or NT1.\n\nLooking at the next token, it's t12. Let's check NT46 and NT1's rules.\n\nFrom NT53 -> NT46 NT1, so after expanding, the first part is NT46 and the second is NT1. But the next token is t12, so I need to see if either NT46 or NT1 can produce t12.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT16 -> 't73' (from the rules)\nNT15 -> NT12 (from NT15 -> NT12)\nNT15 can go to NT12, which perhaps leads to terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should check for NT12 in the remaining string. The second token is t12, so if we have NT15 -> NT12, then perhaps that's a way to get t12.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT15:\n\nNT15 -> NT12, which isn't a terminal. So perhaps NT12 is further expanded.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT12 having a production that leads to a terminal immediately. Wait, let's look at all the NT rules.\n\nWait, let me list the NT rules:\n\nNT43 rules:\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 rules:\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNT45 rules:\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT45 -> NT15 NT1\nNT45 -> NT33 NT29\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to represent the string as a sequence and try to match it using a recursive descent parsing method, considering each step of the grammar.\n\nBut this might take a while, so perhaps I can look for the entire string to see if the first few tokens can lead to NT53.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to think about the entire string in terms of the structure defined by the grammar. Each non-terminal can only produce certain sequences, and the string must consist of all those sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as sequences. Let's think of the string as a concatenation of symbols, and see if it can be built from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe string starts with t90, which matches NT30. So the first part is t90, remaining string starts at t12.\n\nNow, S produced NT30 NT53, so the second part is NT53. So the remaining string after t90 should be the output of NT53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT53 can produce t7, t59, but perhaps other options also.\n\nWait, let me list all the possible ways NT53 can generate tokens:\n\nNT53 -> 't7' (I think there's a rule where NT53 can go to 't7', but actually, looking at the rules, I see NT53 can go to NT91 (from the rule 't7'), but maybe some others?\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT91 (which is 't7')\n- NT53 -> NT59 (which comes from 't28')\n- NT53 -> NT16 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT66 (from 't66')\n- NT53 -> NT32 (from 't32')\n\nHmm, perhaps each production leads to a different terminal or further non-terminals. So, if the remaining string is matched by NT53, which can produce multiple things, perhaps t12 can come from NT15, which in turn comes from NT15 -> NT12.\n\nSo, let me suppose that after t90, the next is NT53, which in one production can transition to NT12.\n\nSo, let's assume that after t90 comes a part that starts with t12. The remaining string is t12 t31 t17 t89 t45 t27 t28 t29 t17 t77 t91 t80 t14 t20 t40 t66 t72 t32 t7 t32 t20 t59 t89 t17 t73 t17 t89 t20 t38 t91 t33 t29 t17 t66 t32 t89 t27.\n\nIf I assume that after t90, the next part is from NT53, which produces t12, then the next token"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the process starts with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45.\n\nLet me examine the string: `t59 t53 t45 t33 t17 t28 t20 t53 t89 t32 t32 t7 t72 t91 t10 t31 t91 t38 t90 t28 t76 t33 t14 t33 t28 t66 t29 t31 t73 t73 t10 t40 t77 t10 t76 t77 t24 t38 t14`.\n\nI'll list them for clarity:\n1. t59\n2. t53\n3. t45\n4. t33\n5. t17\n6. t28\n7. t20\n8. t53\n9. t89\n10. t32\n11. t32\n12. t7\n13. t72\n14. t91\n15. t10\n16. t31\n17. t91\n18. t38\n19. t90\n20. t28\n21. t76\n22. t33\n23. t14\n24. t33\n25. t28\n26. t66\n27. t29\n28. t31\n29. t73\n30. t73\n31. t10\n32. t40\n33. t77\n34. t10\n35. t76\n36. t77\n37. t24\n38. t38\n39. t14\n\nI'll start with the initial production S. Let's pick the first option: S -> NT30 NT53. So, let's see where NT30 and NT53 can go.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT30 has production rules:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n\nWait, but the string starts with t59, so using NT30 in the first position would require a 't59' somewhere else. That doesn't fit because NT30 doesn't produce t59. Alternatively, if I start with S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S could be NT35 and NT45. Let's check NT35 and NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT35 has:\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\nSo, NT35 needs to be expanded further.\n\nNT45 has:\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\nSo, NT45 needs to expand into NT59 and NT5.\n\nLooking at our string, the second symbol is t53. Let's check where t53 comes from.\n\nNT53 can be derived in several ways:\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT53 -> 't1'\nWait, but the terminal is t53, not t7, t91, or t1. So, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me clarify the production rules. The grammar mentions NT53 -> 't53', but looking again, the provided production rules for NT53 are:\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT53 -> 't1'\n\nBut those are terminals. However, in the string, we have t53 as the second symbol. So, to get t53, we need a NT53 production that ends with 't53', but according to the rules provided, I don't see that.\n\nLooking back: The grammar's NT53 production is:\n- NT53 -> 't59' ??? Wait, no. The provided list of productions for NT53 includes:\n  - NT53 -> 't53'\n  - Wait no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, the NT53 production is not directly given. Wait, the user provided a list of grammar productions, which includes:\n\nNT53 -> 't53' is not actually listed. Let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided productions:\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- There's also NT53->'t59', because in the list, I see:\n  - NT59 -> 't53' (wait, no, let's re-examine.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the productions are as follows (I think I might have misread before):\n\nThe correct NT53 productions from the user's input are:\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT53 -> 't1'\n\nBut in the string, we have 't59' as the very first symbol. But according to the production, NT53 doesn't produce 't53'. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, looking back: The productions for NT53 are not in the list provided by the user. The user's list includes:\n\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- Also, NT53 -> NT16 NT72\n- NT53 -> NT72\n- NT53 -> 't53' ??? No, let me check the original post.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, the list is as follows:\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nWait, let me list all NT53 rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n- NT53 -> 't7' (I think)\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- Also, NT53 -> NT45.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the user's message correctly.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The actual list is:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n\nNT53 -> NT59 NT5\n\nThen, the user listed:\n\nNT53 -> 't7'\n\nNT53 -> 't91'\n\nAlso, the line:\n\nNT53 -> 't53'? Let me check.\n\nIn the provided grammar:\n\nThe list includes:\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\n\n...\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't89'\n\nNT53 -> 't7'\n\nNT53 -> 't91'\n\nWait, in the list, there's:\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nBut for NT53, the user has 't7' and 't91', but I don't see any rule for NT53 -> 't53'. Wait, no, I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the user's list ends with:\n\n... 't72'\n\nThen:\n\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nHmm, perhaps I missed a line. But according to the user's provided grammar, NT53 has the following productions:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n\nNT53 -> NT59 NT5\n\nNT53 -> 't7'\n\nNT53 -> 't91'\n\nWait, so 't53' is not a terminal for NT53. So, in the given string, the second token is t53. How do we get t53 from the grammar?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong non-terminal. Let me re-examine the start:\n\nThe initial S can be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nIf the string starts with t59, t53, then let's see:\n\nIf S is NT30 NT53, then NT30 is 't90',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-520","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string I need to evaluate is quite long. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recap what CNF means. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing because each rule either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal, which simplifies the analysis.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a bit complex with multiple non-terminals and terminals. My string is: `t29 t73 t89 t73 t28 t38 t40 t12 t31 t66 t27 t10 t33 t24 t89 t80 t31 t12 t7 t80 t33 t24 t32 t10 t33 t73 t27 t77 t29 t28 t45 t17 t66 t29 t66 t91 t90 t73 t90`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do that, I'll probably have to trace back from the string to the start symbol S, applying the reverse of the production rules.\n\nThe first step is to look at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo, S generates a string that starts with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45.\n\nNow, let's look at the string. The first token is t29. So, I need to see if t29 can come from NT30 or NT53, based on the productions. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nFor NT30, I see several productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14' (though this is a terminal, but in the given string, maybe it's not used)\n\nBut t29 isn't directly produced by NT30. So maybe the first production is from NT30, but perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rule. Let me check other NT30 rules. Wait, no, the given string starts with t29, which isn't produced by NT30. Hmm, maybe I need to look at NT35 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's look at NT35. NT35 has a production rule:\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n\nAnd NT15 has a rule:\n- NT15 \u2192 NT12 NT33\n\nAnd NT12 might have another rule. Wait, but in the given string, the first token is t29. So I think I'm missing how NT35 or other non-terminals could produce t29.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminal(s) can produce t29 in their productions. Let me check the production for NT29. Looking at the grammar, do any production rules have NT29 on the left side?\n\nWait, the grammar provided doesn't have any NT29 rules. Let me see: the productions are all for NT30, NT35, etc., but no NT29. So that's a problem. If the string starts with t29, but the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT29, that would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar. But wait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nI see NT29 is not a starting symbol; the start symbol is S. So in the initial step, S must produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Then each of these non-terminals will produce other symbols. If somewhere down the line, a combination includes t29, then the string could be valid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the string starts with t29, which must come from some terminal production. Let's look for which non-terminals have rules that include t29 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't77' (so it produces t77)\n- NT32 \u2192 't32'\n- NT16 \u2192 't16' (since NT16 \u2192 't31'? Wait, no, looking at the rules, I think:\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nSo, t31 is produced by NT16.\n\nLooking further, does any rule produce t29 directly? Hmm, in the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t29 as a terminal. Let me check each rule for the left-hand side:\n\n- NT30: 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT35: 't15', 't1'\n- NT43: 't43' (i think it's 't43', but in the rules, NT43 is produced by other non-terminals)\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check each production properly.\n\nWait, the rules are provided in a list. Let me go through them:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2.

Let me go through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any non-term that when expanded, includes t29. Scanning:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't45' no.\n- NT25 \u2192 't29' yes! So NT25 produces 't29'.\n\nSo, in the string, we have t29, which can be produced by NT25. Now, how does NT25 get its value? Looking at the rules, NT25's production is:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n\nBecause in the rules, NT25 is defined as NT32 and NT56.\n\nSo to get t29, which comes from NT25, we need to have NT25 in the string. So the string starts with t29, which comes from NT25.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the string:\n\nt29 \u2192 NT25\n\nNow, NT25 is defined as NT32 and NT56. So, the expansion would be NT32 NT56.\n\nLooking at the next tokens in the string after t29, the next is t73. Let me see if that fits.\n\nBut wait, the string is: `t29 t73 ...`\n\nAfter t29, which is NT25, the next symbol is t73, which is the result of NT32 and NT56.\n\nSo let's see: after NT25 (which is NT32 NT56), the next tokens in the string are t73, t89, etc.\n\nWait, so NT32 produces 't77', and NT56 produces 't45'.\n\nWait, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. Let me look at the grammar again and make sure I understand all the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions starting with S:\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo S is the start symbol, and it produces combinations of other non-terminals. \n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is a series of t's followed by numbers. Each t number must correspond to a production rule. Let me look at the grammar to see which terminals are possible. For example, NT9 produces 't38', NT30 produces 't90', etc. \n\nThe string is: `t12 t10 t31 t27 t72 t45 t91 t7 t14 t89 t40 t10 t27 t73 t80 t24 t59 t91 t66 t91 t40 t76 t91 t80 t53 t12 t53 t14 t7 t29 t24 t31 t38 t66 t20 t59 t72 t33 t73 t45`.\n\nI notice that the string has repeated t values like t12, t10, etc. I think each occurrence of a t number corresponds to a terminal symbol, which comes from a production rule. So for instance, if I have a production rule that says NT1 \u2192 t89, then whenever I see t89 in the string, it's equivalent to NT1 being part of the derivation.\n\nWait, actually, in context-free grammars, the order of symbols matters in the string because they form a leftmost derivation. So each symbol in the string must be produced by a rule, starting from the first symbol.\n\nLet me try to map each part of the string back to the grammar. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n2. S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo any valid string must start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nLet me check the string's first symbols: t12, t10, t31, t27, t72, t45, ... Hmm, wait, the string seems to have more than two symbols, so perhaps each production is applied multiple times.\n\nBut wait, the entire string's length is 35 symbols, which is 35 t's followed by numbers. Each production produces two non-terminals, so for each application of a rule, we split into two symbols until we reach the terminals.\n\nWait, no, the entire string is a single derivation, so I need to see if each symbol in the string can be derived by splitting the non-terminals according to the rules.\n\nThis might get complicated because the string is long. Maybe I can find a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if they can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nEach production reduces a non-terminal into two symbols (either another non-terminal or a terminal). So to get a valid string, starting from S, each step reduces a non-terminal into two symbols until all are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps the string's structure must correspond to a binary tree structure where each node splits into two children until leaves are terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nWait, let's look at the string and see if each part can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals. So the entire string should start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nWait, but the string is a single sequence, so maybe it's a single derivation, not a leftmost production. Hmm, this might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a series of rules and see if it can be generated step by step.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me look at the string and see if the t's correspond to possible productions. For example, the first part is t12, t10, t31, t27, t72, t45.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT12 is not a terminal; it might produce something, but actually, in the grammar, the non-terminals seem to have 't' followed by numbers as their production. Wait, no, the grammar's productions are more like NT30 \u2192 't90', so each NT has specific productions to terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nThen,\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't72'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73', 't27'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't59', 't7', 't80', 't91', 't24'\n- NT59 \u2192 't17', 't28'\n- NT15 \u2192 't12', 't10', 't32', 't33'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32', 't38', etc.\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map each production more clearly.\n\nEach non-terminal has specific productions to other non-terminals or terminals. For example:\n\n- S can split into NT30 and NT53, both of which are non-terminals.\n- Each NT (like NT30, NT45, etc.) either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if I have NT30, it can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT10 can produce 't73' or 't27'.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of t's and numbers, which must correspond to the terminals produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t12, t10, t31, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals produce 'tX' where X is a number, but the string includes multiple tX's, so perhaps each t corresponds to a production.\n\nLet me see if the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nSo, the string must start with NT30 and NT53. But the string starts with t12, t10, t31, which doesn't align with that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should consider that the entire string is made up of terminals, and non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. So each step in the derivation produces two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So starting from S, it can produce two non-terminals, each of which can produce more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of all the terminal symbols resulting from a single derivation. So each non-terminal in the derivation will eventually expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut given the string, we need to check if it can be fully generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be broken down into the productions of the grammar. This might take a while, but let's attempt it.\n\nThe string is:\nt12 t10 t31 t27 t72 t45 t91 t7 t14 t89 t40 t10 t27 t73 t80 t24 t59 t91 t66 t91 t40 t76 t91 t80 t53 t12 t53 t14 t7 t29 t24 t31 t38 t66 t20 t59 t72 t33 t73 t45\n\nIt's quite long.

Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that Chomsky normal form requires each production to either be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It seems like it has multiple non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nThe string is: `t10 t73 t66 t80 t53 t59 t72 t89 t91 t29 t32 t66 t91 t45 t31 t29 t24 t17 t59 t27 t80 t27 t17 t66 t14 t29 t76 t73 t32 t72 t24 t31 t90 t27 t7 t91 t28 t10 t7 t29`.\n\nWow, that's a lot of terms. I think the approach is to try to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar's productions. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a two-symbol non-terminal or a terminal. This might be manageable, but it's also quite long.\n\nLet me list out the string into a list to process it step by step:\n\n[t10, t73, t66, t80, t53, t59, t72, t89, t91, t29, t32, t66, t91, t45, t31, t29, t24, t17, t59, t27, t80, t27, t17, t66, t14, t29, t76, t73, t32, t72, t24, t31, t90, t27, t7, t91, t28, t10, t7, t29]\n\nHmm, maybe I can represent this as a list of tokens and try to apply the productions step by step. The starting point is the start symbol S, which according to the grammar can produce two options:\n\n1. NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n2. NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nWait, actually the first two rules are S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So S can only produce these two combinations. Let me check the grammar. Yes, S has two options:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo each of these is a two-part production. Therefore, the string must start with one of these two combinations. Let me look at the string. The first two symbols are t10 and t73. I need to check which part of the S productions can lead to these.\n\nLooking at the NT30 and NT35 rules:\n\n- NT30 can produce several options, including 't53', 't90', 't14', etc. Wait, but looking at the grammar, for example, NT30 has rules like \u2192 't90', \u2192 't53', \u2192 't27', etc. So if the first symbol is t10, we need to see which NT30 or NT35 can derive it.\n\nWait, no. The first step is that S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So the entire string should be a combination of these two parts. So the entire string is a concatenation of the parts derived from each of these two options.\n\nLet me try to see whether the initial part of the string matches either of the two options.\n\nFor S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the first part is NT30 and the second part is NT53. NT30 can produce 't10' as one of its options. But wait, the NT30 can produce multiple things, including 't10' via rule NT30 \u2192 't73' (wait, no, looking back, I think I need to see the grammar rules again.)\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me go back and write down all the productions so I can see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, here's a list of all productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\nNT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nNT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\nNT16 \u2192 't72'\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\nNT30 \u2192 't27'\nNT10 \u2192 't73'\nNT25 \u2192 't29'\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't59'\nNT56 \u2192 't45'\nNT11 \u2192 't28'\nNT59 \u2192 't17'\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\nNT1 \u2192 't89'\nNT59 \u2192 't28'\nNT15 \u2192 't12'\nNT10 \u2192 't32'\nNT44 \u2192 't76'\nNT4 \u2192 't45'\nNT46 \u2192 't66'\nNT53 \u2192 't91'\nNT9 \u2192 't38'\nNT4 \u2192 't53'\nNT15 \u2192 't38'\nNT4 \u2192 't33'\nNT59 \u2192 't24'\nNT9 \u2192 't20'\nNT53 \u2192 't80'\nNT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nSo, the NT30 can directly produce several terminals: 't90', 't53', 't27', etc. Similarly, NT10 can produce 't73', 't32', etc.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the string is t10. So in the S \u2192 NT30 NT53 production, the first part is NT30, which can produce t10 via one of its rules. Let's look at NT30 productions. Checking, yes, there's NT30 \u2192 't10' under NT10's production? Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, NT30 appears to have several rules where it can become a terminal or a combination of non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT30 can become 't90', 't53', 't27', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules under NT30 are:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n- etc.\n\nSo indeed, NT30 can produce t10? Wait, no\u2014looking again, I don't see NT30 directly leading to 't10'. Looking at the rules, the only production for NT30 that seems to directly produce a terminal is 't90', 't53', 't27', 't14', 't32', etc. t10 is actually produced under NT10 \u2192 't73' and so on. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT30 with NT10.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT30 is a non-terminal, and from NT30, you can derive 't90' directly. So if NT30 \u2192 't10' is a production, then that would produce t10. But looking at the grammar, I don't see that. Looking through the grammar again, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nNo, I don't see 't10' as one of NT30's options. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, looking through the list again, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-545","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar given, I notice that most productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz or something like that, which fits the A \u2192 BC structure, while a few have terminals directly. Wait, but in CNF, every production should have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the ones that produce terminals. So, I think the productions ending with a terminal, like NT43 -> 't7', are allowed and are the base cases.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t73 t72 t29 t28 t31 t31 t59 t27 t14 t28 t77 t38 t66 t31 t29 t7 t27 t12 t73 t91 t10 t14 t31 t33 t14 t28 t17 t53 t89 t53 t77 t40 t12 t24 t12 t32 t12 t80 t27 t32 t32`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can probably use a parsing method like the CYK algorithm, which checks if a string is in the language defined by a grammar. But I'm not too familiar with the details of CYK, so maybe I can visualize the parsing steps or backtrack through the productions to see if the string can be split into parts that each production matches.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol, which is S. In the grammar, S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string must start with the concatenation of two parts corresponding to NT30 plus NT53 or NT35 plus NT45. Let's see the first few tokens of the given string: t73, t72, t29, etc. Wait, maybe I should check what NT30 and NT53 produce. From the grammar, NT30 has multiple productions: 't90', 't53', 't27', etc. So from NT30, the possible terminals generated are t90, t53, t27, t29, t32, etc.\n\nBut looking at the first token, t73, which is not among NT30's productions. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if S produces NT30 NT53, then the first part is NT30, which can't produce t73. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar's NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't27', 't29', 't32', among others. So t29 is possible, which would be from NT30. But the first token is t73. That doesn't match any of NT30's productions because NT30's options are t90, t53, t27, t29, t32, etc., but t73 isn't one of them. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up NT1 and other NTs. Alternatively, maybe the first symbol comes from another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S can also produce other things? No, the grammar shows only two initial S productions: NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string must be the concatenation of the two derivations from NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Hmm, so if the string starts with t73, which is not directly produced by any of those initial NTs, that would mean the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the NT rules:\n\nLooking at NT1: It can produce t10, t4, t89, etc. But NT1 doesn't produce t73.\n\nWait, but is there any non-terminal that can produce t73? Let me check. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t73. Because in the rules given, t73 is produced by NT16. Oh, right! NT16 \u2192 't73'. So t73 is the production of NT16. Then, how does NT16 get derived? Looking at the rules: NT16 \u2192 't72'. Hmm, so NT16 can produce t72. And NT72 is produced by NT16, which then produces t72, and maybe someone else produces NT72?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, do any NTs produce 't72'? Yes, NT62 can produce 't43 NT16', and NT16 can produce 't72'. Also, looking at the grammar, NT7 is 't91', which doesn't help. So, for t72, it's produced by NT16, which in turn is produced by NT62 or other options. Hmm, but let me trace this.\n\nWait, if the string starts with t73, which comes from NT16 \u2192 't73'. Then, after that, the next token is t72, which comes from NT16 \u2192 't72'. But wait, NT16 can only produce 't72' and that's it. So, for NT16, the only production is to 't72'. So, how does NT72 get derived? Hmm, looking at the grammar, any NT that produces 't72'?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me check each production step by step. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe given string is: t73 t72 t29 t28 t31 t31 t59 t27 t14 t28 t77 t38 t66 t31 t29 t7 t27 t12 t73 t91 t10 t14 t31 t33 t14 t28 t17 t53 t89 t53 t77 t40 t12 t24 t12 t32 t12 t80 t27 t32 t32.\n\nIf the first part is t73, then that must come from NT16, which is \"16 \u2192 't73'\". But wait, in the grammar, NT16 is defined as \"NT16 -> 't72'\" \u2014 sorry, looking again: \"NT16 -> 't72'\". So NT16 can only produce 't72', so the t73 can't come from NT16 unless there's another production for NT16 that I missed. Wait, checking the grammar entries for NT16: Yes, there's only \"NT16 -> 't72'\". So there's no other way for NT16 to produce a terminal. Therefore, the t73 would have to be produced by some other NT.\n\nBut looking through all the tokens, if t73 is a terminal, does any NT produce t73? Well, let me see: looking at the grammar rules, NT16 produces t72, which is another terminal. But t73 is another terminal; is there a rule that produces t73? Let me check NT16 only: NT16 \u2192 't72'.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I don't see any rule that produces t73 directly. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with t73, which isn't produced by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NTs. Looking through all the entries:\n\n- NT7 is 't91'\n- NT9 is 't38'\n- NT4 is 't45' and others\n- NT1 is 't10', 't4', etc.\n- NT59 is 't28' etc.\n- NT32 is 't77'\n- NT44 is 't76'\n- NT46 is 't66'\n- NT53 is 't91', 't59', others.\n- NT15 is 't12', 't44', etc.\n- NT30 is 't90', 't53', etc.\n\nI don't see any NT that produces t73. Therefore, the string starts with t73, which can't be derived from any NT in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Perhaps the initial S produces NT35 and NT45, which in turn produce other terms. Let me see:\n\nS can produce NT35 NT45. So let's consider that possibility.

{"custom_id":"request-544","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long and consists of a series of tokens separated by spaces. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. Let me look through the rules. The grammar starts with S and has productions like S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Then, there are many non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals like 't28', 't45', etc. Each production either combines two non-terminals or a non-terminal with a terminal. Some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT9 \u2192 't38', or NT46 \u2192 't66'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: t28 t45 t72 t7 t31 t59 t7 t45 t33 t40 t12 t32 t66 t10 t80 t73 t90 t91 t40 t27 t45 t38 t20 t38 t20 t27 t27 t38 t24 t33 t28 t17 t24 t24 t31 t72 t12 t32 t40 t7 t27.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This implies that any string generated by the grammar must have a length that is a power of 2, because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, either another non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The start symbol S is initially a non-terminal, and each production splits a non-terminal into two. So the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions needed to derive the string from S.\n\nLooking at the string, how long is it? Let me count the tokens: 1, 2, ..., up to 40. So, 40 tokens long. Is 40 a power of 2? 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 40 is not a power of 2. If the grammar is only allowed to generate strings of length that's a power of 2, then the answer should be No because 40 is not one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check if all the productions allow for the length to be any number. Wait, in CNF, each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the length of the string increases by 1 each time. But actually, if you have S \u2192 NT...NT..., then each step of replacing a non-terminal with two symbols increases the length by 1 each time you apply a production. So starting from S (length 1), after one application, the string length becomes 2. Then each non-terminal can be expanded similarly. So the total length is 2^n, yes. Therefore, any string generated must have a length that's a power of 2. Since 40 is not a power of two, it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Could there be a way to get a length that's not a power of two? For example, if there are multiple non-terminals in the start symbol, maybe different paths could lead to different lengths. But no, in CNF, each production is exactly two symbols. So no matter how you expand, each step adds one to the length because you replace a single non-terminal with two. Therefore, the total length must be a power of two. The start symbol S can derive a string of length 2^n for some n. \n\nSince the given string has 40 tokens, which is not a power of two, the answer must be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 40, which is not a power of 2. Context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form generate strings whose lengths are powers of two. Since 40 is not a power of two, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-550","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. First, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string thoroughly.\n\nThe grammar is a set of production rules. It looks like most of the non-terminals (like NT30, NT15, etc.) have multiple production rules that split them into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals (the 't's followed by numbers). The top-level non-terminals are S and some NTs.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a series of 't' terms and numbers, all space-separated. The string is quite long, so it's going to be a bit tedious, but let's see if we can break it down.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a recursive descent parser or something similar. But manually doing that on a long string is error-prone. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into the components defined by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has two production rules:\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo the string should, at some point, expand from either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Starting from the beginning:\n\nThe first part is 't28 t91 t17 t73 t77 t28 t76 t12 t53 t40 t32 t12 t27 t66 t66'.\n\nWait, each of these splits seems to come from non-terminals. Let's check if 't28 t91' can be derived from any NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT30 has a production to 't90' (from NT30 -> 't90'), but it also has a production to 't27' and others. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT30 has several productions:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nSo 't90' is a terminal derived from NT30. Similarly, 't53' and 't14' are terminals.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first two tokens are 't28' and 't91'. So does any NT expand to 't28 t91'?\n\nChecking the grammar, I see NT59 has a production to 't17' (from NT59 -> 't17'), and another to 't28'. Wait, let me look for any NT that can produce 't17' followed by something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a chain that leads to 't28 t91 t17...'. Maybe 't28' comes from NT44, which is NT44 -> 't45', but that doesn't help. Alternatively, NT59 -> 't17' or 't53' (if it's part of a production), but maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the entire string as a derivation from S.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules again for NTs:\n\nNT30: 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nNT35: 't15', 't25'\n\nNT43: 't46', 't1'\n\nNT15: 't1', 't25'\n\nNT45: 't59', 't5'\n\nNT35: 't15', 't1'\n\nNT25: 't32', 't56'\n\nNT15: 't44', 't33'\n\nNT53: 't46', 't1', 't59', 't7', 't56', 't28' etc.? Wait, need to check each production.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have multiple productions for some non-terminals. For example, NT15 has multiple rules like NT15 -> NT1 NT25, NT15 -> NT44 NT33, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to represent all productions as trees and see if the string can be built.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can build a parse tree for the string and see if it matches.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can look for patterns.\n\nLet me start from the beginning: the string starts with 't28 t91 t17 t73 t77 t28 t76 t12 t53 t40 t32 t12 t27 t66 t66'\n\nFirst token: t28. Which NT can produce t28?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT59 -> 't17' (directly 't17'), but also NT15 -> 't12' etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for 't28' in the productions.\n\nWait, looking back, 't28' is a terminal in some NT productions:\n\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT59 -> NT59 is connected to 't17' via NT59 -> 't17', and another production NT59 -> 't53'? Or wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT44 is in the productions for NT15: 't45'.\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me take a different approach. Let's build a mapping from the NTs to their possible terminal strings. Since all the NTs expand into pairs of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, each production is of the form NT -> X Y where X and Y can be terminals or NTs.\n\nIn the string, tokens are terminals, so each token must correspond to a production of an NT.\n\nSo, looking at the first tokens: 't28 t91 t17...'\n\nWait, but wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is binary. So each NT produces exactly two symbols (either NT or terminal). Therefore, the entire string must correspond to a sequence of such productions, making the string a sequence of 'binary splits' as per the derivation.\n\nBut the string is a flat list of tokens, so each adjacent pair must come from a single NT production.\n\nWait, but in the string, each token is a single terminal. So for example, if S -> NT30 NT53, then the string must start with the expansion of NT30 followed by NT53.\n\nBut NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. NT53 can produce 't40', 't7', 't59', 't1', 't28', etc.\n\nSo let's see. If the string starts with 't28', which is a terminal. So perhaps the first NT is NT53, which can produce 't28'. But let's check.\n\nLooking at NT53's productions:\n\nIn the grammar, NT53 has several rules:\n\n- NT53 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT53 -> 't59'\n- NT53 -> 't1'\n- NT53 -> 't28'\n- NT53 -> 't77'\n- NT53 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT53 -> 't17'\n- NT53 -> 't56' (from the grammar?)\n\nWait, I need to check all NT53's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the original grammar list isn't exhaustive, so I need to see which NT53 can produce 't28'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- There's NT53 -> 't46 NT1', but wait, no, looking at the initial grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1, which would split into two NTs, so it's a production that goes to two NTs.\n\nIn the string, 't28' is followed by 't91', so perhaps this comes from NT53.\n\nBut let's see: NT53 can produce 't28' in some rules, so if the string starts with 't28' followed by 'something', perhaps 't91', which would be from NT53.\n\nWait, no, because NT53 is an NT, which produces two symbols, so if the first token is 't28', it must come from a production of NT53 that's the first part. So if NT53 has a production that starts with 't28' as the first symbol, which it does: NT53 -> 't28 NT...'\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> 't17'\n- NT53 -> 't56' (from 't59'?)

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars such that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for certain parsing algorithms and for analyzing the structure of the language.\n\nThe grammar provided seems a bit complex, with multiple production rules starting from S and other non-terminals. My string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like \"t59 t66 t38...\" and so on. I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules first to get a better picture. Starting with S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo S is the start symbol, and each production leads to two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions. For example, NT30 can be NT35, NT44, etc. Some of the non-terminals directly produce a 't' followed by a number, like NT30 \u2192 't90', NT30 \u2192 't53', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t59 t66 t38 t53 t10 t27...\". I need to check if each segment of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to build a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can be derived. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step, checking each production.\n\nI think I'll start by looking at the overall structure. Since the string starts with 't59', which seems to come from NT59 according to the rules. Looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT59?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT59 directly, but wait, there's NT59 \u2192 't28' and another NT15 \u2192 NT15 \u2192 't12'. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rule NT59 isn't listed directly except perhaps in another rule. Hmm, no, the rules provided don't directly produce 't59'. Wait, actually, in the list of rules, I don't see NT59 as a terminal, but perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each line:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nLine 2: S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nThen:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't89'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't45'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT53 \u2192 't59'\n\nWait, no, NT53 has two rules: one is NT53 \u2192 't7' and another NT53 \u2192 't59' in line ... Let me check line 14:\n\nWait, line 11: NT53 \u2192 't7'\n\nLine 15: NT53 \u2192 't59'\n\nSo NT53 can produce either 't7' or 't59'. Similarly, looking for 't59' in the string, the first token is 't59'. So the first step could be that the first production is NT53 \u2192 't59'. So that would consume the first 't59'.\n\nNow, the remaining string is \"t66 t38 t53 t10 t27 t91 t38 t40 t45 t32 t32 t91 t29 t89 t28 t29 t40 t91 t17 t33 t66 t33 t77 t20 t66 t27 t59 t53 t29 t17 t72 t89 t31 t10 t80 t7 t10 t24 t17 t29 t66\".\n\nNext, after 't59', the grammar's S productions split into S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. But wait, we've already used one NT53, but S would require that both its components are used in the production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think: the entire string is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Since each production in the grammar ends with a terminal (except perhaps some non-terminals that might lead to other non-terminals, but from the provided rules, every terminal is a leaf). So each token in the string corresponds to a production.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each node in the parse tree would correspond to a production, which in turn would produce either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the string is built from a sequence of these productions.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of terminals, so the parse tree's leaves are these terminals. To check if the string is in the language, we can see if it can be split into the correct sequence of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process the string step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't59', which comes from NT53 \u2192 't59'. So the first part is handled by NT53.\n\nThen the next part is S \u2192 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string as a series of productions. Let me see. Starting from S, each production is two non-terminals. So the entire string would be covered by a series of such productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string, treating each terminal as a step in the derivation.\n\nBut this might be a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for the overall structure of the string. Let me count the number of tokens:\n\nThe string is: t59 t66 t38 t53 t10 t27 t91 t38 t40 t45 t32 t32 t91 t29 t89 t28 t29 t40 t91 t17 t33 t66 t33 t77 t20 t66 t27 t59 t53 t29 t17 t72 t89 t31 t10 t24 t17 t29 t66.\n\nThat's 43 tokens.\n\nSince S starts the derivation, each step of the grammar will expand non-terminals into either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each production contributes 1 or 2 tokens. But since the string has 43 tokens, which is an odd number, that can't be formed by S \u2192 NT X (since S starts and each production either adds 1 or 2). Wait, S \u2192 NT X, where NT is a non-terminal and X is another non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, starting with S, each step would consume 2 symbols if both NT and X are non-terminals, but each non-terminal could lead to more symbols. But in the context of a string, the overall number of symbols could be a sum of 2^n, but given that the string has 43 symbols, perhaps it's a straight expansion without any non-terminals in between. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a linear sequence of terminals, so the parse tree would have to correspond directly to this sequence without any non-terminals in the leaves. So perhaps each production used in the parse would only produce terminals, but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals branch into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, starting with S, suppose we take S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Then each of these could then be terminals or more non-terminals. So the string needs to be matched step by step.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with 't59', which is produced by NT53 \u2192 t59. So the first step could be NT53 \u2192 't59'.\n\nThen, after that, perhaps the next part is the next production that S produces, which is either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. But I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by building a parse tree bottom-up.\n\nLet me look for the end of the string and see if it can match"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of rules where each production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. This suggests that the grammar is in CNF because each production has either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that it's in CNF, the standard way to parse a string would involve breaking it down into a sequence of productions, each corresponding to splitting the string leftmost, replacing the non-terminal with the terminals and the right-hand side of the respective production.\n\nLet me list out the productions for clarity:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't59'\nNT56 -> 't28'\nNT11 -> 't28'\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT32 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT59 -> 't28'\nNT15 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't45'\nNT46 -> 't66'\nNT53 -> 't91'\nNT9 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't53'\nNT15 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't33'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nSo, the terminals are the 't' followed by a number, and some non-terminals that eventually expand into these terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to work backwards from the string, trying to split it into substrings that match the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions. I'll start from the beginning of the string and try to match each possible production, seeing if the string can be completely consumed without any leftover symbols.\n\nLet's denote the string as a list for easier manipulation. The string is:\n['t76', 't7', 't77', 't24', 't31', 't17', 't17', 't29', 't28', 't89', 't31', 't80', 't80', 't66', 't59', 't76', 't66', 't24', 't80', 't28', 't53', 't80', 't10', 't40', 't28', 't14', 't27', 't90', 't20', 't24', 't45', 't89', 't20', 't29', '17', 't40', 't91', 't53', 't89', 't24', 't27', 't32', '91']\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't89' there are two 't20's, then 't29', etc. Hmm, but looking back, the initial string seems to have 't20 t24 t45 ...' etc.\n\nI think it's better to proceed step by step, keeping track of the current string segment to match, using the leftmost derivation.\n\nI'll start with the entire string. The first symbol is 't76', which must come from a production. Looking at the grammar, 't76' is from NT44, and the production for NT44 is 't76'. But wait, looking at the productions, I don't see NT44 directly producing 't76'. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the given productions, NT44 is on the left side of a production, where NT44 -> 't76'. So NT44's production is a terminal 't76'. So, in the string, if I have 't76' as the first symbol, it must come from NT44 expanding to 't76'.\n\nSo, the first step is: S -> NT35 NT45 or S -> NT43 NT53. But the first symbol is 't76', which is a terminal, so I must be using the production S -> NT44 directly, but wait, S has only two productions, both involving other non-terminals. Wait, actually, S can't expand to a single terminal; it must expand to two non-terminals. Therefore, the initial string starts with 't76', which would have to come from one of the non-terminals on the right-hand side of S. But S can't be directly producing 't76' because S's productions are NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe S can produce NT44 NT44 or something. But no, according to the grammar, the only productions for S are S -> NT30 NT53 and S -> NT35 NT45. Neither of those produce 't76', so how does the string start with 't76'? That seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting NT30 or NT53. Let me check the productions again. NT30 has several productions, including 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. NT53 has 't7', 't76' (from NT44's production), 't59', 't59' via NT53->NT53? Wait, no, looking back, the production for NT53 includes NT53 -> 't7', which is a terminal. Wait, but how? Does NT53 directly produce 't7' or is it via other non-terminals?\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT53: 't7' is a direct production? Or is it 't7' via NT53 -> 't7'? Wait, the production is written as 't7', which is a terminal symbol, so yes, NT53 can produce 't7' directly.\n\nBut then, S produces NT30 and NT53. So the entire string must be derived from S, which splits into NT30 and NT53, each of which can expand into sequences of terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't76', which isn't directly produced by any of S's rules. So perhaps the first symbol is the result of some expansion from NT30 or NT53.\n\nWait, perhaps S is broken down into NT30 and NT53, each of which continues to expand until we get to the terminals. So perhaps the initial symbol is part of the expansion from either NT30 or NT53.\n\nBut then the first symbol in the string is 't76', so let me check NT30 and NT53 to see if they can expand to 't76'.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', etc. None of them directly produce 't76'. Wait, but what about NT44? NT44's production is 't76'. So perhaps NT30 can expand into NT44? But in the grammar, NT30's productions only consist of terminals, so if NT30 can produce '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because I know a few strategies for parsing such grammars. The string is quite long, so this might take some time, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, and S produces two non-terminals: NT30 NT53 in two cases. So the string must start with these two parts somewhere. But when I look at the string, the first token is t20, not a non-terminal like NT30 or NT53. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no\u2014looking again, the grammar doesn't actually have 't' tokens on the left side; all the productions start with non-terminals. So the string starts with 't20', which must be generated by some production. That means either the first part or the second part of S must derive into that.\n\nWait, no. Let's double-check. The grammar's productions are all of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for the two initial S productions which are NT combinations. So the top-level start symbol S can only produce strings of two NTs. But the string starts with 't20', which is part of an NT production, like NT15 -> 't1' NT something. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the grammar includes rules that produce actual 't' terms. For example, NT30 -> 't90', and also NT30 -> 't53', and so on. So 't' terms are terminal symbols. So the string is composed of sequences of 't' terms and other NTs.\n\nThe string is: `t20 t17 t12 t80 t33 t90 t14 t76 t32 t10 t40 t40 t77 t28 t31 t45 t20 t14 t77 t77 t89 t90 t76 t7 t20 t14 t80 t45 t91 t91 t28 t77 t77 t14 t80 t45 t27 t17 t33 t20 t76 t91 t73`.\n\nI notice that all tokens are 't' followed by a number. The grammar's non-terminals (NT) seem to produce various 't' terms, and some NTs may also produce other NT combinations.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that S can only produce combinations of two NTs, but in the string, the tokens are all individual 't's except perhaps some that are in the NT rules. Wait, no\u2014the string hasn't any NT symbols; all are 't's with numbers. So the initial S production would have to derive into a series of NTs, which then each derive into a 't's. But the grammar has S -> NT30 NT53 in two options. So each of those NT30 and NT53 would have to further derive into 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT30, I see that NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't27'. No, wait, looking again: The NT30 rules are:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n\nWait, no, actually looking back, the initial NT30 has several rules. Let me list them:\n\nFrom the grammar, under NT30:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14' (maybe?

The user wrote:\n\n\"NT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't30' -> maybe not.\"\n\nWait, no, looking back at the user's input, under NT30, it's:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't27' [from the last line: NT30 -> 't27']\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the rules properly.\n\nBut perhaps that's taking too long. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if we can derive the string using the given rules.\n\nThe string starts with 't20'. So perhaps one of the NTs that can produce 't20' is involved.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which non-terminals have rules that include 't20'.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT30: 't90', 't53', 't27'\n- NT1: 't89', 't10', 't4', etc.\n- NT15: 't12', 't44', 't38'\n- NT43: 't46', 't1'\n- NT53: 't7', 't59', 't91'\n- NT45: 't53', 't45', etc.\n- NT10: 't73', 't32', etc.\n- NT59: 't17', 't28', etc.\n- NT4: 't45', 't43' perhaps, wait let's check: under NT4, rules are 't45' and others.\nWait, no: let me list NT4's rules:\nLooking back: \n- NT43 -> 't46' and 't1'\nWait, no: under NT43, it's:\n- NT43 -> 't46' NT1\n- NT43 -> 't1' NT1\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between NT rules and T rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compile a list of all NTs and their possible 't' yields:\n\nLet me list each NT and the 't's they can produce:\n\n- NT30: 't90', 't53', 't27'\n- NT1: 't89', 't10', 't40', 't4', 't10' (Wait, need to check all rules)\nWait no, each rule for an NT can have multiple paths, but each rule is either a terminal or another pair of NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list which NTs can directly produce which 't's:\n\nFrom the user's grammar, looking at each rule:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT30 -> 't20' (Wait, no, I think the user's input had multiple rules for each NT.

{"custom_id":"request-570","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar provided is quite complex with multiple non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I have to figure out if it's part of the language defined by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe goal is to parse the given string using this grammar. Parsing context-free grammars is typically done using either a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm or a bottom-up approach like the Shunting-yard algorithm or recursive descent. Since the grammar might be large, top-down could be challenging without a parser generator, but maybe I can approach it manually.\n\nThe string is: `t14 t24 t14 t29 t14 t17 t38 t31 t32 t20 t14 t29 t45 t53 t72 t24 t45 t28 t29 t45 t20 t32 t72 t66 t20 t40 t20 t20 t14 t72 t72 t66 t53 t12 t73 t20 t10 t91 t80 t12 t14 t40 t12 t59`.\n\nEach token is a single terminal, so each token must be produced by a production rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production can result in one terminal or two non-terminals. However, since all the provided rules either have two non-terminals or one terminal, the parse would need to handle this.\n\nI think the approach is to start with the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step. But since the string is quite long, I need a systematic way.\n\nFirst, let's list all the production rules:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43-> NT53 NT11\nNT15->NT1 NT25\nNT45->NT59 NT5\nNT35->NT15 NT1\nNT25->NT32 NT56\nNT15->NT44 NT33\nNT53->NT46 NT1\nNT35->NT1 NT4\nNT33->NT62 NT7\nNT1->NT10 NT4\nNT62->NT43 NT16\nNT5->NT9 NT43\nNT16->t72\nNT30->t90\nNT30->t53\nNT30->t14\nNT1->t89\nNT53->t7\nNT7->t91\nNT56->t45\nNT30->t27\nNT10->t73\nNT25->t29\nNT43->t40\nNT53->t59\nNT56->t28\nNT11->t28\nNT59->t17\nNT32->t77\nNT1->t10\nNT59->t28\nNT15->t12\nNT10->t32\nNT44->t76\nNT4->t45\nNT46->t66\nNT53->t91\nNT9->t38\nNT4->t53\nNT15->t38\nNT4->t33\nNT59->t24\nNT9->t20\nNT53->t80\nNT16->t31\n\nSo, all production rules either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. Since the string starts with t14, I need to find a production that starts with t14.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT30 has t14 as an option. Specifically:\n\nNT30 -> t14.\n\nSimilarly, in the S rules:\n\nS can be NT30 NT53. So S can produce t14 and something else.\n\nWait, let's process this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t14, which must come from a production rule that produces t14. The possible rules are NT30 -> t14 and NT1 -> t89 (but t89 isn't in the string, so that's irrelevant). So, the first part of the string must be from NT30 -> t14.\n\nAfter using NT30 -> t14, the remaining string is: t24 t14 t29 t14 t17 t38 t31 t32 t20 t14 t29 t45 t53 t72 t24 t45 t28 t29 t45 t20 t32 t72 t66 t20 t40 t20 t20 t14 t72 t72 t66 t53 t12 t73 t20 t10 t91 t80 t12 t14 t40 t12 t59.\n\nWait, but the first token is t14, which comes from NT30. The next production would involve NT53, so S is NT30 NT53.\n\nNow, after t14, the next token is t24. So, the second part must be generated by NT53. From the production rules, NT53 can produce 't7' (as per NT53->t7), 't91' from NT53->t91, or via other rules like NT53->NT46 NT1, etc.\n\nLooking at NT53's rules, there's NT53->t7, t91, and also NT35->NT1 NT4, but that's irrelevant here.\n\nWait, in the S -> NT30 NT53, so after NT30->t14, NT53 needs to produce t24 as the next token.\n\nLooking at NT53's production rules, does it have a production for 't24'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through NT53's rules:\n\n- NT53->t7\n- NT53->t91\n- NT35->NT1 NT4 (but that's under NT35, not NT53)\n- NT59->t17\n- NT9->t38 (again under NT9)\n- NT53->t59\n- NT56->t45 (under NT56)\n- Other rules under NT53 are:\n   - NT30->t14, t27, etc., but these are under NT30.\n   - Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking back: The rules for NT53 are:\n\n- NT53->t7\n- NT53->t91\n- NT53->t59 (from NT53->t59)\n- Also, from NT53->NT9 NT43, which is a production to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT53's productions correctly.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT53->t7\nNT53->t91\nNT53->t59\nNT59->t24 (since NT59->t24 is a rule)\n\nWait, no. Let me check each rule line by line.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLine 10: NT53->t7\nLine 11: NT53->t59\nOh wait, line 11 is NT53->t59.

The grammar is a bit complex with many productions, and the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and it has two productions:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must be a combination of results from these two productions, and each production leads to a sequence of symbols that eventually derive the string.\n\nLooking at the string provided: `t29 t7 t90 t28 t40 t72 t24 t77 t12 t76 t91 t90 t28 t77 t32 t27 t73 t14 t7 t33 t24 t59 t24 t76 t72 t40 t29 t89 t38 t7 t40 t76 t76 t31 t14 t12 t72 t24 t76 t72 t27 t53 t10 t20`.\n\nI notice that it's a list of tokens, so each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Each of these t-X tokens is a terminal, as they map directly to a specific production, while NT-something are non-terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived by applying the productions in the grammar. Let me analyze the possible paths.\n\nStarting from S, let's consider the two options:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT30 NT53\nSo, the string starts with NT30 and NT53. Wait, but looking at the string, the first token is t29, not NT30 or NT53. Hmm. Maybe I need to see if any of these NT30 or NT53 can produce t29.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT30 has several rules:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n\nSo NT30 can derive t90, t53, or t14. But the string starts with t29. So none of the directly derived tokens from NT30 match t29. That seems problematic because the first token should have come from NT30 or NT35, depending on the option from S. Since the string starts with t29, which isn't directly produced by NT30 or NT35, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think more deeply. Let me check if the grammar has a way for NT30 or other production units to produce t29.\n\nLooking at the productions, none of the NT30, NT35, or other NTs produce t29. So from that, it's impossible for the string to start with t29 because NT30 and NT35 don't produce t29. This suggests that the grammar can't generate a string starting with t29. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misread the grammar. Let me double-check. I see that in the NT30 productions, t29 isn't listed. Looking for any NTs that can produce t29, I don't see it anywhere in the grammar. So t29 must have come from a terminal symbol, but in the grammar, there's no rule that produces t29.\n\nThus, the string begins with a token that's not part of any production in the grammar, making it impossible for the grammar to generate the string.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side consists of two non-terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That's helpful because it means I can parse the string by breaking it down into parts that match these two-terminal symbols or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are several non-terminals that expand into terminals or other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Both NT30 and NT53 have productions that eventually resolve to terminals. So if I start with S, it's going to expand into combinations of these terminal symbols.\n\nThe given string is: `t28 t31 t45 t33 t31 t66 t45 t20 t7 t17 t80 t77 t53 t12 t76 t77 t20 t53 t40 t38 t29 t38 t59 t12 t20 t45 t80 t77 t14 t59 t28 t77 t90 t53 t89`.\n\nI'll try to break this string into components that match the grammar's productions. The strategy here is to split the string into segments where each segment is a result of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nLet's start from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with t28. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT59 \u2192 t17, NT32 \u2192 t77, NT53 \u2192 t91, etc. But I don't see a production directly leading to t28. Wait, there's a rule NT44 \u2192 t76, but nothing directly to t28. Hmm, actually, looking at the rules, maybe I missed something. Let me go through the NT rules:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT15 also has NT15\u2192 NT44 NT33 elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at the NT rules, I think I need to find how to get to t28. Maybe looking at NT59: NT59\u2192 t24, which is from NT59 \u2192 NT9 NT43, and then NT9 is t38, and NT43 is t91, so t24. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. The user provided a long list of NT rules, each with two non-terminals on the right. So to find t28, I need to see which non-terminal directly expands to t28. Looking through the list, I see:\n\nLooking at NT53 rules, but none go to t28. NT30: no. NT1: does NT1 expand to t28? Checking, NT1\u2192 t89, NT10\u2192 't73', etc. No. NT25\u2192t29? No, looking: NT25\u2192 NT32 NT56. So NT32\u2192t77, NT56\u2192t45. So t29 might come from NT56? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each step.

No, NT25\u2192NT32 NT56, which is t77 and t45, but no.\n\nWait, maybe I should go through each NT rule and see their possible expansions. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string is t28 t31 t45... So first, I need to find a way to get t28.

{"custom_id":"request-584","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that all productions be in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules. The string is: `t12 t73 t12 t90 t20 t89 t80 t10 t77 t73 t53 t90 t53 t12 t76 t20 t80 t53 t53 t76 t72 t38 t72 t10 t32 t53 t12 t45 t29 t32 t40 t38 t77 t89 t80 t77 t45 t91 t77 t31 t10 t73 t45 t73 t89`.\n\nMy initial thought is to look at the grammar rules and see if each 't' token in the string corresponds to a production from the non-terminals. Since the start symbol is S, I'll likely need to start from S and trace down the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string must start with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Looking at the string, the first token is t12. Let me check if there's a production for NT12. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT12 isn't listed as a starting non-terminal, but it might be a terminal. Wait, no, the productions only go from non-terminals to other symbols. So if t12 is a terminal, it must be directly produced by something, but in this grammar, all productions are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal to a terminal. Wait, no, the productions are all like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, meaning a can be a terminal. So t12 could be a terminal symbol produced by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see several NT30, NT35, etc., that seem to lead directly to 't's. For example, NT30 can produce t90, t53, t27, t30 (I think some of these are typo'd, but as per the given grammar, NT30 can go to 't90', 't53', etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT30 is split into multiple rules, each replacing it to a 't' followed by another number. For example, NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. So each of those 't...s are terminals.\n\nSo, starting with NT30, the first token is t12. But according to the grammar, NT30 can produce t27, t90, t53, t14, etc., but not t12. So that's a problem, because the first part is t12, which might not be a direct production from NT30 or NT35.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NT symbols are the non-terminals, and the 't's are leaves. So the parsing process would involve replacing the non-terminals step by step until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t12. To produce t12, there must be a production from a non-terminal to t12. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t12. The closest is NT12, but the productions given don't have that. So maybe I'm thinking wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals can produce other non-terminals that eventually lead to 't's. For example, maybe NT30 leads to another non-terminal that then leads to a 't'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT30 has several productions to 't's, like 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. So if NT30 is the start, it can split into two non-terminals that then each produce a 't's.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which splits into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So let's see if both these non-terminals can expand to match the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. Let's check the start options:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53\nSo first, NT30 must produce the first t12. But looking at NT30's productions, none are t12. Wait, that's a problem. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps the first part is not directly matching, but maybe it's a non-terminal that produces t12 through a chain.\n\nLooking more carefully, let's list all the productions for each non-terminal to see how they can be derived into 't's.\n\nFor example, NT30 has several rules leading to 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. So to get a t12, perhaps there's a path through other non-terminals.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that leads NT30 to t12. Alternatively, maybe t12 is a terminal, so there must be a production from a non-terminal that directly leads to t12. But from the given rules, I don't see any rule for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT12, but then NT12 is not listed as a non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are S, NT30, NT35, etc., but perhaps I'm missing some. For example, is there an NT12? I don't see any rule where NT12 is the left-hand side. So if the first part is t12, it's a terminal, which can only be produced if a non-terminal directly produces it. Since there's no such rule, this would mean the string can't be generated. But that can't be right because the string has t12 in the first position.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, for NT30, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' (twice, maybe typo), 't53', 't14', 't27' \u2014 but no t12. So none of NT30's productions produce t12 directly. So to produce t12, it must come from a non-terminal that can lead to it through expansion.\n\nBut the only non-terminals we have are the ones listed, and none seem to produce t12. So it's impossible for t12 to appear at the start of the string. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I overlooked something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, are there any NT that can produce t12? Scanning through, I don't see any production where a non-terminal leads directly to t12. So unless t12 is part of a chain, it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t12, which cannot be generated by any production in the grammar.

In CNF, each production rule on the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols.

For example, NT30 has three rules leading to 't90', 't53', and 't14'. Similarly, NT15 has multiple rules leading to different terminals. Some of these seem redundant, but for the purpose of solving the problem, I can just note that each non-terminal can expand into various terminal symbols.\n\nNow, the input string is:\n\nt38 t45 t20 t53 t28 t76 t72 t59 t17 t53 t77 t10 t76 t53 t53 t31 t80 t77 t7 t27 t40 t90 t10 t91 t80 t80 t45 t38 t33 t77 t20 t76 t45 t90 t73 t66 t72 t91 t89 t27 t33 t27 t72 t32 t76 t66.\n\nI need to see if this string is a possible derivation starting from S, using the given grammar. To do this, I think the best approach is to parse the string using the grammar or to see if the string can be decomposed according to the rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that match the possible productions.\n\nStarting with the first token: t38.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT15 can lead to 't12'? No, wait. Looking at the rules, NT15 has productions like NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4, and also NT15 \u2192 't12'. So maybe the first part of the string corresponds to NT15 expanding to 't12'? Wait, the first token is 't38', though. Let me see.\n\nWait, NT33 can lead to 't77' or 't20' or 't33' or 't10', etc. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7. Also, NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16, which eventually leads to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to build the parse tree from the string upwards or from S downwards.\n\nBut given the length of the string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps looking for sub-strings that correspond to possible expansions.\n\nLet's look for any occurrence of NT15 \u2192 't12'. In the string, does 't12' appear? Let me scan the string:\n\nt38, t45, t20, t53, t28, t76, t72, t59, t17, t53, t77, t10, t76, t53, t53, t31, t80, t77, t7, t27, t40, t90, t10, t91, t80, t80, t45, t38, t33, t77, t20, t76, t45, t90, t73, t66, t72, t91, t89, t27, t33, t27, t72, t32, t76, t66.\n\nNo 't12' in the string, so that production isn't used here. Maybe I should look for other non-terminals that expand into 't38' or other similar terminal tokens.\n\nLooking at NT9 \u2192 't38'. So if part of the string starts with 't38', then it might come from NT9. But wait, NT9's production is only NT9 \u2192 't38', so it's a single terminal. So 't38' can be directly derived from NT9.\n\nSo the first token 't38' would be NT9.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the grammar, the rule is NT9 \u2192 't38'. So that makes sense. So that would correspond to NT9.\n\nSo the string starts with 't38' as NT9.\n\nNext, after 't38', the next token is 't45'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which productions result in 't45'? Let's see. Looking through the RHS:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43, but NT43 \u2192 t40 eventually, but NT43's expansion includes t40 and NT16 \u2192 t31.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-594","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is quite long, so I'll need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar rules. The grammar has a start symbol S, and the productions are all in CNF, meaning each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or a non-terminal on the right. Wait, actually, looking back, it seems some rules produce terminals on the right. Hmm, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C, and a are non-terminals or terminals. So in this case, some of the productions are direct terminals, which is a bit different from standard CNF but still usable.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t76 t33 t73 t72 t59 t33 t28 t72 t66 t45 t91 t76 t31 t20 t28 t38 t28 t32 t40 t17 t90 t14 t77 t17 t24 t7 t59 t80 t38 t29 t45 t91 t38 t27 t59 t17 t66 t59 t89 t10 t80 t76 t66 t20 t24 t14`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t76, so I'll check where the start symbol S can produce t76. Looking through the productions, the start symbol S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So S produces S = NT30 NT53. Now, both NT30 and NT53 are non-terminals, so I need to expand them.\n\nLet's look up the productions for NT30 and NT53.\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', which are terminals. So t90, t53, or t14. But in our string, the first part is t76 t33..., so I need to see if any of these expansions match t76. Wait, actually, the string starts with t76, but NT30 can only produce t90, t53, or t14. So starting from S, the first symbol is a terminal, which must be one of the terminals derived from S's expansion. But wait, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which means the first part of the string is NT30, which can be t90, t53, or t14.\n\nBut the string starts with t76, which is not one of the immediate symbols in S's expansion. Wait, maybe I made a mistake because in Chomsky Normal Form, the starting symbol often produces a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, maybe I should approach this by seeing if the entire string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by starting at S and expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain. So each production is a pair, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backwards, which is a common approach for LL(1) parsers, and since the grammar is in CNF, maybe this can work.\n\nThe string starts with t76 and ends with t14. So the last symbol is t14, which likely comes from a NT14 production. Looking at the grammar, I see that some NT rules produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal. For example, NT7 \u2192 't91', which would end the derivation if NT7 is the last non-terminal, but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each step backwards, breaking the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me look for the terminal 't14': which production produces 't14'? Looking back, I see NT1 -> 't10', NT25 -> 't29', NT30 -> 't14', etc. So NT30 \u2192 't14' is one possibility. If the last symbol is t14, then it must come from NT30. So the last part of the string would be NT30 \u2192 t14. But in the string, the last symbol before t14 is t17..., maybe. Hmm, perhaps my approach needs to be more structured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into pairs of non-terminals, using the fact that each production is two non-terminals or terminals. Wait, but the grammar allows S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which is two non-terminals, but those can further split into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to map out the string's factors.\n\nThe string has 70 symbols, which is even, so maybe each expansion step reduces the number of non-terminals by two until all are terminals. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the string can be parsed step by step, expanding non-terminals until the entire string is matched.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for possible ways to break down the string into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nLet me start by seeing if the first few symbols can be matched by any of the S's expansions. But no, because S's first expansion is non-terminals, not terminals. So the first two symbols must come from the expansion of S's NT30 and NT53.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Let's clarify: S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So after expanding S, the first symbol is whatever NT30 expands to, and the second is whatever NT53 expands to. Since NT30 can be t90, t53, or t14, and NT53 can be various things. But the string starts with t76, which is not among these.\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe the string is not generated by this grammar. But I should not jump to conclusions. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me re-express the grammar rules properly.\n\nLooking back, each production is a single rule, such as S \u2192 NT30 NT53. So S is replaced by two non-terminals: NT30 and NT53. Then each of those can be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals resulting from these expansions.\n\nIf the string starts with t76, but S starts with NT30, which can produce t90, t53, or t14, none of which is t76. So this suggests that the string starts with t76, which cannot be produced by NT30 or NT53.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me double-check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the productions again, I think I made a mistake earlier. For NT30, according to the grammar:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial list:\n\nWait, in the grammar given earlier, under NT30: 't90', 't53', 't14' as per the user's message. So when S expands to NT30 NT53, the first symbol is one of these. But the given string starts with t76, which isn't among the options for NT30.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because the first symbol t76 can't come from NT30's expansion.\n\nBut wait, this might not be the case because t76 could come from a higher-level expansion. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions have more details. Wait, in the user's message, under NT59 and NT30, there are multiple productions, like:\n\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nIs that correct? So NT30 can produce any of those terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t76, which is not among these options. Therefore, the string cannot start with t76, so it's impossible for it to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm being too hasty. Maybe the NT30 can produce more than just the terminals listed. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT30 can produce t90, t53, t14. So only those.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t76, which isn't among these. So the string must be invalid because it starts with t76, which is not produced by any rule of NT30.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the grammar. Maybe some non-terminals produce more than just terminals. For example, could any rule in the grammar produce a terminal sequence longer than one?\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have only productions where each left-hand side expands into either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a terminal. But according to the standard CNF, productions can be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this case, it looks like all productions are in CNF, with each production being either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo for"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-601","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is quite long with a lot of 't' tokens. \n\nFirst, I should remember what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, each rule seems to fit this structure because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals (often followed by a number) or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which fits because it's a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is:\n`t17 t91 t66 t27 t28 t27 t24 t77 t24 t14 t45 t32 t10 t12 t20 t76 t40 t20 t31 t66 t28 t14 t24 t80 t73 t24 t31 t29 t28 t17 t72 t24 t27 t40 t66 t89 t90 t38 t53 t59 t66 t73 t73 t90 t90 t20 t76`\n\nLooking at each token, I can see that most are numbers, but a few start with a 't', like t17, t91, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each terminal must be a single character, so 't' followed by a digit is a terminal. \n\nThe main approach to determine if the string is in the language is to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the entire string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production can be applied only to a single non-terminal at a time. \n\nLooking at the grammar's initial rules:\n- S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So, the start symbol S leads to two non-terminals, each of which can further break down.\n\nI notice that in the string, the first part starts with t17, t91, t66, etc. Let me see which rules correspond to these. For example, t91 appears in NT9 \u2192 t91, so if I see t91, that must come from NT9. Similarly, t72 comes from NT16 \u2192 t72, and NT16 itself has production NT31. \n\nBut going through all this might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if certain parts of the string repeat in a way that aligns with the grammar's rules. \n\nWait, the string is quite long, and the grammar's rules produce various terminals like t90, t53, t45, etc. Each time a non-terminal is involved, it expands into two other non-terminals until we get to a terminal token. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a way to split the string into valid units according to the grammar's productions. Since the string is long, I might need to break it down step by step, but that might not be efficient. \n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string has certain lengths that are allowed by the grammar. Each production in CNF takes a non-terminal and expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each expansion increases the number of symbols. The string given is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals; I need to see if this sequence can result from a leftmost derivation of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of non-terminals and terminals. But wait, the grammar is CNF, so each production rule replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to derive a string consisting solely of terminals, the number of non-terminals used must equal the number of terminals minus one, because each non-terminal except the last will be replaced step by step.\n\nWait, no. Let's think: starting with S as a single non-terminal, each application adds one non-terminal (since each step either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal). So, the number of non-terminals will always be one more than the number of terminals at any step. Wait, no: starting with 1, each step increases the count by 1. For example, the first step from S would either lead to two non-terminals or a terminal. If it's two non-terminals, then to get to terminals, each of those would need to expand, introducing more non-terminals. So the total number of non-terminals in the string would be equal to (number of terminals - 1), but I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nActually, each expansion of a non-terminal into two non-terminals increases the number of symbols by one (since one non-terminal becomes two, so net gain of one). Starting from S, which is one symbol, to reach a string of M terminals, each production step can be thought of as adding one symbol at a time because each non-terminal expansion can either turn one non-terminal into two (so the count increases by one). So, to reach M terminals, we need M-1 expansions. So, the total number of tokens in the string should be equal to M, which is the length of the string. Let's count the number of tokens here.\n\nThe string is: \n\nt17 t91 t66 t27 t28 t27 t24 t77 t24 t14 t45 t32 t10 t12 t20 t76 t40 t20 t31 t66 t28 t14 t24 t80 t73 t24 t31 t29 t28 t17 t72 t24 t27 t40 t66 t89 t90 t38 t53 t59 t66 t73 t73 t90 t90 t20 t76\n\nLet's count them:\n\nThat's 55 tokens. So, starting from S (1), we need 55 tokens. Since each expansion increases the count by 1, the number of expansions needed is 54. So, S would expand into terminals with 54 steps. That's feasible, but I don't know if the specific sequence of terminals is correct.\n\nI think the better approach is to try and identify whether each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar. Looking at each 't' followed by a number, I can see which rules produce those.\n\nLet me make a list of where each 't' comes from. For example:\n\n- t17: Looking at the rules, I don't see NT17 producing t17 directly. Wait, looking through the rules, I see that some NTs produce terminals. Looking through the list, I notice some rules have terminal tokens like t7, t17, etc. For example, NT43 \u2192 t40 and t66, or perhaps I'm looking at the right ones.\n\nWait, let me list the rules that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT7 \u2192 t91\n- NT9 \u2192 t38, t53, t59\n- NT4 \u2192 t45, t53\n- NT5 \u2192 t9\n- NT7 \u2192 t7\n- NT30 \u2192 t90, t53, t14\n- NT35 \u2192 t15 (which leads to more nt rules)\nWait, actually, many NTs have production rules that involve other NTs. The ones that produce terminals are those that have a terminal as a direct production, e.g., NT30 \u2192 't90', which means when NT30 is used to produce a terminal, it's replaced by 't90'. Similarly, NT30 \u2192 't53' and 't14'.\n\nSo, perhaps each terminal in the string must come from a production rule where that NT directly expands to that terminal.\n\nSo, for example, t90 comes from NT30, t53 from NT30, t14 from NT30, t72 comes from NT16, etc.\n\nSo, now, each 't' in the string must match a terminal in one of the NT productions. Let's see:\n\nt17: I need to check if any NT directly leads to t17. Looking through the rules, I notice NT10 \u2192 t73, NT25 \u2192 t29, NT44 \u2192 t76, NT4 \u2192 t45, etc. Hmm, I don't see a direct t17. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules.\n\nLooking again, some NTs directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t91\n- NT1 \u2192 t89, t10, t4, etc. Wait, let me search the rules:\n\nYes, for example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t45, t53\n- NT46 \u2192 t66\n- NT45 \u2192 t59, t5\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, let me check.\n\nActually, looking at the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53, NT35 NT45\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't72'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73', 't32'\n- NT1 \u2192 't89', 't10', 't38', 't4', etc.\n- Also, other non-terminals like NT74, etc., but not sure if they are present.\n\nWait, looking at it again, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'. So the S production starts with S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Since NT30 can produce a terminal, that would mean S can produce a terminal string starting with t90, followed by whatever NT53 produces.\n\nThe given string is: `t27 t80 t10 t76 t7 t10 t14 t38 t33 t27 t17 t66 t91 t29 t73 t7 t27 t20 t31 t10 t24 t33 t89 t40 t33 t66 t66 t90 t10 t24 t91 t31 t76 t27 t7 t33 t7 t90 t33 t66 t29 t32 t89 t28 t20 t66 t32`.\n\nWow, that's quite long. I need to check if this string can be derived from S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nFirst, let me consider the structure of the grammar. Since each production is in CNF, each step in the derivation appends two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc.), but I think in CNF, each production is two non-terminals except for the terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. But in this case, some productions directly include terminals, which seems contradictory. Oh, wait, maybe the given grammar is not strictly in CNF because some productions produce terminals. Let me check the original problem statement.\n\nIt says the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, but the productions sometimes produce terminals. Wait, maybe the user provided a non-CNF grammar. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the description. Alternatively, perhaps some productions have two terminals. But in the problem, the user says it's in CNF, so I should proceed under that assumption.\n\nWait, going back: Context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form have all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So actually, in this grammar, it's allowed for productions to produce a single terminal. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the given grammar does have some non-terminals producing terminals, like NT30 \u2192 't90', so that's correct for CNF.\n\nSo, for the derivation to proceed, S will start with NT30 NT53. Each of these can be terminals or non-terminals. Let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t27. Let's see if the first production matches. Since S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then the first part of the string must be the result of NT30 derivation and then NT53 derivation.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t27, which is a terminal. So let me see which non-terminals produce t27. Looking through the productions, NT10 \u2192 't73', 't32'; NT1 \u2192 't10', 't38', etc. Wait, where is t27 coming from?\n\nLooking at the production rules provided, do any non-terminals produce 't27'? Let me scan through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53, NT35 NT45\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't72'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73','t32'\n- NT1 \u2192 't89','t10','t38','t4','t33','t76','t32'\nWait, looking through these, do any non-terminals produce 't27'? Hmm. I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t27. Wait, maybe t27 is part of another non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to t27. So that's a problem because the first symbol is t27, but there's nothing that produces t27. That suggests that the string can't be generated by this grammar, which would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the productions again:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't89', 't10', 't38', 't4', 't33', 't76', 't32', etc.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't73', 't32'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n\nHmm, so no direct production for t27. So the first symbol t27 can't be produced by any non-terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Did I perhaps misread the production for NT15? Let me recheck:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25; NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n\nBTW, wait, looking again, the user input of the grammar seems a bit jumbled. Did I miss some productions?

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. The string I need to evaluate is quite long, and each token is separated by spaces, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. The non-terminals are designated by uppercase letters: S, NT30, NT35, NT15, NT43, NT1, NT45, NT33, NT11, NT53, NT59, NT32, NT10, NT44, NT4, NT56, NT62, NT7, NT5, etc. Each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, it has two production rules:\nS -> NT30 NT35\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals derived from either of these two paths. The given string starts with 't12', so I need to see if 't12' can be derived from one of the start symbols.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't12', and looking at the non-terminals, 't12' is a terminal and can be produced by NT12. Hmm, but in the grammar provided, I don't see a production for NT12. That\u2019s confusing. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT12 as a non-terminal or as a terminal. Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, the string has 't12' as part of it. Let me check all the productions for NT12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT17 NT5\n- NT9 -> NT38 NT38\nHmm, I don't see NT12 in any production. So, if the string has 't12', which is produced by NT12, but NT12 doesn't exist in the grammar, that might mean that 't12' isn't possible. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check: in the grammar, after NT10 there's NT25 -> NT32 NT56, then NT15 -> NT44 NT33, etc. I don't see any production leading to 't12' elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look at all the productions starting with NT15, NT1, etc.\n\nLooking at NT1 and its productions:\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT1 -> NT53 NT1\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT77\nWait, that's it! Oh, I see. So there's a production NT1 -> NT12 NT77. So from NT1, we can go to NT12 and then NT77, which are both non-terminals or can lead to terminals. So 't12' is produced by NT12, which is derived from NT1. So that's possible.\n\nBut wait, does the NT12 exist as a terminal? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production of the form NT12 -> something terminal. So maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the NT12 is a typo or perhaps it's supposed to be another symbol. Alternatively, perhaps the NT12 is part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps 't12' is a terminal, and it's produced by NT12. But in the grammar, is there a production where NT12 is on the left side? Let's check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I don't see any rule that has NT12 on the left side. So that suggests that NT12 is a non-terminal that doesn't have a production rule. Therefore, if the string contains 't12', it's only possible if NT12 can produce 't12' directly, but that's not the case. So the string can't be generated because 't12' isn't allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought NT1 could produce 't12' because of NT1 -> NT12 NT77. Let me check that. If NT12 is a terminal, then NT12 must have a production rule. But in the given grammar, there's no such rule. That suggests that NT12 cannot produce 't12', meaning that 't12' can't be derived from NT1, so the initial assumption is wrong, which would mean that the string can't start with 't12' because the start symbol S doesn't have a production that would derive 't12'.\n\nWait, but that contradicts earlier. Let me re-express this.\n\nThe string's first token is 't12', which must be the result of some non-terminal (since terminals are leaves and can't be split further). So we need to see if any non-terminal can generate 't12'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any rules directly produce 't12'? For example, is there a production X -> 't12'? Looking through the list:\n\n- I see rules like S -> NT30 NT35, which have terminals.\n- NT30 -> 't90', etc.\n- NT3 -> something else, but I don't see any NT12 in there.\n\nWait, maybe there's a production for NT12 that I'm missing. Let me go through all the rules again to make sure. I see NT15, NT1, etc., but no NT12. So there is no production for NT12, so it's unclear how 't12' would be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assessment. Let me double-check. NT1 has a production NT1 -> NT12 NT77. So if NT12 is a non-terminal, it must have a production that either terminates or splits into other symbols. But since NT12 isn't a terminal in the grammar (as no production ends with it), then it's impossible for 't12' to appear as a terminal. Thus, the string can't have 't12' as part of it because it's not allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT1 can produce 't12' through NT12, but since there's no production for NT12, it's impossible. So the string contains 't12', which isn't possible, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the production NT1. Looking at the line:\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT77\n\nSo, this production allows NT1 to produce NT12 and NT77. But if NT12 is a non-terminal, then it needs to be expanded into terminals. But in our grammar, there's no production that allows NT12 to produce a terminal. Therefore, NT12 is stuck as a non-terminal, which can't be a terminal because it can't derive to a single terminal. Therefore, the production NT1 -> NT12 NT77 can never result in the terminal 't12' because NT12 can't expand to 't12'. Thus, the string can't start with 't12'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No' because the string contains 't12', which isn't allowed by the grammar since there's no production rule for NT12 and no production for NT1 that leads to 't12' as a terminal. So it's impossible for 't12' to be part of any string generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-615","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string I need to check is quite long with a series of 't' followed by some numbers. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have specific production rules. Each non-terminal must produce two non-terminals or a terminal, except for the start symbol. In this case, the grammar seems to be in CNF because every production, except for maybe some, looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Wait, looking at the rules, I see that almost all non-terminals are expanding into two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which is two NTs. Then, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11, again two NTs. But then I see an exception: NT4 \u2192 't45', which is a terminal. That's fine because some non-terminals can produce terminals. Wait, the others like NT1 \u2192 't10', but others might have multiple productions. So the structure seems okay.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals, each being a 't' followed by a number. The string is as follows: \n`t76 t27 t90 t10 t66 t53 t73 t73 t33 t28 t32 t76 t89 t38 t20 t53 t33 t28 t24 t12 t72 t76 t45 t66 t53 t73 t27 t53 t10 t32 t24 t14 t31 t29 t7 t89 t66 t28 t38 t31 t40 t91 t24 t32 t10 t66 t72 t90`.\n\nMy first thought is to compare the string length with what I expect. CNF allows for the derivation of a string whose length is a power of two. But wait, the number of symbols isn't necessarily a strict power of two because the grammar allows for the start symbol to produce two non-terminals, and each non-terminal could produce either two non-terminals or terminals. So the string length can vary. For example, starting with S, which produces two NTs, each could produce two more, etc., leading to 2^n symbols. But in this case, the string has 69 symbols. I need to see if the total number of non-terminals can lead to this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by parsing the string using the grammar. That is, start from the start symbol and see if it can derive the entire string. So, let's see: the string starts with 't76'. Looking at the grammar rules, what non-terminals can derive 't76'? Scanning through the right-hand sides, I notice NT9 \u2192 't38', but no NT with 't76'. Wait, looking again, there's NT89 in the NT list? Let me check the production rules. Oh, no, looking at the list: I don't see any NT with 't76' as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, the string starts with 't76 t27 ...'. Checking the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't76'. So, if that's the case, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is 't76', which is not produced by any non-terminal. \n\nWait, did I miss any production? Let me check the grammar again. The rules for NTs:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't45'\n- NT46 \u2192 't66'\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT1 \u2192 't10', 't89', 't4'\n- Maybe others produce 't's with other numbers.\n\nBut nowhere do I see a production rule that generates 't76'. So 't76' is not present in any of the right-hand sides. That would mean the grammar cannot derive a string starting with 't76'. Therefore, the string in question cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nSo, I think the answer is No because the string starts with a terminal that isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I misread. Maybe 't76' is part of a longer production. Wait, no, looking at the rules, every production either results in a terminal or non-terminals. For example, NT93 would produce more NTs, but if I look at the NTs, none of them directly produce 't76'. So my initial conclusion is correct.

For example, NT15 has several productions.\n\nOkay, so the start symbol is S, which can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's break down the string into parts based on these initial productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't72 t10 t89...', so I need to see if this can be derived from either S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how NT30 and NT53 can produce the initial part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT30: it can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. But the first token in the string is 't72', which isn't directly produced by NT30. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up NTs and 't' symbols.\n\nWait, wait, no. The string starts with t72, which comes from a terminal production. So looking back at the grammar, I see that NT16 -> 't72' and NT30 has some NTs that eventually lead to 't72'? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, let's see: the string starts with t72 t10 t89. So let me see how 't72' gets generated. Looking at the grammar, NT16 -> 't72', so maybe some non-terminal ends up being NT16, which then becomes 't72'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the initial productions of S: S can produce NT30 and NT53, or NT35 and NT45.\n\nLet me try each option:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT30 NT53\n\nNT30's productions are NT30 -> 't90' (terminal), NT53 -> 't59' (terminal), or NT14 (which is possibly a non-terminal? Wait, no, looking back, NT30 is a non-terminal, and in the initial productions, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'\u2014wait, 't14' is a terminal? Or is it NT14? No, looking at the grammar, NT30 has 't90', 't53', 't14', which might be terminals?\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar presented, the rules have non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right, but the rules themselves sometimes have non-terminals in the right side. So each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no: the grammar is in CNF, so each production is of the form A -> BC or A-> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking again, the rules:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53 (so non-terminals on both sides? Wait, NT30 and NT53 are non-terminals, so this is A -> BC, where A is S, and BC are non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 has productions: NT30 -> 't90' (terminal), or NT30 -> 't53' (terminal), or NT30 -> 't14' (terminal). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 't14' is a terminal symbol, so NT30 can directly produce t14, which would be a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT30's productions are:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nWait, but that's not consistent with CNF because CNF allows non-terminals on the right side, but maybe in this case, some rules are allowing terminals on the right. So perhaps some of these productions are actually A -> a, where a is a terminal, and others are A -> BC.\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, the grammar is presented in a way where each line has a non-terminal on the left and either a terminal or another non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, 't's are terminals, right? So for example, NT30 can either directly produce 't90' (a terminal), or combine with another non-terminal.\n\nSo, for NT30:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' (terminal)\nNT30 -> 't53' (terminal)\nNT30 -> 't14' (terminal)\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean S could produce combinations of these, but each is a terminal. So perhaps S -> NT30 NT53, and then each is a terminal.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial string which starts with t72 t10 t89.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the non-terminals need to be expanded further.\n\nWait, maybe the rules for NT30 include some non-terminals that then expand into more symbols.\n\nWait, let me go back. The grammar for NT30 is:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the lines are actually something like NT30 -> NT something else.

{"custom_id":"request-619","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two main rules: each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar provided, I can see that all the productions on the right-hand side are either terminals or non-terminals, so it seems to fit CNF. That's a good start.\n\nNow, looking at the string that needs to be evaluated: it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either a string like 't14' or an abbreviation like 'NT30'. My goal is to parse this string according to the grammar and see if it's valid.\n\nWait, but how exactly do I approach this? I think I can use a parsing method, maybe the CYK algorithm, which is used for CNF grammars. But I'm not super familiar with the exact steps of CYK. Alternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string again to see its length. The string has 46 tokens, which seems quite long. Maybe there's a pattern or a structure that I can exploit.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. In the given string, where does S come into play? The initial productions of S are:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, every derivation starts with either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. Let me check the string's beginning. The first token is 't14'. I need to see if this is the start of the first option.\n\nWait, let's map the non-terminals to their respective terminals. For example, NT30 can correspond to 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT35 can be 't15', which in turn can be 't1' and others.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are 't14', then 't27', 't31', etc. So, 't14' is an option for NT30. So, the first part could be NT30. Then, the second part of S is NT53. Let me see if 't27' is an option for NT53. Hmm, looking through the rules, NT53 can produce 't59', 't17', 't7', 't59', 't17', 't7', 't59', 't17', 't7', and also 't73' under NT56, but wait, I think I might be mixing things up.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, NT53 has multiple productions. For example, NT53 -> NT46 NT1, which then can break down further. But perhaps that's getting too detailed. Let's try to build possible parse trees step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't14', which must come from NT30. So, the first production is S -> NT30 NT53. Then, 't14' could be the terminal part of NT30. The second part is NT53. What does NT53 produce? Let me see the rules:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1 (I think I saw that earlier)\n\nLooking at the string, after 't14', the next token is 't27'. Does 't27' match any production of NT53? Let me check:\n\nNT53 -> NT59 NT5. Hmm, that's 't59' and 't5', but 't59' is present later, but I don't see 't5' in the string. Alternatively, NT53 could be derived further.\n\nWait, the string is: t14 t27 t31 t76 t90 t31 t53 t12 t59 t90 t31 t38 t20 t12 t28 t89 t72 t73 t45 t72 t33 t10 t7 t80 t33 t80 t53 t45 t38 t91 t91 t17 t24 t76 t29 t32 t12 t17 t66 t14 t73 t12 t38 t89 t66 t33 t7 t7 t28.\n\nI see that after the initial 't14', the next is 't27', then 't31', but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should look for the overall structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals, so the parse tree should consist of non-terminals branching into other non-terminals or terminals. Since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to check if each terminal in the string can be matched by some rule, considering the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should try to parse the string using a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nS must be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, starting with 't14', which as I said is possible from NT30. So, let's tentatively assign the first production: S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nNow, the next step would be to parse 't14' under NT30 and the rest under NT53.\n\nBut 't14' is one of the options for NT30. So, that's easy.\n\nNow, the next thing to parse is the rest of the string: t27 t31 t76 t90 t31 t53 t12 t59 t90 t31 t38 t20 t12 t28 t89 t72 t73 t45 t72 t33 t10 t7 t80 t33 t80 t53 t45 t38 t91 t91 t17 t24 t76 t29 t32 t12 t17 t66 t14 t73 t12 t38 t89 t66 t33 t7 t7 t28.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try to break the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the string can be seen as a series of pairs of terminals, each pair matching a production of a non-terminal. So, for example, each production like NT30 being two terminals or two non-terminals that eventually produce two terminals.\n\nBut that's a bit vague. Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of terminals and non-terminals, but that might not be sufficient.\n\nWait, no, the string is a linear sequence of terminals and non-terminals (in the form of abbreviations like 't14', 'nt30', etc.), but in the string to be evaluated, all non-terminals are replaced by their abbreviations, or perhaps not. Wait, no, in the string to evaluate, it's a sequence of terminal symbols and non-terminals as per the grammar. So each token in the string corresponds to either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the string given, all tokens are either 't' followed by a number or are abbreviations like 'nt30', 'nt27', etc. But looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals (e.g., NT30 -> 't90', etc.) and some produce non-terminals.\n\nBut the string given uses the abbreviations, but in the actual string, do they map to terminals? For example, does 't14' come from NT30, which is a non-terminal, and another non-terminal NT53.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'nt' is a non-terminal, but in the string to evaluate, they are either terminals (if they directly correspond) or abbreviations for a production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the grammar provided, all non-terminals are either on the left-hand side or the right-hand side of productions, with some producing terminals (like 't30') and others producing non-terminals (like NT30 -> NT53 NT13). But the string to evaluate consists of a mix of these, e.g., 't14', 'nt27', etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to map each token in the string to either a terminal or a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me see: in the string, some tokens are 't' followed by numbers (e.g., 't14', 't27'), which correspond to specific non-terminals. Others are 'nt' followed by numbers, which are the non-terminals themselves (like NT14, NT27, etc.).\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case.

The string is: t90, t24, t31, t32, t32, t7, t10, t72, t38, t33, t73, t76, t53, t12, t17, t90, t29, t89, t31, t72, t27, t40, t7, t31, t24, t66, t76, t59, t20, t33, t17, t10, t32, t73, t24, t14, t72, t40, t17, t14, t91, t14, t91, t72, t80, t12, t28, t24, t14, t31.\n\nSo the first token is t90, which can be from NT30, as per the production rule NT30 -> t90. So that works. Now, the rest of the string should come from the other part, which in this case, after t90, the next token is t24. How do we get t24?\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, I see that NT59 -> t24, right? So the other part of the S production must be NT59, but NT59 produces t24 as a terminal. So after S -> NT30 NT53, the next parts need to be NT30 producing t90 and NT53 producing t24 if that's the case.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, wait, S's other production is NT35 NT45. So S can also produce NT35 and NT45. So if after t90, the next token is t24, maybe that's from NT59, which isn't directly under NT35 or NT45. Hmm, perhaps I need to see which NTs can produce t24. Let's check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT59 -> t24\n- NT53 -> t7\n- NT30 -> t90\n- NT1 -> various t's\n- NT25 -> t29\n- NT45 -> t45\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the second part is S -> NT35 NT45, so we have to produce the rest of the string from NT35 and NT45.\n\nWait, no, S can either produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string is [t90, t24, t31, ...]. So the first part is t90 from NT30, so the second part must be t24 from NT53. Let's see NT53's rules: looking at the grammar, NT53 has several rules, including NT53 -> t59, NT53 -> t7, and so on. Wait, no, according to the grammar, NT53's productions are:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT53 -> NT91 (twice)\nNT53 -> NT7 (twice)\nWait, no, let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT91 (two lines)\n- NT53 -> NT7 (two lines)\n- Also, others like NT53 -> t59, t90, etc.\n\nWait, no, the initial production for NT53 isn't shown, but looking at the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT91\n- NT53 -> NT7\n- Then further down:\n\n- NT53 -> t59\n- NT53 -> t90\n- Wait, did I miss that? Let me recheck:\n\nIn the grammar, NT53's rules are:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT53 -> NT91\nNT53 -> NT7\nNT53 -> t59\nNT53 -> t90\nNT53 -> t59\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nSo, actually, two rules where NT53 -> t59 and t90.\n\nSo, the options for NT53 are:\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT53 -> NT91\n- NT53 -> NT7\n- NT53 -> t59\n- NT53 -> t90\n\nSo, since the second token is t24, but in the rules, NT53 doesn't directly produce t24. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think: S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's assume the first choice, S -> NT30 NT53.\n\nSo, NT30 -> t90, so the first token is t90, which matches. Now, we need to produce the remaining tokens after t90, which are t24, t31, t32, etc., from NT53.\n\nBut looking at NT53's rules, it can only produce t59, t90, or combinations with other symbols. It can't produce t24, as far as I see from the rules.\n\nSo that suggests that the initial production S -> NT30 NT53 can't produce t24. Therefore, maybe the other production is used, which is S -> NT35 NT45. Let's explore this.\n\nSo, moving to S -> NT35 NT45. Now, the next tokens are t24, t31, etc. Let's see how to produce t24.\n\nLooking at NT35's rules:\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\nNT35 -> NT45\nNT35 -> t28 (multiple times)\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, do any of NT35 or NT45 produce t24? Let me check:\n\nNT45's production rules include:\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT45 -> NT53 NT1\nNT45 -> NT33 NT17\nNT45 -> t45\n\nNo, I don't see any rule where NT45 produces t24 directly. So maybe NT35 could produce t24.\n\nLooking at NT35's rules, the first is NT35 -> NT15 NT1, the second is NT35 -> NT1 NT4, third is NT45, and others are terminals like t28. Wait, none of these seem to produce t24. So this suggests that S -> NT35 NT45 can't produce t24 either.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the string is given, so maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the production rules.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The grammar has:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- S -> NT35 NT45\n- NT30 -> t90\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT35 -> NT45 (this is a typo?

{"custom_id":"request-634","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to follow these rules. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and NT30 \u2192 't90', which is a terminal. So, all productions are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nNext, the goal is to parse the given string using this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which are either terminals or non-terminals. I'll list them out to see the structure:\n\nThe string is: `t59 t38 t29 t38 t33 t72 t27 t12 t17 t40 t40 t24 t73 t66 t40 t45 t28 t40 t17 t20 t33 t59 t32 t77 t14 t27 t80 t76 t53 t53 t38 t72 t72 t7 t17 t38 t12 t7 t33 t33 t14 t29 t77 t38 t91 t91 t12 t53 t27 t40`.\n\nI notice that many of those tokens are letters followed by numbers, like 't59', which must be terminals because they end with a number, which is a common notation in such problems.\n\nThe plan is to use a parsing strategy suitable for CNF, such as the CYK algorithm. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production can be represented as a single step, and the CYK algorithm efficiently parses the string in polynomial time.\n\nBut since I'm not very familiar with implementing CYK manually, especially with a lot of non-terminals, perhaps I should try to see if I can trace the string by breaking it down step by step or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar's productions can all be split into two symbols, I can check if the string can be factorized into a series of these two-symbol steps. For instance, every non-terminal can only derive a pair of symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me first list all the productions and terminals to see what's available.\n\nTerminals are all the tokens that end with a number: t1, t2, ..., t91, and some starting with t like t59, t38, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nThen NT30 \u2192 't90' or 't53' or 't14'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't15' (which is NT15?) Wait, I think NT35 is the non-terminal, and it's being rewritten into terminal sequences. Wait no, in the list, NT35 is a production NT15 NT1, which is a combination. So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, wait, the productions are given with the non-terminals on the left, like S \u2192 NT30 NT53, and the non-terminals on the right, like NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11, etc., and some are terminals like NT30 \u2192 't90', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT30 can derive 't90', or 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT35 can derive NT15 NT1, but wait, that's not a terminal.\n\nWait, hold on. Looking carefully, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me parse the list of productions:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n3. NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n4. NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n5. NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n6. NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n7. NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n8. NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n9. NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n10. NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n11. NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n12. NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n13. NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n14. NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n15. NT16 -> 't72'\n16. NT30 -> 't90'\n17. NT30 -> 't53'\n18. NT30 -> 't14'\n19. NT1 -> 't89'\n20. NT53 -> 't7'\n21. NT7 -> 't91'\n22. NT56 -> 't45'\n23. NT30 -> 't27'\n24. NT10 -> 't73'\n25. NT25 -> 't29'\n26. NT43 -> 't40'\n27. NT53 -> 't59'\n28. NT56 -> 't28'\n29. NT11 -> 't28'\n30. NT59 -> 't17'\n31.

Now, the string starts with t59 t38 t29 t38 t33 t72 etc.\n\nI think I can approach this by trying to find the leftmost and rightmost symbols and see if I can derive them step by step.\n\nWait, but maybe using CYK would be better. Let's recall that CYK parses by putting symbols into a table based on length.\n\nGiven that the string is 49 tokens long, which seems a bit long, but maybe some of the rules can be followed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be broken down according to the productions.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is exactly two symbols, so each step can split the string into chunks of two or a single terminal.\n\nSo perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t59. So t59 is a terminal, and in the grammar, where does t59 come from? Looking at the productions, NT53 can produce 't59', and that's in production 39: NT53 \u2192 't59'.\n\nSo t59 is a terminal from NT53.\n\nLooking further, the next tokens are t38 t29...\n\nWait, so the first three tokens are t59, t38, t29.\n\nHmm. So how can t59 be followed by t38 and t29? Since each production is either two symbols or a terminal, and the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, perhaps I'm getting it wrong because the string is a flat list.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the terminals are combined through the productions. So each step can result in two terminals or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is a non-terminal that produces exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of these symbols, which can be a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but the derivation process must reduce the entire string to the start symbol S.\n\nBut how can we reconstruct a valid derivation?\n\nAnother approach: We can build a parse tree from the bottom up, using the productions.\n\nGiven that the string is t59 t38 t29 t38 t33 t72 t27 t12 t17 t40 t40 t24 t73 t66 t40 t45 t28 t40 t17 t20 t33 t59 t32 t77 t14 t27 t80 t76 t53 t53 t38 t72 t72"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided is a set of production rules, and I have the string 't27 t91' to evaluate. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies the application of algorithms like the CYK parser.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar provided, let's check if it indeed conforms to CNF. The start symbol is S, and the initial productions are S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45. These are both two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which aligns with the first rule of CNF. However, I notice that some of the non-terminals have more than two non-terminals on their right-hand sides. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33, that's two non-terminals, which is fine. Wait, no, actually, most of them are two, except some like NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, which are also two. So maybe this grammar is already in CNF. Alternatively, perhaps I misread it, but looking closer:\n\nWait, some rules might have more than two non-terminals on the right, but in this case, looking through them, every production seems to have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So probably, it's in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to check if the string 't27 t91' can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nThe string consists of two terminals: 't27' and 't91'. So I need to see if S can derive this step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens. Since it's a string of two separated tokens, it's important to consider how the grammar can split into these.\n\nFirst, the string is 't27 t91'. Let's see if S can produce a rule that leads to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial productions:\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nBoth of these produce S as a combination of two non-terminals. So the derived string would be the concatenation of the two non-terminals' strings.\n\nI need to check if each part, 't27' is derived from one and 't91' from another, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of these non-terminals (like NT30) can be further broken down via their production rules until they become terminals.\n\nSo let's look at the 't27' and 't91' parts and see their possible derivations.\n\nStarting with 't27'. Let me see which non-terminals can generate 't27':\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT30 \u2192 't27' (as seen: NT30 -> 't27')\nSo NT30 can directly produce 't27'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at 't91':\n- NT53 \u2192 't91' (NT53 -> 't91')\nSo NT53 can directly produce 't91'.\n\nSo if I can get NT30 to produce 't27' and NT53 to produce 't91', then S \u2192 NT30 NT53 would produce 't27 t91'.\n\nAlternatively, if S uses the other rule S \u2192 NT35 NT45, but then we'd get 't91' from NT35 and 't45' from NT45, which isn't the case here. So the correct rule must be S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nSo let's check if NT30 can indeed produce 't27' and NT53 can produce 't91'.\n\nWait, in the production rules, NT30 has multiple options including 't27', so yes, NT30 can directly derive 't27'.

Let me start by understanding how Chomsky normal form works. The grammar consists of production rules where each non-terminal can produce exactly two terminals or two non-terminals. Since it's already in Chomsky normal form, it's structured neatly, which should make things easier.\n\nFirst, I need to see how the string can be broken down. The string is \"t90 t80\", which looks like two tokens separated by a space. So I can process this as two separate characters 't90' and 't80'. Wait, but in context-free grammars, each production results in either terminals or non-terminals. So each token must be generated by a sequence of productions leading down to terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals directly. Let me list out the productions that produce terminals to see what each non-terminal can generate.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- S can produce NT30 NT53, NT35 NT45.\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't89'\n- NT53 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't91'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't29'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't59'\n- NT56 -> 't28'\n- NT11 -> 't28'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT32 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT59 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT4 -> 't45'\n- NT46 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't53'\n- NT15 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't33'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n- NT16 -> 't31'\n\nOkay, so I see that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal (like NT30 -> 't90'). Others produce multiple non-terminals. For example, S can go to NT30 NT53, which would mean that the string 't90 t80' can be generated if NT53 can produce 't80'.\n\nLooking at NT53: it can produce 't7', 't59', 't1', 't59 again', 't91', or 't80'. Wait, so NT53 can directly produce 't80' as a terminal. That's helpful.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 can produce 't90' directly. So, is it possible for S to generate 't90' followed by 't80'?\n\nBut S splits into two parts: S -> NT30 NT53. So the string generated would be the concatenation of what NT30 generates and what NT53 generates.\n\nNT30 can produce 't90' directly, so that would be the first part. NT53 can produce 't80' directly as the second part. Therefore, S can generate 't90 t80' by going through NT30 and NT53, each producing their respective terminals.\n\nWait, but I need to check if all the production steps for NT30 and NT53 lead to terminals, and not get stuck in any non-terminals. Let me confirm:\n\nFor NT30: production 1 is 't90', which is terminal. So that's fine. So when S expands to NT30 NT53, and NT30 becomes 't90', and NT53 becomes 't80', the string is correctly formed.\n\nI think that's the case.

{"custom_id":"request-36","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string `t27 t66 t10` is generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So any string generated by this grammar should start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t27`. I need to check if this can be derived from either NT30 or NT35. From the production rules, I see that NT30 can produce `t27` directly as one of its options. So `t27` can come from NT30.\n\nNext, I'll look at the next token in the string, which is `t66`. Let's see where `t66` can come from. Looking through the grammar, I notice that `t66` is an option for NT44. How does NT44 get its value? The rule for NT44 is `NT44 -> NT15 NT33`.\n\nSo, for `t66` to be produced, the entire substring must be covered by NT44, which means both NT15 and NT33 must produce `t66`. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because `t66` is a terminal itself in some cases. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nLooking again, actually, the production rules for NT44 might not have `t66` as a terminal. Wait, let me check the full list of rules. Yes, I see that NT44 -> NT15 NT33. But that doesn't directly connect to `t66`. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track how each token is generated. Let's re-examine the grammar to see which NT symbols can produce each token.\n\nStarting with the string `t27 t66 t10`. Let's see each token one by one:\n\n- `t27` can come from NT30.\n- `t66` seems tricky. I look through the NTs and find that NT46 -> `t66`. So, `t66` must come from NT46.\n- `t10` can come from NT10, which in turn can come from NT1, which can come from NT15 or NT35, etc. Hmm, but let's think about how these connect.\n\nSo, putting it together, the string has three tokens: `t27`, `t66`, `t10`. The first token is from NT30. The third token is `t10`, which comes from NT10. Then, the middle token is `t66` from NT46. But `t66` is from NT46, so where does NT46 come from the grammar? Looking back, the production rules for NT46 is `NT46 -> NT53 NT26`. Wait, that might not be right. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT66 NT67\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me list the rules correctly to avoid mistakes. Actually, in the given rules, the ones involving `t66` and `t27` would be:\n\nNT44 -> NT15 NT33 (so `t66` can come from NT44 only if NT15 and NT33 can produce `t66`?), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently by building parse trees.\n\nLet me try to see if I can break down the string from the top-down approach.\n\nThe string is `t27 t66 t10`. The first symbol is `t27`, which comes from NT30. So, S -> NT30 NT53. So the first NT30 is generating `t27`, and then we need to see what comes next from NT53.\n\nThe string continues with `t66`, which suggests that the NT53 might have to produce `t66` through some production. Let's see NT53's rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules for NT53, we see that NT53 can produce multiple options, including `t7`, but more importantly, NT53 can also produce other combinations, like NT30 NT7 or NT11. Wait, `t27` is from NT30, so if NT53 leads to NT30, that would produce `t27`. But in our case, after `t27`, we have `t66`, so that doesn't fit. Let me see if NT53 can produce `t66`.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT53 is involved in some rules. For instance, one of the rules is NT53 -> NT7. But that gives `t7`. Another rule is NT59 -> NT53, but that might not help. Wait, do any NT symbols directly produce `t66`? Looking, I see that NT46 -> NT53 NT26, but that's not directly helpful. Or wait, perhaps NT44 -> NT15 NT33, which might lead to `t66`. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at the overall structure of the grammar, let's see:\n\n- S produces either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n- So, the string starts with either NT30 followed by NT53, or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nIn the string `t27 t66 t10`, the first token is `t27` which comes from NT30, as per the rule NT30 -> 't27'. Then, the second token is `t66` and the third is `t10`.\n\nSo, the first symbol comes from NT30, which is the first part of the S rule NT30 NT53. So we're in the first alternative of S: NT30 NT53.\n\nSo, the first NT30 produces `t27`. Now, the second part is NT53, which we need to see if it can produce `t66 t10` somehow. But that doesn't seem correct because NT53 is a single symbol and can't produce multiple symbols directly unless it has rules that combine them. So perhaps I should consider that after NT30, the next production is NT53, which might produce the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, but in the string, after `t27`, the next symbol is `t66`, which is the second part of S. So perhaps the production is NT30 -> `t27` and NT53 -> `t66 t10`. But that needs to check if NT53 can produce `t66 t10`. But in the grammar, each production of NT53 is a combination of two other NT symbols, not terminals. So actually, NT53 can't directly produce both `t66` and `t10` in one step unless there's a chain of productions.\n\nWait, that's a better way to look at it: to break down the string step by step, see if each token can be generated by the rules.\n\nLet's process the string step by step.\n\n1. The first token is `t27`. As established, it comes from NT30's production NT30 -> 't27'.\n\n2. Now, we move to the second token `t66`. Since the second part of the initial S rule is NT53, we need to see if NT53 can produce `t66` in some way. Looking at the NT53 production rules:\n\n   - NT53 -> NT46 NT66\n   - NT53 -> NT7\n   - NT53 -> NT72\n   - NT53 -> NT40\n   - NT53 -> NT59\n   - NT53 -> NT56\n   - NT53 -> NT11\n\nWait, I'm not sure I'm reading the grammar correctly. Let me re-examine the production rules list:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with rules like S -> NT30 NT53, and then a long list of other production rules, each like NT43 -> NT53 NT11, etc.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNT53 has a production NT53 -> NT46 NT66? Or perhaps I made a mistake, perhaps some of the symbols have their own productions.\n\nWait, let's list all production rules relevant to the NTs involved.\n\n- NT30 can produce 't27', 't30', 't53', 't14' (from the list).\n- NT35 can produce 't35', 't15', 't1', 't59', 't1', 't44', etc.\n- NT43 produces NT53 NT11.\n- NT15 produces NT1 NT25.\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It seems like all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals, which are on the right-hand side. So, the start symbol is S, and from the rules, I can see that S branches into NT30 and NT53, or NT35 and NT45.

Since the string is space-separated, it translates into the sequence: t90, t66, t10. So, each of these is a terminal symbol.

Like NT30 can expand into 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. So when S starts, it's either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let me see which one can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the string: 't90' is the first symbol. Let's see where 't90' comes from. From the NT30 productions, one of the options is 't90'. So maybe NT30 is part of the first non-terminal. Or perhaps S starts with NT30.\n\nWait, let's think about this. Let me consider possible derivations.\n\nOption 1: S expands into NT30 NT53.\n\nSo S => NT30 NT53\n\nNow, NT30 can be a terminal like 't90', 't53', etc., and NT53 can expand into multiple options.\n\nIf the string starts with 't90', which is a terminal for NT30, then NT30 is 't90'. Now, NT53 would need to produce the rest of the string, which is 't66 t10'. Wait, no, because the entire string is 't90 t66 t10'. So after NT30 is 't90', the remaining is 't66 t10', which comes from NT53. So NT53 needs to expand into 't66 t10'.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT53, do any of them produce 't66' and 't10'?\n\nChecking NT53's productions: NT53 can go to NT46 NT1, NT59 NT5, etc., but none of these options directly produce the needed terminals. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, some of these NT53 rules lead to terminal symbols, so maybe they can produce certain t's. Let's go through them:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT46 -> NT66, so this is possible. So NT53 could expand into NT46 NT1, which when NT46 is 't66' and NT1 is 't10'.\n\nWait, does NT46 produce 't66'?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT46 -> NT66? Or is there a production for NT46?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for NT46. Instead, let me check:\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT46 -> NT66? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the list.\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90' | ... and many others.\n\nWait, I think I made an error earlier. Let me get this straight.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can list all NT's and their rules to see if any produce terminals.\n\nHere's a list (to save time):\n\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't53' or 't45'\n- NT46 -> NT66 (from NT62 -> NT43 NT16; but NT62's initial rule is in NT30, which is 't90', etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe I can parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is 't90 t66 t10'.\n\nSo, in terms of the derivation, it's like S => NT30 NT53, which then needs to generate 't90' and 't66 t10'. But wait, the string has three terminals, so the NTs must expand to strings of terminals. Each NT production is a binary split, so the entire string would be a concatenation of two terminals from the first NT and two from the second, etc.\n\nWait, that might not work. Let me think again.\n\nEach production is a binary split. So, the initial S would split into two NTs, each of which can further split into NTs until terminals are reached.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is generated as a sequence of terminals produced by each NT.\n\nFor example, in S -> NT30 NT53:\n\n- NT30 expands into 't90', which is a terminal, so that's done.\n\n- NT53 needs to expand into a sequence that results in 't66 t10'. So, NT53 must split into two non-terminals that generate 't66' and 't10'.\n\nSo, looking at NT53's rules:\n\nNT53 can expand into NT46 NT1. So, let's see if NT46 can expand into 't66' and NT1 can expand into 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules:\n\nNT1 can split into NT10 and NT4. NT10 is 't73', a terminal. NT4 can split into NT45 or NT46.\n\nWait, let's trace it:\n\nIf NT1 expands into NT10 and NT4, then NT10 is 't73'. NT4 can expand into NT45, which is 't53', or NT46, which is 't66'.\n\nWait, but from the rules, NT4 can split into NT45 or NT46.\n\nBut in NT1's rule: NT1 -> NT10 NT4. So, for NT1 to be 't10', we need to see if NT1 can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT1: NT1 -> NT10 NT4, which are:\n\nNT10 is a terminal 't73', and NT4 can be 't53' or 't66' if it can reach 't66'.\n\nWait, this might not be the right path.

{"custom_id":"request-57","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t53 t66 t32 t45`. Let me try to figure out if the grammar can produce this string.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. Wait, no, actually in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except if the start symbol can go directly to a terminal. But looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo S can't go directly to terminals; it needs to use NT30 or NT35, which in turn split into other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of terminals: t53, t66, t32, t45. So each of these must be the result of expanding some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT30, NT35, etc., which presumably expand into the terms in the string. Let me list the rules for each relevant non-terminal.\n\nStarting with NT30: the rules are:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90'\nNT30 \u2192 't53'\nNT30 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. In the string, the first term is 't53', so maybe NT30 is the start for the first token.\n\nThen the next token is 't66'. Looking for NT that can produce t66.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't immediately see an NT66. But maybe it's through another non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps NT53 can produce t66? Let me check NT53:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT53 \u2192 NT91\nNT53 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, no, 't66' isn't a direct production of NT53. Looking for 't66', I see in the rules under NT53, NT46 is produced, which then has its own rules:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't66'\n\nAh, so if I have NT46, it can directly go to 't66'. So for 't66', we need to have a path that goes through NT46.\n\nSimilarly, the third token is 't32'. Checking NT32:\n\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\n\nBut that's 't77', not 't32'. Alternatively, maybe it's through another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps NT32 is part of another rule that can produce t32.\n\nWait, the string is `t53 t66 t32 t45`. Let's list the tokens and see if they can be connected via the grammar.\n\nAnother idea is to see if the string can be generated by starting with S and expanding step by step. Let me try to outline a possible derivation.\n\nFirst, S can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's see which option could lead to the tokens.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nSo, NT30 may produce 't53' directly, which matches the first token. Now, what does NT53 produce? From the rules, NT53 can produce:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1 (same as above)\nWait, actually in the given grammar, NT53 has two production rules:\n\nWait, the grammar provided actually lists:\n\nLook, in the grammar, under NT53:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT53 \u2192 NT91\nNT53 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, that's three rules. So, it can either go to 't7', 't91', or 'NT46 NT1'.\n\nSo if NT53 is to produce a 't66' token, that's not directly possible because NT53 doesn't have 't66' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps it's via another NT.\n\nWait, the 't66' token must come from NT46, which is one of the rules for NT53.\n\nSo in this case, if NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1, then NT46 can be 't66'. So that part can be done.\n\nSo for the first token 't53' via NT30, the second token 't66' via NT46. So that's good.\n\nNow, the third token is 't32'. Let me check which non-terminal can produce 't32'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14' (directly via terminals). NT35 can produce 't15', 't45', or 't33' (from the rules provided, wait let me check the NT35 rules:\n\nWait, NT35 is one of the non-terminals, let me check all its productions:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n\nWait, that's it? Or perhaps I misread. Let me check:\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar rules provided, I need to list all the productions for each NT.\n\nWait the grammar rules given are a bit tangled, perhaps I should list them out more clearly.\n\nLet me parse the grammar again, as the way it's presented could be confusing.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\nNT16 -> 't72'\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT1 -> 't89'\nNT53 -> 't7'\nNT7 -> 't91'\nNT56 -> 't45'\nNT30 -> 't27'\nNT10 -> 't73'\nNT25 -> 't29'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT53 -> 't59'\nNT56 -> 't28'\nNT11 -> 't28'\nNT59 -> 't17'\nNT32 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't10'\nNT59 -> 't28'\nNT15 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't32'\nNT44 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't45'\nNT46 -> 't66'\nNT53 -> 't91'\nNT9 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't53'\nNT15 -> 't38'\nNT4 -> 't33'\nNT59 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT53 -> 't80'\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing because some non-terminals have multiple rules, and each rule is a single production. For example, NT30 can go to 't90', 't53', or 't14'. Similarly, NT35 has certain rules.\n\nSo, for NT30, the three options are 't90', 't53', 't14'. So, 't53' is a direct terminal.\n\nNow, back to the third token 't32'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT32 is present:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT32 \u2192 't77', which is 't77' but that's not the token we have. However, perhaps through another path.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, we might have non-terminals that expand into 't32' via another path. Alternatively, perhaps 't32' can be produced via a chain of rules.\n\nWait, in fact, looking at the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't32'. The closest is NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14' and NT32 \u2192 't77'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe through another NT that can expand into 't32'.\n\nLooking at NT32's rules: NT32 is generated by which rules? Wait in the grammar, I see that NT32 is given as:\n\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\n\nSo, it doesn't have other production rules. Therefore, the only way to get 't32' is via the terminal 't77'\u2014which is not the token we have.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t27 t66 t73 t45`. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has a specific structure: each production rule is either A\u2192BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A\u2192a, where a is a terminal. So looking at the given grammar, every production seems to fit that except maybe the ones starting with S, which are both two non-terminals. That's fine because in CNF, the start symbol can have a production with two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string given is four tokens: t27, t66, t73, t45. Each of these seems to correspond to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. Let me check each one against the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the first token, t27. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT30 has rules that produce t27 as a terminal, specifically NT30 \u2192 't27'. So t27 must come from NT30.\n\nNext, t66. Checking the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't66'. So t66 is derived from NT46.\n\nThen, t73. Looking at the grammar, I think it's possible that NT25 \u2192 't73'? Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, I see NT25 \u2192 't29', not t73. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh, I see a NT30 \u2192 't27', but for t73, I don't see it directly. Wait, could it come from NT16? Because in the grammar, NT16 \u2192 't31', which isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe NT46? NT46 \u2192 't66' which is used in the string. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check all NT productions that might end with t73.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t73 as a terminal. Wait, maybe I need to track back. Perhaps t73 comes from a non-terminal that eventually produces it. Let me think, looking at the grammar rules, I see NT30 \u2192 't27', but I'm not sure how t73 would be produced. Let me continue.\n\nFinally, t45. From the grammar, NT53 \u2192 't45' and NT15 \u2192 't53', etc. Wait, maybe I can see where t45 comes from. In the grammar, there are a few direct terminal 't45' rules, like NT53 \u2192 't45' and NT45 \u2192 't45' as well.\n\nWait, perhaps each token in the string comes from a non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nt27 \u2192 NT30 via NT30 \u2192 't27'\n\nt66 \u2192 NT46 via NT46 \u2192 't66'\n\nt73 \u2192 Hmm, looking for a production that ends with t73... I don't see it directly in the rules. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me see the full list. For example, NT25 \u2192 't29', NT30 \u2192 't30' as 't90', 't53', 't14'. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Maybe t25 is not the same as t73. Wait, perhaps I should map each token to a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's see which non-terminals can produce each of these terminals.\n\nt27: From NT30 \u2192 't27'\n\nt66: From NT46 \u2192 't66'\n\nt73: I don't see a direct production for this. Let me check all NT rules. For example, NT16 \u2192 't31', which is not helpful. What about NT59 \u2192 't59' includes 't24' but that's not relevant. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through all the NTs.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT4, which isn't directly helpful. NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4, etc. Hmm, maybe t73 can't be generated, which would mean the string can't be generated, but that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to map each part step by step.\n\nFirst token: t27 \u2192 comes from NT30 (since NT30 can go to 't27').\n\nAfter NT30, the next symbol is t66, which comes from NT46. So after NT30, we need something that expands to NT46.\n\nWait, but NT30 itself is on the left side of S, so the first step is S \u2192 NT30 NT53 (assuming the other production is S \u2192 NT35 NT45, but let's see which one applies first).\n\nWait, let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t27 t66 t73 t45`.\n\nSo the order is important. So we start with S, and the string must be a left-derivation of S \u2192 ... \u2192 the tokens.\n\nSo starting with S, which can be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLet me try the first option: S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nNow, NT30 needs to generate the first t27, which it does. So the NT30 part is handled as 't27'.\n\nThen the NT53 part must generate the remaining tokens: t66 t73 t45.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after t27 comes t66, then t73, then t45.\n\nWait, but NT30 is a single non-terminal, so the next step is for both NT30 and NT53 to produce their respective parts. So perhaps we can split the string into two parts: 't27' and 't66 t73 t45', with the first part generated by NT30 and the second by NT53.\n\nWait, but NT30 can only generate a single terminal at a time because in CNF, each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So if NT30 \u2192 't27', then the first part is done. Then NT53 needs to produce the rest: t66 t73 t45.\n\nBut NT53 can only produce a single terminal at a time, so we'd need a rule that allows NT53 to generate multiple terminals. But looking at the grammar, each NT53 can only directly produce one terminal or another NT30-like rule, but I don't see how NT53 can generate more than one terminal in a single step beyond what's allowed by the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT30 NT53 can't generate all these tokens because NT30 is producing only t27, and NT53 needs to then generate the remaining t66, t73, t45. But since NT53 will expand according to its rules, perhaps that's feasible.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nThen, NT30 \u2192 't27', so we consume the first token.\n\nNow, NT53 needs to generate the remaining three tokens: t66, t73, t45.\n\nSo, NT53 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT53 has several rules:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT45 NT5 (if I recall), but let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, let's see: In the grammar provided, the NT53 rules are:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT7 NT91\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT59 NT51\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misremembering.

{"custom_id":"request-70","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to evaluate if it's generated by the grammar. The string is `t10 t33 t28 t38 t40`. I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow produces exactly two non-terminals on the right. Terminals can't appear on the left side unless they're on the right side. This might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n- These non-terminals (NTs) eventually lead down to terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers or other NT symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate has the sequence: t10, t33, t28, t38, t40.\n\nI think a good approach might be to use the CYK algorithm. I remember that the CYK algorithm is used to determine whether a string is generated by a CNF grammar. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminals in the string. They are t10, t33, t28, t38, t40.\n\nNext, I need to create a table where each cell (i, j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nThe string length is 5, so the indices go from 1 to 5.\n\nLet me list the terminals in order:\n\n1: t10\n2: t33\n3: t28\n4: t38\n5: t40\n\nWait, in the CYK table, the rows represent the start of the substring, and the columns represent the end. So for a string of length n, we have n-1 possible spans from 1 to n.\n\nWait, no, for a string of length L, the spans go from 1 to L, so for L=5, the spans are 1-1, 2-2, ..., 5-5, and then 1-2, 1-3, ..., 1-5; 2-3, etc.\n\nBut I think I got that mixed up. Let me correct that: CYK starts with spans of length 1, then 2, up to the full string length.\n\nSo, I'll create a table with rows 1 to 5 (positions) and columns 1 to 5, but for spans, it's usually a P x P table where P is the length, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to lay it out step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this by trying to find a derivation starting from S. Let me try to see how the string can be broken down.\n\nThe string is `t10 t33 t28 t38 t40`. Let's see if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nLet's assume S starts the derivation, so the first expansion is either NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t10, which is a terminal. So I need to see which non-terminals can produce t10.\n\nLooking at the rules, I have NT9 -> t38, which is on another path. Wait, no, I need to look for terminals:\n\nNT30 has multiple rules: 't53', 't90', 't14', 't90', etc. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, from the rules:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27'.\n\nBut also, NT10 is a non-terminal, but the right-hand side only for NT30.\n\nWait no, actually, in the rules, I see lines like NT30 -> 't53', which is a terminal, so when a non-terminal's production has a terminal, that's a terminal in the string.\n\nSo, for example, NT30 can directly produce a 't53' which is part of the string.\n\nBut our string starts with t10, so I need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't10'. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NTs that have 't10' in their RHS.\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> 't10' appears in multiple rules, like NT1 -> 't10 NT4', etc., but those are further back.\n\nWait, but perhaps a direct production.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT10->'t73', so maybe NT10 produces t73, which is a terminal.\n\nBut where is 't10'?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any direct productions of a terminal t10 except for NT1 having rules that include t10 and others.\n\nWait, here's the rules again:\n\nLooking through all the NTs' productions:\n\nNT30 can go to 't53', 't90', 't14', 't27'.\n\nNT15 can go to 't1 NT25'.\n\nWait, I might be missing something. Maybe I should list all the rules again more carefully, focusing on terminal tokens that are part of the string.\n\nThe string is `t10 t33 t28 t38 t40`.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> 't89'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- Wait, wait, this seems confusing. Let me go through each rule one by one to see which NTs can produce a terminal that is part of our string.\n\nFirst, I'll list all NTs and their rules to find those that have direct terminals in our string.\n\nNT rules:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53 | NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\n\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\n\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\n\nNT16 -> 't72'\n\nNT30 -> 't90' | 't53' | 't14' | 't27'\n\nNT10 -> 't73'\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the first NT30 is 't90', the second is 't53', third is 't14', fourth is 't27'. So NT30 can directly produce t90, t53, t14, t27.\n\nWait, but there's a NT10 rule that produces 't73', as per NT10 -> 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, I see NT1 -> 't89' and other rules.\n\nLet me note the NTs that can directly produce the terminals in our string `t10 t33 t28 t38 t40`:\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are: t10, t33, t28, t38, t40.\n\nSo we need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by some NT production.\n\nLet's take each terminal in the string and check if it's a terminal in any NT production.\n\nt10:\n\nLooking through the rules, t10 is a terminal. So I need to see which NT's rules have t10 on the RHS.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules:\n\nI see NT16 -> 't72', which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT10 -> 't73'.\n\nWait, another NT: NT33 has a production that includes 't7'? NT33 could lead to t7.\n\nNot directly matching t10.\n\nLooking elsewhere, do any NTs have a production where a rule leads to t10?\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, the only NT that directly produces a t is, for example:\n\nNT1 -> 't89'\n\nBut that's for NT1 producing t89. That doesn't help. Wait, no.\n\nWait, the rules seem to be structured where each NT may or may not have a direct terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t12 t10 t24 t38 t40\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Alright, let's break this down step by step because I'm still pretty new to this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier to parse because it limits the look-ahead in parsing algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems like most of the non-terminals are on the left, and the rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwv or NTxy \u2192 something ending with a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which means the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11, and so on. At the end of many rules, I see terminal symbols like 't90', 't7', 't53', etc. So each production either breaks down further into non-terminals or\u6700\u7ec8 produces a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t12 t10 t24 t38 t40\". I notice it's a sequence of terminal symbols, each separated by a space, so it's five tokens long. Each of these corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, but I need to see if there's a way the grammar can produce this exact sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parsing is context-free, meaning each step processes a part of the string without considering the surrounding context, which might make things a bit trickier. But perhaps a better approach is to try to construct the string by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the highest level production. The start symbol S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the initial expansion is either S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Both of these would then need to produce the given string.\n\nLooking at NT35 and NT30, each could lead to further expansions. Let's take S \u2192 NT35 NT45 first. NT35 has a production rule: NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. So NT35 could become NT15 NT1. Then, NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25. So NT15 becomes NT1 NT25. NT15 also has another rule: NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33. I can explore either of these.\n\nOption 1: Following NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25.\n\nNow, NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4. NT10 can be NT73 or other terminals. Wait, let me check. Wait, looking at the rules, NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4. NT10 has a production: NT10 \u2192 't73' or other expansions. Also, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't45' or other rules. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, from the grammar, I see NT10 can produce multiple things, including 't73', 't32', 't4', etc. So let me think: NT10 can directly produce 't73', 't32', 't4', 't10', 't44', 't15', etc. But in our string, the first token is 't12', which isn't a direct terminal of NT10. So maybe this path isn't the way to go.\n\nOption 2: Let's try another path. Let's go back to S \u2192 NT35 NT45. NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. Maybe we should take another branch here. Let's see NT35's other rule: NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. Wait, that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps NT45 can expand.\n\nWait, NT45 also has a production rule: NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. So S could be NT35 NT45 \u2192 NT15 NT1 NT59 NT5. Hmm, that's getting a bit messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the other initial rule: S \u2192 NT30 NT53. NT30 has multiple productions, including NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27', 't28', etc., and NT53 also has several rules. Let me try that.\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53. Suppose NT30 produces 't14' and NT53 produces 't38'. But in our string, we have a 't12' first. So maybe NT30 \u2192 't28' or another terminal that matches 't12'. Wait, looking at NT28, is there a rule? Oh, I see NT28 is under NT15 and others. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see a terminal 't28' directly. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT53 \u2192 't91'\n- NT7 \u2192 't91' (Wait, that's another rule)\nBut wait, 't28' is produced by NT59, maybe. Looking at the rules: NT59 \u2192 NT17, etc., and one of NT59's rules is NT59 \u2192 't28' because in NT59, I see \"NT59 -> 't17'\", but wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back: The grammar has:\n\nNT59 -> 't17' or perhaps more? Let me scan through all the rules for NT59. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see multiple rules for NT59, but the only explicit terminal is 't17'. Hmm. Maybe I misremembered. Also, do any other non-terminals directly lead to 't12'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, any rule that ends with 't12'? From NT15's rules: NT15 \u2192 't10', 't12', 't14', etc. So NT15 \u2192 't12' is a possible production.\n\nSo perhaps S \u2192 NT35 NT45 \u2192 NT15 NT1 NT45. Then, NT15 could produce 't12', right? Because NT15's production includes 't12'. So let's explore that.\n\nSo, NT15 \u2192 't12' (assuming that's a valid production), which matches our first token in the string, which is 't12'. Then, the remaining tokens are 't10', 't24', 't38', 't40'. Now, after producing 't12', we're left with NT1 NT45.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT35 NT45 \u2192 NT15 NT1 NT45. So after S expands to NT35 NT45, and then NT35 expands to NT15 NT1, and then NT15 expands to 't12', the NT1 and NT45 are left.\n\nWait, so the structure would be 't12' followed by what NT1 and NT45 can produce. Let's see. NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4, so that would produce a sequence after 't12'.\n\nBut in our string, next is 't10', then 't24', etc. So let's see.\n\nAfter 't12', the string continues with 't10 t24 t38 t40'. So 't10' is the next, which would come from NT10. Let's look at NT10 \u2192 't73' or other rules. Wait, in the grammar, NT10 has a production: NT10 \u2192 't73' (from the line NT10 -> 't73'). So NT10 can produce 't73' directly. But in our current expansion, we have NT1, which is NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4.\n\nWait, so NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4. Let's see what NT10 and NT4 can produce. For NT10, it can produce 't73', 't32', 't4', 't10', 't44', 't15', etc. So if NT10 \u2192 't73', and NT4 can produce, say, 't45' (from NT4 \u2192 't45'), but then 't73 t45' would be generated. However, our current requirement after 't12' is 't10 t24 t38 t40', so perhaps another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT10 can produce 't10' directly. Looking back: I don't think so. Because in the grammar, NT10's production includes NT15 \u2192 't10', but does NT10 have a direct terminal? Hmm, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT10 \u2192 't10' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-95","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the string `t12 t89 t28 t38 t80 t28` is generated by the given CFG. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So each of these non-terminals will need to expand into terminal symbols.\n\nThe string consists of six tokens: t12, t89, t28, t38, t80, t28. I notice that t28 and t28 are repeated, which might indicate that the same non-terminal can produce them multiple times through different productions.\n\nLet me check each production to see if I can find a path that generates these tokens.\n\nStarting with S, which can go to NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's explore both options.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nNT30 has productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53' (duplicate)\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n\nSimilarly, NT53 has several productions, including some that produce t7, t59, t1, t91, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t12, which isn't immediately produced by any of the NT30 or NT53 productions. Wait, does any non-terminal produce t12?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 t12. So maybe t12 comes from NT15.\n\nBut in Case 1, S goes to NT30 NT53. So we need to get t12 from either NT30 or NT53, but looking at the productions, neither NT30 nor NT53 directly produce t12. Instead, NT15 does, but in this case, S is splitting into NT30 and NT53, which don't produce t12. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t12, so somewhere in the derivation, t12 must be produced. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that produces t12 is NT15. So there must be a derivation path that reaches NT15.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, can it eventually lead to NT15?\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Let's consider which of these can produce NT15.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: nt30 can lead to 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27'. None of these seem to directly lead to NT15. Similarly, let's look at NT35.\n\nNT35's productions include NT15 (NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1). So if NT35 can expand into NT15, then that's possible.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nThen, NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1.\n\nNow NT15 can produce t12, which is the first token in the string.\n\nSo let's see: The string is t12 t89 t28 t38 t80 t28.\n\nSo the first token is t12 from NT15. Then, what's next? After t12, the remaining string is t89 t28 t38 t80 t28.\n\nNow, after NT15, the next symbol comes from NT1. Because in S \u2192 NT35 NT45, which becomes NT15 NT1 (from NT35 expanding) and NT45.\n\nSo after NT15 comes NT1. Now, NT1 can expand into various things, one of which is t89.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 't89', 't10', 't4', 't12', etc. So yes, NT1 can directly produce t89 as the second token.\n\nSo far, we have t12 t89.\n\nNow, what's next after that? The third token is t28. So we need to expand NT45 (since after NT15 and NT1, the next part is NT45, right? Because S \u2192 NT35 NT45, NT35 becomes NT15 NT1, leaving NT45 to expand further.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. After NT35 becomes NT15 NT1, and then NT1 is processed, which produces t89. Now, the next part is the expansion of NT45.\n\nSo after processing NT1, what's left is NT45. So NT45 needs to produce the tokens following 't89', which are t28, t38, t80, t28.\n\nLooking at NT45's productions, it can expand into NT59 NT5. NT5 could produce 't45' or other things, but that doesn't seem relevant here. Wait, let's see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. So NT59 can produce several things, including 't28', 't17', etc.\n\nIf we take NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, then NT59 can produce 't28' directly. So the third token is t28 from NT59.\n\nSo now, the string is t12 t89 t28. The remaining tokens are t38 t80 t28.\n\nNow, after NT59 produces t28, we're left with NT5 in the expansion. So after NT59, NT5 needs to produce the next tokens: t38 t80 t28.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT4 or NT5 \u2192 't45', etc. Wait, but we need to produce t38, which comes from NT15 (since NT15 \u2192 t12, but that's already used, or maybe another path).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me backtrack.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT35 NT45, which becomes NT15 NT1 (t12) and NT45. Then NT1 (t89) is produced, leaving NT45.\n\nNT45 can expand into NT59 NT5. So let's see: NT59 \u2192 't28', 't17', 't53' etc. 't28' is the next token, so NT59 produces 't28' (third token). Now, what remains after NT59 is NT5.\n\nNow, NT5 can produce 't45' or 'something else. Wait, NT5's productions are NT9 NT4 and 't45'. But t45 is a terminal? Let me check: NT5 \u2192 't45' or 'other combinations.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT53 -> 't7' etc.\n\nWait, actually, each NT in the grammar produces a terminal symbol when applicable. For example, NT53 can produce 't7' (as per NT53 -> 't7'), so in the rule NT53 can go directly to 't7'.\n\nSo back to NT5: NT5's productions are NT9 NT4, or 't45'. So 't45' is a terminal. But our next tokens after 't28' are t38, t80, t28. So after 't28', we have t38, t80, t28.\n\nSo after NT59 produces 't28', we have NT5 left. What can NT5 produce?\n\nNT5 \u2192 't45' or NT9 NT4. Neither of these produce t38 directly. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe the NT45 expansion isn't the way to go. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is the path.\n\nLet's see: NT30 can produce t90, t53, t14, t27. Not t12, so that might not help. NT35 can produce t35 or other things, but that also doesn't lead to t12 directly.\n\nWait, but in the first case, we thought of S \u2192 NT35 NT45, which then leads to NT15 (t12), NT1 (t89), and then NT45. Maybe that's the right path.\n\nAfter NT45, we have to produce t28, t38, t80, t28. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5.\n\nNT59 can produce 't28' as one option, so that gives us the 't28' (third token). Then, we're left with NT5.\n\nNow, NT5 can expand further.

{"custom_id":"request-91","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. Let me see how I can approach this. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. Looking at the initial productions:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the string must start with the expansion of S, which branches into NT30 and NT53, or NT35 and NT45. My string is t73 t45 t45 t28 t38 t40. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with S, I'll consider both possibilities from the two S productions. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n1. Starting with NT30 NT53:\n- NT30 can be a terminal or another production. Looking at the rules, NT30 has multiple options: 't90', 't53', 't14', etc. Wait, in the given string, the first symbol is t73, which isn't one of NT30's direct terminal options. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I miss something? Maybe I should double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the NT30 rules are:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- And several others? Wait, the provided grammar has:\nNT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14', 't30' again, etc. Oh wait, actually, looking carefully, I see in the grammar section, there are entries like NT30 -> 't30' but I think that might be a typo because it's likely an N-terminal or another production. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, it's written as:\nNT30 -> 't90'\nNT30 -> 't53'\nNT30 -> 't14'\nNT30 -> 't27' (Wait, is that a typo? Or is it supposed to be another non-terminal?)\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT30 -> 't27' (Is that a typo? Or maybe another production. Hmm, but in the string, the first symbol is t73, which is in the NT16 production, right? So perhaps I need to look into NT30's productions more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me re-examine the NT30 rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the NT30 entries are:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT30 -> 't30' (Wait, that's a self-reference, which might be incorrect unless it's a typo. Or perhaps I'm miscounting.)\n\nWait, in the grammar as provided:\n\nNT30 is defined as:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- And then in the next lines, there's NT30 -> 't27' but maybe it's a typo or a different rule. Hmm, perhaps I should check all productions of NT30. Let me list them all:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nEntire NT30 list:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT30 -> 't27' (This seems like a different terminal than t30, perhaps a typo. Maybe it's 't27' and not 't30'.)\nWait, the original problem statement lists the grammar with multiple entries, but perhaps some are typos. Alternatively, perhaps each line is part of the same NT30 rule. Wait, no, each line is separate.\n\nSo, maybe it's easier to list all NT30 productions:\n\nNT30 rules are:\n1. NT30 -> 't90'\n2. NT30 -> 't53'\n3. NT30 -> 't14'\n4. NT30 -> 't30'  [Wait, is that a typo for t27? Or perhaps it's part of the same NT30. This is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to write t27 as another option.]\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse each line correctly. Let me go through the grammar step by step, noting all NT30 rules.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't14'\n- NT30 -> 't27'  [Is this a typo, maybe for 't30'? Or perhaps 't30' is a different rule that's missing. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the same NT30.]\n\nThis part is a bit confusing. If it's a typo, perhaps I should consider that NT30 has four terminal productions: 't90', 't53', 't14', 't27'. Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be 't30' but it's actually a mistake. Given that the string starts with 't73', which isn't any of these, it's possible that the initial path via S -> NT30 NT53 isn't valid because the first symbol t73 isn't among NT30's terminals. Therefore, perhaps S must expand via the other branch.\n\nLet me consider the second option: S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nSo now, the first symbol from S would come from NT35, which expands into NT15 NT1. Let's look at NT35's rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT35 has multiple rules:\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nSo, NT35 can be NT15 NT1 or NT1 NT4.\n\nLet's consider the first possibility: NT35 -> NT15 NT1.\n\nThen, NT15 has rules:\n- NT15 -> NT12\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT15 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT15 -> ... Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT15 rules:\n- NT15 -> NT12\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT15 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT15 -> NT38 NT40 ... Wait, is that correct? Or perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, let me list all NT15 rules from the grammar:\n\n- NT15 -> NT12\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT15 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT15 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT15 -> NT38 NT40\n- Wait, wait, perhaps there's a typo and it's NT38 NT33 or something else, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> NT12\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT15 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT15 -> ... No, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar includes:\n\n- NT15 -> NT12\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT15 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT15 -> NT38 NT40\n\nIs that correct? Because 'NT38 NT40' seems to be a production for NT15. So, from NT15, you can go to NT38 NT40, which is another non-terminal pair.\n\nWait, but then that would mean that to get to the terminals, we'd have to go further down, but in our string, after the initial t73 (which we can't get via NT35's initial path), we need to see if any path from S->NT35 NT45 leads to the string.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol in the string is 't73', which comes from NT35, which only expands into NT15 NT1 or NT1 NT4. Neither of these would produce 't73' as they're NT rules, not terminals. So that path is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only other possibility is S -> NT30 NT53, but as I noticed earlier, the first terminal symbol is t73, which isn't in NT30's rules. Therefore, either I'm missing something or the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the NT30 rules. Let me re-examine the NT30 productions carefully.

{"custom_id":"request-112","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t10 t29 t89 t28 t20 t80 t28` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break down my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the process of constructing derivations, especially since each step in the derivation can only produce at most two symbols. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's composed of multiple non-terminal symbols, and each of their productions consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminal symbols are words like 't10', 't29', etc., and the non-terminals are multi-character strings like 'NT10', 'NT29', and so on. \n\nThe string to evaluate is `t10 t29 t89 t28 t20 t80 t28`. My initial thought is to try and build a parse tree for this string by starting from the start symbol S and seeing if we can derive the string through a series of expansions.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S can be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Let's consider both possibilities. \n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n- NT30 and NT53 can each be expanded into terminal symbols or other non-terminals. NT30 can be expanded to 't90', 't53', or 't27'. Meanwhile, NT53 can expand into various non-terminals or terminals. However, looking at the string, the first t is 't10', which isn't directly reachable from NT30's immediate productions since NT30's immediate options don't include t10. So, this path might not be the right one.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n- NT35 can be expanded into NT15 NT1, and NT45 into NT59 NT5. NT5 is in the grammar as 't45', so the second part might contribute a terminal. But again, the first t in the string is 't10', which isn't directly obtainable from these non-terminals. So perhaps this option is also incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper. Let's list out all the non-terminals and their expansion rules, then see if any of them can be expanded to the given string.\n\nAnother approach is to work from the end of the string backward, trying to find any production rules that could lead to the last few symbols being generated from a non-terminal. This method is useful for top-down parsing, especially when using a recursive descent parser.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbol is 't28'. Let's see what can produce 't28'. Scanning through the grammar, I notice several NT that could produce 't28'. For example:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t28\n- NT20 \u2192 t28\n- NT28 exists as a terminal, but that's not helpful here since 't28' isn't a starting symbol and can only be in the last step if one of the non-terminals produces 't28'.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the NTs like NT12, NT20, etc., but perhaps it's more straightforward to look for non-terminals that directly produce 't28' by a single production. Let me check the rules:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't28' (if such a non-terminal exists)\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 -> 't28'\nNT20 -> 't28'? Wait, checking the rules again:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, there's NT20 \u2192 't28':\nIn the list, I see \"NT20 -> 't28'\".\n\nWait, no, let me double-check:\n\nWait, the provided grammar has:\n\nNT15 -> NT12 `t28` ??? Wait, no, the grammar lists the NT rules as:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nWait, some rules are:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT15 -> NT12 `t28`?\nWait, no\u2014the actual grammar list has lines like \"NT35 -> NT15 NT1\", etc. Oh, wait no: each rule is a production. Let me parse all the grammar rules correctly.\n\nLet me list each production line:\n\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n3. NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n4. NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n5. NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n6.

NT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, so for NT44, the production is \"NT44 -> 't76'\", and for NT59, there are two productions: \"NT59 -> 't17'\" and \"NT59 -> 't28'\".\n\nSo, to get 't28', either NT12 or NT20 or NT59 can do it. Let me correct that because in the grammar above, NT59 can produce 't17' or 't28'.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nLooking at the grammars again:\n\nNT59 -> 't17' and NT59 -> 't28'.\n\nYes, so NT59 can produce either 't17' or 't28'.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 -> 't28' and NT20 -> 't28'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at line 42: NT16 -> 't31'.\n\nIn line 28: NT59 -> 't28'.\n\nLine 36: NT4 -> 't45'.\n\nLine 31: NT10 -> 't32'.\n\nOkay, so 't28' can be derived from NT59, NT12, or NT20, but looking at the given grammar, I actually see NT59 has multiple options, including 't28', so that's a key point.\n\nNow, the string is `t10 t29 t89 t28 t20 t80 t28`.\n\nLet's analyze the string:\n\n1. t10\n2. t29\n3. t89\n4. t28\n5. t20\n6. t80\n7. t28\n\nSo, we have 7 symbols. Since each production in the grammar is either a terminal or two non-terminals, each step can only add one symbol. Since S is the start symbol, a context-free grammar generates strings with a length equal to the number of productions in the leftmost derivation. For a grammar with all terminals on the left side, the length of the string after n steps is n.\n\nWait, but in our case, since each production could produce one terminal or a combination, the length isn't straightforward. However, the key is reconstructing a parse tree that produces this string.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nWe need to generate `t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar rules and the string structure.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Each of these non-terminals can further expand into combinations of other NTs, which sometimes produce terminals like 't' followed by a number or letters like 't72', 't53', etc.\n\nThe string we're checking is a sequence of terminal symbols. So, I'll try to trace back from the start symbol S to see if I can assemble this string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the initial productions are S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45. I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nLet's first look at S -> NT30 NT53. NT30 can be expanded in the grammar, and looking at the rules, NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', or 't14'. The string starts with 't10', which isn't 't90', 't53', or 't14', so maybe S -> NT35 NT45 is the right path.\n\nSo, S -> NT35 NT45. Now, NT35 can produce NT15 NT1, and NT45 can produce NT59 NT5. Then, NT15 can produce NT1 NT25, and NT45 can also produce NT59 NT5. \n\nWait, maybe I need to break this down further. Let me list out the productions step by step.\n\n1. S starts as NT35 NT45.\n2. NT35 expands to NT15 NT1.\n3. NT15 can expand to NT1 NT25 or NT33.\n4. NT45 can expand to NT59 NT5 or NT44 NT33.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't10'. So, let's see if any NTs produce 't10'. From the grammar, NT10 has a production -> 't73'. Wait, but NTs can't directly refer to NT10 because they have to be non-terminals. Oh, wait, the grammar might have a mix of NTs and terminals.\n\nLooking back, for example, NT53 -> 't7', which is a terminal. So, whenever an NT like NT53 is part of a production, it can be replaced by 't7'. Similarly, NT10 is a non-terminal, so if it's in a production, it can be replaced by 't73' because NT10 -> 't73'.\n\nIn the target string, we have 't10' at the beginning. Is there a production that produces 't10' directly? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't10'. The closest is NT10 -> 't73', but that would require NT10 to be part of the expansion, which would produce 't73' instead of 't10'. So that's a problem because the string starts with 't10'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see rules like NT10 -> 't73'. So, if NT10 is part of a production, that production would replace it with 't73'. But in the string, the first part is 't10', which isn't generated by any NT in the grammar because none of the NTs directly translate to 't10'. The closest is NT10, which becomes 't73'.\n\nSo, that doesn't match. Maybe I should consider a different initial production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the other initial production, S -> NT35 NT45. Let's see if that leads us anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built using a different path. Let me see what each 't' in the string is supposed to be replaced by.\n\nLooking at the string: t10 t77 t28 t89 t24 t20 t40.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol. So, we need to find a way for the grammar to generate this sequence.\n\nStarting from S, let's see what S can produce. S can produce NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nIf we take S -> NT30 NT53, NT30 can be 't90', 't53', or 't14'. The first part is 't10', which isn't any of these, so maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, take S -> NT35 NT45. Then NT35 can expand to NT15 NT1, and NT45 can expand to NT59 NT5.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT15 can expand to NT1 NT25 or NT33.\n\nIf NT15 -> NT1 NT25, then NT1 can be 't89' as per the rules. Wait, looking back: NT1 -> 't89' (from NT1 -> NT10 ... etc.). Wait, let me check: looking in the grammar, for example, NT1 -> 't89' (yes, under NT1 -> NT10 NT4 and maybe others, but one production is NT1 -> 't89').\n\nSo, if NT15 -> NT1 NT25, and NT1 -> 't89', then that would give us 't89' followed by whatever NT25 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, the second term is 't77', which is followed by 't28', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps a better approach is to use a top-down parsing method or to generate the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the number of steps required. Each production of S adds two non-terminals, and each of those can add more, so the depth is log2(n), but it's a bit tricky.\n\nAnother approach: check each terminal in the string to see if they can be derived via any production. Since all are terminals, they must be derived from NTs that produce them.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, which terminals are present? Let's list all the 't' followed by numbers:\n\nt10, t77, t28, t89, t24, t20, t40, t90, t53, t7, t73, t38, t45, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, NTs like NT10 produce 't73', NT77? Wait, looking through the grammar, I notice some rules that produce specific t's. Let me list all rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT1 -> 't89', 't73', 't45', 't53', 't38', 't4', etc. Wait, no, looking back, under NT1, it's: NT1 -> NT10 NT4, NT15, etc. So NT10 produces 't73'. Wait, so the grammar for NT10 is:\n\nNT10 -> NT73 \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT10's production is NT10 -> 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 has NT53 -> 't7' among other things.\n\nWait, let's look again:\n\nIn the grammar, rules where NT produces terminal are:\n\n- NT30: 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT35: 't15' (but as per the rules, no, NT35 can produce other NTs)\nWait, perhaps I should list each rule that ends in a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for Rules where the production is an terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT35 -> 't15' No, wait, NT35 is followed by NT15 and NT1. So NT35 produces NT15 NT1, not terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the entire grammar:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' and 't53' and 't14'\n\nNT15 -> 't1 NT25' Wait no, NT15's rules are:\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nSo, NT14? I'm looking for any production where the right-hand side is a terminal. Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT30 has three terminal productions: 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\nNT35 has one NT15 NT1, so no terminals.\n\nNT43 has: NT53 NT11, which if NT53 can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT53: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-135","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t32 t45 t53 t17 t38 t66 t89 t28`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice it's pretty complex with a lot of non-terminals and terminals. My first step is to understand how the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S which can branch into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the string must start with either 't90', 't53', or 't35' followed by another non-terminal, which then expands further.\n\nBreaking down the string: It's eight tokens long, and each token in the string must come from either a direct production or a further expansion.\n\nLet me see each token in order:\n\n1. t32: Looking at the non-terminals, NT32 is present. So, NT32 can directly produce 't77'.\n2. t45: NT45 directly produces 't59'.\n3. t53: NT53 can produce 't59' as per the production NT53 -> NT59 NT5. So, the chain would be NT53 \u2192 NT59 NT5. Here, t53 is derived from NT53, then NT59 becomes t59, and NT5 becomes 't43'. Wait, that can't be right because our next token is t17, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, wait, the string token is t53, which would come directly from NT53 only if NT53 has a production for t53, which I don't think is the case here. Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT30 -> 't53', but there's no direct production for NT53 that produces t53. Instead, NT53 has productions like NT53 -> NT59 NT5 and NT53 -> t7, etc. So perhaps t53 must come from NT53 via some other path. But in the string, after t32, t45, t53, the next tokens are t17, which is derived from NT17? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each string token to the possible rules. Let me go step by step.\n\n- t32: As per the grammar, NT32 -> 't77'. So t32 is from NT32.\n\nThen, what leads to NT32? Looking at the grammar, I see NT32 is part of NT43's production: NT43 -> NT53 NT11 and NT43 -> t40. Wait, no, NT43 -> NT53 NT11 and also NT43 -> t40. Wait, where is NT32? Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT32 as a target of any production except perhaps in NT32's own productions. Wait, no, NT32 is a terminal in the production for NT30: NT30 -> 't77', but in the initial question, the string has t32, which is a terminal. So t32 is from NT32, which must have a production that produces it, which is NT32 -> 't77'. So t32 is straightforward.\n\nNext, t45. So looking at the grammar, t45 is NT45's production. Looking at NT45 in the rules: NT45 -> NT59 NT5 and NT45 can produce 't53' (wait, looking at the rules, there's 'NT45 -> 't53')? Let me check the grammar. Wait, the rules list includes 'NT45 -> 't53''. Oh, so NT45 can directly produce 't53', right? So why does the string have t45? Because in the string, the second token is t45, not t53. But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is `t32 t45 t53 t17 t38 t66 t89 t28`.\n\nWait, that's the string. So the second token is t45, which is from NT45. So perhaps the string is:\n\nStart: t32, which is from NT32, then from where does NT32 get its source? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT32 being a non-terminal that produces anything else except for the terminal. So how does NT32 get activated? Maybe through another path. Wait, perhaps the NT30 can produce 't77' from NT32. So the string's first token is t32, which comes from NT32, but looking through the grammar, how is NT32 derived? Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the grammar's non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, which eventually derive terminals. So perhaps the structure is S -> NT30 NT53, meaning S starts with NT30 and NT53, each of which could produce a terminal or split into more non-terminals.\n\nSo let's start by considering S -> NT30 NT53. Then, NT30 has possible productions: 't90', 't53', 't27', and similar. The string starts with t32, which isn't any of these. Wait, that's a problem because if S -> NT30 NT53, then the first token must be either 't90', 't53', etc., but the string starts with t32, which I don't think NT30 can produce directly. So maybe the alternative production is S -> NT35 NT45. Then the first two tokens would be from NT35 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT35's productions: NT35 can produce 't15' or other combinations, but the string starts with t32, which isn't directly produced by any of NT35 or NT45's terminals. Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong production.\n\nWait, the grammar's S can be either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Neither of these directly produce t32 as a terminal. Because NT30's terminals include t90, t53, t27, t14, t10, etc., and NT35's terminals include t35, t15, t1, etc. None of these directly produce t32. Therefore, the string starts with t32, which can't be derived from S, unless t32 is part of some intermediate derivation.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach: perhaps the string is derived from a different S production or a deeper expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token comes from a deeper expansion. Perhaps S -> NT30 NT53 and NT30 splits into something else. Let me see: NT30 can produce 't30', which is a non-terminal, but in our grammar, there are rules like NT30 -> 't77' (from the production NT30 -> 't53')? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT30 has several production rules, some of which are:\n\nNT30 -> NT53 NT14 (so, non-terminals), and also NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', 't27', 't14', 't10', 't32', 't43', etc., but the string starts with t32, which is produced by NT30 -> 't32', right?\n\nWait a second, looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't89'\n\nWait, also, there are entries like NT30 -> 't27' and 't14', so it can produce some terminals, but for t32, I see a line \"NT30 -> 't32'\". Wait, yes, checking the grammar rules provided, under NT30, there's a production NT30 -> 't32'. So the first token t32 can be directly produced from NT30.\n\nSo then, the first part is S -> NT30 NT53. Then, the NT30 produces t32, so that's the first token in the string. Then, the other part is NT53, which needs to produce the remaining tokens: t45, t53, t17, t38, t66, t89, t28.\n\nWait, but the string has seven more tokens after t32, so maybe I'm counting wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-153","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t73 t45 t77 t45 t32 t45 t28 t20 t40`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way of structuring context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is important because it simplifies the grammar, making it easier to analyze.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it follows CNF because all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or NT30 \u2192 't90'. \n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived step by step from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals. \n\nStarting from S, which can be NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. Since the first token in the string is 't73', maybe S is derived as NT30 NT53 because S \u2192 NT30 NT53. Wait, let me check the productions for NT30. The productions start with NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'. Hmm, 't73' is not among these, so maybe the initial step is S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't73'. Let's see what NT35 can produce. NT35 has a production rule NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1. So, NT35 expands into two other non-terminals, NT15 and NT1.\n\nSo, the first step would be S \u2192 NT35 NT45, which starts the derivation. Then NT35 goes to NT15 NT1, and NT45 can be any of its productions, which includes NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. Let me note that.\n\nSo, after expanding, the first tokens would come from NT15, NT1, NT59, and NT5. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT15 has several productions. One is NT15 \u2192 NT12, which is a terminal. Another is NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33. Hmm, 't12' is among the terminals, so perhaps NT15 \u2192 't12' is possible. Similarly, NT44 \u2192 't76' and NT33 \u2192 't62'? Wait, let me check. Looking back, NT33 is 't62' and NT15 is also 't12'. So, maybe the first token is 't12', but the string starts with 't73'. So that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. The initial expansion was S \u2192 NT35 NT45. So, maybe NT35 is NT15 NT1, and NT45 could be other options. Let's look at NT45's productions: NT45 can be NT59 NT5, or maybe other options like NT45 \u2192 't45' directly. Wait, do any of the NT45 productions include a terminal? Looking back, I don't see an NT45 \u2192 't45' production. Instead, all NT45 productions produce non-terminals. So, we can't get a terminal directly from NT45 except through further expansions.\n\nWait, let me confirm: The NT45 productions are NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, NT45 \u2192 NT53 NT5, NT45 \u2192 NT28, NT45 \u2192 't45'... Wait, no, actually looking at the provided grammar, for NT45, the productions are:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\nNT45 \u2192 NT53 NT5\nNT45 -> 't45'?\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar provided doesn't have NT45 \u2192 't45' in the first place. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT43 -> 't46' is in one rule. Hmm. Wait, here's the grammar list:\n\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT45 can also be 't45'? Wait, no, actually, it's not. Wait, looking again, in the provided grammar, NT45 has these productions:\n\nWait, actually, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\n\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nNT43 -> NT53 NT11\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT45 -> NT59 NT5\n\nNT35 -> NT15 NT1\n\nNT25 -> NT32 NT56\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNT53 -> NT46 NT1\n\nNT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nNT33 -> NT62 NT7\n\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4\n\nNT62 -> NT43 NT16\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT43\n\nNT16 -> 't72'\n\nNT30 -> 't90'\n\nNT30 -> 't53'\n\nNT30 -> 't14'\n\nNT1 -> 't89'\n\nNT53 -> 't7'\n\nNT7 -> 't91'\n\nNT56 -> 't45'\n\nNT30 -> 't27'\n\nNT10 -> 't73'\n\nNT25 -> 't29'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT53 -> 't59'\n\nNT56 -> 't28'\n\nNT11 -> 't28'\n\nNT59 -> 't17'\n\nNT32 -> 't77'\n\nNT1 -> 't10'\n\nNT59 -> 't28'\n\nNT15 -> 't12'\n\nNT10 -> 't32'\n\nNT44 -> 't76'\n\nNT4 -> 't45'\n\nNT46 -> 't66'\n\nNT53 -> 't91'\n\nNT9 -> 't38'\n\nNT4 -> 't53'\n\nNT15 -> 't38'\n\nNT4 -> 't33'\n\nNT59 -> 't24'\n\nNT9 -> 't20'\n\nNT53 -> 't80'\n\nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, that's all. So for NT45, the productions are:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n\nand \n\nIs there another production for NT45? It seems not. Because after checking, NT45 only has the production NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5, and maybe another production I might have missed, but from the list, I don't see any other NT45 \u2192 ... So NT45 can only be expanded into NT59 and NT5. \n\nBut looking at the string, after NT35, which expands into NT15 and NT1, and then NT45, which is NT59 and NT5. Let's proceed.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT35 NT45, then NT35 becomes NT15 NT1, and NT45 becomes NT59 NT5.\n\nSo the current string after first two expansions would be NT15, NT1, NT59, NT5.\n\nEach of these can expand into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at each:\n\nNT15 \u2192 possible productions:\n\n1. NT15 \u2192 NT12 (terminal 't12')\n\n2. NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n\n3. NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n\nLooking at the string, the next terminal is 't73'. Let me see: Starting from S, after expanding as NT35 NT45, then NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, and NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. So the next parts are NT15, NT1, NT59, NT5.\n\nWait, the initial string is 't73 t45 t77 t45 t32 t45 t28 t20 t40'. So the first token is 't73'. But if S is expanding as NT35 NT45, which would produce something that starts with NT35, which in turn has 't12' as a possible terminal. However, 't73' isn't 't12', so maybe this path is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which rule for S to use. S can also be derived as S \u2192 NT35 NT45 or S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, starting with S, which of the two options produces 't73'?\n\nIf S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the first part is NT30, which expands to 't90', 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is a member of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's recap what I know about CNF. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is an non-terminal, and the right-hand side of the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure allows for easy parsing using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I'll need that here.\n\nThe grammar provided has a set of productions, such as S \u2192 NT30 NT53, S \u2192 NT35 NT45, and so on. The terminals in the string are t76, t40, t72, t91, t73, t53, t28, t38, etc. Each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t76 t40 t72 t91 t73 t53 t28 t38 t40`. So, the string consists of nine terminals, each of which must be generated by some production in the grammar.\n\nMy goal is to check if there's a sequence of productions that can generate this string. Each step in the derivation must follow the grammar rules, and the result should be exactly the string in order.\n\nI'll start by looking at each production to see which non-terminals can generate a terminal.\n\nLet's list the productions again for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45\nNT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\nNT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\nNT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\nNT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\nNT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\nNT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nNT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\nNT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\nNT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\nNT16 \u2192 't72'\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\nNT10 \u2192 't73'\nNT25 \u2192 't29'\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT53 \u2192 't59', 't7'\nNT56 \u2192 't45'\nNT11 \u2192 't28'\nNT59 \u2192 't17', 't28'\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\nNT1 \u2192 't10'\nNT59 \u2192 't24'\nNT9 \u2192 't38'\nNT4 \u2192 't45', 't53', 't33'\nNT46 \u2192 't66'\nNT53 \u2192 't80'\nNT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nNow, the string is 9 tokens long, each separated by a space. So, I need to see if the leftmost derivations can produce these in order.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t76. Looking at the terminals above, t73 is one of the options for NT10 \u2192 't73', but t76 is not directly listed. Wait, let me check the productions again. Hmm, looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal directly generates 't76'. Scanning through the productions, the only place where a non-terminal directly maps to 't76' is not listed. Checking again, I see:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't72', so 't72' is present. But I don't see any non-terminal directly mapping to 't76'. That means that 't76' must be generated by a non-terminal through multiple steps. That implies that either the grammar doesn't have a production that can generate 't76', or I've missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again to see if any production can generate 't76'. Scanning through the productions, it seems that no non-terminal directly produces 't76'. The only t76 in the string is the first token, and since no non-terminal produces it, that would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So, that would make the answer 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I overlooked a production. Let me check the starting symbol S. S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So, starting from S, any generated string must have two non-terminals, each of which can be expanded into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nThe string in question has nine tokens, which is an odd number, so it must have started with S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then each non-terminal expanded into more until all are terminals.\n\nBut since none of the non-terminals directly produce 't76', the string cannot be generated. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, unless I misread the productions. Let me check again. The string is t76, which is the first token. Are there any production rules that produce t76?

The string is `t73 t45 t77 t28 t89 t24 t20 t66 t89 t28`. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe initial production for S is:\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo S can produce two different non-terminals. Then each of these non-terminals can produce other non-terminals until they eventually reach terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is all terminals, so I have to see if there's a way to derive this string starting from S.\n\nLet me list out the symbols in the string:\nt73, t45, t77, t28, t89, t24, t20, t66, t89, t28.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to see if each part can be matched by applying grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT30 NT53 and S \u2192 NT35 NT45. Let's see if the string can be formed by either.\n\nThe first symbol is t73. Let's see which non-terminals can derive to t73.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see N16 \u2192 t73. So N16 must be the start of a production that leads to t73.\n\nSo, can I get to N16 through the grammar? Let me check that.\n\nLooking at NT16's productions:\nNT16 \u2192 't73'\n\nPerfect, so from NT16, we get t73. That's the first symbol. So the string starts with NT16 \u2192 t73.\n\nSo now, the remaining string part is t45 t77 t28 t89 t24 t20 t66 t89 t28.\n\nNow, looking at S, which is either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45.\n\nBut after t73, which comes from N16, which is from where? Wait, in the initial production, S branches into NT30 and NT53 or NT35 and NT45. But in the string, after t73, the next symbol is t45.\n\nSo, let me think: t73 is from NT16, so the string starts with N16.\n\nBut wait, S can't go directly to N16. So perhaps S expands into something that leads to N16.\n\nWait, no. The initial production for S only allows starting with NT30 or NT35.\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory. Because the first symbol is t73, which comes from NT16, but S only goes into NT30 or NT35.\n\nThat suggests that maybe the string cannot start with t73, so it must come from the other part of S. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, in the initial productions, S \u2192 NT30 NT53, so S can only produce sequences that start with NT30... but the first symbol is t73, which is from NT16, which is part of a different production. That doesn't make sense, unless there's a way to reach t73 through S.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the entire derivation tree. Maybe S expands into NT30, which then has to expand into something that starts with t73.\n\nBut looking at NT30's productions, I see that NT30 can produce several things, including 't73'. Wait, NT30 has a production to 't73'? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, under NT30, the productions are:\n- NT30 \u2192 't73'\n- NT30 \u2192 't45'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the initial productions for NT30 include several, including 't73' as one of them.\n\nWait, the provided grammar for NT30 has the following:\nNT30 \u2192 't73' (I think I missed this earlier).

So perhaps, the production NT53 \u2192 NT15 NT1 is written twice, but that's probably not relevant right now.\n\nLooking at NT53's productions, none of them directly produce 't45'. Instead, perhaps a child non-terminal does. For example, looking at NT45: from the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5. So if NT45 is involved, but earlier NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be looking deeper into the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-175","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t73 t45 t77 t45 t32 t33 t24 t20 t7 t28`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all the rules here seem to be in CNF, that's a good start.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the initial derivation starts with S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which would give us two non-terminals on the left side. Each of these will need to be replaced with their respective productions until we get all terminals.\n\nNow, looking at each symbol in the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t73, t45, t77, t45, t32, t33, t24, t20, t7, t28. I'll list them as a list to process step by step.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the first step is S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which introduces two symbols: NT30 and NT53. I need to check how these produce the given string.\n\nLooking at NT30, the productions are:\n- NT30 \u2192 t90\n- NT30 \u2192t53\n- NT30 \u2192t14\n\nBut wait, in the initial production, S can go to NT30 NT53, which is a combination of NT30 and NT53. Let me see the possible ways.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent each non-terminal's possible terminals and see how the string can be formed. Since the string starts with t73, I'll need to see if any of the non-terminals in the productions produce t73, t45, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the given string, let's list the tokens in order:\nt73, t45, t77, t45, t32, t33, t24, t20, t7, t28.\n\nThis is a total of 10 tokens. Each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from S, each production of S would replace S with two symbols. Each of those symbols could in turn be replacements, leading to more symbols until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the total number of symbols in the string is 10. Let's see how many steps it would take.\n\nEach application of a production on a non-terminal increases the number of symbols by one. So starting with 1 (S), then 2, then 3, etc. So to get to 10 symbols, we need 9 derivations, but since each non-terminal production adds one, it's actually 9 steps beyond the initial. Or more accurately, the number of symbols is derived as 2^k -1 where k is the number of steps, but since it's a linear process, perhaps it's more straightforward to track the counts.\n\nWait, the string has 10 symbols. Each time a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, the count increases by one. So to get from 1 (S) to 10 requires 9 replacements. That seems correct.\n\nLet me think about each step:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53: now we have two symbols. So 2.\n\nBut to reach 10, we need more steps. So maybe we need to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string by matching possible leftmost derivations.\n\nLet me consider the first token: t73.\n\nLooking at the rules, which non-terminal can produce t73. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking at NT7 -> t91, NT16 -> t31. Let's see what produces t73. Wait, in the list, I don't see any rule that directly replaces any non-terminal with t73. Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing it.\n\nLooking at the list of productions:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal and their productions, I search for any that produce 't73' on the right side.\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nNT16 \u2192 t31\n\nNT73 \u2192 nowhere; perhaps it's a terminal. Or maybe t73 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, t73 is a terminal. So perhaps no non-terminal directly produces it. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking through the productions. Let me list all productions to check.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nNT53 \u2192 t7, nt7 \u2192 t91, nt16 \u2192t31.\n\nWait, but no NT produces 't73' directly in the list. Hmm, perhaps it's a mistake. Let me check each production:\n\nAh! Looking at NT30, which can go to t73 via NT30 \u2192 t73? No, wait. Looking back:\n\nWait, let me go through each of the NTs and their productions.\n\nLooking at NT30, its productions are:\n- NT30 \u2192 t90\n- NT30 \u2192 NT53\n- NT30 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo nowhere does NT30 produce t73. Hmm.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps 't73' comes from another NT that's not listed. Or perhaps there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe 't73' is produced by a NT that I missed. Let me check.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nThe NTs are defined with these productions, so for example:\n\nNT15\u2192NT1 NT25,\nNT16\u2192't72',\nWait, perhaps there's a way that NT16 can produce t72, and another NT produces t72 as well.\n\nWait, looking at 't72', which is in NT16's production. Also, looking at NT4, does it have a production to 't72'? Wait, no, I don't see that in the list. Let me double-check:\n\nAfter NT16:\n\nNT56 \u2192 t45,\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me go through all NTs and their productions to find any non-terminal that can produce a t73.\n\nBut in the given list, I don't see any rule producing 't73' on the RHS. That means that perhaps the string t73 can't be produced by the grammar because there's no NT that produces t73. Unless I've missed it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check whether any NT is supposed to produce t73 but was omitted. Let me look at all the rules again.\n\nLooking at all the productions:\n\nNo NT directly produces 't73', so that's a problem. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the first symbol is t73, and there's no way to get that from any NT.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the productions again to make sure.\n\nLooking at NT30: it can go to t14, t90, or NT53.\n\nSo 't73' isn't there. But perhaps it's produced by another NT through multiple steps. For example, maybe an NT can produce another NT that then produces t73.\n\nFor example, maybe there's a chain like NT \u2192 other NTs, which in the end produces t73.\n\nBut in the given list, I don't see any NT with t73 as one of their productions. So that's a red flag. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because t73 is never produced by any rule. So the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't73' is produced by some NT that I overlooked. Let me check each NT again.\n\nLooking through all NTs and their possible RHSs:\n\n- NT1: t10, NT14, t4, etc.\n\n- NT4: t45, etc.\n\n- NT5: t9, t43.\n\n- NT9: t38.\n\n- NT10: t73? No. NT10\u2192t73?\n\nWait, do I see NT10's production: looking through, yes, I see NT10\u2192't73'? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, looking at the list: NT10 \u2192 't73', so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo NT10 can produce t73.\n\nWait, but wait, looking through the list again:\n\nAh, no. Wait, in the list of productions:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't73'? Let me check:\n\nIn the given productions:\n\nNT10\u2192 t73, yes, that's correct. I didn't notice that before. So NT10 can produce t73.\n\nWait, but then, the question is, where does NT10 come in the derivation? Because in the string, it's starting with t73, so if the final step is S \u2192 NT30 NT53, and then NT30 and NT53 have to produce t73, t45, etc., but that seems complicated.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But nowhere in the start productions do we have NT44. So, does that mean NT44 is never used? But the string starts with NT44 producing t76.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Since S can't produce NT44, and the string starts with a t76 which comes from NT44, it seems impossible. Unless there's some other way to get t76.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is generated.

How can t76 be generated? It must come from a production where a non-terminal is replaced by t76. Looking at the productions, only NT44 can produce t76 directly.

For example, does any NT produce another NT that can derive to 44? Let's see.\n\nFor instance, NT59 -> t28. Hmm, but that's a terminal, not a non-terminal.

So NT16 produces t72. That's useful because our string has t72.\n15. NT30 \u2192 t90 or t53 or t14. So NT30 can produce any of those three terminals.\n16. NT10 \u2192 t73 or t32 or t10. Wait, NT10 can produce terminals like t73, t32, or another NT10. But since we need to derive the entire string, each symbol must eventually be a terminal.\n17. NT25 \u2192 t45, t29, or t25. So NT25 can produce a few terms.\n18. NT43 \u2192 t40, t66, or t91. NT43 can produce three terminals: t40, t66, t91.\n19. NT53 \u2192 t7, t59, t28, or t1. Wait, actually, looking back: NT53 has several rules, but one of them is directly to 't7'. So NT53 can produce 't7' as one option.\n20. NT56 \u2192 t45. So NT56 produces t45.\n21. NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7. So NT33 is non-terminal, unless 62 or 7 are terminals. NT7 is t91, as seen in the rules.\n22. NT9 \u2192 t38 or t20. So NT9 can produce t38 or t20.\n23. NT44 \u2192 t76. So NT44 can produce t76.\n24. NT4 \u2192 t53 or t45 or t33. Wait, NT4's production: it can produce 't53'. \n\nWait, NT4 can produce t53? So in the string, I see t53, but maybe I'm mixing up production rules.\n\nBut let me write down all the terminal symbols in the string: t76, t40, t72, t91, t73, t45, t17, t38, t66, t89, t28.\n\nWait, do I have all of these in the production rules? Let me check:\n\n- t76: produced by NT44.\n- t40: produced by NT43 producing 't40'.\n- t72: produced by NT16.\n- t91: produced by NT16 or NT53 (looking back: yes, NT53 can produce t7, but also NT53 can produce NT56 NT5. Wait, the initial production of NT53 is NT56 NT5, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me recheck the rules for NT53. The initial given grammar has NT53 as S \u2192 NT30 NT53, but in the list, NT53 has multiple rules, including NT53 \u2192 t7, so yes, NT53 can produce t7, but also others like t59, t28, etc. Wait, no, in the provided rules, I think I might have misread. Let me parse all the NT53 rules again: NT53 \u2192 t7, t59, t28, t1, t80, t91. Oh, yes, NT53 can produce t7, t59, t28, t1, t80, t91.\n\nSo t72 is produced by NT16, t91 can be produced directly by NT53. That's a good sign.\n\nContinuing, the string has t76 (from NT44), t40 (from NT43), t72 (from NT16), t91 (from NT53), t73 (from NT10's terminal option, as per rule 11: NT10 \u2192 t73). Next, t45: NT25 can produce t45, so perhaps NT25. Then t17: looking through the rules, no NT directly produces t17, but wait, NT59 \u2192 t17. So to have t17, we need NT59 to produce it. Then t38: NT9 can produce t38 (rule 22). Next, t66: NT43 can produce t66. Then t89: looking through the rules, S can produce NT30 or NT35, but NT30 can produce t90, t53, t14; NT35 can produce t15 or t45. Also, NT1 \u2192 t89 is a production rule (rule 11: NT1 \u2192 t89). So t89 is from NT1. Lastly, t28: NT30 can produce t28 (rule 15: NT30 \u2192 t28).\n\nWait, that's a lot, but let me try to build the derivation step by step. Maybe it's easier to start from the string and see if each token can be matched by some rule.\n\nThe string is: t76, t40, t72, t91, t73, t45, t17, t38, t66, t89, t28.\n\nLet's map each token to a non-terminal:\n\n- t76: NT44 produces it. So the first symbol comes from NT44.\n- t40: NT43 produces it.\n- t72: NT16.\n- t91: NT53.\n- t73: NT10.\n- t45: Let's see; looking at NT25, which can produce t45.\n- t17: Must come from NT59.\n- t38: NT9.\n- t66: NT43.\n- t89: NT1.\n- t28: NT30.\n\nSo the entire string should be generated by a sequence of non-terminals that expand into these terminals. Let's try to chain the productions:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt76 (from NT44) \u2192 NT44\n\nThen t40 (from NT43) \u2192 NT43\n\nt72 (from NT16) \u2192 NT16\n\nt91 (from NT53) \u2192 NT53\n\nt73 (from NT10) \u2192 NT10\n\nt45 (from NT25) \u2192 NT25\n\nt17 (from NT59) \u2192 NT59\n\nt38 (from NT9) \u2192 NT9\n\nt66 (from NT43) \u2192 NT43\n\nt89 (from NT1) \u2192 NT1\n\nt28 (from NT30) \u2192 NT30\n\nSo now, let's try to see how these non-terminals connect. The entire derivation would start with S.\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nIf S is the start, the first step is to choose between NT30 and NT35 for the first part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t76, which comes from NT44. But S's first production is NT30. So let's see how NT30 could lead to t76"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t76 t66 t73 t33 t28 t31 t91 t32 t53 t17 t38 t40`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This should make parsing easier, maybe even possible with a simple recursive descent approach. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can be derived in two ways:\n1. S -> NT30 NT53\n2. S -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo, the string should start with either NT30 or NT35 followed by NT53 or NT45 respectively.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with `t76`. I need to match this with the possible terminal symbols from the production rules of NT30 or NT35.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT30 has productions:\n  - NT30 -> NT43 NT10\n  - NT30 -> NT53\n  - NT30 -> NT14\n  - NT30 -> 't90'\n  - NT30 -> 't53'\n  - NT30 -> 't27'\n  - NT30 -> 't73'\n\nWait, actually, for NT30, the options are either multiple non-terminals or terminal symbols. The terminal symbols under NT30 are `t90`, `t53`, `t27`, `t73`, and another `t73` via NT30 -> NT62 NT7. Wait, actually, I think I need to check which NT30 rules are terminal.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT30:\n- N -> 't90'\n- N -> 't53'\n- N -> 't27'\n- N -> 't73'\n\nWait, so NT30 can directly produce these terminals. Also, NT30 can produce NT62 and NT7, but that's not a terminal, it leads to NT62 -> NT43 NT16, and NT16 -> 't72', so NT62 would become 't43' and 't72'. But in the case of NT30, if it goes through NT62 and then NT16, then NT30 can also produce something that includes 't43' and 't16' which would decode to terms.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first token is 't76', which is a terminal. Looking at the terminal productions in the NT30, 't76' isn't listed. Hmm. So maybe NT30 isn't the one to produce 't76' at the start. Let me check NT30's rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT30:\n- NT30 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't27'\n- NT30 -> 't73'\n- NT30 -> 'NT62 NT7'\nWait, so NT30 can produce NT62 and NT7. Let's see what NT62 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT62: NT62 -> NT43 NT16\nNT43: NT43 -> NT40\nNT16: NT16 -> 't72'\n\nSo NT62 would become NT43 and 't72', and NT43 becomes 't40'. So NT62 -> 't40' followed by NT16's 't72', but that's not directly a terminal. Wait, no, NT62 is followed by NT43, which produces 't40', and NT16 is 't72', so NT62 leads to 't40' and 't72' in sequence? Or is it a concatenation? So NT62 would produce 't40 t72'? Or is it one symbol?\n\nWait, probably each production rule is handled by the left-hand side, so NT62 -> NT43 NT16. When we parse, we replace NT62 with NT43 followed by NT16, and then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is 't76'. So perhaps NT30 can't generate 't76' because it's not a direct terminal. Then maybe NT35 is the one that can produce something leading to 't76'.\n\nLooking at NT35's productions:\n\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n\nWait, also, looking at NT35's rules, are there any terminal productions?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any direct terminals. So NT35 can only produce combinations of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check each rule. Wait, I see a line: NT35 -> NT15 NT1. Another line: NT35 -> NT1 NT4. Both are non-terminal productions, so NT35 can't generate a terminal directly except through chains that result in terminals.\n\nWait, but is 't76' a terminal that appears in any of the grammar's productions? I need to check each rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice that some symbols produce terminal strings. Let's list all the terminal symbols in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each rule, when a symbol is followed by '->' and ends with terminals or is a terminal, it's a terminal. So for example:\n\n- S produces NT30 NT53, etc.\n- NT30 can produce 't90', 't53', etc.\n- NT35 can produce NT15 NT1, etc., but not directly a terminal.\n- NT1 has productions like NT10 -> 't73', so NT1 can produce 't10' and NT4, which in turn may produce 't45' or other terms.\nWait, I think I might not have the full picture. Alternatively, maybe I should look up all the possible terminal strings in the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side is entirely terminals. For example, some NT like NT35, etc.\n\nWait, in the given rules:\n\nNo, actually, it's quite a few.

{"custom_id":"request-237","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what each part of this task involves.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form. That means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the base cases where a non-terminal can produce a terminal. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t76 t91 t28 t72 t91 t73 t45 t28 t38 t66 t73 t53 t28`.\n\nTo determine if this string is in the language defined by the grammar, I can use a top-down parsing approach, specifically the CYK algorithm, but since I'm a bit new to this, maybe a more step-by-step approach would help.\n\nLet me first write down all the production rules and the terminals to see which ones can produce which strings.\n\nThe grammar has several production rules for non-terminals (S, NT1, NT3, etc.) that eventually lead to terminal symbols (like 't72', 't91', etc.). Each rule is of the form NT -> NT NT, except when a terminal appears.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- S -> NT30 NT53\n- NT43 -> NT53 NT11\n- NT15 -> NT1 NT25\n- NT45 -> NT59 NT5\n- NT35 -> NT15 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT32 NT56\n- NT15 -> NT44 NT33\n- NT53 -> NT46 NT1\n- NT35 -> NT1 NT4\n- NT33 -> NT62 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT4\n- NT62 -> NT43 NT16\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT43\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't29'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't59', 't7'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT11 -> 't28'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT32 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT59 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't32'\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT4 -> 't45'\n- NT46 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't53'\n- NT15 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't33'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n- NT16 -> 't31'\n\nHmm, that's a lot of rules. Some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT16 -> 't72', and NT53 can produce several terminals: 't7', 't59', etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't76', which I notice that NT44 -> 't76'. But 't44' isn't a terminal itself, so where does 't44' come from? Looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal symbols that directly produce 't44'. Only NT44 is the non-terminal, which goes to 't76'.\n\nSo in the string, the first element is 't76', which must come from NT44. But wait, the production for NT44 is just 't76', so when parsing, that would mean the string must have 't76' as a symbol derived directly from NT44. So in the string, the first symbol is 't76', so it could be part of the derivation from NT44.\n\nBut then, the next symbol is 't91', which I need to check if there's a production that can derive it. Looking at the rules, NT53 -> 't59' and 't7' and 't91' (from NT53). Wait, no, check: NT53 has productions like -> NT46 NT1, which then might produce other symbols, but looking for direct terminals.\n\nLooking at NT53 -> 't53', 't91'? Wait, no. Let me re-examine:\n\nIn the production rules, NT53 appears in several productions:\n\n- NT16 -> 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't90', 't53', 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't29'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT53 -> 't46' and 't1'\n- NT56 -> 't45'\n- NT11 -> 't28'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT32 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't10'\n- NT59 -> 't28' (duplicate)\n- NT15 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't32' (duplicate)\n- NT44 -> 't76'\n- NT4 -> 't45' and 't53' (I think that's in two different rules)\n- NT46 -> 't66'\n- NT53 -> 't91'\n- NT9 -> 't38'\n- NT4 -> 't33'\n- NT59 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't20' (duplicate)\n- NT53 -> 't80'\n- NT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, so NT53 has a production -> 't91' directly. So 't91' can come from NT53.\n\nSimilarly, 't76' comes from NT44, and NT44 only appears once in the rules, so NT44 must be a non-terminal that produces 't76'. So the string starts with 't76' and 't91', so perhaps the first step is to have S produce NT44 NT53, which would be 't76' and 't91', but the string is longer than that, so we have more symbols after these.\n\nWait, the string is: t76 t91 t28 t72 t91 t73 t45 t28 t38 t66 t73 t53 t28.\n\nLet me list these in order:\n\n1. t76\n2. t91\n3. t28\n4. t72\n5. t91\n6. t73\n7. t45\n8. t28\n9. t38\n10. t66\n11. t73\n12. t53\n13. t28\n\nWait, so the first two symbols are t76 and t91. Let's see: S can derive into NT44 NT53, which would produce 't76' and 't91'. Then, perhaps the non-terminals NT44 and NT53 can split into other non-terminals or terminals. Wait, NT53 can split into 't91', so that's a terminal. Then NT44 can split into 't76', which is a terminal.\n\nSo the first two symbols are covered by S -> NT44 NT53, which directly gives 't76' 't91'. Then the next symbol is t28. So after the first two symbols, we have 't28 t72 t91 t73 t45 t28 t38 t66 t73 t53 t28'.\n\nLet me think about how the next symbols can be derived. The next non-terminal after NT53 (which is 't91') would be the next symbol: t28. So maybe after NT53, it can be NT53 which can split into something else that includes 't28'.\n\nLooking back, NT44 produces t76. But after that, we have t91, which is a terminal. So perhaps the production after NT53 is another non-terminal that can produce t28 and the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S -> NT30 NT53, which would be 't90 t53', but that's not our case here because the first symbol is t76.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build this step by step. Let's create a parse tree.\n\nStarting from S, which must split into two parts. Let's look at S's production rules: S can be NT30 NT53 or NT43 NT54?

The grammar and the string are provided, but I need to figure out step by step if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT30, NT43, etc.) has production rules that break them down into other non-terminal symbols or terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). The start symbol is S, which can produce other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals which form the string.\n\nThe string given is: `t76 t80 t28 t31 t91 t32 t53 t28 t38 t66 t32 t33 t28`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each production will eventually produce these terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should try to build the string by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions step by step until I reach the terminals in the string. Alternatively, I could work backwards from the string, trying to see if each substring can be generated by a non-terminal. This reverse approach is often easier for such problems.\n\nWorking backwards might be more efficient. Each terminal in the string would need to match a terminal in some production rule, and the non-terminals would connect the parts. Let me list out the symbols in the string with their order: t76, t80, t28, t31, t91, t32, t53, t28, t38, t66, t32, t33, t28.\n\nI'll assign each as s1 to s13 for clarity:\n\ns1: t76\n\ns2: t80\n\ns3: t28\n\ns4: t31\n\ns5: t91\n\ns6: t32\n\ns7: t53\n\ns8: t28\n\ns9: t38\n\ns10: t66\n\ns11: t32\n\ns12: t33\n\ns13: t28\n\nStarting from the end, s13 is t28.

But I'm trying to get t28, so I need a production that directly gives t28. Looking through the rules, I see that NT32 produces 't77' and 't1'\u2014no, wait, let me check.\n\nWait, among the NT rules, I see NT25 \u2192 't29', and NT29 maybe? No, let's check the given rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some NT symbols produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', or 't14'.\n\nBut looking for t28, I see in NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25 and NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps NT25 \u2192 't29' as per the rule NT25 \u2192 't29'? No, looking through:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n\nAnd NT32 \u2192 't77', which leads to perhaps t77 being further broken down.\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT32 produces 't77' and then what? Wait, let me make a list of all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, some NT are mapped to terminals:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't89', 't10', 't4'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't38'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't45', 't53', 't33'\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, I need to check each production.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, let's note which NT symbols have direct terminal productions.\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't12'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT15 -> NT1 NT25\n\nNT15 -> NT44 NT33\n\nNeither of those produce terminals, but wait, looking for NT25:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n\nNT32 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't45'\n\nBut 't77' and 't45' are further broken down into other NT symbols, not terminals. So perhaps that's a chain.\n\nWait, but in the string, s13 is t28. So I need to see how to get t28.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps NT11 can produce 't28'? Let me check:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT28 NT7\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT11's production: NT11 \u2192 NT28 NT7. So how do NT28 and NT7 get to terminals?\n\nWait, but in the string, the first t28 is s3: t28. How is that generated?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's see each symbol in the string and see if they can be produced by some NT, either directly or as part of a chain.\n\nStarting from the string's last symbol s13: t28.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any NT rules produce 't28'?\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\nNT1 -> NT10 NT4, but 10 and 4 may produce other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find NT28, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT named NT28; maybe it's built from others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to see if the entire string can be broken down into a series of production rules from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53\n\nor S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n\nSo each S production splits into two non-terminals. Let's see what happens when we expand each of these.\n\nBut considering the string's length is 13, which is quite long. I think it's impractical to fully expand all possibilities, so perhaps looking for a way to see if each part of the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, let's check each symbol and see which NT it can come from.\n\ns1: t76.

So, any string generated by this grammar should start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nThe string starts with t76, which I need to match. Looking at the NT35 and NT45 productions, I see NT35 can produce NT15 NT1, and NT30 has different options: t90, t53, t14, t89, etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT30 has several options: 't90', 't53', 't14', 't89', 't73', and 't27'. Hmm, but the string starts with t76, which isn't directly any of those.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the NT30 productions. The user provided the grammar as:\n\nNT30 -> 't90' \nNT30 -> 't53' \nNT30 -> 't14' \nNT1 -> 't89' \nNT53 -> 't7' \nNT7 -> 't91' \nNT56 -> 't45' \nNT30 -> 't27' \nNT10 -> 't73' \nNT25 -> 't29' \nNT43 -> 't40' \nNT53 -> 't59' \nNT56 -> 't28' \nNT11 -> 't28' \nNT59 -> 't17' \nNT32 -> 't77' \nNT1 -> 't10' \nNT59 -> 't28' \nNT15 -> 't12' \nNT10 -> 't32' \nNT44 -> 't76' \nNT4 -> 't45' \nNT46 -> 't66' \nNT53 -> 't91' \nNT9 -> 't38' \nNT4 -> 't53' \nNT15 -> 't38' \nNT4 -> 't33' \nNT59 -> 't24' \nNT9 -> 't20' \nNT53 -> 't80' \nNT16 -> 't31'\n\nWait, I'm confused. The NT30 production includes 't76'? Let me check. Oh, I see under NT44, there's a production NT44 -> t76. So, NT44 can produce 't76'.\n\nBut wait, what about the starting symbol S. The two initial options are S -> NT30 NT53 or S -> NT35 NT45.\n\nSo the string must start with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t76. So, the first part must be t76. Let's see which production yields t76.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only way to get t76 is via NT44 -> t76. But NT44 is a non-terminal. So, for the string to start with t76, it must come from NT44, meaning the earlier productions must have derived NT44.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which doesn't produce NT44 directly. So either the start symbol's productions directly go to t76 or through some chain.\n\nWait no, S only produces combinations of NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So the first step would be to generate a combination of two non-terminals, which then get replaced by terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t76, which must be part of the derivation from either NT30 or NT35.\n\nWait, t76 isn't in NT30 or NT35's direct productions. So that's a problem. Because the string starts with t76, which isn't directly derived from S's initial productions.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The S production is:\n\nS -> NT30 NT53\nOR\nS -> NT35 NT45\n\nSo S starts with either NT30 followed by NT53 or NT35 followed by NT45. So the string must start with either (from NT30) t90, t53, t14, or (from NT35) t15, t45, etc., but none of the direct options produce t76.\n\nWait, wait. There's a production NT44 -> t76, but NT44 is a separate non-terminal. So for S to start with t76, it would have to involve a way to get t76 as the first symbol, but S doesn't produce t76 directly. It only produces combinations of non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the initial part isn't matching, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again: The string starts with t76. Since S can't directly produce t76, the string can't be derived from S. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any possible derivation path. Suppose that the NT30 and NT53 can somehow produce t76 through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at NT30, it can produce 't76' if somewhere along the line, it can derive t76. Wait, does NT30 have a production that results in t76? Looking at the grammar, NT30 only produces terminals like 't90', 't53', 't14', etc., not directly t76. So no, NT30 doesn't produce t76.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT44, which is the only one that produces t76, but S starts with NT30 or NT35. So to get t76 as the first symbol, it must come from a production of NT44, but S doesn't have such a production.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because it starts with t76, which isn't an immediate production of S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way through some intermediate steps. For example, if NT30 could derive NT44, which then produces t76. But I don't see any production that makes NT30 into NT44. So I don't think that's possible.\n\nAnother approach: Let me see if there's any way to derive t76 from S. If S can somehow produce t76 via NT44, but S can't directly do that. So the answer is no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong about NT44. Let me check. In the grammar, there's NT44 -> t76. So yes, NT44 can produce t76. So if in the derivation, a path leads to NT44, which then produces t76.\n\nBut how can that happen starting from S? Because S can't produce t76 directly. So perhaps the first symbols after S would involve chains that include NT44.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. The first symbol is t76, which comes from NT44. So the first part of the derivation would be S -> NT30 NT53. To get t76, either NT30 or NT53 must produce t76, but neither does. Alternatively, perhaps one of them produces NT44, which then becomes t76.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions, none produce NT44. Similarly, NT53 has a production NT53 -> t7, but not NT44. So perhaps there's no way for S to derive t76 as the first symbol.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it starts with t76, which cannot be derived from S.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has S as the start symbol, and there are several productions expanding into other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string to check is: `t76 t66 t10 t28 t31 t91 t32 t53 t28 t20 t66 t32 t53 t28`.\n\nMy plan is to try to derive this string step by step from the grammar, ensuring that each terminal in the string is matched correctly according to the productions.\n\nStarting with S. Looking at the productions, S can expand into NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. I'll need to see which path the string takes. Let's assume it starts as S \u2192 NT30 NT53, so the first part of the string would use NT30.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions: it can go directly to 't76', 't66', 't14', or via other non-terminals. The first token is 't76', so if NT30 \u2192 't76', that's a match. So the initial part is covered.\n\nNow, after 't76', we have 't66'. Let's look at what comes next. The next symbol is 't66'. Now, since we've used 't76' from NT30, the next part must be part of NT53. Looking at NT53's productions:\n\nNT53 can expand into 't7', 't59', 't91', 't46', 't66', etc.\n\nIn the string, after 't76', we have 't66', which matches NT53's production NT53 \u2192 't66'. So so far, we have successfully matched 't76 t66'.\n\nNext is 't10'. Now, after NT53 \u2192 't66', we have to look at what comes next, which is 't10'. Let's see what the next part would be. Since NT53's expansion after 't66' is a terminal, the next part must be covered by another non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, after 't66', the next token is 't10', so we might be dealing with the next part of NT53 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the context where 't10' comes. Let's consider the overall structure. So S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which gives us part of the string as 't76 t66'. Now, after that, we have 't10'. So the next step is to parse 't10', which must come from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: it can go to 't10' via NT15 \u2192 't10'. But in our current context, after NT30 and NT53, the next part is 't10', which might be from another NT. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should backtrack and see if there's a better path.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that after the initial S \u2192 NT30 NT53, the next symbol is 't66' (as we've used 't76'), so maybe NT30 is done, and then we have NT53 \u2192 't66', but then the next symbol is 't10', which is a terminal. So, perhaps after NT53 \u2192 't66', the next symbol is 't10'. So maybe the NT that produces 't10' is somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the structure more carefully. Each symbol in the string must be matched by some production.\n\nLooking at the string: t76, t66, t10, t28, t31, t91, t32, t53, t28, t20, t66, t32, t53, t28.\n\nI think I should parse the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nLet me start with S.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- So, the first symbol must be produced by NT30, and the second by NT53.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't76'. NT30 can produce 't76' (NT30 \u2192 't76'), so S \u2192 NT30 (t76) NT53.\n\nSo, we've consumed 't76' and have the next symbol 't66'.\n\nNow, the next production is from NT53, which must produce 't66'. So, NT53 \u2192 't66' (since NT53 \u2192 't66' is a production).\n\nSo now, we've consumed 't76' and 't66', and we're left with the rest of the string: t10, t28, t31, t91, t32, t53, t28, t20, t66, t32, t53, t28.\n\nNext, after the initial parts, we have S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which started with 't76 t66'. Now, we need to handle the remaining parts.\n\nWait, perhaps after NT53 \u2192 't66', the next symbol is 't10', which must come from another NT. Let's think about what can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't10'.\nNT1 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo, possible.\n\nBut which one is used here?\n\nWait, perhaps after S \u2192 NT30 NT53, we've consumed 't76 t66'. Then, the next NTs would be NT30 (already done) and NT53 (already done). So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the initial production isn't S \u2192 NT30 NT53?\n\nWait, no, S can produce either NT30 NT53 or NT35 NT45. So perhaps I should consider both possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nBut let me first check both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 (covers 't76 t66').\n\nNext symbol is 't10'. So, after 't66', we have to consume 't10', which requires another NT to produce it. But in the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't10' and NT1 \u2192 't10'. Maybe the production is S \u2192 NT30 NT53, then the next NTs are NT15 and NT1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after S \u2192 NT30 NT53, we have consumed 't76 t66', leaving the rest.\n\nBut perhaps the initial assumption is correct, and the next symbol after NT30 and NT53 is 't10', which must come from a production of NT.\n\nWait, maybe the S rule is S \u2192 NT30 NT53, and then after that, the NTs are done, but perhaps NT30 and NT53 are done, so we have to see if the next production is part of another rule. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is correct, and then the next production is another part of the same S. Wait, no, each S production is a single step. So, after choosing S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which produces 't76 t66', the next step would be to parse the remaining string.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this as a parse tree. Let's try:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't76' \u2192 consumed.\n\n- Next, NT53 \u2192 't66' \u2192 consumed.\n\nNow, we have remaining: t10, t28, t31, t91, t32, t53, t28, t20, t66, t32, t53, t28.\n\nBut NT30 and NT53 are both done (NT30 produced 't76', NT53 produced 't66'), so perhaps the next symbols must come from another part of the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the S production S \u2192 NT30 NT53 is the first step, then after that, the NT30 and NT53 can produce more symbols as per their productions.\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, the productions are applied sequentially. So, after S \u2192 NT30 NT53, which gives 't76 t66', the next step is to see what comes after.\n\nBut actually, each production replaces a single non-terminal with a string of symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t76 t66 t32 t45 t28 t31 t91 t73 t53 t24 t20 t66 t73 t45 t28`, and the grammar is quite extensive with multiple production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one non-terminal. This structure simplifies the parsing process because it means that each production step expands a single non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure is conducive to parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll need a different approach.\n\nI think breaking down the problem into smaller steps might be helpful. I'll start by looking at the start symbol, which is S in this case. The grammar provides two options for S: either NT30 NT53 or NT45 NT25.

But in the string, I need to check which terminals are present.\n\nWait, no, looking again: NT32 \u2192 't77', so 't77' is NT32. So in the string, when we have 't77', it corresponds to NT32, but to use that, we need to have a production that involves NT32.\n\nLooking at the entire string: `t76 t66 t32 t45 t28 t31 t91 t73 t53 t24 t20 t66 t73 t45 t28`.\n\nI notice 't76' as the first symbol. Looking at the production rules, 't76' is not directly defined anywhere as a terminal, so that means it must be derived from NT76. However, in the grammar provided, there are no production rules where NT76 appears on the left-hand side. This could be a problem because if 't76' is not a terminal, it must somehow be produced by an NT rule, but the grammar doesn't have such a term.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\n- The production rules are mainly of the form NTa NTb, except for the few with terminals like NT30 \u2192 't90' etc.\n\nI don't see any production rule where the left side is NT76. So 't76' is not generated by any rule in this grammar. That would mean the string starts with a symbol that's not in the language, so the entire string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't91' \u2705\n- NT56 \u2192 't45' \u2705\n- NT32 \u2192 't77' \u2705\n- NT1 \u2192 't89', 't73', 't10', etc. \u2705\n- NT53 \u2192 't7', 't59', 't1', 't91', etc.\n\nWait, I only see production rules involving 25 non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut I don't see NT76 as any production rule. So 't76' cannot be generated by this grammar, as there's no NT76 rule. Therefore, the string starts with 't76', which is not allowed, so the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me confirm. Let me scan through the entire list again.\n\nLooking at all the production rules, the non-terminal NT76 is mentioned in the string, but I don't recall any production rule where NT76 is on the left. The only NTs are like NT43, NT15, etc., but nothing for NT76. For example, looking at NT76: \n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT45 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-276","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t76 t66 t32 t33 t28 t31 t91 t32 t33 t24 t20 t66 t32 t33 t28` and the grammar has a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it limits the way strings can be formed, usually leading to strings where each non-terminal replacement adds exactly one non-terminal and eventually a terminal. So the length of the string should be 2^n -1 for some n, where n is the number of productions applied. But wait, looking at the string, it's 15 tokens long, so does that mean n is log2(16)=4, so 2^4 -1 = 15. Yes, that matches. So the structure is possible, but I need to confirm the exact steps.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so each non-terminal in the grammar should eventually expand into a terminal string. So I need to see if the string can be broken down into steps where each non-terminal has exactly two symbols (either other non-terminals or terminals) until the end.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules again to see how each non-terminal expands.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal (since all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals, one terminal, or one non-terminal).\n\nI think the way to approach this is to try to build a parse tree for the input string. Given the string's length is 15, which is 2^4 -1, the parse tree should be a binary tree with 4 levels.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for possible ways to split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT53\n- S \u2192 NT35 NT45\n- NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11\n- NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25\n- NT45 \u2192 NT59 NT5\n- NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1\n- NT25 \u2192 NT32 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT44 NT33\n- NT53 \u2192 NT46 NT1\n- NT35 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 NT62 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT10 NT4\n- NT62 \u2192 NT43 NT16\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 't72'\n- NT30 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't53'\n- NT30 \u2192 't14'\n- NT1 \u2192 't89'\n- NT53 \u2192 't7'\n- NT7 \u2192 't91'\n- NT56 \u2192 't45'\n- NT30 \u2192 't27'\n- NT10 \u2192 't73'\n- NT25 \u2192 't29'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT53 \u2192 't59'\n- NT56 \u2192 't28'\n- NT11 \u2192 't28'\n- NT59 \u2192 't17'\n- NT32 \u2192 't77'\n- NT1 \u2192 't10'\n- NT59 \u2192 't28'\n- NT15 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't32'\n- NT44 \u2192 't76'\n- NT4 \u2192 't45'\n- NT46 \u2192 't66'\n- NT53 \u2192 't91'\n- NT9 \u2192 't38'\n- NT4 \u2192 't53'\n- NT15 \u2192 't38'\n- NT4 \u2192 't33'\n- NT59 \u2192 't24'\n- NT9 \u2192 't20'\n- NT53 \u2192 't80'\n- NT16 \u2192 't31'\n\nWait, some of these seem conflicting. For example, NT53 \u2192 't59' and NT53 \u2192 't91', and also NT53 comes from multiple places. Similarly, NT43\u2192't40' as well as others. So I need to make sure that each non-terminal correctly expands.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, most of them are non-terminals ending with other non-terminals or a terminal. So some of these non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo let me note which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT30 can be 't90', 't53', 't14'\nWait, but one of the rules says S \u2192 NT30 NT53.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing because some non-terminals can derive a string ending with a terminal. So for example, in NT30, one of the rules is 't90', another is 't53', and another is 't14'. Wait, but this is perhaps multiple ways a non-terminal can be represented? Or is it that each rule is separate?\n\nWait, I think each production is an alternative. So for example, S can be NT30 followed by NT53. But also, NT30 can be 't90' or 't53' or 't14'.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. In a grammar, each rule is an alternative production. So for example, S can be divided into two choices: S \u2192 NT30 NT53 or S \u2192 NT35 NT45.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 has three production rules: NT30 \u2192 't90', 't53', 't14'. Wait, no. Wait, I think each production is a rule, but in the way the problem is presented, each 'NT<something> \u2192 <something else> or a terminal'\u2014 but wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so it can only have two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal or a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C, etc., are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules: for example, NT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11, which is two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 NT1 NT25, which is allowed. NT35 \u2192 NT15 NT1, ok. NT53 \u2192 't7', which is a single terminal, but wait, that's problematic because in CNF, A must produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So A \u2192 a is allowed, yes, that's correct. So, NT53 \u2192 't7' is allowed, because that's a single terminal.\n\nWait a moment, but looking at the rules, there are rules like NT30 \u2192 't90' which would mean A can produce a single terminal. Alternatively, NT30 might also produce other combinations. Wait, yes.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, there are overlapping productions. For example, NT30 has multiple rules: NT30 \u2192 't90' is a rule, another rule is NT30 \u2192 't53', and another is NT30 \u2192 't14'. This seems conflicting because how can NT30 be 't90' as well as 't53'? So perhaps it's a mistake, but perhaps each rule represents a different path.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because a non-terminal can only produce one string. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the rules. Looking again, the way the problem states the grammar, each line is a production, and a non-terminal can have multiple right-hand sides. So for example, NT30 can be replaced by 't90' or 't53' or 't14', meaning that each of those is a production.\n\nSo, for example, NT30 can be 't90', 't53', or 't14', which is non-standard because in Chomsky Normal Form, a non-terminal should derive either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, that can't be because some rules like NT30 \u2192 't90' would be allowed as a single terminal, but the other rules like NT30 \u2192 NT30 something would require that NT30 has multiple productions.\n\nWait, but the initial S is in CNF, which implies each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to check if all non-terminals only have productions that are in CNF.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT53: this is a production with two non-terminals on the right, which is allowed.\n\nS \u2192 NT35 NT45: same.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT53 NT11: two non-terminals on the right.\n\nNT15"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
