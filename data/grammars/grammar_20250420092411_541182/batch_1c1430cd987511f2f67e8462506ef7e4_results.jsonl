The grammar has various non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT89, etc.) and terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). The string to evaluate is `t157`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It seems like each non-terminal can be broken down into two other non-terminals or sometimes directly into a terminal. The Chomsky normal form means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some NT15 rules branch into different combinations. For example, NT15 can produce NT75 NT57, which themselves might have their own branches. The terminals are all `t` followed by a number, so each terminal is a single character.\n\nThe string given is `t157`, which is a single terminal symbol, specifically 157. So, for the grammar to generate `t157`, there must be a production that directly outputs `t157`, or a series of productions that expand into `t157`.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see several that end with terminals. For instance, NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, and some of these have direct terminals. However, none of the productions seem to directly produce `t157`. Instead, they often split into two non-terminals which then further split or produce other terminals.\n\nI also notice that some non-terminals have multiple productions, sometimes with the same left-hand side but different right-hand sides. For example, NT96 can produce NT33 NT36 or NT1 NT108. But none of these produce `t157`.\n\nAlso, some terminals like 't157' are mentioned in the grammar, but looking at the productions, I don't see any rule that directly results in `t157`. Instead, the terminal symbols are like `t24`, `t17`, etc., and it seems like the grammar doesn't have a production that directly outputs `t157`. \n\nSo, without a production that directly or indirectly leads to `t157`, the grammar can't generate that string.

{"custom_id":"request-9","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t99` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That makes parsing a bit tricky, but maybe I can find the rules that lead to `t99`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a lot of rules ending with 't' followed by numbers. The terminal symbols seem to be things like 't24', 't26', 't29', etc. Each of these is a specific terminal, so I need to backtrack to see if any of these lead to `t99`.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see a few that directly produce 't99':\n- `NT99 -> NT6 NT103`: Wait, no, that doesn't help because it's not directly 't99'.\n- `NT19 -> NT74 NT46`: Hmm, but `NT19 -> 't99'`. Oh, right! So `NT19` directly produces `t99`.\n- Another rule: `NT84 -> NT68 NT11`, but `NT11` leads to 't17', which doesn't connect to `t99`.\n- `NT89 -> NT61 NT76`, but those don't lead to `t99`.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. Oh, wait, I see that `NT19 -> 't99'`. So if I can derive `NT19` from the start symbol, then `t99` is generated.\n\nSo the question is, can the start symbol `S` derive `NT19`? The start symbol is `S`, which goes to `NT99 NT89`. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nNow, looking at `NT99` and `NT89`:\n\n- `NT99` can go to `NT6 NT103`, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, does any of these NTs lead to `NT19`?\n\nWait, let me see if any other rules produce `NT19`. Looking through the rules, I think `NT19` might only be produced by one rule: `NT19 -> 't99'`. So, to get `t99`, I need to derive `NT19` somehow from `S`.\n\nSo, starting from `S`, which is `S \u2192 NT99 NT89`, maybe one of these can derive `NT19`.\n\nLooking at NT99: possible rules are `NT99 -> NT6 NT103` and others that might eventually lead to a terminal. Similarly, `NT89` can go to several options. Let's see:\n\nNT89 can go to `NT61 NT76`. Then, NT61 can go to `NT74 NT44`, which could go to some other NTs. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at NT1, which is part of the string `t17` and others. Maybe NT1 can connect somewhere, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the production chain needs to reach `NT19`. Let me see if any rules lead to `NT19`.\n\nLooking through all the rules, only `NT19 -> 't99'` is present. So, to produce `t99`, we need to derive `NT19`.\n\nNow, starting from `S`, which goes to `NT99 NT89`. Let's see how to get `NT19` from either `NT99` or `NT89`.\n\nLooking at `NT99`, let's see its rules:\n\n- `NT99 -> NT6 NT103`\n- `NT99 -> NT6 NT103` again.\nWait, looking back, `NT99` has the rule `NT99 -> NT6 NT103`. So that's one possible step. But does that lead us closer to `NT19`?\n\nFrom `NT6`, which has a rule: `NT6 -> 't108'` and `NT68 -> 't145'`. Hmm, not helpful for `NT19`.\n\nLooking at `NT89`, which has:\n\n- `NT89 -> NT61 NT76`\n- `NT61 -> NT74 NT44`\n- `NT44 -> NT42 NT88`\n- `NT88 -> NT88'...' No, wait, let me list the rules properly.\n\nLooking at `NT89 -> NT61 NT76`. Then, `NT61 -> NT74 NT44`. Then, `NT74 -> 't100'` and `NT44 -> NT42 NT88`. I'm getting stuck here; this path doesn't seem helpful for getting to `NT19`.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see another path: looking at `NT1`, which can go to `t17`. But that's a dead end.\n\nWait, another rule: `NT107 -> 't174'` and others, but that doesn't connect.\n\nWait, going back to `NT99` and `NT89`. Maybe another approach: looking at NT52, since its rules include `NT52 -> NT28 NT70` and others. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since `S` must produce `t99`, which is directly from `NT19`. So, can `S` derive `NT19`?\n\nLooking at the productions, `S` is NT99 NT89. So unless one of these can be rewritten as NT19, it's not possible. Looking at NT99, does it produce something that leads to NT19? Let me check the productions for NT99:\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT99 are `NT99 -> NT6 NT103` only. It doesn't have a production to NT19. Similarly, NT89's productions don't seem to lead to NT19 either.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to derive NT19 from NT99 or NT89 through multiple steps. Let me think.\n\nFor example, can NT6 lead to NT19? Let's look at NT6's productions:\n\n- `NT6 -> 't108'`\n- `NT68 -> 't145'` but that's a different NT.\nNo, so NT6 cannot go to NT19.\n\nWhat about NT103? Let's see. Looking through NT103's rules, does it lead to NT19?\n\nNT103's productions: I see one rule: `NT93 -> NT65 NT71`, and others like `NT103 -> 't101'`. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe NT19 is a child of a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps NT91 goes to NT9, which is 't134' and others. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at `NT23` rules, maybe not.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. The only way to produce `t99` is via `NT19`, but from the start symbol `S`, which produces `NT99` and `NT89`, I don't see a way to get `NT19`. Unless there's a production I missed.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the NT rules, `NT19` has the rule: NT19 -> 't99'. So it's a direct production. To derive `t99`, the NT19 must be derived from S somehow.\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nSo, if NT99 or NT89 can derive NT19, then it's possible. Let me see if any of them can.\n\nLooking at NT99, it produces `NT6 NT103` and other rules. But none of these seem to lead to NT19.\n\nLooking at NT89, it can produce NT61 NT76. Let's look at NT61:\n\nNT61 -> NT74 NT44\n\nThen, NT74 -> 't100' and NT44 -> NT42 NT88\n\nNT42 -> NT16 NT88\n\nWait, this seems to be going into a loop or producing non-NT19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a rule. Let's see if any other NT leads to NT19.\n\nLooking at NT15: `NT15 -> NT21 NT9`. Does that help? Not directly.\n\nWait, looking back, NT19's production is only to `t99`. So unless S can derive NT19, we can't produce `t99`.\n\nSo, can S derive NT19? Let's see: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Both of these are complex NTs. Let's see if any of their productions lead to NT19.\n\nLooking at NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string should start with either NT99 or NT89. But in our case, the first part is `t96`, which isn't directly matching. Wait, maybe NT99 or NT89 can be broken down further.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals can be replaced with a combination of other non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT96 is defined as NT33 NT36, which can be further broken down. But I'm given `t96`, which is a terminal.

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's look for a production that directly leads to `t96`. Scanning through the rules, I see NT96 \u2192 NT105. No, that's NT96 \u2192 NT105. Then NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT65. Hmm, that's still non-terminals. Then NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, and so on. This seems like it's going deeper, but I'm not reaching a terminal yet.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT96 has another rule: NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108. Hmm, but that's also non-terminals. Maybe I'm missing a rule where NT96 directly gives a terminal. Let me check again. Oh, wait, I see NT96 \u2192 't91' in one of the rules. Hmm, no, that doesn't match either.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules more carefully. I see NT96 appears in two places: NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 and NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108. Wait, no, looking again, I think I may have misread. Let me list all NT96 rules:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it says:\n\nNT96 -> NT33 NT36\nNT96 -> NT1 NT108\n\nNo, wait, I might have miscounted. Let me scan the provided rules again.\n\nAh! I see: \"NT96 -> NT33 NT36\" and \"NT96 -> NT1 NT108\". Wait, but in the rules given, I also see \"NT96 -> 't118'\". Oh! Yes, there's a rule where NT96 directly produces 't118'. So NT96 \u2192 't118'. Similarly, other non-terminals have such direct terminal productions.\n\nSo for `t96`, we can see if any non-terminal directly produces 't96'. Looking through the rules, I see NT96 is the only one with 't96' in it. Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 and also NT96 \u2192 't118'.\n\nBut in the string, it's `t96`, not `t118`. So that's a problem. Unless I'm missing another path. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nOh, I see \"NT96 \u2192 't118'\" but also \"NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\". So NT96 can be `t118` or a combination of other non-terminals. So if the string has `t96`, that's different from `t118`, so that path doesn't work. So how else could `t96` be formed?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me check if there's another NT that can produce `t96`. Or perhaps I have a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, the string is `t96 t123`. So the first part is `t96`, which must come from a production that leads to `t96`. Looking through the rules, only NT96 has a direct terminal production, and that's `t118`. There's no rule where NTxx produces `t96` directly. So unless I'm missing something, this seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let's think again: the start symbol is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the first symbol generated would be either NT99 or NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99's rules, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So starting with NT99, it would go to NT6 and NT103.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t96`, so that would require that NT99 or NT89 eventually leads to `t96`. Let's see: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nNT6 is defined as NT108, and NT108 \u2192 't118'. So NT99 would lead to NT108 and NT103. Wait, NT103 is another non-terminal. Let me check its rules: NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45.\n\nSo from NT99, we go to NT6 (which is NT108 \u2192 't118') and NT103 (which is NT24 and NT45). NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, and so on. This doesn't seem to get me to `t96`. Alternatively, starting with NT89.\n\nNT89 has a rule NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. So from NT89, it would go to NT44 and NT1.\n\nNT44 is defined as NT24 and NT88, and NT88 leads to 't141'. NT44 would then be NT24 (which goes to NT54 and NT65) and NT141. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. If `t96` is part of the string, maybe it's via a leftmost derivation. Let's see if any of the non-terminals can produce `t96`.\n\nLooking at the rules again, I see NT96 \u2192 't118' and NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36. So to get `t96`, we'd have to have a path where a non-terminal leads to `t96`, but none of the rules for NT* have `t96` as a terminal except for NT96's rule, which leads to 't118'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check each NT rule for terminals:\n\nAnother look:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't68', 't103'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134'\n- NT44 \u2192 't165'\n- NT33 \u2192 't23'\n- NT80 \u2192 't67', 't73'\n- NT40 \u2192 't39', 't35'\n- NT95 \u2192 't130'\n- NT52 \u2192 't177'\n- NT77 \u2192 't124'\n- NT49 \u2192 't115'\n- NT90 \u2192 't154'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69', 't171'\n- NT76 \u2192 't121'\n- NT95 \u2192 't130'\n- NT61 \u2192 't84', 't71'\n- NT73 \u2192 't90'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT40 \u2192 't33', 't64'\n- NT92 \u2192 't74', 't18'\n- NT61 \u2192 't7', 't92'\n- NT93 \u2192 't170'\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT23 \u2192 't156'\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT88 \u2192 't141'\n- NT45 \u2192 't98'\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT15 \u2192 't154'\n- NT7 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string in question is \"t24 t49\". Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It starts with S -> NT99 NT89, which means the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. So, to get any string, it must eventually derive into these, and from there, possibly other non-terminals, until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers here. Each terminal is represented as 't' followed by a number, like 't24', so I need to see if the grammar can produce '24' and '49' as separate strings.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that many of them are of the form NTxy -> NTxa NTxb. These seem to split the non-terminals into two parts. Each of these can possibly be expanded recursively until they reach a terminal.\n\nLet me focus on NT24 and NT49 because those correspond to our target tokens 't24' and 't49'. I don't have a production rule that directly produces 't24' or 't49', so I need to see if they can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that NT24 -> t123. Wait, that's a terminal? Let me confirm. Yes, under NT24, it's represented as 't123'. Similarly, NT49 is a terminal 't115'.\n\nBut wait, in the string we need to analyze, it's \"t24 t49\". So, if NT24 can produce 't24' and NT49 can produce 't49', then the derivation S -> NT99 NT89 would need to eventually produce t24 and t49.\n\nBut looking at the rules for NT99 and NT89, do they ever directly produce 't24' or 't49'? Let me check:\n\n- NT99: under its rules, I see NT99 -> NT6 NT103, NT99 -> NT61 NT76, etc. None of these directly produce 't24' or 't49'. So, how do they get to those terminals?\n\nWait, looking further down, I see NT6 -> 't108' and NT49 -> 't115'. So NT49 is t115, but that's not matching the string. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me list the rules for NT24 and NT49 to see if they produce their respective terminals.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT24 -> t123. So for NT24, the production is directly 't123', which would correspond to 't123', not 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, NT49 -> t115. So NT49 produces 't115'.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't24' and 't49'. That would correspond to NT24 -> t24 and NT49 -> t49. But according to the provided rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t24 or t49. The closest is NT40 -> NT33 NT64, and so on. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, NT24 is present in some production rules. For example, NT74 -> NT16 NT74? Hmm, no. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT24 producing anything except t123. So how does NT24 ever reach 't24'? It seems like the NT24 might not be able to produce that unless I have a rule I'm missing.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again. Under NT24, it's only t123. There's no other production for NT24. So how can we get 't24' if NT24 only produces 't123'?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the string \"t24 t49\" cannot be derived from the grammar because NT24 cannot produce 't24'. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's think again. The string is \"t24 t49\", which consists of two tokens: 't24' and 't49'. Each token would need to be derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to the corresponding t.\n\nSo, for 't24', it would have to come from NT24, which according to the rules is a terminal 't123', meaning that NT24 cannot produce 't24' directly. So, unless there's a rule elsewhere that I'm missing which allows NT24 to produce 't24', it's not possible.\n\nAlso, looking at NT49, it only produces 't115', so 't49' can't come from NT49 either.\n\nSo, both 't24' and 't49' are not directly produced by any NT in the given rules. Therefore, the given string cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-26","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the string \"t101 t36 t67\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, first, I should probably recall how context-free grammars work, especially in Chomsky normal form. From what I remember, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems mostly follows this structure, except some terminals are represented with specific mappings. For example, I see that NT15 becomes 't90', NT31 becomes 't34', etc. So each non-terminal resolves to either a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nThe target string is \"t101 t36 t67\". Since this has three tokens, I need to see if the grammar can produce a string with exactly three symbols. Each step in the derivation should increase the number of symbols by one due to the productions, but I'm not sure about the exact steps. Maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down into the possible terminal productions.\n\nLet me break down each token:\n\n1. t101: I don't see an NT rule that directly produces t101. Maybe it's derived through a chain of steps? Or perhaps it's a high-level NT that eventually maps to t101.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for which NT produces t101. Checking the mappings, I don't see any line that says NTsomething \u2192 t101. Let's see the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't123'\nNT48 -> 't11'\nNT2-> 't26'\nNT77 -> 't56'\nNT6 -> 't108'\nNT33 -> 't23'\nNT67-> 't67' (is this a rule or a mapping?) Wait, looking closer, it's a production: NT67 -> 't67'. So NT67 is a terminal, but in the string we have t67. Wait, no, the string has t67, so maybe NT67 is present in the grammar. Wait, let me check if 't67' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the mappings, I see lines like NT67 -> 't67', so yes, NT67 is directly mapped to 't67'. So t67 is part of the string, and it's produced by NT67 directly. So the string includes t67.\n\nSimilarly, t36 is another token. Looking for NT mappings that produce t36. Scanning the list, I see:\n\nNT68 -> 't45 NT71' I think. Wait, looking at the grammar, the rules for some NTs:\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me list all NTs and their productions. The grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89. Each NT has specific productions. For example, NT99 is defined as NT6 NT103, and NT103 might go further. But perhaps it's easier to see if each token can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should trace backward from the string to see if it's possible.\n\nThe string is three tokens: t101, t36, t67. Let's consider each token as a terminal symbol. For this, each must be produced directly by some NT production (i.e., the rule is A \u2192 x, where x is a terminal). So I need to check if each token is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT67 -> 't67' \u21d2 t67 is a terminal.\n- Any others? Let's see: NT24 -> 't123', so t123 is a terminal.\n- NT2 -> 't26'\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT36: Is there a rule like NT36 -> 't36'? No, looking through the grammar, I don't see such a production. Wait, perhaps NT36 is derived through other steps. For example, NT36 might produce another non-terminal, which then produces a t36. Or maybe it's not possible, so the string would include t36 if there's a production rule for NT36 to t36.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any direct productions that produce t36. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking at each NT rule:\n\n- NT68: 't45' (Wait, actually, some NTs might combine two terminals. For example, in the grammar, I see NT68 -> NT45 NT71. But that's an internal production, leading to non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each token:\n\nt101: Is there a rule where some NT directly maps to t101? Looking through the list, I don't see any rule that produces t101 as a terminal. So it must be produced by a series of steps. Let me see if any NT can eventually derive t101.\n\nSimilarly, t36: No direct rule for t36. So t36 must come from a longer chain.\n\nt67: There is a rule NT67 -> 't67', so that one is straightforward.\n\nBut for t101 and t36, we need to see if the grammar can produce these as terminals. Since they're not directly mapped, t101 and t36 must be the result of longer derivations.\n\nLet me check for t101. Looking through the rules to see if any NT produces 't101' directly or indirectly.\n\nLooking at the list of NT productions:\n\nNo NT is directly assigned to t101. So t101 must be the result of a non-terminal expanding into several steps. Let me see if any NT production leads to t101.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT106: productions are NT35 NT107, NT7 NT92, NT71 NT92, NT35 NT107 again, etc.\nWait, no, looking closely:\n\nThe lines for NT106 are:\n\nNT106 -> NT35 NT107\nNT106 -> NT7 NT92\nNT106 -> NT74 NT18\n\nNone of these produce a terminal. So if t101 is part of the string, the NT that eventually becomes it must have a production where it leads to t101.\n\nLooking for any NT where a rule leads to t101. Scanning the rules again.\n\nI don't see any NT whose rule is A \u2192 t101. So t101 must be produced by some intermediate steps.\n\nWait, no NT is directly producing t101, so it must come from a combination of non-terminals. Let me see if any NT leads to a production that can include t101.\n\nFor example, suppose an NT has a rule that has a terminal and another non-terminal, and through that, t101 gets included.\n\nFor example, if NTsomething expands to NTabc where abc includes t101.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT73 has a rule:\n\nNT73 -> NT60 NT24\n\nBut NT24 maps to 't123', so in that case, is NT73's rule leading to a string that includes t123? Yes, if the NTs further produce their own terminals or non-terminals, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to find a path for each token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the overall structure of the productions.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S -> NT99 NT89. So the entire string must be derived from two NTs, each producing sequences of symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nThe input string is three symbols, so in the derivation, the two NTs must produce three symbols each, but no, that would make six symbols, which doesn't match. Or maybe one NT produces one symbol and the other produces two.\n\nWait, no: S is splitting into two NTs, each of which must expand into some number of symbols, and the total number of symbols in the string is the sum of the symbols from each NT. Since the string is three, perhaps each NT produces one and two symbols respectively, such as the first NT producing t101 and the second producing t36 t67, or any combination that adds up to three.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me consider that the string is three symbols, so the derivation from S must produce three symbols. Each NT in the two initial splits must produce a number of symbols adding up to three. Let's see: S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so each of these NTs, when fully expanded, must produce a certain number of symbols. Let's denote the number of symbols each NT contributes as n1 and n2. So n1 + n2 = 3.\n\nPossible options are (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), etc. But in reality, each NT must produce at least one symbol. So possibilities are (1,2), (2,1).\n\nSo, for example, if NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-22","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the string \"t172 t96 t144\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the final terminals. The starting symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So, S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, it's three tokens separated by spaces: \"t172\", \"t96\", and \"t144\". Each of these looks like a terminal symbol because they contain 't' followed by numbers, except for possible number with multiple digits. But from the grammar's production rules, I can see that many terminals are represented as 't' followed by a two-digit number, like t172, t96, t144.\n\nNow, I need to check if these terminals can be generated by this grammar. Let's start by looking at each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals might derive to them.\n\nStarting with \"t172\". Looking through the production rules, I see NT57 produces t172. So NT57 \u2192 t172.\n\nNext, \"t96\". Let's check the grammar. I see NT96 \u2192 t91, and NT106 \u2192 t35, but wait, nowhere do I see a direct rule for NT96 to produce t96. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me double-check. The rules under NT96 are: NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 and NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108. There doesn't seem to be a production for NT96 that directly gives t96. Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me scan through all NT96 rules. No, it seems they don't produce t96. Perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe there's another way. Let's check the rule NT108: no, NT108 isn't in the rules either. Hmm, maybe \"t96\" isn't directly produced by any single NT. Or did I miss it?\n\nWait, maybe I should check all NT96 productions. Yes, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\n\nThat's it. So no production for NT96 \u2192 t96. Hmm, that's a problem. So how does t96 get generated then?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t96\" is generated by another NT. Let me check NT34: no, that's not in the grammar. Wait, let's check NT34 in the given rules... Oh, I see NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23, and NT23 \u2192 NT40 NT107. Hmm, maybe via a more complex derivation. Let me see: If NT96 can only produce two other non-terminals, and none directly produce t96, then how can t96 appear in the string? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. Are all the NTs in the rules correctly listed? Let me check NT96:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT96, the productions are:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\n\nSo, neither of these produce t96. That's odd. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the NTs again.\n\nWait, under NT106, I see:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92\n- NT106 \u2192 NT24 NT45\n- NT106 \u2192 NT91 NT69\n- Etc.\n\nWait, I see NT91 \u2192 't164', which is not t96. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs that can produce t96 are elsewhere. Let me check NT6, for example. Under NT6, there's a rule: NT6 \u2192 t108. Wait, that's t108, not t96. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all NTs that have rules with numbers:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129'. NT24 has some, NT42 has some, etc. Hmm. Maybe t96 is under NT11 -> 't17'. Wait, that's t17, not 96. Alternatively, NT95 \u2192 't130', but that's t130, not 96.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think differently. Maybe I can backtrack from t172, t96, t144.\n\nLet's start with t172. As I saw earlier, NT57 \u2192 t172. So, NT57 is an intermediate that must produce t172.\n\nThen, going up to the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, both NT99 and NT89 must be derived from parts of the string.\n\nWait, the string is t172 t96 t144, which is three tokens. So, the overall structure must be that S \u2192 NT99 NT89, each NT99 and NT89 generating their own substrings. But the string is a concatenation of three tokens. Hmm, this might not align because S is a two-part expansion. So perhaps the string needs to be split into two parts, each generated by NT99 and NT89. But the given string has three tokens, so that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me try to represent each token as a derived non-terminal.\n\nSo, the string is [t172][t96][t144]. That's three tokens. But the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which is two non-terminals. So, the generated string should consist of two parts. How can three tokens emerge from that? Maybe one of the NTs expands further than the other.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the NTs in S's production splits into more parts, but that would require the NTs to produce more than just one terminal. But in this grammar, each terminal is a single token. So, maybe the three tokens are a result of NT99 expanding into two tokens and NT89 expanding into one token, but that's not possible because the NTs in the grammar have fixed number of symbols in their production. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT99 and NT89 can produce more than one token, but in this case, the string is three tokens, so one NT must produce two tokens and the other produces one. Let me check the possible expansions.\n\nLooking at NT99: The rule is NT99 \u2192 't154'. So directly, it's a single terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So, if both NT99 and NT89 produce a single terminal each, the overall string would be two tokens. But here, it's three tokens, so that's a problem. Unless one of them produces multiple tokens.\n\nBut looking at NT57, which is part of S's children, produces t172. Wait, no, S is nt99 and nt89, which have their own productions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me try building the derivation.\n\nThe string is t172 t96 t144. Let's split it into three parts. Since S \u2192 NT99 NT89, each NT99 and NT89 needs to generate their own strings. But the overall string is three tokens, implying that one of them must produce two tokens and the other one, but in the grammar, every non-terminal's production is either two symbols or a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT57 \u2192 t172, which is one terminal. So that's fine. Let me see if any NT is capable of producing two terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, many NTs produce two non-terminals, but none seem to produce two terminals. The only terminals are t's with numbers, so each term is directly a single terminal.\n\nSo if the grammar requires that each step is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals, how can a single NT produce more than one terminal? It can't, unless by some production rule. So, for example, if a non-terminal N \u2192 A B, then the two symbols A and B must both be either non-terminals or terminals. If both are terminals, then N produces two terminals, which is not the case in this grammar because all the NTs have only terminals or two NTs.\n\nWait, looking again, for example, NT96: its rules are NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36. So that's two non-terminals. So it can only produce two non-terminals, which are then expanded further.\n\nWait, but then to get three"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since I'm a bit new to this, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's all in Chomsky normal form, meaning each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. But wait, some rules like NT1 -> NT107 NT17 end with terminal symbols directly. Oh, right, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so maybe these are considered in a way that each terminal is a single symbol. Or perhaps some rules are mixed, but the presence of terminals might complicate things.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some production rules have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT7 -> NT21 NT9 would be a production with two non-terminals, but others like NT7 -> 't24' have a terminal. This might mean that the grammar is actually in a modified form, maybe right-regular or something else. Hmm, but the problem says it's in Chomsky normal form, which by definition only allows two non-terminals on the RHS. So perhaps only non-terminals are present, but here we see terminals as part of the productions. Maybe the terminals are part of the start symbol? Or maybe I need to represent them as terminal symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals first. Let me see the rules:\n\nNT1 -> NT107 NT17\n...\nNT29 -> 't36'\nNT29 -> 't156'\nNT24 -> 't123'\n...\nNT12 -> 't80'\n...\nOther terminals include 't63', 't45', 't96', 't104', etc.\n\nSo each terminal is a single token. Now, the string to check is \"t63 t45 t96 t104\". So each 't' followed by a number is a separate terminal symbol.\n\nI think I need to parse this string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe initial string is a sequence of four terminals: t63, t45, t96, t104. I need to see if this can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S -> NT99 NT89. So S can generate NT99 NT89, which are two non-terminals. Each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nLet me see what NT99 and NT89 can produce. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT99: I see NT99 -> NT104 NT23 and NT99 -> NT6 NT103. Also, other rules like NT76 -> 't178', but that's a terminal. Wait, let's check the rules:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103\nAlso, perhaps looking for NT96: From the rules, NT96 -> NT33 NT36. Wait, NT96 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string is t63, which is 't63'. Looking back through the rules, I find NT63. Wait, no. The grammar doesn't have NT63 as a non-terminal; instead, we have NT48 -> NT68 NT24, etc. Wait, I think I should list all the non-terminals to understand the structure.\n\nLet me make a list of all non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, non-terminals are:\nS, NT1, NT7, NT9, NT10, NT15, NT17, NT21, NT22, NT23, NT24, NT28, NT29, NT33, NT35, NT39, NT40, NT42, NT43, NT44, NT45, NT46, NT48, NT49, NT52, NT54, NT55, NT57, NT61, NT65, NT68, NT69, NT71, NT73, NT74, NT75, NT76, NT77, NT79, NT80, NT81, NT82, NT83, NT84, NT85, NT86, NT87, NT88, NT89, NT90, NT91, NT92, NT93, NT94, NT95, NT96, NT97, NT98, NT99, NT100, NT102, NT104, NT106, NT107, NT108, NT109, NT110, NT111, etc. Hmm, perhaps a total of around 50 non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string is t63, t45, t96, t104. I need to see how these might be generated.\n\nStart by expanding S:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nSo the string will be: production of NT99 followed by production of NT89.\n\nEach of these needs to be expanded into sequences of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLet me handle NT99 first.\n\nLooking up NT99:\n\nNT99 has two productions:\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT99 -> NT104 NT23\n\nI need to find a way to get t63 from these. Let's see if NT6 or NT103 can produce t63.\n\nLooking at NT6: The rules for NT6 are:\n\nNT68 -> NT67 NT73\nNT68 -> NT28 NT12\nNT68 -> 't134' (from the rules, but wait no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT68 has rules like NT68 -> 't63', yes. So NT68 -> 't63' (assuming 't63' is a terminal). So how does NT68 get to t63.\n\nSo if in NT99, one of the options is NT6, then NT6 would expand into NT68 and NT73, which in turn might lead to t63.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf NT99 is expanded into NT6 NT103, then NT6 and NT103 need to produce t63, t45, etc.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to get t63, which is the first token. So perhaps NT99 -> NT6 NT103, where NT6 expands to something that produces t63.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6's rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT68 NT73\n\nWait, but NT68 has a production that results in 't63' as a terminal. So for NT68 -> 't63', that's a direct production.\n\nSo, the derivation for t63 could be:\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103\n\nNT6 -> NT68 NT73\n\nNT68 -> 't63'\n\nBut wait, then NT103 would need to produce the remaining terminals: t45, t96, t104. But I'm not sure what NT103 does. Looking at the rules:\n\nSearching for NT103:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103\nAlso, NT99 -> NT68 NT103.\n\nWait, no, I'm looking at the grammar, and I see:\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103\nBut also, in other rules like NT68 -> 't67' (no), wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT52 -> NT107 NT81\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try again. Let's check NT103.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT103 is mentioned in:\n\nLooking: NT68 -> NT45 NT71\n\nNo, not directly. Wait, in the rules, I don't see a direct NT103. Let me check again. Scrolling through all the rules:\n\nLooking for NT103, I see it as a non-terminal? Or a terminal? I think a terminal would be something like 't103' but that's not in the list. In the given grammar, terminals are listed as 't' followed by a number, like 't63', 't45', etc.\n\nWait, looking again through the grammar, I see NT103 in the rule:\n\nNT68 -> NT45 NT71\n\nBut 't45' is a terminal. Wait, that's a terminal. So 't45' is NT45.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar uses 't' as a way to denote terminals. So in the rules, NT45 -> 't45' would mean that NT45 produces the terminal 't45'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals produce either other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT45 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the string `t90 t49 t51 t110` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice that it starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the start symbol S generates two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals seems to have their own productions, leading down to terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t90 t49 t51 t110`. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Let's break the string down and see how it might fit.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how each 't' part might be generated. From the grammar rules, I see that some productions end with terminals like 't71', 't94', etc. That suggests that some non-terminals produce these specific strings.\n\nFor example:\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9 \u2192 NT21 produces 't171', and NT9 produces 't41'. Wait, but in the string, I see 't90', which I don't immediately see in the productions. Hmm.\n- Wait, looking at the rules, NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9. NT21 \u2192 't171' and NT9 \u2192 't41'. So NT7 would produce 't174' (since 171 followed by 41 would be '174' if concatenated, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Or maybe NT9 outputs 't41', so NT7 would be 't171 t41' or 't174' as a single string? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, in the given grammar, some NTs produce 't' strings. For instance, NT15 \u2192 't90', which is exactly one of the rules: `NT15 -> 't90'`. So maybe NT15 is directly producing 't90'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT15 -> 't90'\n- NT7 -> NT21 NT9\n- NT9 -> 't41'\n- So, NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9 \u2192 't171' 't41', which would be '171 41' as a combined string, but I don't see that in the given string. Hmm.\n\nWait, the string is `t90 t49 t51 t110`. So perhaps the first 't90' comes from NT15. Then, how can the rest fit?\n\nLooking for the production of NT99 and NT89. The start is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So perhaps the string is derived starting with NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99, I see in the rules that NT99 \u2192 't6 NT103' or other productions. Let me check all NT99 rules:\n- NT99 \u2192 't6 NT103'\n- Are there others? Let me scan: yes, no, seems like only that. Wait, no, looking through all the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 't6 NT103' and NT99 also appears in some other productions? Wait, no, in the rules, I only see NT99 \u2192 't6 NT103'. So NT99 can only produce '6' followed by NT103's result.\n\nWait, no, checking the rules again, I see:\n\nLooking at all the grammar rules:\n- NT99 \u2192 't6 NT103'\n- That's the only production for NT99.\n\nSo NT99 will produce 't6' followed by what NT103 produces.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT89:\n\nNT89 is present in the initial production as S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so NT89 must generate part of the string.\n\nLooking for NT89's productions. I see:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 't61 NT76'\n- Also, I see in some other productions like `NT89 -> 't94'` but wait, no, looking through all rules:\n\nWait, I need to list all rules under NT89. Looking at the rules:\n\nNo, in the given grammar, the only rule for NT89 is in the initial S production and perhaps others. Wait, checking the grammar, I see: `NT89 -> 't61 NT76'`. Also, looking further, is there any other rule for NT89? Let me check all lines after S is mentioned.\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT40 is followed by NT39 and others.\n- NT16,29 etc., but for NT89, only one production: NT89 \u2192 't61 NT76'.\n\nWait, no. Checking all lines, I see NT89 appears only once in the initial S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and no other productions. So NT89 only \u2192 't61 NT76'.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Did I miss any? Let me go through each line carefully.\n\nLine by line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT89\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\n- NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n- NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n- NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\n- ... and many more.\n\nWait, looking at all NT89 rules:\n\nOnly one rule: `NT89 -> 't61 NT76'`. So NT89 produces 't61' followed by whatever NT76 produces. Then, NT76 \u2192 't124' as per my earlier note. So NT89 would produce 't61 t124'.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after the first 't90', we have 't49', which doesn't immediately fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. In the CNF, each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which means S generates NT99 followed by NT89. So the entire string would be the concatenation of NT99's derivation and NT89's derivation.\n\nSo the first part, NT99, generates a string, and the second part, NT89, generates another string, and the entire string is their concatenation.\n\nIn the given string, `t90 t49 t51 t110`, we can split it into two parts: the first two symbols and the next two. Maybe NT99 produces the first two symbols, and NT89 produces the last two.\n\nWait, but NT99 produces 't6' followed by NT103's result. So perhaps NT103 produces 't94', making NT99 produce 't6 t94' (i.e., '694'). But the string starts with 't90', which would not fit that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT99 \u2192 't6 NT103' to mean 't6' concatenated with NT103's symbols. So if NT103 produces 't94', then NT99 \u2192 't6 t94' \u2192 '694', which doesn't match the given string's first part 't90'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT99 \u2192 't90' because NT99 has another production? Wait, looking at the rules again, I think NT99's only production is \u2192 't6 NT103' unless I missed something.\n\nWait, checking all lines again:\n\nWait, under NT99, the only rule is `NT99 -> 't6 NT103'`. There's no other production. So that suggests that NT99 can only produce 't6' followed by NT103's output. So the first part of the string should start with '6'.\n\nBut the given string starts with '90', which would correspond to NT15 producing 't90' (since `NT15 -> 't90'`). So maybe the string is trying to use NT15 and some others, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the string is `t90 t49 t51 t110`. Let me list them as tokens: 't90', 't49', 't51', 't110'.\n\nSo perhaps the overall structure is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. NT99 generates 't90' and NT89 generates the rest.

{"custom_id":"request-59","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string provided is `t69 t170 t104 t134 t90`. The grammar is pretty long, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. That might help because I can think in terms of the productions leading to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t69, t170, t104, t134, t90. Since the string has 5 symbols, the derivation must start from the start symbol S and split into two, then each of those could split further until we get down to five terminals with no non-terminals left.\n\nLet me start from the top. The start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S splits into NT99 and NT89.\n\nNow, each of these NTs will produce more symbols. Let's look at NT99. The productions for NT99 are not listed, so I need to check if there's a production that directly ends with t90 because the last symbol in the string is t90. Wait, no, looking back, I see NT99 has a production: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Hmm, that's two NTs.\n\nNT6 is another non-terminal. Looking up its productions, NT6 \u2192 NT108. So that's another split. But NT108 doesn't seem to produce a terminal. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT108 has a production: NT108 \u2192 NT65. So NT108 splits into NT65, which itself splits into NT15 (NT65 \u2192 NT15 NT77) and so on.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string ends with t90, I should find if any NT directly produces t90. Looking through the productions, I see NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64, and I don't see NT40 \u2192 t90. Wait, actually, looking again, I see NT71 \u2192 NT69. Oh, that's useful.\n\nWait, let me check. The production NT71 can produce NT69. So if somewhere in the derivation, we have NT71, it can split into NT69, which then perhaps leads to t90? Or maybe not. Let me look for t90.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the only place where a terminal appears that could be t90 is in NT9's production: NT9 \u2192 't26' (from NT9 \u2192 NT17). But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the string and see which symbols can be directly derived. The string is `t69 t170 t104 t134 t90`.\n\nWait, t69 comes from NT71 because looking at the productions, NT71 \u2192 NT69. Then NT69 \u2192 't134' according to one of the productions: NT69 \u2192 t133. Wait, actually, looking again: NT69 is not an NT but actually has a production NT69 \u2192 't134' because in the data, there's NT69 \u2192 t133? Wait, no, let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT9 \u2192 't26', NT29 \u2192 't156', NT29 \u2192 't129', etc. Wait, but the string has t69, so I need to find if any NT produces t69. Looking at the productions, I see NT74 \u2192 't146', but not NT69. Wait, wait, in the data, looking for where a production results in 't'...\n\nLooking through, I find NT9 \u2192 't26', NT11 \u2192 't17', NT28 \u2192 't76', NT57 \u2192 't172', NT79? No, not t69. Wait, looking at the grammar, I notice that NT69 is a non-terminal, but does it produce a terminal? Looking back, I don't see any production for NT69 that ends with a terminal. So perhaps t69 must come from an NT that directly produces it.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, looking for 't69', I see that NT69 \u2192 't68' (no, wait, looking carefully, the data shows NT69 \u2192 t134, etc. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking through the productions, I see something like NT29 \u2192 't156', but I don't see any NT that directly produces t69. Hmm, so that's a problem. If t69 is in the string, but the grammar doesn't have a production that produces t69, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. But wait, let me double-check because maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT69 \u2192 't133', which is t133, not t69. So where does t69 come from? Maybe via another NT.\n\nWait, looking at NT74 \u2192 't146', NT68 \u2192 't145', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe t69 comes from NT67, but NT67 has a production NT67 \u2192 NT42 NT73. Wait, NT67 is another non-terminal. Let me see if NT67 can produce anything relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t69 comes from NT71, as I thought earlier. Because looking at the productions, NT71 \u2192 NT69 and NT71 \u2192 NT52.\n\nWait, so from NT71, you can get NT69 or NT52. Now, if NT71 is in the derivation, it can split into either. Let me see if NT71 can eventually produce t69.\n\nSo NT71 splits into NT69 or NT52. Let's say we pick NT69 first. Then NT69 splits into, I think, according to the data, NT69 \u2192 't133'. But that would produce t133, not t69. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can look for t69 in another way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all the productions for NT69. Do any of them produce t69? I don't think so. So perhaps the string contains a terminal that is not in the grammar. That would make the answer 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Looking through the productions, in the data, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't156', 't129'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- Others produce other terminals like 't26', 't17', 't134', etc.\n\nI don't see any production that leads to t69. So the string `t69` can't be produced by the grammar. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I should consider all possible derivations. Let's think again. The string starts with t69, so it's the first terminal. If there's no production that produces t69 directly, then that symbol is impossible. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, after checking, since t69 isn't directly produced by any NT in the grammar, the string is invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-55","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t22 t165 t17 t94 t144`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the problem. Context-free grammars work by having start symbols that expand into other symbols, either other non-terminals or terminals. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so S is the start symbol and the left-hand side. The right-hand side consists of two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals must expand into a sequence that eventually leads to terminals like 't' followed by a number.\n\nMy goal is to see if `t22 t165 t17 t94 t144` can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the string has five tokens, each corresponding to a terminal after expansions, I'll need to track back how these could have been generated.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't22'. I look through the grammar expansions to see where 't22' is defined. Scanning the production rules, I spot NT17 \u2192 't22' (since NT17 is defined as \u2192 't22'). So, the first part must come from NT17.\n\nNext, 't165'. I check if 't165' is a terminal. Looking through the rules, I find NT52 \u2192 't165' (as NT17 was used for 't22' but looking at other non-terminals). Wait, no, actually, looking again, the rule is NT17 \u2192 't22' and NT1 \u2192 't171' which might not help. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-81","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t22 t177 t90 t69 t45 t24` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, where do I even start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and either a terminal or a single non-terminal on the right. In this grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and the productions branch out into various NTx symbols, which are like non-terminals with numbers. Each rule seems to split into two of these NTx symbols until we hit terminals.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a series of ts with numbers, like t22, t177, etc. My initial thought is that each 't' followed by a number might be a terminal symbol. So, the string has six terminals. To check if the grammar can generate this, I need to see if the non-terminals can expand to these terminals in the right order.\n\nLet me try to work backward from the string. Starting with the last symbol, t24, I need to find a production that can derive t24. Looking at the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t123. Wait, but t123 isn't in the string. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the rules again.\n\nOh, no, actually, looking at the rules, NT24 is derived into t123, but t123 isn't part of the string. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps 't24' is a terminal, and one of the non-terminals directly expands to 't24'. Let me scan all the rules for a production where the right-hand side is just 't24'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t123. That's a problem because the string has t24, not t123. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rules. Some rules have 't' followed by numbers that could be part of the string. Let me check other rules.\n\nWait, I spot that NT17 \u2192 t22. So t17 is t22. So, in the string, there's a t22. If I can get something to derive to t17, which then becomes t22, then that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other 't's, I see NT43 \u2192 t2, so t43 is t2. But I don't see any t2 in the string. Hmm, maybe I'm stuck.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t22, t177, t90, t69, t45, t24.\n\nI know that NT22 must be the start symbol because the string starts with t22, and in the grammar, the start symbol S is NT99 NT99? Wait, no, the start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT99 NT99. Wait, or is it S \u2192 NT99 NT99? Let me check: No, the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT99? Wait, the user didn't specify that in the question, but typically, in CNF, the start symbol splits into two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see S \u2192 NT99 NT99? No, wait: the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT99? Let me check the initial part of the grammar:\n\ngrammar:\nS -> NT99 NT99? No, according to the user, it's S -> NT99 NT99? Wait, no, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar: S -> NT99 NT99?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, S is followed by NT99 NT99? Wait, the user provided the grammar as S->NT99 NT99, but looking more carefully:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammar: \nS -> NT99 NT99?\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar: S -> NT99 NT99.\n\nWait, no, the first production is S -> NT99 NT99. Let me confirm: S's first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT99.\n\nWait, no, actually the user wrote:\n\n\"S-> NT99 NT99\" as the first production. So S splits into NT99 and NT99. So, S expands into NT99 and NT99. So, to generate the string, we need NT99 to expand into the given string.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have six tokens: t22 t177 t90 t69 t45 t24. So that's six symbols, so S must expand into a sequence that results in these six tokens. Since each production is either a terminal or splits into two non-terminals, the number of symbols doubles each time except when a non-terminal expands into a terminal.\n\nWait, more accurately, when a non-terminal expands into a terminal, it adds one symbol. But if a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, the count increases by one each time.\n\nSo, starting with S, which is two non-terminals: when both expand into terminals, the string length would be 2. If one splits into two, then 3, and so on. The given string has 6 symbols, which is even, so it must have gone through several productions where non-terminals split into non-terminals until you reach a certain depth.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting a bit too abstract. Let me try to find possible expansions step by step.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt22, t177, t90, t69, t45, t24.\n\nFirst, let's map some t to NTs:\n\nFrom rules:\n- NT24 \u2192 t24 (rule 24)\n\nBut wait, looking for 't24', we see that NT24 is t24. But in the string, the last token is t24, so perhaps the last non-terminal is NT24.\n\nSimilarly, for t45: looking at rules, I see NT45 \u2192 t98 (rule 45). But t98 isn't in the string. Wait, perhaps looking for other rules.\n\nWait, another rule: NT23 \u2192 t156 (rule 23). Also, t156 isn't in the string, so that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for each token in the string and see what non-terminals could expand to them, then see if those non-terminals can be connected in a way to form the string.\n\nLet's try each token:\n\n- t22: NT17 \u2192 t22 (from rule 17). So t22 comes from NT17.\n\n- t177: Let's find a rule that expands to t177. Looking through the rules, I see NT177 appears as a left-hand side. No production rule ends with t177, so that suggests that perhaps t177 is a terminal. But in the rules, I see other NTs expanding into t numbers. For example, NT177 is a non-terminal. Wait, checking the rules: I see that NT177 is mentioned in a number of productions, but not as a right-hand side with a terminal. Hmm. So if NT177 is in the derivation, but it doesn't expand to a terminal, then that would cause a problem unless it's part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, but the grammar's rules are given, and all NTx symbols are on the left. So, to get to t177, we'd need a non-terminal that directly expands to t177, but looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where NTx \u2192 t177.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake. Maybe I should check again. Let's go through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a single terminal like t177.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nYes, here's a rule: NT39 \u2192 t144 (rule 39). No, that's t144.\n\nWait, here's another rule: NT56 \u2192 t121 (rule 56). Hmm. Wait, perhaps looking at NT177? No, I don't see NT177 on the RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe t177 is actually part of an NT that does expand into something else. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I don't see any rule that has t177 as a RHS. Therefore, t177 must be a terminal. But wait, the given string contains t177, which I can't find a rule that expands to it. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again. There are 106 production rules listed.\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nRule 177: NT177 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, actually, looking through, I think I might have miscounted.

From the rules, NT23 -> 't171' and NT14 -> 't170' perhaps? Wait, looking again, for NT17: 't22', NT43 -> 't2', but other terms. Hmm, maybe I'm missing one. Wait, maybe t170 is from a different rule. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that directly gives t170, but maybe it's derived from another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the rules and see which ones result in t-terms.

But looking at the rules, I don't see a rule that directly maps to t151. The closest is NT7 -> 't24', but that's t24, not t151. So perhaps t151 comes from another rule.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, is there any rule that produces t151? For example, NT17 -> 't22', so t22 is 't22'. Similarly, NT6 -> 't108', but that's t108.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t151 comes from a more complex derivation, but that's unlikely since the string is a simple list of t-terms.\n\nWait, maybe all the t-terms in the string must be directly produced by some rule. Let's list them:\n\nt139, t170, t80, t154, t2, t151.\n\nCheck t139: Looking for a rule where NT... -> 't139'. From the rules, yes, NT42->'t139'.\n\nt170: Looking for a rule that gives t170. Checking the rules, I don't see any rule that directly maps to t170, but maybe t170 is part of a longer derivation. For example, maybe NT170 exists but it doesn't. So perhaps t170 isn't directly in the mappings.\n\nt80: Looking for a rule that gives t80. From the rules, NT33 -> 't80'.\n\nt154: Looking for a rule that gives t154. From the rules, NT15 -> 't154', so t154 = NT15.\n\nt2: Looking for t2, it's from NT43->'t2'.\n\nt151: Looking for a rule that gives t151. Oh, NT71->'t151' because the rule is NT71 -> 't151'.\n\nWait, is that correct?

No, wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, from the list, looking for 't170'.\n\nI see that NT14 -> 't170' is not directly. Wait, perhaps in the rules, NT14 is mapped to something else. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, here's a rule: NT42 -> 't139', which we saw earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps t170 comes from a different non-terminal.

Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces t170 as the string. The only place where 't170' appears is as a result of NT170? Wait, but NT170 might not be a defined non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo in the string, but the string is given, so I have to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is derived from a chain that leads to those t-terms.

So NT42 is a non-terminal that directly produces t139.\n\nSimilarly, t170: looking for a rule that produces t170. Scanning the rules, I see NT42 -> 't139' again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the rule that produces t170 is NT17 -> 't22'? No, that's t22, which is t22.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is `t139 t170 t80 t154 t2 t151`. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Start with the first symbol: t139. From the rules, NT42 -> 't139' so t139 = NT42.\n\n2. Next, t170: what non-terminal can produce t170? Looking through the rules, perhaps NT14 -> 't170' is not there. Wait, the rules don't have such a rule. Let me check the rules again to see if any non-terminal leads directly to 't170':\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT42 is mapped to 't139'.\n\n- NT17 -> 't22', NT24->'t123', and several others, but none map to 't170' directly.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is not directly a terminal but is part of a larger derivation. Alternatively, perhaps there's no rule that directly produces t170, making the string ungrammatical.\n\nBut then, wait, is there any non-terminal that can lead to t170 through other rules?"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar and see the production rules. They all seem to start from S and have various productions, but some symbols are terminal strings like 't' followed by numbers. So, the non-terminals are the NTs like NT15, NT24, etc., and the terminals are the 't' parts. \n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t22, t26, t151, t157, t162, t112, t156. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string step by step, starting from S, and see if I can match the entire string. Alternatively, since the grammar is CNF, maybe there's a way to trace the derivation.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, S consists of two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Each of these needs to be expanded eventually into the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me look at NT99. From the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (I think I saw that in the initial rules). Wait, looking back, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. But looking again, actually, under the grammar provided, I think there's a rule like NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, but let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I don't see a direct rule for NT99 except as mentioned in the user's message. Wait, the user's grammar has lines like NT99 -> NT6 NT103, and NT103 -> NT24 NT45, etc. So, NT99 can be broken down.\n\nSimilarly, NT89. Looking at the grammar, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. So, that would be NT89 \u2192 NT44 \u2192 and NT1. Let's see what NT44 and NT1 are.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88, and NT88 \u2192 NT69 NT46, from the rules. NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65. Let's check: NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65. NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75. NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71. Hmm, this is getting complex.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t22. Looking at the grammar, t22 is a terminal. So, it must come from some production that ends with t22. Looking through the grammar, I see NT77 \u2192 t56. Hmm, but t22 isn't directly there. Alternatively, other non-terminals might directly produce 't22' via their productions.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again for any NT that directly expand to t22. From the user's message, I see that some NTs are mapped directly to 't's. For example, NT29 \u2192 t156, t129, etc. But I don't see 't22' in the provided mappings. Wait, maybe it's a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, I don't see any production that ends with t22. So either the string is wrong, or I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me go through each line.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n- NT29 \u2192 t36, t156\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- NT12 \u2192 t80\n- NT9 \u2192 t134\n- NT39 \u2192 t144, t144 again, and t129 also mentioned but not t150\n- NT66 \u2192 Wait, looking again, no NT22 rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is wrong? No, the user provided it as `t22 t26 t151 t157 t162 t112 t156`. So, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place for the productions that result in these 't's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't22' comes from a longer production, but in the grammar, every production is two non-terminals, except the terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So 't's must come directly from terminals in the grammar. So, for example, NT7 \u2192 t151, because in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, and NT21 \u2192 t171, but wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT7, I see NT7 \u2192 t151? No, wait. Let me check the lines:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n- NT21 \u2192 t171\n- NT9 \u2192 t134\n\nSo, actually, NT7 expands into t151, but maybe through NT21 and NT9. Wait, no: from the rules, NT21 is a non-terminal, so NT21 \u2192 t171. So, NT7 \u2192 t171 t134. But the string has t151, so that must come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's take each token in the string and see what non-terminals can produce them.\n\nThe string is t22, t26, t151, t157, t162, t112, t156.\n\nWe need to find a way for the grammar to generate this sequence as a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this as a leftmost derivation. We start with S, which is NT99 NT89 (from S \u2192 NT99 NT89).\n\nSo, the first step is to derive NT99 and NT89.\n\nLet's first handle NT99. NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Now, NT6 \u2192 t108 from the rules. So, for NT6, it's straightforward: t108. But in our string, the first token is t22, so maybe NT99 should produce something else. Hmm, but according to the given grammar, NT6 \u2192 t108, not t22. So perhaps the first token can't be t22 if the starting symbol is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Therefore, perhaps the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing another rule for NT99. Let me check again. In the provided rules, I don't see any other production for NT99 except NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So, NT99 can only generate t6 and t103. Therefore, the first part would generate t6 followed by t103, which is t6 t103. But our string starts with t22, which is not t6 or t103. Therefore, maybe this string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in some other step. Let me check if there's any other way NT99 or NT89 can be derived to start with t22. But according to the grammar, NT99 can only expand into NT6 and NT103. NT6 is t108, so the first part of the string would have to be t6 t103, which is t108 t157, maybe? Wait, let me look.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT103: in the provided rules, I don't see a production for NT103, but perhaps it's derived from other non-terminals. Wait, the grammar includes NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and NT35 can go to t52 or other things. Let me check.\n\nBut that's branching further away. Maybe it's better to confirm that the first token t22 can't be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Because in the given rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t22. So, that would mean the string is invalid, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, to be thorough, is there any NT that can produce t22? Let me go through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT rules ending with t22, but in the provided rules, no NT is directly defined as producing t22. Some rules produce t26, but t22 isn't among them. So, it's impossible for the string to start with t22, given the grammar as provided.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, I need to go through the grammar step by step and see how each part of the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual symbols: t146, t105, t47, t99, t156, t11, t115, t8. I need to see if each of these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t146. Looking through the productions, I see that NT46 is connected to t99 via NT46 \u2192 t99. But wait, NT46 isn't directly producing t146. Let me check the productions for NT46:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT77 \u2192 t124, and NT74 \u2192 t146. Oh, so NT74 \u2192 t146. Wait, no, let me double-check. Looking back, in the productions, NT74 \u2192 t146. So, to get t146, I can have NT74 produce t146.\n\nSo, starting from S, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. I need to match the string, so let's see if I can split the string into two parts that match NT99 and NT89.\n\nWait, the string is t146 t105 t47 t99 t156 t11 t115 t8. Let's see if we can parse this string into two parts: the first part starting with t146 and the second starting with t8, or the first part starting with t146 and t105 and the second starting with t47 and so on. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can try to find a leftmost derivation for the string. Let's think about how to get t146 as part of the leftmost derivation.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT74 \u2192 t146. So to get t146, I need NT74 in the string. Let me see where NT74 can appear. Looking through the productions, NT74 is a non-terminal that can produce t146. So, in the string, I need to find NT74.\n\nLooking at the string, after t146 comes t105. So, perhaps the string is split as t146 (NT74) and t105 (another NT). But wait, t105 is a terminal? No, in the grammar, NT105 is a non-terminal. So, t105 is a terminal, which is 't105'.\n\nWait, no, actually in the grammar, the productions like NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107. So, NT105 is a non-terminal. But in the string, I see t105 as a terminal, which is allowed because the productions can terminate on terminals. So, the symbol t105 is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Looking at the grammar, some parts like NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9. The NT symbols are non-terminals, and they can only be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals. So in the string, each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, the symbols are all terminals, like t146, t105, etc. So, actually, the string is composed of terminal symbols, meaning that the entire string must be derived as a terminal string, i.e., the derivation must end with all non-terminals replaced by the string of terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be derivable from the grammar. Let's check each symbol:\n\nt146: Looking at the productions, does any NT produce t146? Yes, NT74 \u2192 t146 (from the productions, I see NT74 \u2192 t146). So that's okay.\n\nt105: Does any NT produce t105? Let's see. Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see an NT that directly produces t105. Looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the productions, there's NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT65. But NT24 can produce t123, and NT65 \u2192 t8 or NT105 again. Wait, that's a bit circular. Wait, NT65 \u2192 t157 from the productions? Wait, looking back, I see NT65 \u2192 NT107.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look for t105.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT65. Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT96 \u2192 t105. Wait, wait, in the list: NT96 \u2192 NT105 NT71. Wait no, actually: the productions show NT96 \u2192 NT105 NT71, but wait, NT105 is another non-terminal. So NT96 is derived from NT105 and NT71. But that's within the grammar, but how does that help me get t105.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a production where a non-terminal directly produces t105. So, looking for any production X \u2192 t105.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT96 \u2192 t105 (no, NT96 \u2192 NT105 NT71). Wait, actually, no, in the productions, the only place where t105 appears is in NT96 \u2192 NT105 NT71 and NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT65. So t105 is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT96 \u2192 t105 is not present. Wait, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17 (no t105)\nNT31 \u2192 t7 NT6 (no)\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me carefully check each production to see if any non-terminal directly produces a t105.\n\nLooking through the entire list, I don't see any X \u2192 t105 directly. All t105 in the string are actually the result of productions where a non-terminal produces t105 as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is all terminals, so each symbol in the string must be the result of replacing a non-terminal (via production) to a terminal or a combination that eventually becomes terminals.\n\nSo, for example, t146 is produced by NT74, which is a non-terminal that directly connects to t146.\n\nSimilarly, t105 must be produced by some sequence of productions.\n\nLooking for t105 in the productions, the only place t105 appears is in NT96 \u2192 t105 NT71. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nYes, in the list, the production NT96 \u2192 t105 NT71 is present. So, NT96 produces the terminal t105 followed by NT71.\n\nSimilarly, for t105, I need to see where it appears. But in the productions, t105 is also in NT65 \u2192 t8 (as seen in NT65 \u2192 t157, wait no, looking back.\n\nWait, looking for t105:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT65 \u2192 t157, which doesn't produce t105. Wait, perhaps t105 is produced by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT65. So NT105 produces NT24 and NT65, both of which are non-terminals. So to produce t105, I need a way for these non-terminals to eventually produce t105.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t105 as a terminal. So, for t105 to be a terminal, it must be directly produced by a non-terminal that produces it. But from the productions, no non-terminal directly produces t105. Only NT96 produces t105 as a terminal (NT96 \u2192 t105 NT71). Wait, wait, no: in the production list, I see NT96 \u2192 t105 NT71. So NT96 directly produces t105 and NT71. So if in the string, I have a t105, that could come from NT96.\n\nWait, but the string is t146 t105"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT15, etc.) can produce combinations of other non-terminals or terminal tokens (the 't' followed by numbers like t139, t145, etc.). The start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89, each of which are followed by NT178, meaning S -> NT99 NT89 NT178 (wait, no, NT15 in the first part, but maybe I should check the exact production rules).\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the production for S is S -> NT99 NT89. Then each of NT99 and NT89 produce other non-terminals, which eventually break down into terminal tokens. So the string starts with t139, which maps to NT25 -> 't157'... Wait, no, looking at the grammar, let me check the rule for NT139.\n\nWait a minute, the grammar's terminal entries are provided. For example, NT24 -> 't123', etc. Wait, no, actually, the grammar's rules are in the form of NT15 -> something, and some of the NT's end up producing a terminal token. Each 't' like t134 or t144 is an individual terminal symbol.\n\nSo the given string has eight tokens: t139, t145, t41, t178, t76, t104, t80, t11. Let's list each token and see which NT it comes from.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nt139: From NT39's rule? Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT39 -> NT23 NT16. Hmm, NT23 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT23 does. From the rules, NT23 -> NT40 NT70. NT40 has two rules: one is NT40 -> NT33 NT64, and another is NT40 -> NT33 NT64 again? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT40 has multiple rules. For example, NT40 can be NT33 NT64 or NT24 NT75, depending on the production rule.\n\nWait, but looking for where the terminals come from. Let me go through each terminal:\n\nt139: From NT69? Because in the grammar, NT69 -> 't133' isn't directly, but looking for which NTs end with t139. Wait, I see NT42 -> 't165', so maybe t139 is from NT23? Wait, no, wait, the rules for NT19: NT19 -> 't99' and 't99'. No, wait, looking back, I see NT39 -> 't48' and 't48' as well. So t48 is from NT39.\n\nWait, let me make a list:\n\n- t139: which NT produces it? Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see it. Maybe from NT19? No, looking at the rules for NT19: NT19 -> 't99' 't99', but that's t99, not t139. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 8 tokens, so the derivation must produce exactly 8 steps, each adding a terminal.\n\nBut wait, let's see the structure. The start symbol S is S -> NT99 NT89, so the first two non-terminals. Then each of those non-terminals has their own production.\n\nWait, but looking at NT99 and NT89 in the grammar. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar, I don't see an explicit production for NT99 and NT89 beyond what's written for S. Wait, no, the initial rule is S -> NT99 NT89, but looking further, I see:\n\n- NT96 -> 't11' or something else? Wait, no, looking more carefully, the rules include NT99 -> 't156' or others. Wait, I need to check each rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NTs and their rules, focusing on those that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's find all NTs that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT73 -> 't167' (from NT73 -> 't167')\n- NT76 -> 't178' (from NT76 -> 't178')\n- NT139 -> 't165' (or no, wait: looking back, I see NT42 -> 't165', which is 't165' from NT42. So where is t139 coming from?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list each NT and see what terminals they produce.\n\nLet me go through each NT:\n\n- NT12 -> 't80'\n- NT15 -> 't90'\n- NT17 -> 't171'\n- NT18 -> 't35'\n- NT23 -> 't40' (from NT23 -> NT40 NT70; but NT40 has rules leading elsewhere, so not directly)\nWait, no, NT23's rules go to NT40 NT70. So NT23 is not producing a terminal directly.\n\nWait, let's find all NTs that have a rule that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, it's time-consuming, but let's try:\n\n- NT29 -> t129 and t156, from NT29->t156, etc. Hmm, in the rules, NT29 appears as producing t156 and t129.\n\nWait, the rules in the grammar include various NTs that end with t's. For example:\n\n- NT15 -> 't90' (but wait, looking at the rules, no, NT15's rules are more complicated. Wait, no, initial rules:\nLooking back:\n\nIn the provided grammar, after 'S -> NT99 NT89', next rule is 'NT15 -> NT23 NT21'? Wait no, the rules go like this:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of production rules, each line starting with the left-hand side (LHS) and then the RHS. Let me break it down:\n\n1. S -> NT99 NT89\n2. NT15 -> NT23 NT21 ?\nWait, no, looking at the first few lines after S:\n\nThe initial line after S is 'NT15 -> NT23 NT9', but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should list all the rules systematically:\n\nLet me list all the production rules provided:\n\n- NT13 -> NT9...\nWait, maybe it's more efficient to note which NTs ultimately produce a terminal 't' and then see the string.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT29 -> 't156', 't129'\n- NT31 -> 't7'\nWait, no, looking at the rules, NT31 is: NT31 -> NT7 NT6.\n\nBut perhaps this is taking too long. Maybe another approach: the string has 8 tokens, which suggests the derivation is 8 steps, with each step introducing a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production adds exactly one terminal per non-terminal node.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the derivation tree will have a height of 8, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar allows S -> NT99 NT89, each NT99 and NT89 will produce a sequence of terminals. So perhaps each NT99 and NT89 each produce several tokens, adding up to 8 in total.\n\nWait, no, the string is exactly 8 tokens, so if the tree is perfectly balanced, each NT would produce 4 tokens.\n\nWait, but let's see: NT99's rules:\n\nLooking for NT99's production, I see it's likely produced by other NTs. For example, from the given rules, NT99 is likely broken down.\n\nBut perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is provided with many rules, but only a few directly produce terminals, perhaps the string can be matched if each token is generated by the non-terminals in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be too involved.

{"custom_id":"request-137","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the productions start with a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for some that directly produce terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 107 and 17 are terminals. So each non-terminal can eventually lead to a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t123 t34 t115 t130 t174 t13 t129 t48 t100`. Hmm, that's quite a long string with nine tokens. My first thought is to break this down into possible parse trees, but given the number of steps, it might be easier to work backwards, checking if there's a way to produce this string starting from the top symbol S.\n\nStarting with the top-level production S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string starts with NT99 and followed by NT89. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part starts with 't123' and ends before the 't130' (since after that comes 't130') and then the second part is 't130 t174 t13 t129 t48 t100'.\n\nWait, no, actually, the productions are two non-terminals, so each part must generate their respective parts of the string. So the first non-terminal NT99 should generate 't123 t34', and the second NT89 should generate the rest of the string.\n\nFirst, let's check NT99. Looking at the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. From here, NT6 \u2192 't108' (a terminal) and NT103 \u2192 't101'. So NT99 can generate 't108 t101'. But in the string, the first two tokens are 't123 t34'. That doesn't match, so maybe NT99 isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT99, what's its production? It looks like NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, which then becomes 't108 t101', which is 't108' followed by 't101'. But in our string, after 't123', it's 't34'. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The grammar has more possibilities. Let me check if there's another production for NT99. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any other rules for NT99 except NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So perhaps my initial assumption is correct.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string starting with 't123 t34' doesn't match what NT99 can produce. But maybe I should check another possible production for S. Wait, no, in CNF, S only produces NT99 NT89, so there's no other option.\n\nHmm, this might be the problem. But maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the non-terminals can be broken down further. Let's try to see.\n\nLooking at NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 is 't108' and NT103 \u2192 't101'. So the first part of the string should be 't108 t101', but the string has 't123 t34' instead. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the grammar has more rules that I didn't consider. Let me double-check the grammar. Oh, wait, I see that there are entries for NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, but also other entries like NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65, etc. But specifically, NT99 doesn't have any other production except for NT6 and NT103.\n\nSo unless there's a way to get 't123' from NT99, which doesn't seem possible because the only production leads to 't108 t101', the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built recursively, but given the number of steps, it's unlikely. Let me consider another approach: maybe using the CYK algorithm, but with so many non-terminals, it's a bit time-consuming.\n\nAnother way is to see if the string can be split into parts that match the possible productions. The first part is 't123 t34'. Let's see what terminal pairs can be formed from the grammar. \n\nFrom the grammar, some terminals are directly produced by non-terminals:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT34 \u2192 't34'\n- NT115 \u2192 't115'\n- NT130 \u2192 't130'\n- NT174 \u2192 't174'\n- NT13 \u2192 't13'\n- NT129 \u2192 't129'\n- NT48 \u2192 't48'\n- NT100 \u2192 't100'\n\nSo looking at the first part, 't123 t34', those are terminal symbols from NT24 and NT34. So can NT24 produce 't123' and NT34 produce 't34'? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT24 \u2192 NT106 NT31. Wait, no, that's a production for NT24. But the terminal symbols for NT24 are only 't123' from NT24 in the end. Or wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. NT24 can be further expanded into non-terminals, but in the end, some non-terminals lead to terminals directly. For example, NT106 \u2192 't35' (wait, looking back, the grammar has NT35 \u2192 't40' and other terms, but not directly to 't123'. Wait, no, NT24 \u2192 't123' is not a production; looking at the grammar, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, etc., and some of these non-terminals lead to terminals. For example, NT35 \u2192 't68' in some case, but I don't see NT24 directly leading to 't123'. Wait, perhaps NT24 is 't123'? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT24 \u2192 't123'. Instead, NT24 appears in several productions, like NT24 \u2192 NT106 NT31. Hmm, maybe I got the NT numbers wrong. Wait, let's re-examine the grammar. \n\nLooking at line 24: NT24 \u2192 NT106 NT31. Line 12: NT40 \u2192 NT24 NT69. Line 40: NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107. Line 35: NT35 \u2192 't40' and 't105', among others. So, I don't see a direct production for NT24 leading to 't123'. Wait, no, actually, line 24: NT24 \u2192 NT106 NT31. So, NT24 is a combination of other non-terminals, but no production seems to create 't123' directly from NT24.\n\nWait, looking back, the line NT24 \u2192 't123' is where? Looking at the list of productions, I don't see that. Looking through the list again, there's a line: NT44 \u2192 't24', but that's line 67. Wait, no, line by line:\n\nLooking for 't123' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\nLine 24: NT24 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n\nLine 12: NT40 \u2192 NT24 NT69\n\nLine 40: NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n\nLine 35: NT35 \u2192 't40', 't105', etc.\n\nLine 106: NT106 \u2192 't35' in some cases, but also to NT7 and 107.\n\nI don't see any production of NT24 leading to 't123'. So perhaps 't123' comes from another non-terminal. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't123'.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\nLine 24: NT24 \u2192 NT106 NT31 (no 't123' here)\n\nWait, perhaps it's NT106? Let's see:\n\nNT106 appears in production lines 3, 10, 13, 14, 105, 107"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall how context-free grammars work. The grammar consists of production rules, and each rule can produce smaller parts of the string that eventually lead to the start symbol, S, which in turn generates the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT99 and NT89. So the string starts with t144, which must come from one of these NTs. I'll check the production rules for NT99 and NT89. \n\nWait, I see that NT99 -> NT6 NT103, but in the final string, it's t144. Also, looking at NT99 in another rule: NT99 produces NT61 NT73. Hmm, let me check the rules. Oh, hold on: NT99's rule is not listed directly, but looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n- NT99 -> NT61 NT73 (I think) because from the provided grammar, I see NT61 -> NT84 NT44 and NT73 -> NT83 NT70, etc. But actually, looking for NT99 and NT89 production rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT99 -> NT61 NT73\nNT89 -> NT44 NT1\n\nOh, right. So S -> NT99 NT89, which would produce t61 and t44 for NT99 and t44 and t1 for NT89. But the string starts with t144, which is different. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mapping.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, each NT in the production is a non-terminal, but when it's replaced by t with numbers, it's the actual terminal symbols that are part of the string. So for example, in the production rules, when a NT expands, the ts with numbers at the end correspond to the terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, each NT rule produces a combination of other NTs and terminals. So, for example, NT106 -> NT35 NT107, but in the provided rules, I see more NTs being defined. Wait, perhaps the NTs with numbers ending with t are the terminals, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me try to parse this. The grammar is presented in a format where each rule is in the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except for certain rules where NTY becomes a terminal t followed by a number. So, the NTs are represented as NTx, and when a rule has a t in it, that's the terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see which NTs generate which t symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can note where a rule ends with a t, meaning that's a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT18 -> NT35 NT43, but also NT61 -> NT93 NT80.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of the terminals. Let me scan through the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> NT69 (terminal t91)\n- NT19 -> NT74 NT46, which when expanding further, leads to NT74 -> t22? Wait, no, perhaps I need to see when Ntx turns into a t something.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal followed by something or just a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar rules, I notice:\n\nNT1 -> NT107 NT17\nNT31 -> NT7 NT6\nNT99 -> NT61 NT73\nNT89 -> NT44 NT1\nNT52 -> NT107 NT81\nNT35 -> NT43 NT52\n... etc.\n\nAnd among these, some have t at the end, like:\n\nNT16 -> 't93'\nNT6 -> 't108'\nNT68 -> 't134'\nNT29 -> 't36'\nNT29 -> 't156'\nNT24 -> 't123'\nNT12 -> 't80'\nNT9 -> 't134'\nNT39 -> 't144'\nNT68 -> 't145'\nNT6 -> 't108'\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping where a non-terminal (like NTx) either becomes a terminal t followed by a number, or is expanded into other non-terminals.\n\nFor example, from NT39 -> NT23 NT16, and NT23 -> NT40 NT107, etc. But ultimately, each NTx should expand to either a terminal or a combination of non-terminals.\n\nBut the problem is, without knowing the entire derivation tree, it's difficult to map the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string consists of ts with numbers, perhaps each tX corresponds to a particular NTx non-terminal.\n\nSo let's take the string: t144 t104 t112 t23 t165 t67 t76 t8 t174.\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific NTx nodes. So:\n\nt144 -> NT?\nt104 -> NT?\nt112 -> NT?\nt23 -> NT?\nt165 -> NT?\nt67 -> NT?\nt76 -> NT?\nt8 -> NT?\nt174 -> NT?\n\nWait, perhaps each tX corresponds to a specific production of the NTx. For example, looking at the rules, we can find which NTx produces a tX.\n\nSo let's go through each t in the string and see where they come from.\n\nt144: Looking for an NTx rule that has t144 as a terminal. Scanning through the rules, I see NT35 -> NT40 NT103, but also NT99 has some rules... Wait, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side has 't144'. In the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for Ntx -> tX NTY.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the last entry is:\n\nNT107 -> NT65 NT71\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some rules where Ntx directly produces a t.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, each Ntx is a non-terminal that can be a terminal, or further split into other Ntxs.\n\nWait, from the given rules, for example, NT39 -> NT23 NT16. Then, perhaps:\n\nLooking for where a Ntx is a terminal, i.e., when the production ends with a letter indicating it's a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminal production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if the given string \"t21 t110 t118 t54 t154 t76 t159 t21 t69 t67\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that most productions seem to split the left-hand side (LHS) into two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS), which fits CNF. The only exception is when terminals are on the LHS, like NT7 -> 't24'. However, in CNF, terminals on LHS aren't allowed unless the grammar is in a specific form where they can appear as axioms, but generally, it's not standard. This might complicate things because our string contains several terminals like 't21', 't110', etc., which need to be matched exactly.\n\nNext, I notice that each string is a sequence of terminals. To check if the string is generated by the grammar, we can simulate the parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can try to construct a derivation that leads to the string.\n\nLet me break down the string: \"t21 t110 t118 t54 t154 t76 t159 t21 t69 t67\". I'll list each terminal and see where they appear in the grammar. For example, looking at the productions, NT96 is somewhere, but I'm more interested in the terminals.\n\nLooking for 't21', I see a production NT7 \u2192 't24', but that's a different terminal. Wait, in the grammar, are there any 't21's? Let me check. Oh, 't21' is part of the grammar as NT21 \u2192 't171'. Hmm, but in the string, the first 't21' might come from another production.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't21', which in the grammar is from NT21 \u2192 't171', but that seems inconsistent because 't171' is a different terminal. Alternatively, maybe 't21' comes from another production. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, there's NT74 \u2192 't146', NT49 \u2192 't115', etc. Wait, perhaps I need to see if 't21' is directly produced by any production or if it can be derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, the way the string is built would be a tree where each node is a non-terminal split into two children. So, for the string to be generated, the entire string must be a parse tree built from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be built step by step. Let's look for the longest possible splits from the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT99 NT99. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT99? Or S \u2192 NT99 NT99? Wait, checking the grammar, S splits into NT99 and NT99, but looking at the production rules, S is defined as NT99 NT99? No, in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT99 isn't present. Let me recheck:\n\nThe given grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89, not S -> NT99 NT99. So that might not be the case. Wait, looking again, the very first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S is split into NT99 and NT89. So any derivation starting from S would have these two as the first steps.\n\nSo, the process would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals would need to split further until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me see where NT99 and NT89 go. From the grammar:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (I think, but looking through the rules, I can't find NT99. Wait, let me check...)\n\nWait, I might have missed some rules. Let me search for NT99 in the production list. Scanning through, I see NT6 \u2192 't108', NT99 is not directly a production, but maybe it's part of another rule. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule for NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and other rules involve NT99, but looking for NT99, I don't see it defined. Let me check the grammar again. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting something.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for all rules where NT99 appears on the RHS. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT99 as the LHS. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan the entire list again.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any rule where NT99 is on the LHS. That seems conflicting because if S \u2192 NT99 NT89 and if NT99 is not further split into terminals, it would create a problem. Did I make a mistake in reading the grammar?\n\nWait, perhaps in the grammar, NT99 is defined as a combination that eventually leads to 't99'. Looking for 't99' in the string, it's towards the end: 't69 t67'. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar to see if any non-terminals lead to 't99'.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking at the rules for NT76: NT76 \u2192 NT45 NT71, and so on. It seems that the terminals in the string are generated by non-terminals that lead to them. For example, NT52 \u2192 't123' and 't171' etc.\n\nBut perhaps the crux is to see that all the terminals in the string must be produced by some rule, and we have to check if the whole string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the approach is to see if each terminal in the string is directly produced by some NT production.\n\nLooking at the string: t21 t110 t118 t54 t154 t76 t159 t21 t69 t67.\n\nEach of these terminals must correspond to a production where the LHS is a non-terminal, and the RHS includes that terminal. So, for example, 't21' must be the result of something like NT21 \u2192 't171', but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps 't21' is produced by a non-terminal that's derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to look for a parse tree that matches the string, ensuring each step aligns with the grammar rules.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals in the grammar produce 't21', 't110', 't118', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, 't21' is in the production NT21 \u2192 't171'. Wait, but 't21' is different. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong production.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal in the string and see if any production in the grammar leads directly to it.\n\n- t21: I don't see a production that produces 't21' directly. The closest is NT21 \u2192 't171', which outputs t171, not t21. So perhaps 't21' is produced by a non-terminal that is eventually split into a terminal. But without a direct production, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's look for 't21' in the grammar as a terminal in the LHS. I see rules like NT7 \u2192 't24', which produces t24, but not t21.\n\nWait, perhaps 't21' is part of a larger production. For example, maybe a non-terminal splits into multiple non-terminals and one of them leads to t21, and another continues splitting. Let's consider S \u2192 NT99 NT99 or NT99 NT89.\n\nBut wait, the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so from S, we would get NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99, I don't see any production in the rules where NT99 is on the LHS, which suggests that I might have missed a production. Wait, perhaps I need to recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the grammar. Let me check again. Oh, I see: There's a production NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18, but that's not NT99.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial problem is that the starting symbol has child non-terminals, but those non-terminals never produce"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-159","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is `t63 t124 t101 t171 t133 t124 t65 t172 t99 t171`.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. It's a way of structuring context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for simplifying certain parsing algorithms and theorems about context-free languages.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that the initial symbol is S, which starts the derivation. The first production is S -> NT99 NT89. So, the string must start with the terminal symbols generated by NT99 and NT89.\n\nEach NT production seems to further break down into other NT symbols or terminal strings. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and then NT75 and NT57 might lead to terminals.\n\nMy task is to see if the given string can be derived starting from S. Since the string consists entirely of terminals (all starting with 't'), I need to trace back from the string to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree starting from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet's start by looking at each symbol in the string:\n\nt63, t124, t101, t171, t133, t124, t65, t172, t99, t171.\n\nI'll process each token step by step, trying to find production paths that lead to these terminals.\n\nStarting with the leftmost terminal, t63.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several NT productions that lead to 't33', 't63', etc. For example, NT33 -> t80, t23 (wait, looking back, I see NT33: NT33 -> NT80 NT23?)\n\nWait, no, the grammar seems to have some symbols that can produce 't' strings. Let me look through the productions.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23, and NT80 is 't63' (from NT80 \u2192 t63) and NT23 \u2192 t124 (NT23 production isn't directly given, but I see NT67 \u2192 t67, and others. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, many NT symbols produce terminal strings. For instance:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23\nBut then looking further, I see NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23 is wrong because the grammar provided doesn't list that. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT33, it's: NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23. Is that correct? Because in the grammar, I see something like NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, etc. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nNT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73, and NT67 is 't67' (from NT67 \u2192 t67) and NT73 is 't73' (from NT73 \u2192 t73). So NT73 is in the grammar as producing 't73'. Similarly, NT171 \u2192 t171.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the beginning:\n\nThe string is t63 t124 t101 t171 t133 t124 t65 t172 t99 t171.\n\nLet me split them: [t63, t124, t101, t171, t133, t124, t65, t172, t99, t171].\n\nNow, perhaps it's best to work backwards using a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nBut since the string is only terminals, bottom-up parsing might be more efficient, like the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for Chomsky Normal Form and context-free grammars.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by maintaining a table that tracks the possible non-terminals and symbols that can derive substrings. It uses dynamic programming to fill this table, splitting the current symbols into two parts, i and j, and checking if any production can derive the appropriate non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's try to apply the CYK algorithm step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string is of length 10. Let's index the string from 0 to 9.\n\nThe string is: t63, t124, t101, t171, t133, t124, t65, t172, t99, t171.\n\nSo, the table will have 10 rows and 10 columns. Each cell (i, j) will represent the substring from index i to j.\n\nWe'll need to fill the table by checking at each cell (i, j) which non-terminals can derive the substring s[i..j], and see if the entire string can be derived starting from S.\n\nBut since I'm not very familiar with the CYK specifics, especially with generating the entire table without seeing the actual grammar rules for all symbols, perhaps I should look for other patterns or rules that might directly produce the required string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that are generated by certain productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal can be produced by some NT symbol in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\nt63: Looking through the grammar, NT80 produces t63 (NT80 \u2192 t63).\n\nt124: From NT23 \u2192 t124.\n\nt101: Not immediately obvious. Let me check if any NT produces t101.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT91 produces 't91' and some 107s. Wait, in the grammar, under NT91: NT91 \u2192 t171. Not t101. Looking elsewhere: NT101 \u2192 't101'? No, the grammar has a production NT77 \u2192 t124, NT71 \u2192 t71, etc. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NTs have a production where they go to a terminal, like NT12 \u2192 't80'.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NT symbols and their corresponding terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35 (so no terminal)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65 (no terminal)\n- NT99 \u2192 't19'?

{"custom_id":"request-178","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out whether the given string is in the language defined by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because I can use a parsing strategy, maybe the CYK algorithm, but since the string is a bit long, I might need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar and the string. The grammar has several NT rules and some terminal symbols. The string to evaluate is: `t73 t156 t129 t73 t72 t110 t90 t22 t169 t21 t169`.\n\nI see that a lot of the grammar rules start with NT followed by two digits, and some of those translate directly to \"t\" followed by a three-digit number, like NT73 \u2192 t151, NT77 \u2192 t178, etc. Wait, actually, looking closer, each NT rule ends up producing a terminal string. For example, NT73 \u2192 t151, NT52 \u2192 t177, etc.\n\nWait no, actually, some of the rules have two NTs producing a t string, like NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT70, but others have a t prefix. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, but NT21 seems to produce 't171' and NT9 is 't9'? I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the rules and see how each production translates into the t's. For instance, looking at NT73 \u2192 t151, which is a direct terminal. Similarly, NT90 \u2192 t41, NT57 \u2192 t159, etc. So some terms produce t's directly. Others, like NT7, go through other NTs before reaching a terminal.\n\nSo the string is a series of t's with numbers, like t73, t156, etc. Let me check if these are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n- NT73 -> t151\n- NT77 -> t178\n- NT7 -> t151\n- NT57 -> t159\n- NT67 -> t67? Wait, no, looking at NT67: it's only in NT91 \u2192 t164, and looking at NT67: wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of the terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, I can list each production that ends in a terminal 't' something:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t107 t17 \u2192 t107 and t17, but that might be part of a longer sequence.\n\nNT21 \u2192 t171\nNT70 \u2192 t162\nNT73 \u2192 t151\nNT75 \u2192 t98\nNT90 \u2192 t41\nNT57 \u2192 t159\nNT7 \u2192 t151\nNT48 \u2192 t11\nNT24 \u2192 t123\nNT29 \u2192 t36 or t156\nNT11 \u2192 t17\nNT36 \u2192 t47\nNT52 \u2192 t104 or t177\nNT42 \u2192 t139 or t158\nNT89 \u2192 t60 or t81\nNT64 \u2192 t24\nNT100 \u2192 t127 or t96\nNT108 \u2192 t118\nNT69 \u2192 t1 or t133\nNT76 \u2192 t121\nNT46 \u2192 t99\nNT39 \u2192 t48 or t144\nNT61 \u2192 t84 or t92\nNT84 \u2192 t1 or t17\nNT9 \u2192 t49 or t93 or others\nAnd so on. \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier if I list each terminal that each NT can produce:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t107, t17, t107 t17\n- So possible terminal sequences for NT1: t107 t17, t17 t107, t107, t17\n\nBut the string is `t73 t156 t129 t73 t72 t110 t90 t22 t169 t21 t169`. Each part is a single t followed by a number.\n\nWait, perhaps each tX is a separate terminal, so the string is a sequence of Ts, each with their own number. But in the grammar, each NT can produce either two NTs or a terminal string. So, for example, NT52 can produce t104 or t177. But for our problem, it's important to see all possible t sequences produced by each NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT corresponds to a specific sequence of t's. So if the grammar allows a specific t-string, then the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t73 t156 t129 t73 t72 t110 t90 t22 t169 t21 t169`.\n\nLet me see each t number and see if it's a possible terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t73: Is there an NT that produces t73? Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t73. NT73 \u2192 t151, which is different. So no NT in the grammar produces t73 directly. Hmm, that's a problem because the string contains t73.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The grammar rules are all in the form of NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX \u2192 txxx. For example, NT73 \u2192 t151, which is a single terminal, but in the string, we have t73 as a terminal. So unless there's a production for NT73 \u2192 t73 somewhere, it can't be generated. Since I don't see NT73 \u2192 t73, that t73 can't come from any production in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated because t73 is not produced by any NT.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see other rules:\n\nAt the end of the question, the grammar includes lines like NT81 \u2192 NT15 NT70 \u2192 then looking at NT15 \u2192 t107 t17? Hmm, perhaps this is getting confusing because NT rules are interconnected. Maybe I should look for any production that ends in t73.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I don't see any rule where NT73 is replaced by t73. The only production for NT73 is NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT73, or maybe other rules.\n\nWait, here's a line: `NT73 -> NT6 NT39`. Then looking at NT39: `NT39 -> NT23 NT16`. Not helpful. Wait, maybe I should look for all the terminal expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t73 comes from a term that I've not considered. Looking through the grammar, all the NTS that can produce terminals are defined as NT \u2192 t followed by a number. For example, looking for t73:\n\n- Does any NT production end with t73? Let's scan the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t162\n- NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT73\n- NT75 \u2192 t98\n- NT90 \u2192 t41\n- NT57 \u2192 t159\n- NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n- NT21 \u2192 t171\n- NT89 \u2192 t81 or t60\n- NT61 \u2192 t84 or t92\n- NT65 \u2192 t157 or t8\n- And others.\n\nI don't see any NT rule that directly produces t73, and the string contains t73. So that would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar, right?\n\nBut wait, perhaps the string can be derived through a series of steps. Let me see if any NT can be expanded into a sequence that includes t73.\n\nWait, for example, maybe some NT is expanded into another NT and then that produces t73. Let me see. Looking at NT7 \u2192 t151, so that's t151, not 73. NT48 \u2192 t11, so that's t11. NT42 \u2192 t139 or t158, which are t139 or t158. Hmm, none of these seem to produce t73.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT73, and then NT80 is t63, and maybe the second NT73 also expands, but that would not help in getting t73 in the string. Because it's a recursive production that doesn't terminate.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-174","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, the grammar is pretty complicated with a lot of rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is `t177 t141 t50 t51 t99 t63 t22 t139 t159 t91 t144`. That's a series of tokens ending with t144. My goal is to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's mostly rules that break down symbols into other symbols, often involving 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT15 can become 't90', NT48 can become 't11', etc. But the string has mixed NT symbols and 't' tokens. I need to see if each 't' token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the 't' tokens in the string: 177, 141, 50, 51, 99, 63, 22, 139, 159, 91, 144.\n\nI should check each 't' token to see if there's a rule in the grammar that produces it. The grammar looks like it has rules where some NT symbols are rewritten as combinations of other NT symbols and sometimes 't' tokens.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT177 doesn't seem to have a direct rule. Wait, no rule is given for NT177, but in the string, some 't' tokens come after NT rule expansions. For example, NT57->t172, NT43->t2, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of each 't' token and see if they can be derived from any NT rule.\n\n1. t177: I don't see any rule that directly produces t177. Maybe it's part of a larger rule. Wait, looking back, I think there are rules like NT52->t177, but checking the given rules: NT52->t177? Let me look. No, the grammar doesn't have a rule where NT52 becomes t177. Instead, I see rules like NT52->t123. Wait, let me scan the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT52 -> t123\n- NT77 -> t124\n- NT23 -> t156\n- NT23 also appears in other rules, like NT23->t47.\n\nWait, maybe t177 comes from a rule like NT177, but I don't see that in the grammar. So perhaps t177 isn't produced directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a longer production, but I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the reverse process. That is, to see if the string can be built step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me consider building the string from left to right. The string starts with t177, then 141, etc.\n\nFirst, t177: Do any rules produce t177? Looking through the rules, I see NT19->t99, and NT19 is derived from NT74 and NT46. So t177 would come from a symbol that includes NT177, but in the grammar, it's not present. Alternatively, maybe it's part of another symbol. Wait, none of the rules in the grammar have t177 as a literal, so I think t177 might be invalid because it's not produced by any rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's part of a more complex production, like NT89->t60. But I don't see t177 being generated. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the NT177 rule isn't present, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check the grammar again. Scanning through, I don't see any NT177 being defined. So, if t177 is supposed to come from some NT symbol, but there's no such symbol, then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, 't' tokens are the results of certain rules. So for example, NT57->t172. So for 't177', perhaps it's produced by NT177, but that rule isn't in the grammar. So unless there's a rule that directly produces t177, which there isn't, the string can't have t177 as a symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's produced indirectly through a chain. For example, if NT177 is broken down into other symbols, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any such rule.

The string is \"t11 t8 t99 t71 t162 t76 t17 t164 t167 t51 t36 t73\". \n\nFirst, let me recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have two terminals or non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the start symbol should lead to these productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string starts with NT99 \u2192 ... and NT89 \u2192 ..., each of which should generate two non-terminals. \n\nLet me break down the string into individual tokens: \"t11\", \"t8\", \"t99\", \"t71\", \"t162\", \"t76\", \"t17\", \"t164\", \"t167\", \"t51\", \"t36\", \"t73\".\n\nEach terminal is in the form 't' followed by some number. I think each of these corresponds to a rule in the grammar where a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal. For example, looking through the provided rules, I notice that NT15 \u2192 't21' because the rule is NT15 -> NT21 NT9, but wait, no, actually, in the context, it's written as NT15 -> 't21'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see rules like NT7 -> 't151', which would mean NT7 can produce 't151'. Similarly, NT15 is supposed to produce 't90' according to NT15 -> 't90'. Hmm, but in the string, I see \"t11\", so which NT does that correspond to? \n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT11 has multiple rules. Looking back, I see:\n\nNT11 is present in several rules, including NT11 -> NT35 NT81, but that doesn't produce a terminal. However, I also see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT35 -> NT68 NT103\nNT29 is present in multiple places but not generating a terminal. Wait, let me check all the rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I notice that NT99 is used in several places. Wait, the rule for NT99 is not explicitly given, but perhaps it's in the form of NT99 -> 't11'? Because in the list, under NT99, I see \"NT99 -> NT6 NT103\". That isn't a terminal. Hmm, maybe I missed a rule where NT99 is a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Let me see the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some rules where NT is followed by a 't', like NT7 -> 't151', NT15 -> 't90', NT28 -> 't76', and so on. So each of these represent NT \u2192 'tX' where X is the number after 't'.\n\nSo, in the string, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal that a non-terminal might produce.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 12 terminals: t11, t8, t99, t71, t162, t76, t17, t164, t167, t51, t36, t73.\n\nNow, the grammar starts as S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so each production should add two non-terminals, and eventually, these non-terminals should expand into the given terminals.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string starts with t11, t8, which correspond to NT99 and NT89, respectively.\n\nLet me check what NT99 and NT89 can produce. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT99: I don't see a rule for NT99 directly, but I do see that other NTs produce terms like 99, e.g., in the grammar, NT24 \u2192 NT123, but wait, maybe I'm looking incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should search the grammar for non-terminals that produce 't99' as their terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-216","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by breaking down what I know and what I need to do.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see various non-terminals like S, NT15, NT89, etc., and terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t60 t49 t159 t123 t63 t41 t26 t65 t11 t121 t170 t159 t47`. I need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string using the grammar, possibly using a recursive descent parsing method since it's in CNF. Since each non-terminal is replaced by exactly two non-terminals, the derivation tree should have a certain structure.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The first rule for S is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, S must derive to a string that starts with NT99 followed by NT89. That means the first part of the string should come from NT99 and then NT89, producing t60 followed by t159. Wait, the given string starts with t60, then t49, which might not align immediately. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, let me parse the string step by step. The string is a series of terminals: t60, t49, t159, t123, t63, t41, t26, t65, t11, t121, t170, t159, t47.\n\nI think I need to see if this string can be built up starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT99 NT89, let's see if the first two symbols match the possible productions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (from the grammar), but wait, in the given grammar, NT99 has a production? Let me check: looking through the rules, I don't see NT99 in the initial list. Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me scroll through the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through, I see NT99 is in the productions: NT99 is listed as producing NT6 and NT103. So, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, and looking further down, there's another NT99 in the rules? Hmm, wait, wait, in the grammar provided, I might have misread. Looking back:\n\nWait, under the grammar rules, I have:\n\nNT96 -> NT33 NT36\n\nNT12 -> NT91 NT69\n\nNT40 -> NT33 NT64\n\nNT93 -> NT15 NT77\n\n... and so on. Hmm, looking for t60, which is part of the string. I don't see any NT rules that produce a terminal with 60, so perhaps I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the terminals are actually the sequences of 't' followed by digits? Let me think: in the grammar, the terminals are like 't60', 't49', etc., not just single letters. So each 't' followed by two digits is a terminal symbol. That changes things.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals: t60, t49, t159, t123, t63, t41, t26, t65, t11, t121, t170, t159, t47. All the t's have two-digit numbers except maybe t47, which is also two digits.\n\nOkay, so each of these is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find if the given sequence of terminals can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal. So in this case, the given string is all terminals, which suggests that the entire string is derived by replacing non-terminals with terminals using the productions.\n\nSo, essentially, each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal produced by some non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be decomposed into sequences that match the given productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the string as a series of steps where each non-terminal in the derivation generates two terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut the string is a flat sequence of terminals. To match this, the derivation must have exactly (length of string)\/2 steps, but perhaps that's too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree bottom-up, ensuring that each node in the tree corresponds to a production rule.\n\nBut since the grammar is quite extensive, maybe I can track back which terminals correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions. Let's take the given string and see if it can be divided into segments that match the possible productions.\n\nThe string is: t60 t49 t159 t123 t63 t41 t26 t65 t11 t121 t170 t159 t47.\n\nWait, perhaps I can group these into pairs, but the count is 13 terms, which is odd. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which would produce two non-terminals, the initial split must go into two parts, so the count should be even perhaps? But in the given string, it's 13, which is odd, so maybe some non-terminals generate a mixture of terminals and non-terminals, but wait, the grammar in CNF has all productions as either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each non-terminal in the derivation must split into two non-terminals or produce a terminal.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe start symbol is S. S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo the derivation must start with NT99 followed by NT89.\n\nEach NT is a non-terminal. Let's see what possible productions NT99 and NT89 have.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nSo NT99 must generate t6 and t103. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t60, not t6. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the grammar. Wait, looking through the grammar, I'm only seeing references to NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Are there other possible NT99 productions? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see another production for NT99 except NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So NT99 can only produce NT6 and NT103. So if the string starts with t60, which is generated by NT99's production, it doesn't align, since NT99's production would give us t6 and t103, which are t6 and t103. So the first symbol being t60 doesn't match that.\n\nWait, that suggests that the string cannot be generated because the first production from S requires NT99 to produce t6 and t103, but the string starts with t60. The only possible way is if I made a mistake in interpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the entire grammar again. Maybe there's a production I missed.\n\nLooking carefully, I see NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 and NT108 \u2192 NT118, but no, that doesn't help. Wait, is there a production for NT60? Let me check.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm mistaken in thinking that NT99 is the only symbol that can produce anything. Looking again, maybe there's a production for NT60 or NT49? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT60 or NT159 production. The only NT rules seem to be for higher-numbered non-terminals. So perhaps the string symbols don't correspond to any non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' is a terminal. But how can that be, because the grammar is in CNF, which allows for terminals to be produced directly. Wait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, looking at the longer productions, like NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88, but others might produce terminals as individual steps. Wait, looking back, I don't think the grammar has any rules that produce a terminal like 't60' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-213","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right, except possibly the start symbol which can produce a single non-terminal. But looking at the given grammar, most rules have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so that fits CNF.\n\nFirst, the string given is `t172 t169 t102 t51 t73 t104 t156 t54 t169 t145 t54 t22 t22`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol, I think, and the grammar terminals look like 't' followed by a number. So for example, 't172' corresponds to the terminal symbol 't172'.\n\nIn CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can produce a terminal. But wait, in this grammar, all the productions are of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT..., except the very last one for NT1 which becomes 't171'. So the grammar is actually in Chomsky Normal Form because all productions except the initial one produce two non-terminals, and the initial ones eventually produce terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to see if there's a way to derive the given sequence of terminals using the productions. Since the grammar is context-free, the parsing can be done using something like the CYK algorithm, but perhaps for simplicity, I can simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nLet's see, the string has 13 tokens. So the derivation would start at the top level with S, which produces two non-terminals, each of which might themselves produce two, and so on, until the terminals match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt172 t169 t102 t51 t73 t104 t156 t54 t169 t145 t54 t22 t22\n\nFirst, I notice that the last two tokens are t22 and t22.

Hmm. Also, line 22: NT17 \u2192 't171'. Wait, maybe I need to go through all the rules to find where a non-terminal becomes t22.\n\nLooking again, line 17 is NT17 \u2192 't24', and line 22 is NT17 \u2192 't171'. What about line 74: NT74 \u2192 't146'. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing a rule that produces t22. Wait, maybe in line 28: NT28 \u2192 't76'. Or line 22: NT17 \u2192 't171'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar.

Looking through the lines, yes, line 19: NT19 \u2192 t99, line 22: NT22 \u2192 't21'?\n\nNo, check line 2: NT11 \u2192 't17'; line 5: NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a rule for NT22. Let me go through all the lines again:\n\nLooking at the list, the lines include NT107 \u2192 t65, NT94 \u2192 ... Hmm, maybe no NT22. Wait, actually, looking at the lines, I don't see an NT22. So how does t22 get generated? That's an issue because if there's no rule in the grammar that directly produces t22, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, maybe t22 can be produced through a series of productions. For example, maybe a non-terminal expands into something that eventually becomes t22. Let's think about that.\n\nLooking for any rules where t22 could be a terminal. Let's check each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any that directly produce t22. So perhaps t22 is part of a larger string, and the parser can't generate it. That might mean that the string can't be derived because there's no production that ends with t22.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path where the derivation leads to t22 through multiple steps. Let me think about it. For example, maybe a non-terminal can expand to a chain that ends in t22.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example, NT74 \u2192 't146', which is another terminal. But t146 might lead somewhere else. Maybe I can reconstruct a path, but it's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains a t22 which is impossible to derive, meaning the answer is 'No'. But I'm not 100% sure, so I need a better approach.\n\nAnother way is to look at the structure of the string and see if it matches any possible derivation path.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual t's followed by numbers:\n\nt172, t169, t102, t51, t73, t104, t156, t54, t169, t145, t54, t22, t22.\n\nI can think of the string as a sequence of symbols that must be derived from the start symbol S. Since S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the initial step would produce two symbols, e.g., NT99 and NT89. Each of these would then expand into more symbols, and so on, until leaves (terminals) are produced.\n\nGiven that the string ends with t22 two times, and since I can't find a rule that produces t22, unless it's part of a larger chain, I'm starting to think that the string is invalid.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to find any NT that can expand to t22. Let's see.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some NTs expand into two NTs:\n\nFor example, NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70. Let's see if any of those can go further.\n\nNT28 \u2192 t76.\n\nWait, line 28: NT28 \u2192 't76'. So if a symbol is NT28, it becomes t76. Hmm, what about NT76?\n\nLooking at line 27: NT76 \u2192 NT28 NT43. So NT76 becomes NT28 and NT43. Then, NT28 \u2192 t76, and NT43 \u2192 t2. So t76 would become t76 and t2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. That would mean NT76 \u2192 NT28 NT43 \u2192 (t76) (t2). So that would create t76 and t2, which would make it t76 t2, or perhaps that's an intermediate step.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to see if t22 can be reached through any chain.\n\nWait, another NT that could lead to t22: For example, line 10: NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107.\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103 (line 44).\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71 (line 42).\n\nNT45 \u2192 t98 (from line 42: NT44 \u2192 t98?

{"custom_id":"request-241","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t69 t162 t174 t80 t110 t50 t159 t127 t157 t76 t104 t169 t76 t80`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky normal form, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, all the productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTab NTcd, where NT are non-terminals and the right-hand side has two non-terminals each time. Oh, but at the end of the list, there are explicit terminal productions, like `NT17 -> 't24'` or other similar ones. So the grammar includes both rules with two non-terminals and some terminals.\n\nThe string starts with `t69`, which is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, there's a production where NT75 \u2192 't98'. Also, `t69` appears in NT70 \u2192 't162', but wait, looking at the productions, NT70 is a non-terminal, so `t162` must come from another production. \n\nI think I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the given grammar. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. Each `t` followed by a number is a terminal. The string is:\n\nt69 t162 t174 t80 t110 t50 t159 t127 t157 t76 t104 t169 t76 t80\n\nI'll start from the end and see if I can trace back to the start using the grammar rules, working backwards. This is the standard way to check if the string is in the language, especially since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is suitable for the CYK algorithm, but since the string is only 14 symbols, I'll try to manually parse.\n\nLooking at the last symbol `t80`. We need a production that ends with `t80`. Looking at the grammar, NT80 \u2192 't67'. Wait, no, looking through the productions, I see NT80 \u2192 't67' is probably incorrect because I don't see that in the list. Let me check the given productions again.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT80 is in NT95 via NT74, but that's not directly helpful. Wait, let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT68 \u2192 't24' appears, but I'm looking for `t80`. Let me check if there's a production for `t80`.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT67 \u2192 't67' (I'm not sure that's the case, as 't67' might not be the same as 't80'). Alternatively, checking for `t80` in the productions. Oh, in NT70 \u2192 't162', so `t162` comes from NT70. So, if I have `t162` followed by another symbol, perhaps it's generated by NT70 and something else.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider the entire string and see if it can be split into the right non-terminals. Starting from the end, `t80` must come from a production where the second non-terminal's production ends with `t80`. Or perhaps, working backward, each symbol must match the end of a production.\n\nAlternatively, I'll consider that each production in the grammar is S \u2192 NTxy NTyz, etc., but I need to see if the sequence of terminals can be formed by expanding S step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at each terminal symbol and see if it has a production that ends with that terminal. Starting from the first symbol:\n\n1. `t69`: Look for a production that ends with `t69`. Checking the productions, I see NT71 \u2192 't69' (I think, because in the list, I see NT7 -> 't151' (not 69), but perhaps NT71 is something else. Wait, in the productions, there's NT71 \u2192 't69'. So yes, NT71 can be expanded to 't69'.\n\nSo the end symbol `t69` must come from NT71. Then, before that, the production must have been of NT... Let's see, perhaps something like NTxxx \u2192 NT71 NT... So before `t69`, there is another NT symbol.\n\nLooking at the rest of the string after `t69` (the next symbol is `t162`). So the string is: `t69`, `t162`, rest. So the substring is `t69 t162 ...`.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to consider the entire string and see how to split it into the right-hand sides of the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production on the left-hand side expands into two non-terminals, which in turn can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be the result of some non-terminal's expansion. So I can work backwards, starting from the first terminal `t69` and seeing how it can be the result of a non-terminal, then check the preceding symbols.\n\nSo, for the first symbol `t69`, the production is from NT71, as per the grammar. So NT71 must expand to `t69`. But wait, looking at the grammar, do we have NT71 \u2192 ... something that ends with `t69`? From the productions, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't162' \n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT53 \u2192 't2'? Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Wait, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT71 \u2192 't69' (I think). Let me check the provided productions:\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I see:\n\nYes, there's NT71 \u2192 't69' (from the portion: NT71 -> 't69'). So yes, that's correct. So the first step is that the non-terminal NT71 expands to `t69`.\n\nNow, before `t69`, the next symbol is `t162`, which must come from the other non-terminal in the production that NT71 comes from. So NT71 comes from a production like NTab \u2192 NT71 NTcd, where the second part is NTcd, which must expand to `t162`. \n\nLooking through the grammar, is there a production where one of the non-terminals expands to `t162`? Wait, in the list, I see NT174 \u2192 't80' (from NT80 \u2192 't110'? Not sure). Alternatively, perhaps it's NT174 \u2192 't80', but no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals to see which non-terminals produce them:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69' (duplicate)\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT70 \u2192 't162'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69' (again)\n- NT71 \u2192 't69' (multiple times)\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT70 \u2192 't162'\n- NT95 \u2192 't130'\n- NT162 \u2192 perhaps? Wait, no, 't162' is a terminal. Hmm.\n\nSo, `t162` must come from a production where a non-terminal expands to it. Looking at the list, I see NT95 \u2192 't130' but not 't162'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again at the list:\n\nWait, in the production list, there's:\n\nNT80 \u2192 't67'\n\nWait, that can't be. I'm looking for `t80`. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for all productions that result in a terminal symbol, and see which NTs expand to which terminals. Let me list all NTs and their corresponding terminals:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT70 \u2192 't162'\n- NT67"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the string is made up of terminals, which are t followed by numbers, indicating tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it consists of a bunch of rules. Each rule on the left is a non-terminal, and the right side is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production only expands into two symbols, making it efficient for generating strings.\n\nThe string starts with `t118`, so I need to see which non-terminal can derive `t118`. Looking at the grammar, I see the production `NT96 -> NT1 NT108` and another `NT65 -> NT105 NT71`. Wait, but `t118` isn't directly listed. Let's check all the productions:\n\nWait, let me think. Each non-terminal can produce two symbols, so for each `tX`, I need to find a rule where one of the RHS symbols is `tX`. Let me scan through the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> NT83 NT70 (but 73 is a non-terminal, so not directly helpful)\n- NT96 -> NT33 NT36, but 33 and 36 are non-terminals.\n- NT12 -> NT91 NT69: 91 and 69 are non-terminals.\n- Checking further, looking for `T` rules with `tN` as a terminal.\n\nAh, here are some important rules where terminals appear:\n\n- NT96 -> NT105 NT71 on the RHS. Wait, no, looking for right-hand sides that have terminals. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT96 -> NT33 NT36: both non-terminals.\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107: NT35 is a non-terminal.\n- NT12 -> NT91 NT69: both terminals? Wait, NT12's production is NT91 and NT69. But in the string, we have `t12`. Wait, no. Let's check each rule:\n\nWait a minute, it seems like some rules produce terminals. Let me list them all again to see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT107 NT17\n- NT31 -> NT7 NT6\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT89 -> NT44 NT1\n- NT52 -> NT107 NT81\n- NT35 -> NT43 NT52\n- NT77 -> NT95 NT65\n- NT70 -> NT102 NT92\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT12\n- NT105 -> NT24 NT45\n- NT102 -> NT48 NT49\n- NT23 -> NT40 NT107\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n- NT16 -> 't93'\n- NT29 -> 't36' and 't156' and 't129'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT12 -> 't80'\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT39 -> 't144' and 't144' again\n- NT68 -> 't134' again\n- NT29 -> 't129'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT9 -> 't41'\n- NT76 -> 't178'\n- NT65 -> 't105' and 't8' (Wait, but 't8' is in NT65? So NT65 can produce 't8' directly?)\n\nWait, so looking at the rules, I see that NT99 has a production to 't6' and 't103'. So, for example, NT99 -> 't6' 'NT103'. NT68 has a production to 't28' and 'NT12' (which is 't80'), so NT68 can produce 't28 t80'.\n\nWait, but the string given has `t118`. Looking at the rules, is there any non-terminal that can directly produce 't118'? Let me check all the rules:\n\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107. No terminals here.\n- NT96 -> NT105 NT71. No.\n- NT67 -> 't67'? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't67'. Wait, maybe NT67's production is elsewhere. Let me check all rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any with 't67' as a terminal. So how does 't67' get into the string? Wait, maybe not, because in the string provided, it's `t118 t94 t96 t26 t144...`. So focusing on that.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is `t118`, 't94', 't96', 't26', etc. So I'm looking for rules that can produce these.\n\nLet's start by analyzing whether each token can be derived.\n\n1. `t118`: Does any rule directly produce 't118' as a terminal? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't118' directly. The rules with terminals are:\n\n- NT29 -> 't36' or 't156' or 't129'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT12 -> 't80'\n- NT9 -> 't134', 't41', etc.\n- NT76 -> 't178'\n- NT65 -> 't105', 't8'\n\nLooking, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't118'. So perhaps 't118' must be part of a larger production, but in the given grammar, no non-terminal has 't118' in any of its productions on the RHS. So how is 't118' being produced?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT11: NT11 -> 't17' and 't96'. Wait, no, looking through all the rules:\n\nNT11: No. Wait, let's check NT91. Does any rule for a non-terminal produce 't91'? Looking:\n\nNT91: Does any rule for NT91 have a terminal? Let's see, the rules:\n\n- NT91 -> 't9' and another rule. Wait, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal produces 't91'.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's `t91`. So perhaps it's part of a production. Wait, perhaps we can derive 't91' by going through a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps someone might think that the string is not possible, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in CNF, each production is length 2. So to get the given string, which is 14 tokens, each token is the result of a sequence of productions.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string uses 't118', 't94', 't96', 't26', etc., but 't26' comes from NT24: 't24' because 't26' is not a terminal in any rule. Wait, but looking for 't26' \u2014 no rule produces 't26'. Hmm, but in the given string, the user wrote 't26' as a token. Unless perhaps NT24 could produce something that includes 't26', but I don't see that.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't108'\n\n- NT77 -> 't56'\n\n- NT29 -> 't129'\n\n- NT96 -> 't157' and 't118'? Wait, looking at NT61 -> NT106 NT71, and NT106 -> NT7 NT92.\n\nWait, no, that's getting more complicated. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to generate the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string cannot be derived, as certain tokens aren't produced by any non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's think: can we derive `"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-253","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t145 t129 t56 t121 t99 t26 t104 t174 t72 t93 t124 t157 t112 t167 t11`.\n\nI know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. The grammar starts with S, and from there, we should be able to derive the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the non-terminals and terminals seem to be mapped to specific t-value representations. For example, certain NTs are mapped directly to 't' followed by a number. My task is to check if the string can be produced through these mappings.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual t-values and see how they might correspond to the grammar. Let's list them:\n\n1. t145\n2. t129\n3. t56\n4. t121\n5. t99\n6. t26\n7. t104\n8. t174\n9. t72\n10. t93\n11. t124\n12. t157\n13. t112\n14. t167\n15. t11\n\nNow, I'll check each t-value against the grammar rules to see if they match.\n\nStarting with S -> NT99 NT89, so S generates two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Let's see if these correspond to any t-values.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT99 is mapped to 't6' (from NT96 -> NT33 NT36, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT96 -> NT33 NT36 has t105 and t23, but that's not directly relevant here. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the mappings. Let me check.\n\nWait, I notice that certain NTs have t-values assigned in the rules. For example, NT77 -> 't56' (since NT77 -> t178 via something). Wait, looking back, in the grammar, some rules have 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFor example, look at this line: NT77 -> 't56'. Yes, so when NT77 is rewritten, it produces t56.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 -> 't156'. So if NT23 appears in a production, it becomes t156.\n\nSimilarly, NT99 -> 't6', NT89 -> 't0' looking through the grammar.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. Starting with S, it splits into NT99 and NT89. So both NT99 and NT89 must appear in the derivation tree.\n\nLet me check NT99. In the grammar, I see that NT99 is directly mapped to 't6'. So that's one part.\n\nNext, NT89. Looking at the grammar, NT89 -> 't0' according to the rules. So that's another part.\n\nWait, but looking more carefully, the grammar has multiple rules for some NTs. For example, NT89 can be derived from other NTs, but in this case, it's also directly mapped to 't0'. So NT89 can be 't0'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first t-value is t145. Wait, the string starts with t145, which is the first token. Let's see how t145 could be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, are there any rules that produce t145? Let's scan through the rules.\n\nIn the production for NT77: NT77 -> 't56' (from NT77 -> NT55 NT23, but actually, the rule says NT77->'t56'? Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT77 -> NT95 NT65.\n\nBut in the lines, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't56' (line: NT77 -> 't56').\n\nYes, so NT77->t56.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 is a non-terminal, and looking at the grammar, I see that NT55 is part of a production: NT81 -> NT55 NT23. Let me check if NT55 can produce any terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT55 is not directly given, but perhaps another rule can produce it. Looking through, maybe NT55 can be derived from other NTs. Alternatively, perhaps NT55 can be split into more NTs until terminals are reached.\n\nBut first, let's see where t145 comes from. In the string, the first token is t145. Is there any rule that produces t145?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule for NT that results in t145. Let me check each line for any terminal that starts with t145.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT171 has 't21' and 't171' but that's not t145.\n- NT145: I don't see any NT with 't145' as a production.\n- Similarly, NT45 has 't98', but I'm looking for t145.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules: NT174 -> 't117'? No, NT174 -> ... Hmm, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, let me re-express the entire grammar and see if any NTs have a production that results in t145.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nI think I might have missed that NT174 isn't present in any rule as a terminal, but maybe NT174 can split into more nodes until we get t145.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either two NTs or a terminal. So each t-value in the string must be generated directly by some NT.\n\nSo for each t-value in the string, the corresponding NT must have a production that maps directly to that t. Therefore, each t in the string must correspond to a production rule where that NT is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, let's compile a list of NTs that produce a t-term:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT99: t6\n- NT89: t0\n- NT24: t123\n- NT48: t11\n- NT76: t121\n- NT107: t94 (from NT107->t94?)\nWait, no: Let me find each rule.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n NT71 -> 't69'\n NT75 -> 't98'\n NT68 -> 't145' <---- Oh, here it is! NT68 produces t145.\nSo, NT68 -> t145.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other t-values:\n\nNT129: Does any NT produce t129? Looking through, I don't see NT129 mapping anywhere. Wait, perhaps NT129 is a composite of smaller NTs.\n\nWait, but in the derivation, we can have non-terminals split into other non-terminals until terminals.\n\nSo, to get 't129' as the second token, the NT must split into a sequence that eventually leads to 't129'.\n\nWait, but the grammar in CNF only allows derivations that split into NTs each step. So a terminal can only appear directly if there's a production for that NT.\n\nTherefore, for any t-value in the string, the corresponding NT must have a direct production rule that results in that t.\n\nSo let's go through each t in the string and see if the NT can directly produce it.\n\n1. t145: As I found, NT68-> t145. So NT68 must be present.\n\n2. t129: Do any NTs produce t129? Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly maps to t129. So I need to check if t129 can be derived via other NTs.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, perhaps NT129 is produced by other NTs. Let me look through each production for NT12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me re-express the grammar lines more clearly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the lines like NT12 -> t80 and NT81 -> t55 might not help.

{"custom_id":"request-258","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to figure out if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t123 t134 t105 t133 t141 t112 t93 t9 t171 t73 t170 t118 t115 t145 t91`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a simplified form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it makes the structure of the grammar very clear and facilitates parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm. Also, in CNF, every production starts with a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's indeed in CNF. Each production starts with a single non-terminal followed by either two non-terminals, another non-terminal, or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and so on. Some of the productions start with a terminal directly, like NT17 \u2192 't24', which is a terminal string.\n\nNext, I need to check each production and see if they can generate the given string. The string is a sequence of terminals, all of which are 't' followed by numbers. Since the grammar primarily uses non-terminals (NT) and terminals, I should see how these non-terminals can be expanded into the given sequence.\n\nI start by looking at the initial symbol S, which is the start symbol. According to the first production, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string must start with NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first three elements are t123, t134, t105. Wait, but S produces two non-terminals, so the initial expansion would be NT99 NT89. But the given string starts with three t's, which suggests that perhaps NT99 and NT89 can further expand into more terminals.\n\nWait, no. The string is `t123 t134 t105 t133 t141 t112 t93 t9 t171 t73 t170 t118 t115 t145 t91`. Let me count the number of tokens: that's 15 tokens. So the entire string is 15 terminals.\n\nNow, in the given grammar, each production (except the ones that produce terminals) splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals. The ones that directly produce terminals are like NT77 \u2192 't56', which is a short terminal string.\n\nSo, each non-terminal can be replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let's model this step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. So the first step would be to replace S with NT99 NT89. So after the first expansion, we have two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89.\n\nNext, each of these non-terminals can be replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal. So the total number of non-terminals can increase each time, but the terminals will replace when we reach the symbols that produce terminals.\n\nThe given string has 15 terminals. Let's see how the non-terminals can expand into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76 (from production NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76)\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT70 NT70\n\nWait, but perhaps this can go on. Alternatively, NT99 can expand into other paths as well.\n\nSimilarly, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT141 NT71\n\nNT141 is a terminal. Let me note that.\n\nWait, so NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT141 NT71.\n\nSo, in the string, 141 appears. That's part of the string. So NT89 can become NT44 NT1, then NT44 can become NT24 NT88, which then becomes 141 71. But wait, 71 is another terminal. So we might see 71 as well. But in the given string, I don't see 71, but let's check: the string ends with t91, so 91 is present. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at other non-terminals.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\n NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\n NT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11\n\n NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12\n\n NT28 \u2192 NT70 NT70\n\n NT70 \u2192 NT102 NT92\n\n NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49\n\n NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n\n NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n\n NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT103\n\n NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n\n NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23\n\n NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n\n NT67 \u2192 NT67 NT73? Wait, looking at NT67, I don't see a production in the given grammar. Wait, is there a production for NT67? Looking at the list, I don't see NT67, but I do see NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT15, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to trace the string through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal in the string to a possible derivation path.\n\nLooking at the given string: t123, t134, t105, t133, t141, t112, t93, t9, t171, t73, t170, t118, t115, t145, t91.\n\nLet me look for any terminals that are produced directly:\n\nFrom the grammar, we can see that NT16 \u2192 't112', NT17 \u2192 't24', NT19 \u2192 't99', NT31 \u2192 't121', NT42 \u2192 't139', NT57 \u2192 't159', NT76 \u2192 't45', NT99 \u2192 't134', NT102 \u2192 't13', NT12 \u2192 't80', NT36 \u2192 't47', NT89 \u2192 't60', NT107 \u2192 't94', NT57 \u2192 't159', NT102 \u2192 't13', NT11 \u2192 't96', NT48 \u2192 't11', NT42 \u2192 't139', NT11 \u2192 't96', etc.\n\nSo in the string, t112 is present, at the 6th position. Let's see that NT16 \u2192 't112'. Similarly, t24 is present (NT17). t134 is present (NT99 \u2192 't134' because NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76, and perhaps NT76 can become 't134'? Let's check.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar rules again. For NT76: is there a rule that produces it? Looking through the list, I don't see NT76 having a production that leads to a terminal or another non-terminal that can lead to a terminal. Wait, NT77 \u2192 t56, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better way is to see if the entire string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice that each non-terminal in the grammar can only expand into a certain number of terminals or further non-terminals. For example, S starts by expanding into two non-terminals, each of which can further split. But since each production is in CNF, each non-terminal is expanded into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that the string has 15 terminals, and each production can split into two non-terminals, the total number of split steps required would be such that 2^k = 2 * (number of terminals) or something, but perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in any derivation from S is 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. But here, the string has 15 terminals, so non-terminals would have been expanded into, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: let's see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But the string starts with 't54', so perhaps I need to find an NT that results in 't54'.\n\nChecking all 't' productions, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- ...\nWait, is there any Nt with 't54'? Let me scan the rules again. Hmm, looking through, I don't see any NT directly producing 't54'. Did I miss something? Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the list, I see NT24 \u2192 't123', NT48 \u2192 't11', etc. Wait, maybe the start of the string 't54' comes from NT24's production when split in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. \n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't54', so it must be the result of a production where the NT generates 't54'. Looking at the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't123', not 54. NT64 \u2192 't24'. NSo, maybe I need to see if there's a production that produces 't54' directly. Hmm, I don't see any NT directly producing 't54' in the rules. Maybe it's a combination, like a product that eventually reduces to 't54'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking through the rules. Let me go through the rules systematically. Starting from NT24, NT17, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production isn't directly 't54'. Maybe the string comes from expanding NT99 and NT89. Let me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\nSo the string must be derived from expanding NT99 and NT89 into sequences of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nNT99's production: I don't see it listed directly. Wait, looking through the rules, I think I might have missed it. Let me check again. \n\nWait, looking through the rules, I have NT99: I don't see it listed. Hmm. Let me check again. The production rules for NT99 might not be present. Wait, looking back, in the list, one rule is NT99 \u2192 't103', right? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in the given grammar, there's a rule: NT99 \u2192 't103'. So NT99 produces 't103', a terminal. Similarly, NT89 \u2192 't60'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT99 NT89 becomes 't103' 't60', but that's just the first step. But the string starts with 't54', so perhaps I'm on the wrong track.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the entire string must be built from the expansion of NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo the initial production would be S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Then, both NT99 and NT89 must expand into sequences of non-terminals, which eventually become the entire string.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's `t54 t108 t2 t1 t76 t41 t69 t47 t174 t130 t145 t124 t22 t162 t146 t124`.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT99 NT89 would generate a string that starts with the expansion of NT99 followed by the expansion of NT89. So the string must be [NT99's expansion] [NT89's expansion].\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is 't54', which comes from NT99. Let's look at NT99's expansions.\n\nLooking through the rules, does NT99 produce anything besides 't103'? Or is there another NT99 production? In the rules, I see a line: NT99 \u2192 't103', which is a terminal. That's the only production for NT99.\n\nSo NT99 \u2192 't103'. Therefore, S \u2192 NT99 NT89 would start with 't103', then the expansion of NT89. But the given string starts with 't54', not 't103'. That suggests that the string doesn't match because S would generate a string starting with 't103', not 't54'.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because the given string starts with 't54', but according to the grammar, S produces 't103 t60' if NT99 \u2192 't103' and NT89 \u2192 't60'. Therefore, the first token should be 't103', not 't54'. \n\nThis indicates that the given string doesn't align with the grammar, right? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait, did I get the NT99 production correct? Let me check the rules again. I see NT99 \u2192 't103' is present. Yes.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT99 NT89 \u2192 't103' 'something', where 'something' comes from NT89's production, which is 't60'.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with 't54'. That can't be, unless my understanding is wrong. So perhaps I've misread the rules or the string. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't54' and I need to see whether any production of ND's can lead to 't54' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules, the non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't123'\nNT17 \u2192 't22'\nNT48 \u2192 't11'\nNT45 \u2192 't98'\nNT22 \u2192 't112'\nNT57 \u2192 't172'\nNT77 \u2192 't124'\nNT40 \u2192 't21'\nNT1 \u2192 't107' and others.\nNT35 \u2192 various terminals.\nNT99 \u2192 't103'\nNT89 \u2192 't60'\n\nWait, are there any NTs that produce 't54'? It doesn't seem so. Because in the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't54'. The closest is NT24 \u2192 't123', which is a higher number.\n\nSo if the string starts with 't54', and all non-terminals that produce terminals have higher numbers or different starting points, then perhaps the string isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production isn't S \u2192 NT99 NT89. But the given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89 as the first production. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the string's first token is 't54', which we can't derive from any non-terminal in the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-274","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production has exactly two non-terminals or exactly one terminal. But for our purposes, it's important to note how the symbols are constructed from terminals and non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t22 t123 t169 t170 t169 t124 t118 t91 t69 t101 t60 t98 t98 t94 t133 t96`, and I need to check if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a lot of NT symbols like NT15, NT23, etc., and some of them expand into 't' followed by a number. Each 't' prefix seems to correspond to a unique combination of numbers. For example, NT7-> \"t21\", NT16->\"t112\", and so on.\n\nI think the strategy here is to work backwards from the string, breaking it down into the corresponding NT symbols and seeing if the overall structure of the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the beginning. The first symbol is 't22'. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces 't22'? From the provided rules, I see `NT17 -> 't22'`. So the first part of the string could be generated by NT17.\n\nNext, after 't22', the next symbol is 't123'. Let's check which NT produces 't123'. Scrolling through, I see `NT24-> 't123'`. So 't123' comes from NT24.\n\nNow, the second part of the string is 't123', which we've mapped to NT24. But wait, in the grammar, NT24 doesn't expand to anything else; NT24 is a terminal symbol, so it's a leaf node. So the string so far is NT17 -> 't22', followed by NT24->'t123'.\n\nPutting that into the structure, the substring starts with NT17 producing 't22', then NT24 producing 't123'.\n\nBut looking back, in the grammar, NT24 appears in other places, but in this case, the first part is NT17 and NT24, which are both terminals. That's okay because in the grammar, NT17 and NT24 are non-terminals that produce specific terminals, so that's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT24 -> 't123' is that correct? Let me double-check the grammar provided. Yes, under NT24, it's written as -> 't123', so that's a terminal production.\n\nSo, after 't22' comes 't123', which is from NT24. So the structure so far would be NT17 NT24.\n\nBut in the overall grammar, the start symbol S produces NT99 NT99. Wait, no, looking at the first rule: S->NT99 NT99. So the entire string must be generated by S, which expands into NT99 and NT99. But wait, no, the first rule is S->NT99 NT99, meaning both left-hand side symbols are NT99.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol S would produce two non-terminals in this case, S->NT99 NT99. So the entire string must be broken down into the productions leading to NT99 on both sides.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminals: t22, t123, t169, t170, t169, t124, t118, t91, t69, t101, t60, t98, t98, t94, t133, t96.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a specific NT. Let me list their corresponding NT symbols:\n\n1. t22 \u2192 NT17\n2. t123 \u2192 NT24\n3. t169 \u2192 NT42 (Assuming NT42 is t169)\n4. t170 \u2192 NT45\n5. t169 \u2192 NT42\n6. t124 \u2192 NT49\n7. t118 \u2192 NT106 (Wait, checking the grammar, NT106->'t118'? Let me confirm. Yes, under NT106: NT106-> 't118'. So t118 comes from NT106.\n8. t91 \u2192 NT19\n9. t69 \u2192 NT74\n10. t101 \u2192 NT68 (NT68's production: Wait, let's see. Looking at the grammar, NT68 has multiple rules. I notice NT68->'t145', NT68->'t45' (Wait, no. Let me check each occurrence: 't145' is under NT68: NT68 seems to have multiple expansions, including NT71->'t69', but 't145' is under some other NT? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, 't169' is under NT89, which is a production: NT89-> 't60'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the grammar in parts to see:\n\nLooking at NT24: NT24->'t123'\n\nSo t123 comes from NT24.\n\nThen, t169 comes from NT42. Let's check the grammar: looking for NT42. Hmm, in the given rules, I don't see NT42 explicitly unless it's a terminal. Wait, the user provided the grammar as a list, and I need to see which NT42 is a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is presented as a series of rules, each starting with NT followed by some parts, so each entry is a production like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, or NT24-> 't123'. So terminals have an arrow leading to a string of terminals and non-terminals, so if a production of NT24 is 't123', then NT24 is a non-terminal that only produces that one terminal.\n\nSo, to clarify, each NT can produce either a terminal (followed by others?) or two NTs. In this case, NT24 produces 't123'\u2014a single terminal.\n\nWait, but this seems too simple because the grammar has a lot of NTs with combined productions. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how to parse the string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the overall structure. The string starts with t22, which comes from NT17, then t123 from NT24. So the initial part is NT17 NT24.\n\nBut the grammar has S->NT99 NT99. So the entire string must be two copies of NT99, each expanding into something that eventually leads to the terminal string. So perhaps each NT99 must produce a string that starts with t22, then t123, etc.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily true. The string is just a sequence of 16 terminal symbols, and the grammar being S->NT99 NT99 might mean that the entire string is derived from two NT99 productions concatenated together.\n\nSo, to break down the string into possible components, perhaps it's made up of two parts: the first 8 symbols, the next 8 symbols. But perhaps it's better to see if the entire 16 symbols can be generated by NT99 expanding into t22 t123 t169 t170 t169 t124 t118 t91 t69 t101 t60 t98 t98 t94 t133 t96, which would imply that the entire string is the combination of two NT99 expansions.\n\nBut I might need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, trying to match it to the grammar rules. Since the string starts with t22, which is NT17->'t22', the beginning is NT17. Next is t123, which is NT24->'t123', so the continuation is NT24.\n\nSo the string starts with NT17 NT24. But the start symbol S produces NT99 NT99, so the entire production must be S = NT99 NT99.

{"custom_id":"request-295","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consist of two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually, Chomsky normal form allows each production to replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or one terminal, but all RHS must have exactly two symbols.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that the productions are all in CNF. For example, S -> NT99 NT89. So the start symbol S produces two non-terminals NT99 and NT89. Then each NT production is another non-terminal splitting into two other parts, often starting with NT or sometimes a terminal like 't'. The 't' symbols are terminals, meaning they are part of the output string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t157 t41 t154 t17 t1 t146 t139 t24 t94 t158 t97 t130 t133 t17 t157 t2`.\n\nFirst thought: Let's parse this string and see which symbols correspond to which non-terminals. The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers. Each 't' followed by a number is a literal terminal symbol.\n\nI think the approach is to try to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to the given string. That is, the start S should expand to the string step by step following the productions.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, doing this manually would take too much time. Instead, maybe I can map each terminal in the string to the corresponding non-terminal and see if there's a way to reach that non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are followed by numbers like NT15, NT89, etc. But some seem to have been rewritten to terminals, others remain as non-terminals. Wait, not all productions in the grammar have non-terminals; some have a mix.\n\nFor example, NT15 -> NT21 NT9, as seen in the grammar. Wait, but looking at the provided grammar lines, some have 't' symbols. For instance, NT16 -> 't112', meaning that NT16 produces a terminal string 't112'. Similarly, NT28 -> 't76', etc.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the rightmost non-terminal and see if each terminal in the string can be matched by the productions. Let me try to traverse the string and see if each term matches the possible productions.\n\nStarting from the end, looking at \"t2\", which is the last symbol. I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't2'. Looking at the grammar, I scan to find any non-terminals that have 't2' in their productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT28 -> 't76' \u2014 not relevant. NT67 -> 't67' \u2014 which is 't67'. NT84 -> 't17' \u2014 not 't2'. NT72 -> 't72' \u2014 not it. NT11 -> 't96' \u2014 not. NT44 -> 't165' \u2014 not. Wait, looking for 't2' somewhere. Hmm.\n\nWait, I see the production NT57 -> 't172'. Not. Also, NT75 -> 't98' \u2014 no. Maybe NT106 -> 't107' \u2014 no. NT77 -> 't56', etc. Wait, I'm not seeing any 't2' directly. Maybe I should check if there's a non-terminal that can derive 't2'. Alternatively, perhaps 't2' is a terminal, and I should check if it exists in any production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking through all the lines, I don't see any non-terminals producing 't2' as a terminal. So perhaps 't2' cannot be produced directly, which suggests that the string contains a terminal symbol that the grammar doesn't have a production for. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but before jumping to that conclusion, perhaps 't2' can be produced via some other path. Maybe through other non-terminals. For example, maybe NT48 -> 't11' followed by NT43 -> 't0', etc. Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a production that leads to 't2'.\n\nLooking again, let's list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nNT7 -> 't151' \u2014 No 't2'.\nNT9 -> 't134', 't41', 't169'.\nNT29 -> 't156', 't129'.\nNT43 -> 't2', which is the first occurrence of 't2'. So NT43 can produce 't2'. Great! So 't2' is produced by NT43. So that's good.\n\nThen the next term is 't157'. So we need to find what produces 't157'. Looking through the productions, NT157 appears in NT65 -> 't157' \u2014 so NT65 can produce 't157'. Similarly, NT157 also appears in NT48 -> 't157', I think \u2014 no, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT157 as a production unless it's part of a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT65 -> 't157' \u2014 yes. So NT65 -> 't157'. So the 't157' comes from NT65.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't2' (from NT43) is 't157', that would suggest that after NT43, the next step is to produce 't157', which would be a terminal. So NT43 -> 't2' and the next step is NT65 -> 't157'. So far, so good.\n\nNext term: 't41'. Where in the grammar is 't41' produced? Looking at the productions, I see NT9 -> 't41'. So 't41' comes from NT9.\n\nThen 't154'. So, which non-terminal produces 't154'? I need to scan the productions again. Looking at NT48 -> 't157', NT43 -> 't2', but perhaps others like NT198? No. Wait, looking through the list, I see NT61 -> 't157' and NT74 -> 't100', etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for any production that produces 't154'.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see any direct terminal 't154' except perhaps through other paths. Maybe a non-terminal that produces 't154' through some steps. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps 't154' is an error, but let me check again. Looking at NT154 -> 't146'? No, that's incorrect. Wait, looking through the grammar, for example, NT146 \u2014 does that exist? I don't recall seeing that. Maybe I need to look in more detail.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's try to represent the given string as a series of non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nThe string is: t2 t157 t41 t154 t17 t1 t146 t139 t24 t94 t158 t97 t130 t133 t17 t157 t2.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\n1. 't2' comes from NT43 -> 't2'.\n2. 't157' comes from NT65 -> 't157'.\n   So NT43 -> t2, NT65 -> t157.\n\nNow, the substring so far is 't2 t157', which corresponds to NT43 followed by NT65. So in the parse tree, that's a terminal 't2' and another terminal 't157'. In CFG, that could be the start symbol S -> ... which produces two non-terminals, which then each produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The entire string is the result of a leftmost derivation. So S expands first to two non-terminals, each of which may expand further until they become terminals.\n\nSo the string has multiple terminals; each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. The order in the string is the order of leftmost symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to work backward from the end of the string, using a top-down parsing approach called lookaheads or recursive descent.\n\nBut given the length of the string, let's try to split it into the production rules.\n\nThe string ends with 't2', which we know"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-298","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a series of tokens like `t164`, `t0`, etc. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar and see what it produces. The grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89, so S is the start symbol and it produces two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals then likely breaks down further into other non-terminals and eventually into terminal symbols (the `t` followed by numbers).\n\nLooking at the productions, each NT... rule seems to break down into two NT... rules. For example, NT15 -> NT75 NT57. Each of these has two non-terminals, so it's like a binary tree structure. Each step doubles the number of symbols, leading to a tree that eventually produces a string of terminals.\n\nThe target string is `t164 t0 t158 t157 t144 t127 t11 t47 t172 t167 t0 t8 t118 t170 t101 t67 t144`. That's a lot of tokens, 17 in total. I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards. The top-level symbol is S, which produces NT99 NT89. So the first tokens should correspond to the expansion of NT99 and NT89. Let me look at the end of the string. The last tokens are `t167 t0 t144`. Hmm, in the grammar, NT96 can produce t118 by the production NT96 -> t1 NT108. But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me break it down.\n\nLet me start by parsing the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt164, t0, t158, t157, t144, t127, t11, t47, t172, t167, t0, t8, t118, t170, t101, t67, t144.\n\nI'll try to match the end of the string to see if it corresponds to any terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the end part: ... t144. In the grammar, I see NT144 is produced in the rule NT16 -> t22? Wait, no, let's check the productions.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT144 isn't directly a production, but looking at NT91 -> t164, which is the first token. So perhaps the start is NT91. Wait, no, the start symbol is S, and S produces NT99 NT89. So the start string must be the concatenation of expansions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo S -> NT99 NT89. So the string starts with NT99 and ends with NT89. The first part is 8 tokens: t164, t0, t158, t157, t144, t127, t11, t47.\n\nAnd the second part is: t172, t167, t0, t8, t118, t170, t101, t67, t144.\n\nHmm, that's 9 tokens. Wait, but S should produce NT99 and NT89, each expanding into sequences, so the total number of tokens should be the sum of the lengths of the expansions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 17 in total. So 8 tokens for NT99 and 9 tokens for NT89.\n\nLooking at the first part: t164 t0 t158 t157 t144 t127 t11 t47 (8 tokens).\n\nWhat does NT99 expand into? Looking at the grammar, NT74 -> t146? Not sure. Wait, looking at NT99, I don't see it being directly expanded. Instead, looking at NT101 -> t69 + something? Hmm.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar rules more carefully. Starting from NT91, which produces t164 directly. So perhaps the start is NT91, but no, the start is S, which is NT99 NT89.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Each NT... is a non-terminal that can produce two other NT... non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rule NT91 -> 't164'. So NT91 can produce 't164' directly. Similarly, NT99 -> 't169' according to the grammar. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with many rules, some ending with 't...', which are terminal symbols, meaning they produce a single character.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT91 -> 't164'\n\nSo NT91 is a terminal in this context? Or is it a non-terminal that can produce 't164'?\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, if a production rule ends with a terminal symbol (like 't164'), that means the non-terminal can directly produce that string of terminals.\n\nWait, Chomsky Normal Form is usually two non-terminals on the right side, or a single terminal. So S -> NT99 NT89. Then NT99 and NT89 can each either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, some of the NT... rules have rules like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, which are two non-terminals, so NT15 is not a terminal. But others like NT91 -> 't164' are terminals.\n\nSo the terminal symbols are those with rules ending in 't...'.\n\nSo S starts the derivation by expanding into NT99 and NT89. Each of these can expand further into other non-terminals or into terminals.\n\nSo to parse the string, I need to see if it can be split into sequences that match the productions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nBut given the size, it's better to work backwards.\n\nLet me look at the end of the string:\n\n... t67, t144.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT67: does it have a rule that produces 't67'? Looking through the productions, NT67 is not appearing as a terminal. So NT67 is a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the other end: t144. Does any non-terminal produce t144 directly? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't144' in any NT's terminal production:\n\nNT144 is not directly a terminal because there's no rule like NT144 -> t144.\n\nWait, maybe looking at NT144's productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT144 is the start of a production for S? No, the start symbol is S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nWait, no, let me recheck. The grammar is:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nAnd then all the NT... rules.\n\nLooking for 't144' in the grammar's terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT144's productions?\n\nWait, looking through each rule, I see:\n\nNT16 -> 't22'\n\nNT22 -> 't...'?\n\nWait, this is going to take too long. Let me see if 't144' appears as a terminal in any production. Looking through the given rules:\n\nLooking for 't144' in the right-hand side of any rule.\n\nYes, I see NT84 -> t17, etc., but do any NT rules produce t144 directly?\n\nYes, here:\n\nNT19 -> 't99'\n\nNT96 -> 't91'\n\nNT15 -> 't154'\n\nWait, looking at the last part, is there any NT production that ends with t144?\n\nI see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice NT84 -> t17, but that's too short. Looking at the rules, does any NT have a terminal production of t144?\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't144'. So t144 must be a terminal, but it's not directly produced by any non-terminal. Wait, but that's impossible because in Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a terminal like t144 is present, it must be generated directly by an NT rule.\n\nBut looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT rule ending with t144. So maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, let's look again: The rules provided include:\n\nNT88 -> 't69'\n\nNT22 -> 't76'\n\nNT57"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-320","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string that I need to check whether it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume represents the terminal symbols of the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form (CNF) specifies that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I see that it's mostly in the form A \u2192 B C, except for the rules where A terminates, like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which ends with NT99 and NT89 being the terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t41 t108 t48 t49 t90 t139 t171 t21 t97 t21 t48 t11 t145 t99 t145 t24 t99` \n\nI notice that each part of the string is prefixed with 't', which probably stands for \"terminal\". So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers X might correspond to certain non-terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, most non-terminals are labeled as NT followed by numbers, like NT99, NT89, etc. So each of these is a non-terminal. Now, I need to see how each terminal token in the string maps to these non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 'tX' corresponds to a production step in the derivation. So, the string's tokens represent a sequence of transitions, and I need to see if the derivation can produce this exact sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string has 17 tokens, which suggests that it's a sequence of 17 terminals. Each of these tokens must be reachable from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nBut considering the string's length is 17, I wonder if it's a leftmost derivation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the number of steps in the derivation is related to the number of symbols derived.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, each production expands a non-terminal into two others, except when it terminates. So, the derivation process starts at S and splits into two, and each step either splits a non-terminal into two others or stops.\n\nLet me see if I can map the string's tokens to the productions. Each 'tX' represents a terminal, so for the string to be valid, the derivation must produce these in order. Let me list the token numbers for clarity:\n\n1. t41\n2. t108\n3. t48\n4. t49\n5. t90\n6. t139\n7. t171\n8. t21\n9. t97\n10. t21\n11. t48\n12. t11\n13. t145\n14. t99\n15. t145\n16. t24\n17. t99\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S produces two non-terminals. The first step would be to expand S into NT99 and NT89. Now, I need both NT99 and NT89 to eventually produce the corresponding terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t41. So let's check what rule produces t41. Scanning the grammar, I find that NT9 is defined as NT107 NT17, and NT17 isn't a terminal. Wait, maybe looking for the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the right-hand sides of rules that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t49\n- NT68 \u2192 t134\n- NT29 \u2192 t156\n- NT68 \u2192 t121\n- NT29 \u2192 t129\n- NT81 \u2192 t71\n- NT9 \u2192 t41\n- NT69 \u2192 t1\n- NT74 \u2192 t100\n- NT16 \u2192 t54\n- NT20 something? Wait, looking through the grammar more carefully, I notice that NT9 is defined as producing certain things, but looking for the rules that produce 't41' directly.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule that ends with a terminal symbol. For example, NT9 \u2192 t41, as per the grammar (line: NT9 -> 't41').\n\nSo NT9 can directly produce 't41'. Similarly, other NTs produce different terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t41. So perhaps the first production is NT9 \u2192 t41. But looking back at the grammar, the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S splits into NT99 and NT89. How do these NT99 and NT89 produce the subsequent terminals?\n\nWait, NT99 is split from S. Let's look at the grammar for NT99. Scanning through, I see NT99 \u2192 't90' (line: NT99 -> 't90').\n\nWait, line: NT99 -> 't90'. So NT99 directly produces 't90'. So the first production would be that NT99 generates t90. But the string starts with t41, not t90. That's a problem. That suggests that perhaps the initial S cannot generate this string because the first part would generate t90 or another terminal that doesn't match the first token.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The string starts with t41. So after starting at S, which splits into NT99 and NT89, what do those produce?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't90'\n- NT89 \u2192 't60' (line: NT89 -> 't60')\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the first step is to have t90 from NT99 and t60 from NT89. So the initial step would produce terminals t90 and t60 in order. But the string starts with t41, not t90 or t60. That's a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar uses leftmost derivation, so perhaps one of the NTs produces a string that can include t41 at some point.\n\nWait, no. The first productions from S are T99 and T89, which generate t90 and t60. So immediately after S, the derived string would be t90 t60. The given string starts with t41, so it's unclear how that happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is structured. Maybe each token represents a single terminal, so the string is a sequence of terminals that must be generated in order from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' is a literal symbol, and the number represents its identity. For example, t41 is a terminal symbol, and we need to see if the entire string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo, the string is t41, t108, t48, t49, t90, t139, t171, t21, t97, t21, t48, t11, t145, t99, t145, t24, t99.\n\nGiven that S branches into NT99 and NT89, and each of those needs to produce the necessary sequence of t's.\n\nLet me see: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So NT99 must produce a sequence that includes the first few t's, and NT89 must produce the latter part.\n\nWait, let's break down the string. The first part is t41. So perhaps NT99 can produce t41 followed by something else. But from the grammar, NT99 produces 't90', not 't41'. So NT99 cannot start the string with t41.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other non-terminals that when combined can produce t41. But looking through the grammar, the only rule that produces t41 is NT9 \u2192 't41' (line: NT9 -> 't41').\n\nSo, to get t41, the non-terminal must be NT9. But S is NT99 NT89, which doesn't include NT9. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to start with t41 because S's first productions are t90 and t60.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the non-terminals can combine to produce another non-terminal that can then produce t41. For example, perhaps some other rule allows a non-terminal to produce another non-terminal which in turn can produce t41.\n\nLet me check if there's a rule that has NT9 as part of the RHS. Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> NT7, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, actually, looking at the rules, for example, NT99 is only a terminal in the production NT99 \u2192 't16', 't12', etc., but in this case, I don't see NT99 producing t76 directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see which non-terminals directly produce t76. Looking through the rules, I see NT67 \u2192 NT98 NT73, but that doesn't directly give t76. Then, looking at NT28 \u2192 't76'. So, NT28 directly produces 't76'. That's a possible starting point.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't76', which comes from NT28. Now, looking at the grammar, what does NT28 produce? Looking at the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT70 NT76. Wait, that's not correct because NT28 is supposed to produce two non-terminals. So if NT28 is used, then it would split into two non-terminals. But the first symbol is 't76', which directly comes from NT28, which seems contradictory because normally NT28 would produce two non-terminals, not directly a terminal. Did I miss a rule?\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar might have some rules where non-terminals produce terminals. Looking through the rules, I see entries like NT99 \u2192 t6 NT103, which suggests that NT99 can produce 't6' and NT103, but I don't see 't76' being a direct terminal. Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules provided, I see NT28 \u2192 t76. Yes, that's one of the rules. So, NT28 can directly produce 't76'. Therefore, the first symbol can be produced by NT28. So the string starts with 't76', which corresponds to NT28.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't90'. Let's see where 't90' comes from. Looking at the grammar rules, NT90 is not present as a terminal, unless I'm misreading. Wait, in the rules, I see NT9 -> 't134', which is a specific production. So perhaps 't90' comes from NT9. So looking for NT9, but in the given rules, I don't see NT9 as a terminal, but I see NT9 -> 't134'. Hmm, that's not 't90'. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, looking for other NT symbols that produce 't90' directly. I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't90'. So maybe 't90' comes from a non-terminal's production, but I'm not seeing it yet.\n\nWait, perhaps 't90' comes from another path. Let me think. If the first part is NT28 \u2192 t76, then the second symbol 't90' must come from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and then NT99 and NT89 produce something. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar. The starting symbol is S, which produces NT99 NT89. So the entire string must be a derivation starting from S. Therefore, the string is a sequence of symbols produced by the S rule, possibly through intermediate steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the production steps. Let's think differently: the string is given, and each token must come from a terminal production from some non-terminal in the grammar. So I can try to build a parse tree where each terminal in the string is derived from a production that ends in that terminal.\n\nLet's start by examining the entire string and seeing if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string: t76 t90 t157 t24 t97 t91 t118 t154 t69 t154 t93 t65 t177 t47 t47 t130 t101 t110.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t76. From the grammar, the only non-terminal that directly produces t76 is NT28 \u2192 t76. So, the first part of the string starts with NT28, which produces t76.\n\nSo, the first symbol is from NT28. Then, the next symbol is t90. Let's see what non-terminals can produce t90.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't90'. Wait, but maybe it's produced indirectly. Let's think about the NT that could produce 't90'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't90' is part of a production chain. Let's see the possible NTs that can lead to 't90'. Let me look through the rules again.\n\nWait, I see NT37 \u2192 t65 NT57. Not helpful. NT78 \u2192 t29 NT24. NT29 is involved. NT24 \u2192 t123. Hmm, not 't90'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for 't90' in the string, I can see which symbols come after 't90'. Let's see the string: t76, t90, t157, etc. Maybe t157 is produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce t157. For example, NT28 \u2192 t76 (already used), NT157 is not present in the rules. Wait, let's check for t157. I see NT65 \u2192 t157 in one instance and NT157 in another place, but not directly as a terminal. Alternatively, looking at the production rules, I see NT157 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal that produces something else.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 t72, but that's terminal. Wait, NT55 is used in some other production, like NT55 \u2192 t72. So perhaps 't72' can be derived from NT55.\n\nBut the string has 't157'. Let me see if any NT produces t157.\n\nIn the rules, I see NT65 \u2192 t157 is one option. So, NT65 \u2192 t157.\n\nSo, if we have t157 in the string, it must come from NT65. So, perhaps the string's third token is t157, which comes from NT65. So, the sequence after t76 t90 would involve NT65 \u2192 t157.\n\nBut in the string, it's t76 (from NT28), then t90, then t157. So, after t90 comes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-336","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and I need to figure out if the string \"t23 t91 t154 t130 t50 t177 t96 t151 t112 t146 t1 t93 t154 t56 t50 t76 t0 t63 t145\" is generated by this grammar. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. So, the grammar given here is in CNF because all the rules seem to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for some specific ones which produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see they start from S and go down into various non-terminals, each splitting into two non-terminals. Some of them have productions that directly lead to terminals with 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT17 \u2192 't22', which is a terminal. This reminds me that these non-terminals eventually derive into these terminal strings.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of 't's with numbers. The first thing I notice is that the string starts with t23. So, the first non-terminal in the string must derive into t23. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT23 has a production NT23 -> NT40 NT107. So, NT23 needs to split into NT40 and NT107. Then, each of these, if they're non-terminals, will have their own productions.\n\nContinuing down, after NT23 comes NT40. The production for NT40 is NT40 -> NT33 NT64. So, NT40 is NT33 and NT64. NT33 has a production NT33 -> NT80 NT23. Wait, that's not right because after NT33 comes another NT23, but in the string, after t23 (which is NT23) comes t91, not t40. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parse tree. Each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the parse tree should generate this sequence in a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The first token is t23, so that implies NT23 as the root. Then, according to NT23's production, it splits into NT40 and NT107. So the next part of the string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT40 and NT107.\n\nLooking at the production of NT40: NT40 -> NT33 NT64. So now, the next tokens should be generated by NT33 followed by NT64. NT33's production is NT33 -> NT80 NT23. So after NT33, we expect NT80 and NT23. But in the string, after t23 (from NT23) comes t91, which is after t40 (which we just started with). Wait, the string is t23 t91 t154... but according to NT23 \u2192 NT40 NT107, then 40 comes first, then 107. So the next tokens after t23 should be the string from NT40 and then from NT107.\n\nBut in the given string, after t23 comes t91. So let me see what NT40 produces. NT40 is split into NT33 and NT64. NT33 splits into NT80 and NT23, so t80 and t23. But in the string, after t23 is t91, which would have to be part of NT64's production. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, after t23, perhaps it's handling the first part from NT107. Wait, the production of NT23 is NT40 NT107. So the first step is that the parse tree has NT23 with children NT40 and NT107. So the string is generated by NT40 followed by NT107. So the first tokens are from NT40, then from NT107.\n\nSo, after t23, the next token is t91. So looking at the first part, which is NT40 (t40). Wait, but in the given string, the first token is t23, then t91. That would mean that the first part generated by NT40 is t91. But looking at the production of NT40, NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64. So maybe NT33 is generating t91, and NT64 is generating something else.\n\nWait, let me check NT33's production. NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23. So NT33 produces two tokens: the first from NT80, then from NT23. So after t23, the next should be from NT80. But in the string, after t23 comes t91, which doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production of NT40 is NT33 NT64, so when we derive NT40, we first derive the subtree of NT33, giving tokens t80 and t23, then the subtree of NT64. So the order would be t80, t23, followed by whatever comes from NT64. So after t23, the next should be t80, but that's not matching the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t23, then t91. So perhaps the initial NT23 produces NT40, which in turn produces NT107, which in turn produces t91. But no, because NT107's production is NT177 NT96 or other terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's NT107 \u2192 NT96 NT94 maybe? Wait, I should check the given grammar.\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT106 -> NT35 NT107\nNT107 -> NT96 NT118\nWait, no, looking at the given rules, I need to find NT107's production. Let me scan through the given rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\nI don't see NT107 \u2192... directly. Wait, the grammar as provided has some lines, and some non-terminals map to terminals with 't' numbers. So, for NT107, in the given rules, I don't see an immediate production, but I think I can see in the rules above that NT107 is a non-terminal because it's on the left-hand side of some productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again:\n\nIn the given list, there's NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107. So NT106 is a non-terminal. Also, looking at NT107, I don't see it on the left-hand side elsewhere except in the list... Wait, no, I think perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the given list, I see lines like:\n\nNT91 -> NT6 NT17\nNT76 -> NT45 NT71\nNT107 -> 't91' etc.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps in the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-338","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t67 t134 t73 t26 t9 t169 t123 t76 t174 t162 t121 t110 t54 t47 t63 t151 t22 t157 t72` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, looking at the grammar, it's pretty big with many productions, so parsing the string manually might be a bit tricky. But let's approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules for clarity. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all in the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a (terminals). Each non-terminal on the left produces exactly two other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string we have is a sequence of these terms, and terminal symbols here are all the 't' followed by numbers. Each production rule can expand two non-terminals into either two non-terminals or a terminal and another non-terminal, etc. So each production step would break down the string into smaller parts.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to systematically apply the grammar to the string. The string has 19 elements, so each step of applying productions would reduce this number by half, but it's better to approach it as a derivation.\n\nI'll consider the entire string as the left-hand side (LHS) of the grammar and try to expand it step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. The string is `t67 t134 t73 t26 t9 t169 t123 t76 t174 t162 t121 t110 t54 t47 t63 t151 t22 t157 t72`. Let me check if the entire string can be matched to the right-hand side (RHS) of this production. The RHS is NT99 and NT89. So, the entire string should be split into two parts, each part being the RHS of NT99 or NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99 and NT89 in the grammar. Let's see what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nSo, each of these will further split into two parts. Let's see what NT6, NT44, NT1, and others produce.\n\nWait, NT1 is a production that ends with 't26', according to `NT1 -> NT107 NT17`, and then further down, NT17 \u2192 't22'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, at some point, it's mentioned that NT17 \u2192 't22'. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe grammar has:\nNT17 \u2192 't22'\n\nSimilarly, NT18 \u2192 't35' and so on. So, looking at the string, `t26` corresponds to NT1 because `NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17`, and then NT17 \u2192 't22'. Wait, no, the production for NT17 is 't22', so NT17 is terminal. But in the string, we have `t26`.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's check each terminal in the string against the grammar.\n\nThe string includes t67, t134, t73, etc. Let's take each one and see what they correspond to.\n\nLooking at t67: Is this a known terminal? Looking through the grammar, I don't see an explicit terminal for 67. Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking for A \u2192 a where a is the string ending with t67 or any other t followed by a number.\n\nWait, the grammar is extensive, so perhaps the terminals are only those that appear as a result of some productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are rules like NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, and if NT103 is a non-terminal, then perhaps the string t103 would be there. But in our string, we have t67, which isn't mentioned as a terminal directly. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the terminal symbols are all the 't' followed by numbers. So t67 is a terminal, but I need to check if it's produced by some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for each non-terminal, it's defined in terms of other non-terminals or terminals. So, let's check if any non-terminals expand to t67.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any rules that produce t67 directly. For example, NT67 isn't in the grammar. Wait, but maybe it's a result of expansion. For example, NT67 could be produced by a production rule, but the grammar doesn't have that. Hmm, maybe t67 is a terminal that doesn't appear in any expansion, which would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But that doesn't make sense because the grammar might have a path to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the productions to see if any non-terminal can derive to t67.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT67 is not a non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, t67 cannot be derived from any production, so the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because the string contains t67, which is a terminal that doesn't appear as a right-hand side of any production, the entire string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. Because any production rule in the grammar would only expand a non-terminal to two other symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. Since t67 is a terminal that doesn't appear in any right-hand side of a production rule, it can never be part of any derived string. Therefore, since the input string contains t67, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nSo, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-354","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is quite dense with productions, so I'll need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. Each production seems to split the non-terminal into two smaller non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals are all strings starting with 't' followed by numbers, except for the start symbol S, which is broken into NT99 and NT89.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t100 t118 t0 t167 t96 t98 t93 t56 t156 t48 t112 t72 t96 t174 t170 t162 t177 t134 t63 t156.\n\nI'll start by looking at the productions and seeing if I can trace back from the string to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens:\nt100, t118, t0, t167, t96, t98, t93, t56, t156, t48, t112, t72, t96, t174, t170, t162, t177, t134, t63, t156.\n\nLooking at the top-level productions in the grammar, S -> NT99 NT89. So the initial expansion of S would split into NT99 and NT89, each of which are non-terminals that need to be expanded further until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me check if t100 and t118 can be generated by NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 has a production: NT99 -> NT6 NT103. So t99 comes from NT6 and NT103.\n\nBut wait, t100 and t118 are part of the string, so I'm not sure if they appear in the NT productions. Maybe I should see which NTs generate these t tokens.\n\nWait, let's look at the NT productions to see if they generate the t values present in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT12 is defined as NT91 NT69, which ends in t96 and others, but I don't see any production for NT12 that includes t118.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for productions that end in the t tokens. For example, NT100 -> t127. So if there's a NT100, it can generate t127. But in the string, we have t100.\n\nLooking for any NT production that results in t100. Hmm, I don't see a direct production where NT100 generates 't100'. Wait, maybe NT100 can be expanded via another production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT100 -> NT67 NT73. So it would split into two non-terminals.\n\nThen, NT67 is a production, but looking through the grammar, I don't see a production that ends in t67. Wait, NT73 is another option.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. In the productions:\n\nNT67 -> NT67 NT73 (Wait, no, checking the provided grammar lines... Oh, actually, I don't see NT67 as a non-terminal with a production except as part of other productions.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me look for any non-terminals that produce t118. Scanning through the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't118'. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT99 and NT89 can generate t118 through their expansions. But I'm not seeing any obvious path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should work backwards from the string, trying to match each token to possible grammar productions.\n\nLet me look at the first token: t100. I need to see which non-terminal can produce 't100'. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that ends with t100. So perhaps I need to see if any of the NTs can produce t100 via their rules.\n\nWait a moment, looking through the productions, I see NT96 -> t98, but that's not helpful. NT12 -> 't80', but we have t72. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are several NTs that produce a mix of NTs and t's. Maybe I should check each token in the string and see if I can backtrack through the grammar to see if each can be generated by some NT.\n\nFor example, t100: Is there any production that generates t100? Looking through the grammar, I don't see such a production. Hmm, that's a problem because the string includes 't100', but if it can't be generated by any non-terminal, the answer would be No.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Maybe some non-terminals can generate t tokens directly.\n\nLooking again, let me list all the productions that result in t tokens:\n\nNT9 -> 't134'\n\nNT7 -> 't151'\n\nNT9 -> 't41'\n\nNT76 -> 't45'\n\nNT42 -> 't139'\n\nNT42 -> 't158'\n\nNT84 -> 't102'\n\nNT29 -> 't156'\n\nNT29 -> 't129'\n\nNT16 -> 't54'\n\nNT77 -> 't124'\n\nNT49 -> 't115'\n\nNT107 -> 't174'\n\nNT177 -> 't94'\n\nNT69 -> 't171'\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me see if any of these can generate the 't' tokens in the string.\n\nSo looking at the first token in the string: 't100'. Is there an NT production that can lead to 't100'? Looking through the list, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't100'. That seems to be a problem because the string starts with 't100', which can't be generated by any of the NTs.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't100' is generated through a multi-step process, maybe via intermediate NTs. For example, maybe one NT produces another NT, which then produces 't100'. Let me see: looking at the grammar, for example, NT96 -> 't105' and NT105 can generate more NTs, but I don't see a path that leads to t100.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong grammar. Maybe 't100' is generated by NT100, but as I checked earlier, NT100 is broken into NT67 and NT73, which don't seem to produce t100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't100' can be generated via some other NT. Wait, looking back, I see that NT68 -> 't12', and other NTs may lead to t100, but it's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try a top-down approach starting from S, trying to generate the string. Let's see: S splits into NT99 and NT89. Then NT99 splits into NT6 and NT103. Let's see what NT6 and NT103 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT6's production: NT6 -> 't96', that's a terminal. So in the string, that's why I see 't96' in the middle. Then NT103: looking at the grammar, NT103 -> 't156'. So NT103 would produce 't156'.\n\nSo the initial split of S into NT99 and NT89 would produce t96 (from NT6) and t156 (from NT103). That means the string must start with t96, but in our case, the string starts with t100, which is different. Therefore, the NT99 cannot generate the t100 as the first token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the top-down parsing works. Maybe the NT99 and NT89 can generate the tokens in a way that other NTs are produced that include t100 as part of their expansion. But given that NT96 is 't96', and NT103 is 't156', the initial expansion would produce t96 and t156, which are both present in the string, but the string starts with t100, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe S generates NT99 and NT89, which themselves can generate other NTs, which may include t177, t100, etc. Let me check if any NT in the grammar can generate 't100'.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT directly generating 't100'.

The string is: `t112 t24 t151 t130 t123 t65 t144 t115 t90 t93 t167 t118 t110 t93 t24 t60 t2 t130 t164 t112`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) allows each production to be in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a terminal. The grammar starts with S and builds up using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the productions for non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT89, etc.) are in the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, except where a terminal is directly used, like some NT productions ending with 't' followed by a number, such as NT77 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). Since the grammar starts with S generating two non-terminals, the string must be a result of expanding these two non-terminals down to the terminals.\n\nI can approach this by trying to parse the string from the bottom up, but that can get complicated. Alternatively, I can reconstruct how the string might have been generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's note that the grammar's right-hand sides either produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. The top-level string is built by two non-terminals, each of which could expand into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t112, t24, t151, t130, t123, t65, t144, t115, t90, t93, t167, t118, t110, t93, t24, t60, t2, t130, t164, t112.\n\nThis is 19 tokens. Since S starts as two non-terminals, the string must be the result of expanding both NT99 and NT89.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two or more non-terminals on the right, or a terminal. Looking at the rules, most of them are combinations of non-terminals except for the ones that directly produce terminals (like 't' followed by a number). These terminal productions are the leaves of the grammar, so the generated strings are made up by combining these terminals via the non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t174 t169 t110 t165 t54 t0 t71 t17 t91 t99 t93 t157 t133 t51 t50 t164 t24 t171 t115 t169 t22`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar's production rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start, ensuring that each segment corresponds to the productions in the grammar. Let's start by looking at the possible rules that produce these 't' strings.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces NT99 NT89. So, the string should start with NT99 and NT89. Let's check the beginning of the string. It starts with 't174 t169', but in the grammar, NT99 is 't6' and NT89 is 't60'. Wait, that doesn't match. But looking back, the grammar has NT99 -> NT69 and NT89 -> NT60. So, NT99 produces 't69' and NT89 produces 't60'. But in the string, it starts with t174 and t169. That doesn't align. Did I misinterpret the NT99 and NT89 productions?\n\nWait, the grammar rules are:\n\nNT99 -> NT69\n\nNT89 -> NT60\n\nSo, S -> NT99 NT89 would produce t69 t60. But the string starts with t174 and t169. That's different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT69: NT69 -> NT84 NT133. Because the rules are:\n\nNT69 -> NT84 NT133\n\nNT21 -> NT171 NT91\n\nWait, but looking at NT21, it's actually in the list as:\n\nNT21 -> NT171 NT91.\n\nBut in the string, we have t174 first. That's confusing. Maybe I should list all the possible NT productions and their terminals to see if any of them match.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, each rule is of the form NTxxx -> NTyy NTzz or NTxxx -> 't' followed by some number. So, for each NTxxx, the production either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal string.\n\nI need to check each 't' in the string and see if it's covered by any NT rule. Let's list the 't' terms in the string:\n\nt174, t169, t110, t165, t54, t0, t71, t17, t91, t99, t93, t157, t133, t51, t50, t164, t24, t171, t115, t169, t22.\n\nNow, I'll look for each of these terminals in NT rules.\n\nFor t174: Is there any NT rule that produces t174? Looking through the grammar, for example, NT68 -> NT46 (from earlier list: NT68->NT24 NT12), and later NT26 is in NT44: NT44->NT24 NT88, etc. Wait, let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT43 -> 't2'\n- NT42 -> 't165'\nWait, no, looking at the NT rules, I see NT31 -> NT7 NT6. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to map each terminal to the NT rule that produces it. For example:\n\n- 't174' is produced by NT174, but looking through the rules, I don't see NT174. Wait, in the list, NT174 is present as:\n\nWait, I need to scan the grammar rules for any NTxxx that ends with a terminal t... For example, NT99 -> NT69 (i.e., t69), NT89 -> NT60 (t60). But in the string, we have t174, which isn't directly listed. Wait, maybe it's produced through several steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of these 't' values is produced by a unique NT production. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT11 -> NT81 NT29\n- NT29 -> 't36'\n- NT29 also -> 't156'\n- Similarly, other terminals are produced from specific NT rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each 't' is a terminal symbol, and they must appear exactly as the result of a specific production. So for each 't' value, I need to check if there's an NT rule that directly produces it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT16 -> t54\n- NT11 -> t17\n- NT48 -> t11\n- NT77 -> t56\n- NT24 -> t123\n- NT12 -> t80\n- NT9 -> t134\n- NT39 -> t144\n- NT68 -> t134\n- NT29 -> t129\n- NT81 -> t71\n- NT9 -> t41\n- NT76 -> t45\n- NT65 -> t105\n- NT73 -> t167\n- NT15 -> t90\n- NT71 -> t69\n- NT73 -> t90\n- NT52 -> t177\n- NT21 -> t171\n- NT43 -> t2\n- NT33 -> t23\n- NT80 -> t63\n- NT49 -> t157\n- NT69 -> t1\n- NT100 -> t127\n- NT108 -> t118\n- NT65 -> t157\n- NT46 -> t99\n- NT39 -> t48\n- NT96 -> t91\n- NT19 -> t99\n- NT23 -> t171\n- NT57 -> t172\n- NT77 -> t124\n- NT49 -> t115\n- NT84 -> t102\n- NT9 -> t169 Wait, no, NT9 is 't134'.\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is: `t94 t80 t174 t178 t0 t105 t165 t50 t124 t172 t112 t41 t67 t23 t124 t104 t102 t97 t45 t102 t157`.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. A grammar in CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar starts with S and consists of productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit extensive with many productions. Each non-terminal (like S, NT15, NT89, etc.) produces other non-terminals or terminals labeled 't' followed by a number. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step.\n\nThe string provided starts with t94, which I need to trace back through the productions to see how it can be formed. So, looking at the grammar, I see that NT89 can produce t1 and t65 (looking at the production NT89 \u2192 NT73 NT76, but wait, that doesn't lead to t1. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 't99' but not t94. Looking at the list, I see NT89 \u2192 NT73 NT76, and then NT73 has some productions. For example, NT73 can produce NT83 NT70 and also NT6 NT39, among others. There's a production where NT73 \u2192 't167' for instance.\n\nBut I need to see if t94 can be produced. Let's look through the productions. I see that NT93 can produce NT15 NT77, and NT15 can produce 't154'. Hmm, not getting t94. Wait, maybe NT48 produces NT106 NT31, and NT106 can produce NT35 NT107, and so on. Let me try to find where t94 is produced.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT57 \u2192 't172', but that's for NT57, not NT89. Wait, NT89 \u2192 NT73 NT76. Let me see where 't94' comes from. Scanning the productions, I see NT92 \u2192 't41' and 't171', but not t94. Wait, NT43 \u2192 't2' and 't99', but that's for NT43. Hmm.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step. The string starts with t94. I need to find a production that leads to t94. Looking through the productions, I see that NT42 \u2192 't139', NT49 \u2192 't115', NT57 \u2192 't172', NT92 \u2192 't17', 't41', 't171', 't146', 't27', etc. Hmm, not seeing t94 yet.\n\nWait, perhaps t94 comes from a higher-level non-terminal. Let me look at NT65: it can produce t8 or t157. Hmm. Or NT71 can produce t69 or t17. NT97 can produce 't144'. Wait, I'm not seeing where t94 is coming from yet.\n\nWait, looking at NT42: it has multiple productions, including 't165' and 't158', but not t94. Wait, let me check each NT that can produce a 't*'. For example, NT29 can produce 't156' and 't129'. NT16 can produce 't54'. NT24 can produce 't123' and 't12'. NT36 can produce 't47'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that each 't' in the string must be derived from a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, each 't' number must correspond to a production where the non-terminal directly produces that 't'. So, looking for 't94', I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t94.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT19 can produce t99, and NT29 can produce t129 and t156. But where does t94 come from? Wait, looking at NT42: it's NT42 \u2192 't139', 't158', and 't166'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see NT42 \u2192 't139' once and 't158' once. Hmm, not matching t94.\n\nWait, let me look at the rule NT42: NT42 \u2192 't139', 't158'. So, t94 isn't directly produced by any NT in this grammar. Therefore, the string starts with t94, which can't be derived because there's no production rule that directly produces t94.\n\nWait, but perhaps t94 comes from a chain of productions. For instance, maybe there's a non-terminal somewhere that can produce t94 through several steps. Let me check if any of the NTs can produce 't94' in a multi-step process.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t94. Hmm. Wait, perhaps t94 is part of a longer chain. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chain where s \u2192 ... \u2192 t94. Since t94 can't be produced directly, perhaps it's involved in a longer production that eventually leads to t94.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't65', 't178'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't35', 't43'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't156', 't124'\n\n- NT73 has some 't' productions, like 't167', 't90'\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't99', etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have overlooked t94 in the productions. Let me go through each line again carefully.\n\nHere's the list of productions with 't':\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't178'\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't167'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't154'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't124', 't56'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't2', 't99'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't177', 't24'\n\n- NT106 \u2192 't92', 't35'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't75', 't52'\n\nWait, none of these produce 't94'. Hmm, so where is 't94' coming from?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking at NT96 lines, I see:\n\nNT96 \u2192 't157', 't1'\n\nNT53? No, there's no NT53. Wait, the lines I have are up to NT108 \u2192 't118'. Let's see:\n\nLooking for t94:\n\nI don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't94'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't94'. That suggests that somehow 't94' needs to be derived from the grammar. Since none of the productions directly produce 't94', perhaps the string cannot be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't94' is part of a longer chain where a non-terminal produces another non-terminal that eventually leads to 't94', but given that there's no direct way to produce 't94', it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with 't94', which cannot be derived from the grammar, so the answer should be 'No' because t94 cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. In this case, the start symbol seems to be S, as the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. The other non-terminals are labeled NT followed by numbers, except for some cases where terminal symbols (t) are used. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: `t41 t69 t157 t80 t13 t65 t93 t63 t124 t101 t9 t130 t63 t9 t141 t145 t139 t11 t105 t67 t17 t1`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S. Given the size of the string and the complexity of the grammar, I'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, matching the productions step by step. Since this is a CNF grammar, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so each step of the derivation should correspond to a specific production.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and the grammar's rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So the string should start with the concatenation of these two, meaning the first two parts should somehow expand into these non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which means the string starts with NT99 followed by NT89, each of which can produce sequences of terminal symbols.\n\nBut in the given string, the first few tokens are t41, t69, t157, etc. I need to see if these match the productions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT99 \u2192 is only present in one rule: NT99 appears in NT96's production as NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36, and elsewhere? Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT99 rules, I don't see any directly; most non-terminals have rules that start with NT such as NT15, NT73, etc. Wait, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT76 \u2192 t178, but that's for NT76. I see that NT16 is a terminal. Hmm. Maybe I should look for each token in the string and see which non-terminals they belong to.\n\nWait, the string has tokens like t41, t69, t157, t80, etc. Let me list them in order and see:\n\n1. t41\n2. t69\n3. t157\n4. t80\n5. t13\n6. t65\n7. t93\n8. t63\n9. t124\n10. t101\n11. t9\n12. t130\n13. t63\n14. t9\n15. t141\n16. t145\n17. t139\n18. t11\n19. t105\n20. t67\n21. t17\n22. t1\n\nThat's 22 tokens. I need to see if these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to identify which non-terminals these tokens belong to. Each terminal tX is likely the result of a production of a non-terminal, so for each tX, I can check which non-terminal rules produce it.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't112' \u2014 no match for t41 here.\n\nNT39 \u2192 't144' and 't130' among others.\n\nWait, let me go through some of the tokens:\n\n- t41: Let's see which non-terminals have t41 as their production. Looking at the productions, I find:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70: not t41.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103: no t41.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look in the rules where the terminals are. It looks like many non-terminals are mapped to specific terminals, and some to other non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT99 \u2192 't6' and 't103'. So if we have t6, it's from NT99, and t103 is from NT99. Let me check t69. Wait, NT13 might produce t69? Let me look.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nWait, I see NT91 \u2192 't164', NT100 \u2192 't127', etc. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to list all the non-terminals and their productions, and see which ones can produce these tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create a mapping from each non-terminals to their possible terminal outputs. But this would take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, I can start by trying to match the string token by token, starting from the left, and see if I can find a path in the grammar that produces it.\n\nLet me start with the first token: t41.\n\nLooking at the production rules, which non-terminal produces t41?\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT19 \u2192 't99'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't172'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't76'? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't2'\n\nSo 't41' is a separate token, and perhaps there's a non-terminal that produces 't41'.\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\nI see NT9 \u2192 't134', NT7 \u2192 't151', NT16 \u2192 't112', NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129', NT68 \u2192 't145', etc. Hmm, I don't see an immediate match for 't41'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see 't41' as a terminal in any non-terminal's rule. So perhaps this string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't41' isn't present as a terminal. Alternatively, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check the entire list of productions again to see if any non-terminal produces 't41':\n\nLooking through each non-terminal's production:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't151'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129'\n- NT43 \u2192 't2'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134'\n- NT13 might be present? Wait, no, not in the given productions. Wait, perhaps I should look for 't41' elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe 't41' is a terminal that doesn't appear anywhere in the grammar's productions, making the string invalid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but assuming no typo, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, let me check again the given productions. Looking through each non-terminal's productions, I don't see any rule that produces 't41'. So that might mean that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Looking for 't41' in all the productions:\n\nAfter scanning all the productions, I don't see any mapping that produces 't41'. Each non-terminal's productions either map to another non-terminal or to a specific terminal, none of which is 't41'. Therefore, the string contains a terminal that's not part of the grammar's defined terminals, making it impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal symbol 't41' that is not present in any of the grammar's production rules. Since all terminals must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar and 't41' is not present, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that might make parsing easier, although I'm not sure if that will help here directly.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It consists of a series of production rules where non-terminals (NTx) produce other non-terminals or terminals. The starting symbol is S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t1, t178, etc. \n\nLooking at the string: `t1 t178 t174 t11 t97 t165 t93 t110 t165 t154 t144 t41 t47 t51 t102 t73 t21 t177 t172 t65 t101 t13`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, I suppose. The grammar's rules produce sequences of these terminals, so I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string has 21 terminals, so I'll need to find a way to break it down into these steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing strategies like theCYK algorithm could work, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nStarting from S, which produces NT99 NT89. Each of these NTs will produce other NTs or terminals, or other combinations. Let me see if the string starts with t1, which is in the string. Looking at the grammar, some NTs have productions that include terminals.\n\nLooking at the NTs, for example, NT99 -> NT6 and 't103', because in the grammar, NT99 -> NT6 NT103. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT99 -> NT6 and something? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nNo, I see that later in the grammar, there's a rule like NT35 -> NT68 NT103, and NT96 -> NT33 NT36, etc., but NT99 is not directly a terminal. Let me see the specific rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT99 that produces a terminal. The rules are all of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, so NT99 must be broken down further until it hits a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT103 -> NT24 NT45\n- NT6 is 't108' (from NT68 -> NT28 NT12, but I'm not sure where NT6 is. Wait, let me check the grammar rules for NT6:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT6 directly. Let me go step by step.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT6 is produced by various rules, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 -> NT76 NT12 (from NT68 -> NT28 NT12). Wait, but in the string, I have t108. Wait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules provided, I see that NT68 -> NT28 NT12, and then NT28 is a non-terminal, but looking through the other rules, I don't see NT28 producing a terminal. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to try to find if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals using the grammar rules.\n\nBut this might take a long time, as the string is quite long. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t1, which might correspond to some NT production.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I can see:\n\nLooking for terminals, the first term is t1. Looking through the grammar, which terminals are present? Let me see:\n\nFrom the grammar, I can see that some NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT17 -> t24\n- NT16 -> t112\n- NT29 -> t36, t156, t129\n- NT24 -> t123\n- NT12 -> t80\n- NT9 -> t134\n- NT39 -> t144, t33\n- NT76 -> t45\n- NT65 -> t55, t157, t8\n- NT77 -> t56, t124\n- NT46 -> t99\n- NT2 -> t26\n- NT77 -> t56, t124\n- NT71 -> t69, t171\n- NT69 -> t1\n- NT100 -> t127\n- NT108 -> t118\n- NT65 -> t157, t8, etc.\n- Others may also produce terminals, but the key is to find if the string can be generated.\n\nGiven that the first symbol is t1, which might come from NT69, since in the grammar, NT69 -> 't1'. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see NT69 -> t1. Let me check the rules for NT69.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT69 -> 't1' is a terminal, but in the grammar, I don't see a production that directly produces 't1'. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbols in the string are all 't' followed by numbers, and in the grammar, each NTx is a non-terminal, and when x is beyond 43, it's a terminal. For example, 't' followed by 47 is x=47. Wait, maybe not. It's clearer to see when x is less than 50, they are non-terminals, and beyond that, they are terminals? Or perhaps any NT with x >= some number is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some have 't' followed by numbers, like t1, t2, etc. So I think that in the grammar, when the rule specifies 't' followed by a number, that's a terminal symbol. For example, NT17 -> 't24' is a terminal.\n\nSo in the string, each symbol starting with 't' is a terminal. So the first step is to see if the initial steps can produce 't1'.\n\nLooking at the grammar's starting symbol S: S -> NT99 NT89. So S produces NT99 and NT89.\n\nNow, each of these needs to produce a sequence of symbols that can lead to t1. Let me try to find if NT99 or NT89 can produce 't1'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT103 -> NT24 NT45\n- NT6 is a non-terminal, as I don't see it producing a terminal, unless I missed it.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe NT6 is a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT6 leading to a terminal. So perhaps NT6 isn't a terminal, meaning it must be further expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT103 -> NT24 NT45. Let's see what NT24 and NT45 produce.\n\n- NT24 -> t123, as per one of the rules (NT24 -> NT106 NT31) and others? Wait, from the grammar, I see NT24 -> NT106 NT31. Wait, that's a non-terminal. Wait, does any production lead NT24 directly to a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nYes, looking at the rules for NT24: there's a rule NT24 -> t123? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, it's NT24 -> t123 is not present. Wait, perhaps I need to double-check.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I don't see NT24 directly producing a terminal. So NT24 would have to be expanded into other non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, NT45: looking through the grammar, do any rules for NT45 generate terminals? I don't see it. So that's a problem. If both NT24 and NT45 are non-terminals, then this branch might not produce a terminal t1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the starting symbols S can produce a string that includes t1, t178, etc., but with the given grammar, maybe t1 comes from a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S -> NT99 NT89, and when we expand NT99 and NT89, after a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t164 t112 t134 t71 t118 t159 t51 t98 t51 t164 t102 t24 t165 t164 t60 t108 t105 t49 t48 t80 t177 t54 t2`. \n\nFirst, let me recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF since each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string should start with NT99 and NT89. But the given string starts with t164, which is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, the productions produce terminals, so the start symbol S must derive to a sequence of these terminals. But in the provided string, the first few tokens are all terminals like t164, t112, etc., so perhaps the start symbol S is expanded fully into these terminals. \n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the derivation must consist of expanding these non-terminals step by step until all are terminals. However, the provided string has a lot of t's, which are terminals. So each of these t's must have been derived from a production rule.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string according to the grammar. Each production in the grammar can be used to replace a non-terminal with a pair of other symbols. Each terminal in the string must correspond to a production that produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals expand into a terminal and a non-terminal. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT93 (which might be t170) and NT93 \u2192 NT96 (t91) and so on, until it eventually gives a terminal.\n\nBut instead of parsing the entire string, maybe I can look for the structure in the string that matches the productions. Let me see the structure of the string: it's a sequence of t's. The first few are t164, t112, t134, t71, t118, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce two terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65, which also might produce \"t56\" and \"t157\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, terminals like t164 appear, so I should see if any non-terminal expands directly to t164.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT71 \u2192 NT80 NT42. Also, NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23, which may expand to other things. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about the dependencies.\n\nWait, another approach is that in the given string, each t is a terminal, so each must be produced by a single production, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps the string is built by replacing non-terminals step by step until all are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is structured as the S expansion, which is NT99 NT89. So the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 23 terminals. So that would mean that both NT99 and NT89 derive into 11 and 11 terminals, or some other split. Wait, let me count: the string is 23 tokens, so maybe the derivation splits into two parts, each producing some number of terminals.\n\nLet me check the first symbol: t164. That's part of the string starting from S.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT can derive into a certain number of terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65, which then may produce t91 and t157. That could give t91 t157 as two terminals. Similarly, other NTs may split into more or fewer terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each NT in the string is generated by expanding a single non-terminal recursively until all are terminals. For example, if a NT is expanded as two symbols, and one of those is another NT, that continues until only terminals are left.\n\nBut it's a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to see if the string is built by stepping through each expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the given string can be split into parts that correspond to each NT's expansion. For example, the first part is t164, which would have to come from an NT that directly produces it, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces t164 directly. The productions either produce two NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49, NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36, etc. Wait, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT45 \u2192 NT24 NT65, which might produce t123 and t105.\n\nBut in the string, terminals like t164 appear. So perhaps some NTs produce t164 as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see that NT69 \u2192 NT40 NT107, which then produces NT40 and NT107. NT40 has production to NT33 NT64, and NT107 to NT65 NT71. So I'm not seeing any direct terminal for t164, so maybe t164 is produced by an NT that eventually expands into it, but it's possible.\n\nWait, but if the grammar only produces certain terminals, and the string uses t164, t112, etc., which are specific to certain NT paths, then the string must match exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by checking if each part of the string can be traced back to a production in the grammar. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t164 t112 t134 t71 t118 t159 t51 t98 t51 t164 t102 t24 t165 t164 t60 t108 t105 t49 t48 t80 t177 t54 t2.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the string must consist of the concatenation of NT99's expansion and NT89's expansion.\n\nSo first, I need to see if NT99's expansion can produce t164 as the first symbol. Looking up NT99's productions in the grammar, I see NT99 \u2192 NT93 NT57? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nLooking at the initial productions, I see:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nNT15 -> NT21 NT9\n\nNT17 -> 't22'\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, I see that some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't22', so 't22' is the terminal. Similarly, other NTs produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I should scan through all the rules to see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't54' (So 't54' is a terminal)\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT18 \u2192 't35' and 't43'\n- NT19 \u2192 't99' and 't93'\n- NT21 \u2192 't171'\n- NT22 \u2192 't123'\n- NT23 \u2192 't156', 't171', 't29', 't42', 't45', 't47', 't56', 't64', '65', '68', '70', '81', '83', '94', '167', '170', etc.\nWait, the grammar seems extensive. Let me look for NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice NT29 \u2192 't156', 't29' \u2192 't156', 't129', 't24', 't29' \u2192 't299' (wait, no, looking at the rules, some NT29 have rules like NT29 \u2192 't156', 't129', 't24', 't29' \u2192 't129', etc. So that might complicate things.

{"custom_id":"request-417","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t174 t1 t17 t174 t177 t112 t99 t34 t76 t93 t24 t171 t134 t26 t73 t134 t76 t60 t1 t112 t174 t139 t98`. That's a lot of terms, each like `t174`, `t26`, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. The grammar is in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminal rule where a non-terminal can produce a single terminal symbol. Also, every rule is binary, so each production has exactly two symbols on the right.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that it's a lot of non-terminals generating various other non-terminals and terminals. Each rule looks like NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, except for those where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, like NT17 \u2192 't24', meaning it can produce the string 't24'.\n\nThe string we need to check consists entirely of terminals, each prefixed with 't'. Some are two-digit, like t177, t138, etc. So each of these must be derived from the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual components: t174, t1, t17, t174, t177, t112, t99, t34, t76, t93, t24, t171, t134, t26, t73, t134, t76, t60, t1, t112, t174, t139, t98.\n\nI think each of these 't' terms must correspond to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. So, for example, if the grammar has a production NT17 \u2192 't24', then whenever we see t24, that must come from NT17. So I can map each t-term to its corresponding non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to map each 't' term to its respective non-terminal:\n\nt174: Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT174, but I don't see that in the given rules. Maybe it's derived from a series of rules. Alternatively, there might be a direct rule for NT174. Wait, in the grammar, I see terms like NT43 \u2192 't2' and others, but I don't immediately see NT174. Maybe I'll have to reconstruct how each term is derived.\n\nSimilarly, t177: I see a rule NT177 \u2192 something? Let me check the provided rules. Looking through them, I don't see any rules starting with NT177 or ending with 't177'. Hmm, that could be an issue because unless t177 is a directly terminal, it must come from some non-terminal that produces it through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT68 \u2192 't134' and another NT68 \u2192 't145', but nothing about NT177. So perhaps t177 comes from some other non-terminal. Let me check: looking for NTs that produce 't177'.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any NT that produces 't177' directly or via a chain. For example, NT75 \u2192 't98', but that's not helpful. Hmm, maybe I've missed something. Let me scan through the production rules again.\n\nLooking at NT77 \u2192 't56', but 't56' is different from 't177'. NT68 \u2192 't134' and 't145'. Wait, is there a way to combine these to get a longer sequence? Maybe, but this could get complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t177 is a longer sequence that can be generated through multiple steps. For example, if there's a chain like NT177 \u2192 NTX NTY, and each of those can be expanded further until we get to the terminals. But without explicit terminal symbols for t177, it might be tricky.\n\nWait, the string includes t174, t174 again, t177, etc. Let me try to see if the grammar can generate t177 somehow. Looking at NT177, is there a production for it? I don't see it right away. So maybe t177 is a non-terminal that eventually produces 't177' through some expansion.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces 't177'. So maybe t177 isn't present, which could mean the string can't be generated by this grammar. But let me not jump to conclusions yet; perhaps there's a way that through the rules, t177 can appear.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the parse tree. Each terminal in the string must be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. So t177 must be produced by a non-terminal that can derive to 't177'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I'm trying to find any NT that can produce 't177'. If none exist, then t177 cannot be part of any string generated by the grammar. So if t177 isn't present, the string would be invalid.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules again. The grammar has NT52 \u2192 't123' (from NT52 -> NT28 NT70, and then maybe NT28 and NT70 can produce t123, but I'm not sure). Or NT95 \u2192 't130', etc. Not seeing 't177' anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t177 is a two-step production where NT177 is derived from NTX NTY, and each X and Y can produce the respective 't's. But without knowing if NT177 has a production that includes 't177', this isn't possible.\n\nWait a second, in the initial question, the grammar's productions are all in the form NTx \u2192 NTa NTb, except some directly produce terminals. For example, NT17 is defined as \u2192 't24'. So if any NTx production includes a direct terminal like 't177', that could be a path. But in our case, as per the given grammar, there is no NT that directly produces 't177'.\n\nWait, let me check the provided rules again for NT177:\n\nLooking through all the provided rules, I don't see any that start with NT177 or end with 't177' for the right-hand side. For example:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't134' and 't145'\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT7 \u2192 't151'\n- etc.\n\nSince there's no NT that directly produces 't177' or that can derive into it through the given rules, it seems 't177' isn't part of any string generated by this grammar. Therefore, if the input string contains 't177', the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, could 't177' be derived indirectly through a series of expansion steps? For example, perhaps via NT177 \u2192 NTX NTY, and NTX and NTY can expand to produce the required terminals in the string. But if the grammar doesn't include a production rule for NT177, I don't see how it could be derived.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something in the rules. Let me look again at each production rule line:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT99, then a long list of rules. Scanning through, I don't see any rule for NT177.\n\nSo, unless I'm mistaken, the grammar doesn't include a production for NT177. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains 't177', which is not derivable from any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me re-examine all the provided rules. Let me count each line:\n\nEach line is S, then several NTx \u2192 production.\n\nLooking for NT177: Not present anywhere. The maximum I see is NT174, NT112, etc., but not NT177.\n\nTherefore, 't177' is not in the grammar's terminals. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The string has t177, which must come from NT177. Since there's no rule for NT177, the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-438","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the right-hand sides have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That should help because each step of derivation alternates between expanding non-terminals into two others or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's a big set of productions. Some of them produce terminals (like NT7 \u2192 't21', NT16 \u2192 't93'), but others just split into two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. The string to evaluate is: `t172 t141 t96 t90 t129 t91 t45 t56 t115 t129 t123 t134 t139 t151 t9 t17 t1765 t0 t65 t129` Wait, no, wait, let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the string is: `t172 t141 t96 t90 t129 t91 t45 t56 t115 t129 t123 t134 t139 t151 t9 t17 t17 t65 t127 t121 t1 t0 t65 t129`.\n\nWait, I think the user had a typo. No, looking again, the string is: `t172 t141 t96 t90 t129 t91 t45 t56 t115 t129 t123 t134 t139 t151 t9 t17 t17 t65 t127 t121 t1 t0 t65 t129`.\n\nSo that's 25 tokens, all are 't' followed by some number. Now, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to reverse-engineer the string. Let's see if each 't' in the string is a terminal produced by the grammar. So looking through the grammar, some terminals are obvious: t172, t141, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, I see a lot of terminals like 't17', 't21', 't93', etc., so each 't' is uniquely produced by a specific non-terminal.\n\nLet me start by mapping each token to the production that produces it. For instance, t17 is produced by NT7 \u2192 't21'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT7 \u2192 't151' (from NT7 -> 't151'). Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't151' (if I recall, there's a rule like NT7 \u2192 't151'.)\n- Similarly, NT16 \u2192 't93'\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't171'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129' (but NT29 can have two productions)\n- NT15 \u2192 't90' (since NT15 \u2192 't90')\nBut I might need to make a list of all possible terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal in the string must be matched by a rule in the grammar. So, each 'tX' must correspond to a production like NTn \u2192 'tX'.\n\nSo first, I should check if each token in the string is a terminal that exists in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t172, t141, t96, t90, t129, t91, t45, t56, t115, t129, t123, t134, t139, t151, t9, t17, t17, t65, t127, t121, t1, t0, t65, t129.\n\nSo let's go through each and see if there are corresponding productions.\n\nt172: Is there a rule NTx \u2192 't172'? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 't172' (from the rule NT57 -> 't172')\nYes, NT57 produces t172.\n\nt141: Check for a rule NTx \u2192 't141'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT96 \u2192 't171' (since there's a production NT96 -> 't171'), but I don't see NT141. Wait, wait. Let me check all the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't156' (twice)\n- NT46 \u2192 't99'\n- NT107 \u2192 't65'\n- NT57 \u2192 't172'\n- NT42 \u2192 't165'\n- NT42 \u2192 't139'\nWait, actually, I think I need to list all terminals:\n\nEach production where the right-hand side is a terminal has the form NTn \u2192 'tXX'. So I can create a list of NTn \u2192 tXX mappings.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't151' \nNT16 \u2192 't93' \nNT17 \u2192 't22' \nNT21 \u2192 't171' \nNT29 \u2192 't156', 't129' \nNT35 \u2192 't48', 't94', 't105', 't52', etc.\nWait, no, looking specifically:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 't172'\n- NT46 \u2192 't99'\n- NT42 \u2192 't139', 't165'\n- NT23 \u2192 't156', 't171'\nWait, sorry, no.

{"custom_id":"request-434","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a form where all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S -> NT99 NT89, and then there are a bunch of NT productions and a lot of terminal productions. Each production seems to break down the non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number, like 't51', 't105', etc.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t51 t105 t130 t80 t93 t154 t139 t154 t177 t22 t156 t1 t65 t110 t121 t139 t151 t2 t177 t110 t60 t73 t8 t112`.\n\nHmm, the first thing I notice is that Chomsky normal form grammars are quite structured, so maybe I can find a way to parse the string step by step. Let's see how the grammar works.\n\nStarting from S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So, the string must start with 't51 t105'. Wait, because looking at the grammar, NT99 -> 't51', right? Because in the terminal productions under NT99, it says NT99 -> 't63'? Wait, no, let me check. The given grammar for NT99 is looking at the end part. Oh wait, actually, looking through the list:\n\nI see NT99 -> 't94' and NT99 -> 't103'? No, wait, I have to check. Wait, the grammar has a lot of entries. Let me look for NT99. Scanning through the rules, I don't immediately see NT99 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Or perhaps NT99 is derived through other rules. Wait, in the given grammar, the rule S produces NT99 and NT89, and then NT99 has a rule that goes to 't51'. Because in the list, under NT100, there's a rule NT100 -> 't127', but not directly NT99.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT99 -> 't51' (look for ND99 in the list). Scanning through, I see under NT99, maybe not. Let me check each NT99 in the grammar:\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see:\n\n- NT100 -> 't127' \u2192 No.\n- NT48 -> 't11' \u2192 No.\n- NT1 -> 't107' 't17' \u2192 No.\nWait, perhaps I need to check if NT99 is used as a terminal. Looking through the terminal list, I see 't51', 't105', etc.\n\nWait, the terminals are all defined under some NT rule. For example, NT7 -> 't21' 't9', which is likely an error because NT7 is a non-terminal. Or perhaps the grammar is such that some NT rules produce terminals, and others produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't51', which presumably comes from a production of NT99, since S starts with NT99 and NT89. So the first part is 't51', meaning NT99 must produce a 't51'. Let me find what NT99 produces.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, I don't directly see NT99, but perhaps it's defined in another rule. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, no, the grammar uses left-hand sides. Oh, but in the given list, some rules look like NT12 -> 't80' 't91', but others are more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step. Since S starts with NT99 and NT89, the string must start with the productions of NT99 and NT89. So the first token is 't51', meaning NT99 must produce 't51'. So I need to check if NT99 \u2192 't51' is a possible production.\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT99, I don't see any NT99 directly, but perhaps NT99 is derived via another rule. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscounted.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, looking for NT99: I see NT77 -> 't56' but that's another NT. Let me check more thoroughly.\n\nWait, I notice that in the grammar, some of the rules produce two non-terminals, like NT1 -> NT107 and NT17, etc. But there are also rules like NT73 -> 't167' and NT43 -> 't2.' So perhaps 't51' is from a terminal production.\n\nWait, looking through all the terminal productions, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't156'\n- NT29 -> 't156' and 't129'\n- NT77 -> 't124'\n- NT65 -> 't157'\n- NT106 -> 't94' maybe?\nWait, actually, perhaps I should parse each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the entire string in terms of the grammar's production steps. Starting from S, it's NT99 NT89, so the string is split into substrings that come from NT99 and NT89.\n\nThe first token is 't51'. If S \u2192 NT99 NT89, then the 't51' must come from NT99. So NT99's rule must produce 't51'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an explicit NT99 -> 't51' production. Wait, did I miss it? Let me go through each rule again.\n\nWait, perhaps in one of the more complex rules, NT99 is part of a combination. Wait, no. Wait, looking at NT99: wait, maybe in the provided grammar, NT99 isn't directly listed in the production rules as a terminal, but perhaps it's used internally. Alternatively, maybe I've got the NT99 as part of a rule elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in initial scanning. Let me look carefully for NT99 in the list. Oh, I see a line that says:\n\n\"NT40 -> NT39 NT35\"\n\"NT52 -> NT28 NT70\"\n\"NT89 -> NT44 NT1\"\n\"NT54 -> NT42 NT75\"\n\"NT11 -> NT81 NT29\"\n...\n\"NT96 -> NT1 NT108\"\n\"NT65 -> NT106 NT71\"\n\"NT100 -> NT96 NT93\"\n\"NT108 -> NT65 NT127\"\n...\n\nWait, perhaps 't51' comes from NT105 -> 't17' 't47'?\n\nWait, looking for 't51', let me scan through all the terminal symbols:\n\n- NT105 -> 't17', 't47'?\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nLooking for 't51' in the productions:\n\nWait, 't51' is under NT100: \"NT100 -> 't127'?\" Or 't127' is another.\n\nWait, no, 't51' isn't directly listed. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me try to see how the string can be broken down. The first token is 't51'. If S \u2192 NT99 NT89, then 't51' must be part of the expansion of NT99, and the rest would have to come from NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see where 't51' can come from. Perhaps it's a terminal production.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT97 -> 't99'\n- NT100 -> 't127'\n- NT73 -> 't73'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't51' comes from a production in NT100. Looking at NT100:\n\n\"NT100 -> 't106' NT109 ???\" Wait, no, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each NT's production to see if it can produce a 't51'. But I don't see any terminal in NT99. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing NT names.

Looking at the grammar, I see that it's all in CNF, so that's good.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string `t90 t157 t157 t164 t174 t72 t72 t110 t145 t67 t45 t139 t23 t139 t94 t162 t178 t9 t9 t129 t51 t151 t22 t123 t172` can be derived from the grammar. \n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals.

Maybe the string has to be built up from the derivations, substituting symbols according to the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the string has t90, t157, etc., and I need to see if this can be obtained by replacing the non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the grammar using a top-down approach, expanding S and seeing if I can derive the string.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to see if the string can be factorized according to the production rules, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet me look at the string: t90 t157 t157 t164 t174 t72 t72 t110 t145 t67 t45 t139 t23 t139 t94 t162 t178 t9 t9 t129 t51 t151 t22 t123 t172.\n\nWait, if I break this down into a list of tokens:\n\n1. t90\n\n2. t157\n\n3. t157\n\n4. t164\n\n5. t174\n\n6. t72\n\n7. t72\n\n8. t110\n\n9. t145\n\n10. t67\n\n11. t45\n\n12. t139\n\n13. t23\n\n14. t139\n\n15. t94\n\n16. t162\n\n17. t178\n\n18. t9\n\n19. t9\n\n20. t129\n\n21. t51\n\n22. t151\n\n23. t22\n\n24. t123\n\n25. t172\n\nWait, t90: looking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t90. That's a problem. Because in the grammar, each NT either produces a terminal or another non-terminal. So unless there's a direct production rule for NT90, which I don't think exists, how can the string contain t90?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT with \u2192 t90. All the terminal productions start with 't...' where the rest are digits, but I don't see t90 being a terminal of any NT.\n\nSo if the string starts with t90, but in the grammar, there is no production for any non-terminal NT that leads to t90, then it's impossible for the grammar to produce the given string because t90 can't be derived from any non-terminal NT.\n\nWait, but the grammar has S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the initial symbol S produces NT99 and NT89. Each of these must be expanded into their respective production rules.\n\nLet me check what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nLooking back, the production rules:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 't6' \u2192 that's a direct terminal.\n\n- NT89 \u2192 't60' \u2192 also a direct terminal.\n\nSo the start symbol produces t6 and t60. But the string starts with t90, which is a problem because the start symbol's first expansion is 't6 t60', not t90.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. If the grammar starts with NT99, which directly generates t6, and NT89 which generates t60, then the initial string from S would be t6 followed by t60.\n\nBut the given string starts with t90, so that's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string is longer than what's derived from S, but the initial expansion can't get to t90 unless there's a way to produce it through other rules. But I don't see any non-terminal that can generate t90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated where t90 comes from. Maybe it's part of a derived symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. The string in question is `t104 t172 t158 t105 t146 t127 t71 t151 t156 t69 t24 t63 t99 t154 t157 t171 t170 t1 t133 t164 t56 t47 t156 t72 t73`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Context-free grammars consist of a start symbol and production rules that define how the start symbol can be replaced. Since this is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, each production seems to have two non-terminals on the right side, except for some that end with terminals. For example, the start symbol S becomes NT99 and NT89. Each of those NT's then breaks down further into combinations of other NT's until some point where a terminal (like t104, t172, etc.) appears.\n\nOne approach I can take is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Each step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual parts:\n\nt104, t172, t158, t105, t146, t127, t71, t151, t156, t69, t24, t63, t99, t154, t157, t171, t170, t1, t133, t164, t56, t47, t156, t72, t73.\n\nNow, each of these terminals should have corresponding grammar productions. For instance, if a non-terminal A can produce t104, then in the parsing process, there should be a rule A \u2192 t104, which would be the direct way. Alternatively, A might go through more steps but end up as t104.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check for t104. Scanning through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT96 NT93\nWait, but where is t104 defined? Hmm, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\nWait, the list is quite long. Let me see: I noticed lines like NT11 \u2192 NT96 NT93, NT52 \u2192 NT107 NT81, etc. Also, there's NT100 \u2192 t127, which is t127. There's also NT40 \u2192 t21, and NT64 \u2192 t24. So t24 is associated with NT64.\n\nIn the string, t24 is present. So any path that leads to t24 must come from NT64. So in the derivation, if t24 is there, the preceding non-terminals must eventually lead down to t24. Let's see how NT64 is formed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT64 \u2192 NT106 NT73. So to derive t24 from NT64, we have to have a rule that eventually leads from NT64 to t24. So NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and NT73 \u2192 ... let's see:\n\nNT73 has two entries: NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70 and NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39. So let's explore both possibilities.\n\nBut wait, the string has t24, which comes from NT64. So NT64 \u2192 NT106 NT73 \u2192 (let's choose one) let's say NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70. But does NT83 produce anything? Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see a terminal for NT83. Alternatively, if NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39, and NT6 leads somewhere.\n\nWait, NT6 is another non-terminal, and in the rules, there's NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71. I'm not seeing a direct terminal for NT6, unless I'm missing it. Let me check: The rules include NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, and NT16 \u2192 't112', but I'm not sure that's the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe each terminal corresponds directly to a production rule. So for example, t127 is produced by NT100, t146 by NT146 (wait, no, it's t146, but I need to find if NT146 is a terminal or not. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT146 as a terminal; instead, it's broken down into other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step, trying to match the longest possible substrings starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the string has to be a terminal sequence generated from S. So starting from S, which can be NT99 and NT89. So the first step is to choose either NT99 or NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t102, which is t102. Hmm, wait, in the string, the first part is t104. Wait, looking back at the string, the first term is t104, so let me see:\n\nt104 is from NT64, which is NT64 \u2192 t24 and another NT. Wait, the rules for NT64 are:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT106 NT73\n\nSo to produce t24, we must have a path where NT106 and NT73 lead to t24. Let me see:\n\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nNT73 can be either NT83 NT70 or NT6 NT39.\n\nIf we go with NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70, but I don't see a terminal there. Maybe NT83 leads to something else.\n\nAlternatively, if NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39, then NT6 is another non-terminal. Does NT6 produce a terminal? Looking at the rules, NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, but NT6 isn't directly a terminal.\n\nWait, the rule for NT6 is in the production list. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT16 \u2192 't112', NT7 \u2192 't21', which is a terminal. So perhaps NT7 can produce 't21', which is the string 't21'.\n\nBut in the string we have 't1', which is another terminal. Where does t1 come from? Looking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't1'. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the string has a production that ends with 't1', but looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that ends with 't1'. That could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing the production for NT64. Let's re-examine:\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT106 NT73.\n\nNow, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107.\n\nSo, NT35 can go to NT68 NT103. Let's see:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103.\n\nNow, NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71. NT45 leads to 't98', and NT71 leads to 't69'.\n\nWait, so NT35 can produce t68 and t103, but t68 is a non-terminal that leads to t45 and t71, which are terminals t45 and t69. So from NT35, you can have t45, t71, or combinations, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can't proceed further because some terminals are not produced.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using the CYK algorithm or some parsing method. Alternatively, since the grammar is small, perhaps I can look for any conflicts or derivations.\n\nWait, but given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to check if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the string: it starts with t104, which is from NT64.\n\nSo the derivation path starts as S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nBut the string starts with t104, which is produced only from NT64, not NT99 or NT89. So that's a problem because the first symbol in the string is t104, but NT99 and NT89 don't directly lead to t104; they lead to other non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the productions, they mainly consist of non-terminals on the left and combinations of two non-terminals or terminals on the right. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT99 and NT89. So the string starts with t121 and t89's corresponding token, which is 't48' according to the grammar. Let me check the productions for NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking up NT99: It has a production NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Oh, no, in the grammar, NT99 has two productions:\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT99 \u2192 NT84 NT11\n\nSimilarly, NT89 has:\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n- NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nWait, that's a lot. So when S starts as NT99 NT89, each of these non-terminals will have their own productions. \n\nLet's map the string step by step. The string starts with t121, which must come from NT99. Looking at the productions for NT99, one of them is NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So NT99 would produce t121 (from NT6) and something else (NT103). Wait, no, actually, each side of the production. So NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 would produce something like \"t from NT6\" and \"t from NT103\". But according to the grammar, each production for NT99 has specific terminals. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, each NT has specific productions, including both non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT99 -> NT6 NT103 would mean that when expanded, NT99 would produce symbols from NT6 and NT103's productions. But looking more closely, let's see the specific productions:\n\nLooking at NT6 in the grammar: NT6 is one of the non-terminals. It has a production NT6 -> 't108' and another production NT6 -> NT108 NT72.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT6's productions:\n- NT6 -> 't108'\n- NT6 -> NT108 NT72\n\nSo NT6 can either produce t108 or two more non-terminals. So if NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, then t6 (t108) would be one part, and NT103 would produce another symbol.\n\nWait, looking at NT103: NT103 is a non-terminal, and from the grammar, it has:\n- NT103 -> NT24 NT45\n- NT103 -> NT24 NT45\nWait, no, looking again, I see for NT103:\nLooking through the list, NT103 doesn't have a direct production except possibly via others. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT103 in the productions. Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT65 -> NT106 NT71\nNT106 -> NT35 NT107\nNT107 -> NT95 NT65\nWait, maybe I'm going wrong here. Let me instead go step by step.\n\nThe initial string is t121 t60 t167 t115 t9 t48 t127 t1 t26 t36 t2 t45 t154 t169 t177 t11 t177 t169 t146 t97 t100 t69 t102 t8 t134.\n\nStarts with t121 and t60. So the string is split into t121, t60, t167, etc. So the first two tokens are t121 and t60. Let's see how that could come from the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So NT99 must expand to t121, and NT89 must expand to t60.\n\nLooking at NT99's productions. One of them is NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Another is NT99 \u2192 NT84 NT11.\n\nLooking for which production of NT99 could give us t121. Looking at NT6 and NT103.\n\nBut wait, NT6's productions are:\n\nNT6 -> 't108' or NT6 -> NT108 NT72.\n\nBut t121 is 't6', so it's more likely coming from a terminal production. Let me check the productions for NT6 again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't108'\nBut elsewhere, like NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me scan the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\nNT6 \u2192 't108'\nWait, that's not possible because I thought NT6 had other productions, but perhaps I'm misremembering. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT6:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar in a list, so let me parse the NT6 part.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nLooking for \"NT6\" in the productions. Here's what I find:\n\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT71\n- NT61 -> NT84 NT44\n- NT65 -> NT106 NT71\n- NT71 -> NT80 NT42\n- NT91 -> NT6 NT17\n- NT42 -> NT139 NT45\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT68 -> 't117'\n- etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see NT6 in the list except if I missed it. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me scan the entire list again for lines starting with NT6.\n\nLooking through:\n\nHere's the list again:\n\n... (skipped for brevity)\n\n...\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT71\n- NT61 -> NT84 NT44\n- NT65 -> NT106 NT71\n- NT71 -> NT80 NT42\n- NT91 -> NT6 NT17\n- NT42 -> NT139 NT45\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT68 -> 't117'\n...\n\nWait, I see NT6 appearing in NT91's production: NT91 -> NT6 NT17. So NT91 can produce t from NT6 and t from NT17. Looking at NT17, it has a production NT17 -> 't22'.\n\nSo if NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, then it could produce t from NT6 and t22.\n\nWait, but in the initial string, the second token is t60, which might come from NT89.\n\nLet me focus on NT89 next. NT89's productions are:\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\nNT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nSo, looking for t60. Let's see if either of these can produce t60.\n\nWait, t60 must come from some NT's production.\n\nLooking for t60: Do any NTs have a production that results in t60?\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't107'\n\nBut t60 isn't listed directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's take each token and see which NTs can produce it, working backwards.\n\nThe string is: t121 t60 t167 t115 t9 t48 t127 t1 t26 t36 t2 t45 t154 t169 t177 t11 t177 t169 t146 t97 t100 t69 t102 t8 t134.\n\nSo each token corresponds to a production. The first two tokens are t121 and t60. So we need to find how these tokens can be produced from the grammar.\n\nFirst token: t121.

{"custom_id":"request-473","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay. Let me first try to understand the problem and break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a very detailed form with all the productions. The string I need to evaluate is quite long, so I'll need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step. But maybe I don't need to parse the entire string; instead, I can look for patterns or known symbols in the string that are part of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the case where a terminal like 't178' appears. These terminals are the leaves of the parse tree and represent the terminal symbols that make up the string.\n\nThe string is: t178 t110 t49 t11 t151 t50 t11 t110 t127 t167 t48 t48 t36 t172 t80 t1 t17 t2 t141 t134 t90 t56 t45 t102 t65 t123.\n\nLet me go through the string and check each symbol to see if it's present in the grammar as a terminal or if it's part of any production's right-hand side.\n\nStarting with t178: Is this a terminal? Looking through the grammar, I don't see t178 as a terminal because all the terminals in the grammar are 't' followed by a number, but I need to check if t178 is produced by any production. Looking through all the productions, I don't see a production that directly produces t178. So, unless it's derived from somewhere, which it can't be because it's a terminal symbol, the presence of t178 might immediately indicate the string is not in the language. But wait, perhaps it's being produced by a non-terminal. Let me check if t178 is the result of any production.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, all the productions have variables on the left and combinations of variables or terminals on the right. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, t178 must be a terminal symbol. So, if the grammar doesn't have any production that produces t178, then it's impossible for t178 to appear in any derived string.\n\nLet me scan through the grammar terminals to confirm. The grammar defines several productions ending with certain symbols like t24, t93, etc. But I don't see t178 listed anywhere. So, the presence of t178 in the string suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. Perhaps t178 is part of a production that I didn't see, but given the way the grammar is structured, each production seems to have non-terminals on the left and combinations of non-terminals or terminals on the right. So, t178 must be a terminal that's directly produced by a production like A \u2192 t178. But in the grammar provided, I don't see such a production.\n\nYes, for example, looking through the last few productions, I see NT50 \u2192 t151, which is a production where a non-terminal produces a terminal. But I don't see any production that ends with t178. So, t178 would have to be produced by a non-terminal A, but if no production can derive t178, then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t178 is part of a larger string that is derived from some non-terminal, but without a production for it, it can't appear as a terminal. Therefore, the string is not derivable.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar because t178 is present, and it's not a terminal in this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains 't178', which is not a terminal produced by any production in the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Also, the start symbol S transforms into `NT99 NT89`. So, starting from S, the first step is to split into NT99 and NT89.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. The string starts with `t133 t121...`, so the first symbol is `t133`. I need to see which non-terminal can produce `t133`. Looking through the grammar, I notice a rule: `NT93 -> NT15 NT77`. Then, `NT15` and `NT77` have their own productions. `NT15` goes to `NT90`, and `NT77` can produce `t124`. Hmm, but I don't see `t133` being a direct terminal. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I need to look for any production rules that result in `t133`. Scanning through all the rules, I see some terminals like `NT18 -> NT35 NT43`, but again, no `t133` there. Wait, maybe `t133` comes from another part. Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see things like `NT106 -> NT35 NT107`, but no `t133`. However, I notice a rule `NT69 -> t133`. Let me check this: `NT69 -> t133`. Yes! So, `NT69` can directly produce `t133`. Therefore, any time `NT69` appears in a derivation, it can produce `t133`.\n\nSo, the first symbol is `t133`, which would come from `NT69`. Now, how can `NT69` be derived? Looking at the grammar, let's find a rule where `NT69` appears on the right-hand side. Scanning the rules:\n\nWait, let me make sure. The given grammar has a bunch of rules. Let's list those that produce terminals:\n\n- `NT69 -> t133` (from the end-of-list section)\n- Other terminals like `NT52 -> t177` etc.\n\nSo, the only way to get `t133` is directly from `NT69`. Therefore, in the derivation, we must have `NT69` at some point generating `t133`.\n\nNow, looking at the original string, the first symbol is `t133`, so the derivation must start with `S -> NT99 NT89`, and then NT99 or NT89 must produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but let's look at the entire string and see if each token is a terminal or can be traced back to a non-terminal. Let's go token by token:\n\n1. `t133` \u2192 NT69\n2. `t121` \u2192 Let's see; is there a NT121? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule ending with t121. Hmm, that's a problem. So, how do we get `t121`? Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules, I don't see any that produce `t121`. So, either I missed something, or this might not be possible. Wait, maybe `t121` comes from some NT. Let me check: Is there any NT that produces `t121`? Looking through the rules:\n\nI see for example `NT11 -> t17' (from the end of the list with t17), but not t121. Hmm. Maybe `t121` comes from a non-terminal that splits into two terminals that sum up or something. Wait, but in context-free grammars, each production splits into two, and each can be a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if any NT can produce `t121`. Looking at the list:\n\n- `NT61 -> NT93 NT80`\n- `NT93 -> NT15 NT77`\n- `NT15 -> NT90`\n- `NT77 -> NT75 NT65`\n- `NT75 -> NT95 NT18`\n- `NT18 -> NT35 NT43`\n- `NT35 -> NT68 NT103`\n- `NT68 -> NT45 NT71`\n- `NT71 -> NT69`\n- `NT45 -> NT48 t1' (no, wait: looking at the grammar, the rule is `NT22 -> t22` so maybe NT45: check all rules ending with t. Wait, I need to look through each rule.\n\nWait, the list of terminal rules is extensive, but looking through them all, I don't see a rule that directly produces `t121`. So, the only way to produce `t121` would be if a non-terminal can generate it directly, which isn't present in the given rules.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the string contains a symbol that can't be derived from the grammar, making it impossible for the string to be in the language. But wait, maybe it's derived in more steps. Let me check the entire string again and see if all tokens can be linked to non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the symbols:\n\nLooking at the entire string: `t133 t121 t170 t158 t67 t94 t134 t123 t174 t34 t21 t133 t151 t167 t60 t94 t100 t101 t164 t96 t96 t172 t2 t129 t129 t102 t76`.\n\nNow, let's go through each symbol:\n\n1. t133 \u2192 NT69\n2. t121 \u2192 Need a NT that can produce t121. Looking at the rules, no NT directly produces t121. So, unless t121 is produced by splitting from another NT into two terminals, but in this case, t121 is a single terminal, so it can't be split. Therefore, this symbol is a problem because it can't be generated.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I'm looking at the rules wrong. Let me scan the entire grammar to see if any NT rules produce t121:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- From the end section: `NT129 -> t129`, `NT129` also is part of other rules.\n\nWait, the section says `NT129 -> t129` twice, and `NT129 -> t129` again. So `t129` is produced by NT129. But wait, in the string, there are two `t129` terms: `t129 t129`.\n\nSo, how about symbol 2: t121. The problem is that there's no NT that directly produces t121. So, the string has a token `t121` which is not present as a terminal in any of the rules. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: Are there any NT rules that could indirectly produce t121 through intermediate NTs?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example, `NT73 -> NT15 NT2` produces t2 from NT2. Similarly, `NT29 -> t29` appears twice. So, `t29` is from NT29. Wait, but where does t121 come from? It's not a terminal in any rule, so it can't be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-500","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to be in CNF because each rule on the left side (like S, NT15, etc.) has exactly two non-terminals except for the terminal rules, which have a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t178 t151 t2 t178 t94 t130 t151 t141 t49 t49 t130 t9 t115 t51 t172 t65 t24 t123 t154 t99 t1 t130 t141 t129 t36 t100 t169`.\n\nSo, each token in the string is a terminal like t178, t151, etc. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which according to the grammar, produces NT99 and NT89. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Both NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals, so we need to see what they produce.\n\nLooking into the grammar, NT99 is rewritten as NT6 and NT103. So NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Both NT6 and NT103 are non-terminals. NT6 is directly rewritten to 't108' (from NT6 \u2192 't108'), and NT103 is rewritten as NT101 (NT103 \u2192 NT101) according to the grammar. Wait, no, I need to check the specific rules.\n\nLooking at NT103, I see that NT103 is a terminal 't94' in some rules. Wait, no, checking the provided grammar, the NT103 rules might be a bit more complex. Wait, the grammar for NT6 is given as NT6 \u2192 't108', and for NT103, looking at each production, I see NT103 can produce 't91' or 't134' or 't129', etc. Wait, let me check the rules for NT103. Hmm, in the list, I see NT103 \u2192 't101', 't115', 't130', etc. Oh, wait, specifically, in the list, I see 'NT103 -> NT101' as one production, but another is 'NT103 -> NT115', and others. Wait, no, let me check: in the provided grammar list, I see NT103 is a terminal with rules like 't101' and 't129', but looking at the rules, actually, the terminal productions for NT103 don't seem to be directly given; instead, the rules for NT103 are probably non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up NT103 and something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's start from the top and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t178. Looking at the grammar, NT76 is rewritten as NT56 and 't121' (Wait, NT76 is defined as NT56 NT76? No, wait, looking at the grammar, NT76 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. Let me check: according to the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT76 that ends with a terminal. Wait, in the list, NT76 \u2192 't121', no. Let me check each production for NT76. I think it's not directly written. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT76 \u2192 't121' as a possible direct terminal? No, actually, no. Wait, let me re-examine the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided productions, I see lines like NT77 \u2192 't56', NT76 \u2192 't121'? Or maybe I'm wrong. Wait, let me check each rule carefully.\n\nFor example, line 20: NT77 \u2192 't56' (so NT77 \u2192 t56).\n\nLine 50: NT17 \u2192 't22'.\n\nLooking for NT76... Line 47: NT68 \u2192 't12', so that's a terminal. Line 50: NT19 \u2192 't22'. Wait, I'm looking for NT76 specifically. I see NT176 is not a rule, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the rules to see if NT76 is a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the lines: I see NT76 appears as a production? Let me see. Line 26: NT17 \u2192 't22'. Line 27: NT31 \u2192 't34'. Line 30: NT103 \u2192 't94', 't130', 't129', 't36', 't100', 't169', etc. Hmm, I don't see an explicit NT76 production as a terminal. So perhaps NT76 is a non-terminal that's further rewritten.\n\nWait, let me restructure the approach.\n\nSince the given grammar is in CNF, each step of substitution takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals. The terminals in the string must be the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nTherefore, each terminal in the string must appear exactly once, and each step must generate exactly one terminal. Wait, no, in a derivation, each expansion replaces a single non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases or sometimes terminals are added.\n\nWait, but given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So in each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, which may eventually lead to terminals.\n\nTherefore, to generate the string, we need to build it by expanding non-terminals into terminals, ensuring that each terminal occurs exactly once in the end.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is: `t178 t151 t2 t178 t94 t130 t151 t141 t49 t49 t130 t9 t115 t51 t172 t65 t24 t123 t154 t99 t1 t130 t141 t129 t36 t100 t169`.\n\nThat's 27 tokens, which suggests that the derivation started from S and went through multiple expansions.\n\nWait, but S is either NT99 or NT89. So let's see:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nThen NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nNT6 \u2192 't108'.\n\nNT103 \u2192 't94' (one of its rules).\n\nSo NT99 could produce t108 t94.\n\nSimilarly, NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't19' (from NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71).\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT61 has several rules. For example, line 69: NT76 \u2192 't100' (from line: NT76 \u2192 't105', no, wait line 40 has NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71, but looking for NT61, I see:\n\nLine 40: NT61 \u2192 NT102 NT92.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to reconstruct the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched through the productions, working backward from the string to the start symbol.\n\nGiven the string, it's a sequence of terminals. To see if this string is in the language, we can use the CYK algorithm or attempt to parse it.\n\nBut since I don't have a parser tool here, perhaps a better way is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by some production's right-hand side (RHS), considering the structure.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm a bit overwhelmed by the grammar, perhaps I can consider the leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t178, which is in the grammar as NT77 \u2192 t95, but I don't see NT77 \u2192 t178 anywhere.

{"custom_id":"request-516","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided along with the string, and I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by this grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or two terminal symbols. So each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see many A \u2192 BC productions. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So that's a start.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t22 t141 t151 t165 t8 t73 t100 t177 t124 t129 t98 t130 t129 t167 t100 t34 t177 t9 t49 t63 t105 t174 t145 t104 t146 t67 t23 t73`.\n\nI need to parse this string and see if it can be derived from the starting symbol S of the grammar.\n\nI remember that for CNF grammars, the standard way to check if a string is in the language is to use a parsing algorithm like CYK (Cocke-Yacc-Kasami). But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list all the non-terminal symbols. From the grammar, non-terminals are followed by NT (like NT99, NT89, etc). So, the non-terminals are NT15, NT89, NT81, NT55, etc. All the NT... symbols are non-terminals. Then, 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So t1, t2, etc., are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, all the symbols after 't' are numbers. So t22 is a terminal, t141 is another terminal, and so on. So the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe aim is to see if this sequence can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet's start with the starting symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string can be split into two parts: the first part must derive to NT99, and the second part must derive to NT89.\n\nLooking at the string: t22 t141 t151 t165 t8 t73 t100 t177 t124 t129 t98 t130 t129 t167 t100 t34 t177 t9 t49 t63 t105 t174 t145 t104 t146 t67 t23 t73.\n\nWait, that's 26 symbols. Since S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the entire string must be split into two parts: the first part will be NT99's derivation, and the second part will be NT89's derivation. So each of these derivations must produce their respective parts, and together their concatenation should form the string.\n\nBut wait, each NT... is a single non-terminal, so each should derive into a string of terminals. So we can model this as the entire string being a concatenation of two strings, one from NT99 and one from NT89.\n\nSo, let's separate the string into two parts:\n\nPart 1: t22 t141 t151 t165 t8 t73 t100 t177 t124 t129 t98 t130 t129 t167 t100 t34 t177\n\nPart 2: t9 t49 t63 t105 t174 t145 t104 t146 t67 t23 t73\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the entire string is NT99's derivation concatenated with NT89's derivation. Therefore, the string can be split into two contiguous parts before and after NT89, but looking at the string, the split would not be in the middle; rather, each NT's derivation would produce a sequence of terminals, and the two sequences are concatenated.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial step, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so during derivation, the string generated by NT99 would come first, followed by the string generated by NT89. So the initial string must be the concatenation of these two. Therefore, in the given string, it should be possible to partition it into two parts: NT99 derivation and NT89 derivation.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt22 t141 t151 t165 t8 t73 t100 t177 t124 t129 t98 t130 t129 t167 t100 t34 t177 t9 t49 t63 t105 t174 t145 t104 t146 t67 t23 t73\n\nThat's 26 tokens. So, the first part will be from t22 to ... and the second part from ... to t73. But where?\n\nBut wait, no, each NT's derivation could result in multiple tokens. So to model this, I think I can approach it by checking if the string can be divided such that the first part generates NT99, and the second part generates NT89.\n\nBut without knowing what NT99 and NT89 derive to, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps we can work backward from the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions can be followed recursively. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT55 NT23.\n\nSo, maybe NT99's derivation is a certain sequence. Let's take each non-terminal and see what their productions are.\n\nStarting with NT99:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 is defined as NT55 NT23.\n\nSo NT99 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n\nSo, for NT99 to be derived into a string of terminals, it would need to be broken down further. NT55 and NT23 are both non-terminals. Let's see what each of them produces.\n\nLooking at NT55: in the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT55. Let me check the given productions:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT55. Perhaps it's an error? Or maybe it's defined elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar step by step to identify all non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\nNT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\nNT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\nNT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\n... and so on.\n\nSo, non-terminals are all the NT... symbols. So, NT99, NT89, NT81, NT55, etc.\n\nSo, looking for NT55, let me see if it has a production. From the grammar:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n\nSo, NT55 is involved in NT81's production. Let me check if NT55 has a rule elsewhere. I don't see NT55 \u2192 something else, so perhaps it's a leaf node. Wait, in the grammar provided, each production is either split into two non-terminals or two terminals. So if a non-terminal doesn't have any production, it's a terminal. But in this case, NT55 is a non-terminal, so it must have a production.\n\nWait, let's check again. From the input grammar, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, NT55 must have a rule, but looking through the given productions, I don't see NT55 being split.\n\nWait, perhaps NT55 has a production in another rule, but in the grammar provided, it's not apparent. So perhaps NT55 is a terminal? But in the string, we have t's, so unless there's a rule that directly gives t's, which we don't see.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I'm not sure if I missed NT55's production. Let me go through all the productions:\n\nAfter the S rule, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93.\n\nNT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73.\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71.\n\nNT106 \u2192 NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-518","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful. So, Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's quite extensive with many non-terminals, and several of them produce terminals. The string I have to evaluate is a sequence of t followed by numbers. Each 't' is followed by a number, like 't2', 't97', etc. My goal is to check if this specific string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is: `t2 t97 t71 t178 t102 t105 t60 t90 t63 t121 t41 t91 t21 t51 t98 t145 t96 t124 t156 t158 t108 t71 t178 t100 t118 t65 t162 t151`.\n\nThat's 25 t-values. So, the string is pretty long, but I don't think I need to parse it as a full sentence. Instead, maybe I can look for a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n\nSince it's Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the leftmost derivation approach would be suitable. Let me start from the start symbol S and see how it can expand.\n\nLooking at S, the production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, S can derive into two parts: NT99 and NT89. Each of these should then expand into something, perhaps more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me take NT99 first. From the grammar, NT99 is actually mentioned twice but produces the same terminal. Specifically, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Wait, no, actually looking back:\n\nWait, the NT99 is defined as NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103? Or is it the same as others? Let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, the NT99 in the grammar is actually not directly listed. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me go through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103. NT6 \u2192 t108. NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. Hmm, but NT99 isn't directly in the list until at the end: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see multiple entries for NT99 and NT103.\n\nWait, here's the grammar:\n\nLooking through the user-provided grammar, I find:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n\nAnd also earlier in the list:\n\nNT99 is defined multiple times, but seems to resolve to the same thing. Then, NT6 is a terminal 't108', and NT103 is NT24 NT45.\n\nSo, to expand NT99, we first expand it to NT6 (t108) and NT103, which is NT24 NT45. Then, NT24 is nt24 \u2192 t123, and NT45 is \u2192 nt45, which may further break down, but let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT24: nt24 \u2192 t123. So, NT24 is replaced by t123. Similarly, NT45: looking through the grammar, I see NT45 \u2192 NT22 NT88. Wait, but in the terminal definitions, I see nt45 \u2192 t something? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, looking through the terminal productions: NT16 \u2192 't93'; NT24 \u2192 't123'; NT29 \u2192 't36', 't156'; NT43 \u2192 't2'; NT45 \u2192 't115'; NT68 \u2192 't145'; NT91 \u2192 't134'; NT92 \u2192 't26'; NT100 \u2192 't127'; NT1 \u2192 't107'; etc.\n\nSo, in the case of NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, which is t108, and NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45, which would be t123 and t115. So, that would make NT99 be t108 t123 t115. But in the string, I see 't60', 't90', etc. So, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Instead of trying to trace the entire string, which might be too time-consuming, maybe I can look for the structure of the string and see if it fits any possible derivation from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be complicated given the number of non-terminals and the complexity of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the structure of the string. The string starts with t2, which is a terminal. So, perhaps that's the start of a chain.\n\nLet me look through the string for any known terminals that correspond to single non-terminals. For example, nt24 is 't123', so not in the string. But looking through, I see 't41' which is NT9 \u2192 t134, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at each component and see if it can correspond to a production.\n\nLooking at the first element: t2. Let's see if any non-terminals produce t2. From the grammar, looking through the terminal productions, I see NT43 \u2192 t2. So, NT43 can produce 't2'. So, if I have NT43 \u2192 't2', that could be part of the string.\n\nSo, the first element is 't2', which could be part of NT43.\n\nSimilarly, the next element is 't97', which from the grammar, I see NT39 \u2192 t48, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking through, I see NT17 \u2192 t22, NT24 \u2192 t123, NT39 \u2192 t144, etc. Wait, let me check all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminal productions, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t22?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't22'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't22'\n\nSo, NT17 can produce 't22'\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 't2'?\n\nWait, let me correct myself.

Let me go through the grammar's terminal productions line by line.\n\nWait, the grammar as provided has multiple lines, some of which are non-terminals transformed into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, here's a section:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT156, NT156 seems to be another non-terminal, but in the user's grammar, this ends up being t36 and t156 as terminals?

{"custom_id":"request-532","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is a series of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers. Hmm, first, I need to understand what the grammar looks like and how it works.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that most of them are in the form of A \u2192 BC, which is typical for Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Each rule has two non-terminals on the right side. But some of them are terminals, represented by the 't' followed by numbers, like 't129', 't110', etc. This is interesting because in typical CNF, all rules have non-terminals on the right, but here we have some terminals, which suggests that the grammar is not purely in CNF but might have some terminals. Wait, though, maybe the grammar allows for productions to terminals, which would make it a right-regular grammar instead, since it's extended with terminals.\n\nSo, in this grammar, non-terminals are everything starting with 'S', like S, NT15, NT89, etc., and terminals are all the 'tX' strings. Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. In CNF, the left side is a non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals. But here, some right sides have terminals, so this can't be a pure CNF. Perhaps it's a mix, or maybe it's a different form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar uses letters as non-terminals and the 't's as actual symbols in the terminal alphabet. So, let's parse this: non-terminals would be the NT... tokens, and the terminals are all the 't' tokens. That makes sense because 't' followed by numbers are probably terminal symbols, and the NT... are the non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols: t129, t110, etc. The task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S following the grammar rules.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, we can approach it by either trying to parse the string using the grammar or by constructing a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) and seeing if the string is accepted. However, given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to attempt to simulate a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, since all the grammar rules have two non-terminals on the right, except for the ones producing terminals, maybe we can represent the string as a series of productions building up the required non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't129', which is a terminal. So the first step in parsing must be that S produces a non-terminal A whose expansion starts with a derivation that leads to t129. Alternatively, maybe the grammar's derivations can result in terminals directly, but given the structure, I think each step from non-terminals to terminals happens through rules that produce two terminals. Wait, no, because the rules all produce non-terminals unless the right-hand side directly contains a terminal, which in this grammar does happen. For example, one of the rules is NT107 \u2192 t94, which is a rule where the non-terminal NT107 can produce a terminal 't94'.\n\nSo, each time a non-terminal appears, it can expand into one or more non-terminals, and some of these have immediate terminals. So, for example, S can expand into NT99 NT91. But how do these non-terminals expand further?\n\nWait, but in the first level, S is split into two non-terminals: NT99 and NT91. Each of these would need to derive into a sequence of terminals. So, for example, NT99 might have a rule that eventually reaches a terminal, and similarly for NT91. Let's look at the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT99 rule: NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So, wait, that's another pair of non-terminals. Then, where do these expand?\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44. Each non-terminal again. Hmm, this is getting complex. Maybe I should try to find a path from each NT (non-terminal) to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create a tree where each step is a non-terminal expanding into two others, and the leaves (non-terminals that have terminals in their rules) will eventually produce the terminals.\n\nLet me try to map out the structure. Starting from S, it splits into NT99 and NT91.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n\nNT107 might be a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT107 \u2192 't94'. Wait, no, in the rules, I see several NT107 \u2192 't134' or something else? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking for NT107, in the rules, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules, near the end, I see:\n\nNT107 \u2192 't134'? Or wait, looking closely:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT107 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT107 \u2192 't174'\n\nWait, but in the list given, it's a long list. Let me scan for NT107:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n... and then:\n\nLooking for 'NT107':\n\nLooking:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT107 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT107 \u2192 't174'\n\nAlso, looking for 't134' in terminals:\n\nYes, 't129', 't110', 't130', etc., are in the string, so looking for where each 't' is produced.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see that each 't' in the string is produced by some non-terminal's rule.\n\nWait, looking back, each rule can be a production that either results in a non-terminal or a terminal. So, perhaps we can model this as a tree where the leaves are the 't's.\n\nNow, the string given is t129 t110 t130 t105 t96 t36 t177 t54 t112 t41 t11 t94 t165 t72 t172 t23 t174 t115 t71 t63 t91 t112 t0 t156 t94 t94 t100 t100 t134.\n\nThat's 30 tokens in total. So, each of these corresponds to a step down from the initial non-terminals that are eventually connected.\n\nWait, but since the string is all terminals, each step in the parsing must produce a terminal symbol, which can only happen at the leaves of the parse tree. So, each non-terminal must be able to expand in such a way that, when combined, they produce the required terminal sequence.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step. Starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT91\n\nSo, the string will be a concatenation of the terminals produced by NT99 and NT91.\n\nNow, let's see what NT99 produces. From the rules:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\nSo, the string will be the concatenation of the terminals from NT61 and NT76.\n\nNow, NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n\nSo, NT84's expansion is (NT107, NT17). Let's look at their productions:\n\nNT107 can produce 't94', 't174', etc. Specifically:\n\nNT107 \u2192 't94' and NT17 \u2192 't22' (I think, let me check). Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't22' (from the long list). So, NT107 can produce 't94' or 't174', and NT17 can produce 't22'.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 \u2192 't98' perhaps? Wait, let me look for NT44's rules.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't98'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me search for NT44:\n\nYes, I see: NT44 \u2192 't98'\n\nSo, back to NT84: it produces NT1 and NT65.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT107 and NT17\n\nNT107 can produce 't94' or 't174'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT65 \u2192 't157' or some other?

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. The grammar consists of a bunch of production rules, mostly expanding non-terminals (NT) into other non-terminals and sometimes terminals labeled 't' followed by numbers. The string we need to check is a sequence of these 't' terms, and I need to see if it can be derived through these rules.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the production rules are in the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for some that produce terminals or specific non-terminals. Each rule either breaks down a non-terminal into two others or substitutes it with a terminal. For example, S -> NT99 NT89, which might eventually become the 't' terms in the string.\n\nThe string given is: t134 t94 t22 t72 t164 t24 t102 t67 t170 t159 t49 t167 t50 t91 t23 t162 t73 t121 t145 t48 t22 t24 t177 t172 t164 t165 t123 t67 t9.\n\nI think I need to reverse engineer the derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if I can reach this string. Since S starts with NT99 NT89, let's see what those produce. Looking at the grammar, NT99 -> NT6 NT103, and NT89 -> NT44 NT1. Wait, but NT89 also has another rule: NT89 -> NT44 NT1. Hmm, I'm not sure if I got that right. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT89 has two productions: one is NT44 NT1 and another is explicitly written as NT44 NT1, perhaps? Or maybe I misread. Wait, let me check the rules again. Oh, the grammar has NT89 -> NT61 NT76 in one rule and perhaps others. Wait, maybe I'm confusing some rules. Let me list the relevant rules for NT89.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT89 -> NT61 NT76\n- Also, looking further down, there's another NT89 -> NT65 NT71. Wait, no, looking again I see a rule for NT89: \"NT89 -> NT44 NT1\" in one place. Or maybe it's another line. Let me check each rule step by step, perhaps I overlooked the rule for NT89.\n\nAh, here it is: \"NT89 -> NT65 NT71\", \"NT89 -> NT44 NT1\". So actually, NT89 can produce either NT65 NT71 or NT44 NT1. So, going back, S expands into NT99 and NT89, which further expand into other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, the first terms are t134, t94, etc. Let's see if these can be derived from the rules. For example, t134 is a terminal, so I need to find a production rule that gives t134. Looking through the rules, I see NT35 -> NT40 NT105, and further down NT68 -> NT45 NT71, and some other rules.\n\nWait, I also see NT65 -> NT105 NT71, which produces t105 or t71. Hmm, but t134 isn't directly listed, so perhaps we need to trace through the non-terminals to reach a terminal that matches t134. Let's see where t134 is defined. Looking for 't134' in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the 't' rules:\n- NT61 -> NT84 NT44, which might not directly give t134.\n- NT77 -> NT95 NT65, which gives t95 or t65.\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107, which gives t35 or t107.\n- NT59? No, I don't see a rule for NT59. Wait, looking again, perhaps I missed some. Maybe NT61 is involved.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT106 -> NT35 NT107 and NT35 has a production that leads to NT40 NT103, and so on. But maybe t134 is in another rule. Let me check all the terminal rules. \n\nI see:\n- NT57 -> NT69 NT80 \u2192 but these are non-terminals, so they don't produce terminals directly.\n- NT33 -> NT80 NT23, which are non-terminals.\n- Wait, I'm looking for a rule that directly defines a terminal like t134.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't immediately see any rule that has 't134' as a product. But maybe it's produced through some expansions. Let me trace back.\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT61: \"NT61 -> NT52 NT70\", and in another rule, \"NT61 -> NT84 NT44\", \"NT61 -> NT19 NT71\", etc. Wait, wait, actually, I think I misread earlier. Let me go through each NT rule:\n\nLooking for 't134' in the rules. I see a production: NT7 -> NT21 NT9. Hmm, not related. NT15 -> NT90. NT93 -> t167. NT100 -> t127.

Let's check each rule for terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, under the 't's:\n\nLooking for any production that ends with 't134' as a terminal.\n\nAh, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> t123\n- NT11 -> t17, t96, etc.\n- NT29 -> t156, t15\n- NT29 -> t129\n- NT33 -> t23, t80\n- NT68 -> t76, t145\n- NT9 -> t41\n- NT76 -> t45\n- NT106 -> t35, t107\n- NT61 -> t103, t107\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT99: \"NT99 -> NT6 NT103\" and \"NT99 -> NT40 NT20\", perhaps. Wait, no, in the rules, NT99 appears as \"NT99 -> NT6 NT103\" and another rule for NT99. Wait, looking again, I see NT99 -> NT6 NT103 as a rule. So, going back, NT99 (from S) expands into NT6 and NT103. So, how do these get to terminals?\n\nWait, NT6 is 't108' in the rules: \"NT6 -> t108\" and NT103 -> NT102 and NT29, etc. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I think I saw NT103 -> NT102 and NT29, and those further down lead to other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step. The first term is t134. If the first part of the string is t134, then in the derivation, the leftmost symbol must expand to t134. So, we have to find a non-terminal that can produce t134. But in the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t134. Does that mean the string cannot be generated? But maybe t134 is produced indirectly through a series of non-terminals, but I'm not seeing which path would lead to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a production for a particular NT that would lead to t134. Let me look again. Scanning through all the rules for 't134':\n\nLooking through the rules, the first NT that might produce t134 is in the list provided. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that directly produce t134 as a terminal. So perhaps t134 cannot be derived from any non-terminal in this grammar. If that's the case, the string cannot be produced by the grammar because it contains a terminal that isn't generated by any rule.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check if any non-terminal expands into t134 through a chain. For example, looking for which NT can eventually derive t134.

{"custom_id":"request-558","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `\"t60 t0 t127 t0 t2 t22 t90 t141 t34 t21 t91 t101 t121 t67 t23 t71 t104 t51 t13 t96 t105 t130 t130 t90 t36 t0 t72 t65 t151 t157\"`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has productions where each non-terminal is rewritten into two non-terminals. So, the given grammar is in CNF, which simplifies parsing, maybe allowing for a simple CYK algorithm, but since this is just a single string, maybe using the parsing strategy step by step would be better.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So the start strings must begin with NT99 and NT89. The string we're checking starts with t60, which seems to be a terminal, not a non-terminal, since all the NTs are followed by a 't' and a number. Wait, looking closer, the NTs are like NT99, which then produce strings starting with 't' followed by some number, like t6, etc. So perhaps each NT can be expanded to a series of terminals, each prefixed by 't'.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT99 and NT89. From the grammar, S -> NT99 NT89. So the first part is NT99, which can be expanded, then NT89. I'll need to see what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nLooking at NT99, any productions for NT99? Scanning through the productions, I see NT99 -> NT69 in one case, but not others. So to figure out what NT99 produces, I need to look at all its productions. Wait, looking through the grammar, does NT99 appear on the left-hand side of any productions? From the list, I see NT99 -> NT69, but nothing else. So NT99 can be replaced by NT69. Then, NT69 has its own productions. Let me go down.\n\nNT69 -> NT51, NT42. So NT69 expands into NT51 and NT42. Then, checking NT51's productions: looking for NT51 in the list. I see NT51 -> NT40 NT24, and also something else. Wait, looking at the productions, there's NT51: no, wait, I don't see NT51's productions listed here. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Alternatively, maybe NT51 only appears as a part of another production, not directly. Hmm, perhaps I need to approach this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be decomposed into parts that match the possible expansions of NT99 and NT89. Let's break down the string into components after the 't's. Each part between 't's is a number, which would correspond to the expansions of the non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t60 t0 t127 t0 t2 t22 t90 t141 t34 t21 t91 t101 t121 t67 t23 t71 t104 t51 t13 t96 t105 t130 t130 t90 t36 t0 t72 t65 t151 t157.\n\nSo the components are: 60,0,127,0,2,22,90,141,34,21,91,101,121,67,23,71,104,51,13,96,105,130,130,90,36,0,72,65,151,157.\n\nLooking at NT99 and NT89. NT99 is the first part, so it should generate parts of the string. NT99's production seems to be NT69, which then breaks into NT51 and others. Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: look at the entire string and see if it matches the structure of the grammar. The grammar is given in terms of non-terminals, which produce other non-terminals. Each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, each of which might produce more until only terminals are left.\n\nPerhaps it's better to build a parse tree, but with a string of terminals, it's easier to check step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terminals correspond directly to the non-terminals, meaning each NT followed by a 't' and a number is a production. So NT69 might expand into 't60', for example. So perhaps I can look for known expansions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each NT has specific productions. For example, NT73 can produce NT83 NT70 or NT6 NT39. Similarly, some NTs expand into multiple terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to see if the entire string can be broken into the products of the non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nGiven the string starts with t60, which would be a terminal generated by some NT production. Let me check which NT can produce 't60' directly. Looking through the grammar, do any NTs produce t60? Let's scan the productions.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: I don't see NT6 as a left-hand side (LHS), but looking through, in the productions, I see NT67: wait, no. Wait, looking through:\n\nThe productions for NT9: Not listed. NT2: Not listed. Wait, I'm looking for an NT that can directly produce t60. Scanning through the grammar, let's see the productions for NT60? Actually, I don't see any NT having a production for 't60'. Thus, it's possible that the string might not be in the language, but I should verify this.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the non-terminals are all named NT followed by a number. Each NT production leads to other NT combinations or to terminals with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nBut when I look at the string, t60 appears early, so perhaps NT99 or NT89 must eventually produce t60.\n\nLooking at the grammar, looking for NT99 and NT89:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nNT99's production is only NT69.\n\nNT89 has productions: NT61 NT76 and NT44 NT1.\n\nWait, let's see NT69:\n\nLooking for NT69, we see in the list: NT69 -> NT51, NT42.\n\nAnd NT51: is there a production? Hmm, I don't see any line with NT51 as the LHS. Wait, let me look again. The productions for NT51... Hmm, in the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT51 on the left, but perhaps it's a typo or I missed it. Wait, maybe NT51 doesn't exist, but some production includes it. Alternatively, perhaps NT51 produces more non-terminals. But without seeing any, I must proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a tree approach.\n\nGiven that S is NT99 NT89, the string generated by the grammar is a sequence of terminals from the expansion of these two NTs.\n\nSo, let's try to see where t60 might come from.\n\nLooking through all the NTs in the grammar, see if any of them produce t60.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT15: Some NTs, but NT15's productions. Looking through the productions, does any NT have a production for 't60'? Let's search.\n\nLooking through each line, looking for any 't60'. Scanning: 't151', 't103', 't141', 't174', etc., but no 't60'. So perhaps t60 is produced by NT69 through a production that's not listed here. Wait, but looking back, did I miss any line? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the provided lines, the only place where a terminal occurs is 't60', 't0', 't127', etc. So perhaps, NT69 can produce t60? But in the productions given, there's no NT that ends with 't60' except for NT61 in 't61', but I don't see it for t60. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking again: in the provided productions, I see NT61 -> NT93 NT80, but also NT61 -> NT74 NT45?\n\nNo, looking through, I don't see any terminal t60. So perhaps t60 isn't in any production.

In this case, the terminals seem to be the 't' followed by numbers like 't1', 't2', etc. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a lot of production rules where non-terminals like S, NT15, NT89, etc., are producing combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.

I think each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that terminates the derivation. So, for example, the string starts with `t73`, so I need to see if 73 can be a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT73 has two production rules: NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70 and NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39. Neither of these are terminals, they lead to other non-terminals. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no\u2014 wait, the string has `t73`, but according to the grammar, NT73 doesn't have a rule that directly produces 't73'; instead, it has production rules that split into combinations of NTs. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how the string is built up from the grammar. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and each terminal must be the result of a production rule that ends in that terminal. So for each token in the string, I need to find a production rule that terminates in that token.\n\nLet me start with the first token: `t73`. Looking through the grammar, does any non-terminal lead to `t73`? Let's check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70 (produces non-terminals)\nNT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39 (also non-terminals)\n\nSo there's no production for NT73 that ends with 't73'. Hmm, so perhaps the string is invalid? But wait, the string's first token is `t73`, but the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal whose production ends with 't73'. So that would immediately disqualify the string as being generated by the grammar, right?\n\nWait, but that seems odd. Let me double-check. Let me see all the rules again.\n\nLooking for any rule that directly ends in 't73':\n\nScanning through the production rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134', etc.\n- NT39 \u2192 't144'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134'\n- NT29 \u2192 't129'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41'\n- NT76 \u2192 't178'\n- NT65 \u2192 't105' and 't8'\n- NT73 \u2192 't167' and 't90'\n- NT15 \u2192 't90'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT73 \u2192 't90' again\nWait, so NT73 is defined as leading to 't167' or 't90', but no direct 't73'. So the string starts with 't73' which isn't produced by any rule in the grammar. That would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But wait, perhaps there's a typo or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar.

So, the string must start with symbols that can derive to these NTs.\n\nLooking at the string: `t41 t80 t144 t49 t22 t130 t54 t0 t22 t101 t8 t48 t22 t26 t156 t169 t76 t17 t63 t98 t141 t56 t145 t154 t102 t65 t178 t158 t26 t177 t139`.\n\nI notice that the first token is t41. Looking at the grammar terminals, I see that some rules produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't134', but there's also NT39 \u2192 't144', which is in the string. Hmm, let's check which NTe rules produce 't41' or other tokens in the string.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see some NTe rules that produce 't' and numbers. For example, NT16 \u2192 't112', NT17 \u2192 '22', NT2 \u2192 't26', etc. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see lines like NT39 \u2192 't144', NT43 \u2192 't2', and NT107 \u2192 't174'. Not sure if there's an NTe that produces 't41'.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT9 \u2192 't134' and NT39 \u2192 't144'. So the string has 't41' which I don't see in the provided terminals. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the NTe produce terminals. Maybe some NTe produce single terminals, like 't41' isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe it's derived from multiple steps.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar rules. For example, NT1 \u2192 't107' '17', which would produce 't107 17', but the string has 't41', which isn't directly produced by any single rule. Or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the terminals incorrectly. Let me list all the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t171 t17\nNT3 \u2192 t234 t180\nNT4 \u2192 t21\nNT5 \u2192 t123\nNT7 \u2192 t21 t9\nNT8 \u2192 t35 t43\nNT10 \u2192 t93 t107\nNT12 \u2192 t80\nNT14 \u2192 t123\nNT15 \u2192 t154\nNT16 \u2192 t112\nNT17 \u2192 t22 t99\nNT18 \u2192 t35 t43\nNT19 \u2192 t97 t99\nNT20 \u2192 nt\nNT21 \u2192 171 17\nNT22 \u2192 t22\nNT23 \u2192 156 107\nNT24 \u2192 t24\nNT25 \u2192 t25\n...\nWait, maybe it's easier to look for the tokens in the string against the terminal productions. Let's list all tokens:\n\nt41, t80, t144, t49, t22, t130, t54, t0, t22, t101, t8, t48, t22, t26, t156, t169, t76, t17, t63, t98, t141, t56, t145, t154, t102, t65, t178, t158, t26, t177, t139.\n\nLooking through each token:\n\n- t41: Is there any NT production that produces 't41'? From the grammar, I don't see any NT where substituting leads directly to 't41'. All terminal productions seem to be for numbers with combinations like 't171 17', 't21 17', etc., but no 't41' alone. So this might be a problem. If '41' isn't produced by any terminal rule, then the string can't be generated because 't41' isn't a valid terminal. Alternatively, maybe it's a derived symbol.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, are there any NTs that can produce 't41' directly or through combination? I don't see any terminal production that includes '41'. So perhaps the token 't41' shouldn't be in the string if the grammar doesn't allow producing it. That would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe it's a typo, or maybe I need to look deeper. But based on the given grammar, 't41' isn't produced by any of the terminal rules. Therefore, the string contains a token that's not allowed, so it's not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-575","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given grammar generates the provided string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The string is a sequence of terms like t178, t159, etc., so each of these must correspond to some production in the grammar. The grammar looks quite complex with many non-terminals and productions, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, which is S, and see what it expands into. The initial production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string must ultimately start with these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided string, it starts with t178. So, I need to see which production can derive t178. Scanning through the grammar, I see a production NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65 and another NT77 \u2192 NT65 NT71. But wait, looking closer, I notice that NT77 has other productions, but I don't see a production that directly results in a terminal like t178 yet. Hmm, maybe I need to follow the derivation steps.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, there are several NTx productions that lead to t's. Let me see which non-terminals can produce t's.\n\nFor example, NT17 \u2192 't22', NT77 \u2192 't56', NT75 \u2192 't98', NT68 \u2192 't134', etc. So, the t's are terminals that are the results of certain productions. So, each 't' in the string must come from a production where the non-terminal is replaced by that t.\n\nSo, the string is a series of t's with numbers. My task is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S using the given grammar.\n\nTo do this, I think I should try to parse the string using the grammar. Starting from the beginning, the string starts with t178. So, I need a production that gives t178 as the result. Looking at the grammar, I see NT77 \u2192 NT65 NT71, but that doesn't directly produce a t. Hmm.\n\nWait, does any non-terminal produce t178? Let me check the productions. Scanning through, for example, NT77 \u2192 t56, which is a different t. There's also NT96 \u2192 t91, but that's another t. I don't see a production where any non-terminal directly starts with t178. So, maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, maybe NT46 \u2192 t99 is another example, but no, that's different. Oh, perhaps t178 comes from NT67, but checking NT67's productions, it's either NT102 or NT73, not t. Wait, looking back, I see NT67 \u2192 NT67 NT73, but that's a recursion, so probably not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe t178 is derived from a longer chain. Let me try to see if there's a non-terminal that can produce t178. It seems that none of the non-terminals directly produce a t starting with 178. So that might mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first t doesn't correspond to any production rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a production that leads to t178. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at all NTxxx productions, I don't see any that produce 't178'. So perhaps the string starts with a t that's not accounted for by the grammar's productions. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me see: in the grammar, NT77 \u2192 t56, which is one of the t's present in the string, so that's fine. NT17 \u2192 t22, which is another t in the string. NT75 \u2192 t98, and so on.\n\nBut what about t178? Let me look through all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the last part of the string, I see t118 twice. Checking the grammar, there's NT118 \u2192 't118', so that's okay. Similarly, t97 appears a few times. NT84 \u2192 t17, which is another t in the string. So, all the t's except t178 have corresponding productions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again for t178. Scanning through all the productions, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly leads to t178 as the terminal. So, unless the t178 is produced through a chain of non-terminals that reduce to a t, but based on the grammar, I don't see such a path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the structure of the grammar. Let me re-examine. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the string must start with t178, which should come from either NT99 or NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99 productions: I don't see any in the provided grammar. NT99 is listed under some productions, but let me check the list. Wait, the grammar includes NT99 \u2192 t99, for example, but in the initial productions, I don't see NT99 as a starting point. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT99's productions are: NT99 \u2192 NT55 NT43, and others like NT99 \u2192 t99. So, if the first symbol is t178, it must come from a production starting with NT99 or NT89, right?\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t178, which implies that NT99 or NT89 must expand to include t178. But checking the productions for NT99, I see NT99 \u2192 t99, but not necessarily t178. Similarly, looking at NT89: NT89 \u2192 t17 from the provided grammar. So, if the first symbol is t178, that contradicts because NT99 can't produce t178, and NT89 can only produce t17. Therefore, the string cannot start with t178 because none of the NTx productions starting from the initial S can produce t178 as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because the first t178 has no corresponding production.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-594","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a list of production rules, and the string to evaluate is quite long. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. The string in question consists of a sequence of tokens like 't104', 't50', etc. These tokens are likely representing terminal symbols, so each must be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Some terminals are 't' followed by numbers, but others are not. For example, NT15 -> NT75 NT57, which suggests that NT non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, while others directly produce 't' terms.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n\nt104 t50 t21 t115 t71 t129 t96 t98 t127 t178 t101 t146 t151 t91 t164 t104 t99 t167 t2 t162 t144 t174 t72 t63 t108 t63 t0 t172 t54 t130 t51 t102.\n\nI'll need to trace back the possible derivation of this string through the given grammar. It might be helpful to look for production rules that generate each of these terminals, ensuring that the sequence aligns with the possible leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nStarting with the first token, 't104'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT52 -> t177, but that's not relevant here. Wait, 't104' appears under NT48 -> NT106 NT31, and in the rules, I see that NT106 can become 't35' via NT106 -> NT35 NT107, and NT35 can sometimes yield a 't' value. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me go through each token step by step.\n\nt104: Looking through the grammar, I see that NT48 -> NT106 NT31. So 't104' could be derived if one of the non-terminals in NT48's expansion becomes 't104'. Alternatively, perhaps there's a production rule that directly yields 't104', but from what I see, NT106 can go to 't35' or other terms, but I don't recall 't104' being a direct production.\n\nWait, maybe 't104' comes from a non-terminal that can produce it. Looking through the rules, I see NT48: NT48 -> NT106 NT31. If NT106 can yield 't35' (from NT106 -> NT35 NT107, and then NT35 -> 't43' sometimes, or perhaps another path). Alternatively, perhaps 't104' is a result of a non-terminal that's not directly in the given rules. Hmm, maybe I need to check all rules that can produce 't' terms.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, many produce 't' terms with varying numbers. For example, NT7 -> 't21', NT17 -> 't22', NT39 -> 't144', etc. I need to find if the string can be formed by successive applications of these rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string forward by applying the grammar's rules in either leftmost or rightmost derivations. Let's attempt a leftmost derivation first.\n\nStarting with S -> NT99 NT89. So the string should start with two terminals from NT99 and NT89. Looking at the string: the first two tokens are t104 and t50.\n\nSo, does NT99 produce t104? Let's check the rules for NT99. Wait, I don't see NT99 in the given rules. Wait, in the given grammar, I think I might have missed the rules. Wait, let me re-express the grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with a lot of production rules, each starting with NT followed by another number. So, each production like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, meaning NT15 expands into two other non-terminals. Similarly, some seem to produce terminal symbols.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that for example, NT7 -> 't21', which is a direct terminal production. Similarly, NT17 -> 't22', NT29 -> 't156', etc. So each production that ends with a terminal is a direct expansion.\n\nGiven the string starts with t104 and t50, I need to find production rules where the leftmost symbols can produce these.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't104'.\n\nLooking through the 't...' rules, I see NT106 -> 't35', NT107 seems to have some but not 't104'. Wait, perhaps 't104' is not directly produced, so maybe it's part of a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't104' is produced by a non-terminal that eventually reaches that terminal after some reductions. Maybe NT48 -> NT106 NT31. So, if NT106 can produce 't35' and NT31 can produce 't121', for example, but that doesn't directly lead to 't104'.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's better to approach this systematically by building a parse tree. Alternatively, I can check which non-terminals can produce each 't' token.\n\nLet me list all the 't' tokens in the string and see if their corresponding non-terminals can be derived from S.\n\nt104, t50, t21, t115, t71, t129, t96, t98, t127, t178, t101, t146, t151, t91, t164, t104, t99, t167, t2, t162, t144, t174, t72, t63, t108, t63, t0, t172, t54, t130, t51, t102.\n\nLet me pick the first token, t104. Looking for NT that can produce t104 through their productions.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT106 -> 't35' or NT35 NT107.\n- NT35 -> 't68' or NT68 NT103, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the recursive descent parsing method. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the grammar is in CNF. Since it's CNF, each production is a single non-terminal followed by two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, in recursive descent, the parser would look for the longest match from the current position.\n\nBut to do this, I might need to reverse the string and see if each step can find a production.\n\nWait, I'm getting overwhelmed. Maybe there's a pattern in the string that can help. For example, the string contains 't104' twice. Let's see the production rules involving 't104'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT48 -> NT106 NT31, and NT52 -> NT107 NT81, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to specific non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to find a path through the grammar that can generate this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for sequences in the string that match certain production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the entire string, it's 35 tokens long. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion doubles the number of symbols, but since the string consists of terminals, the derivation ends in a certain number of steps, producing the terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string's length can give me an idea of the number of steps needed. For 35 terminals, perhaps it's around 5 or 6 steps since 2^5 =32 and 2^6=64. But this is approximate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into production steps. For example, starting with S-> NT99 NT89, each of those can produce two non-terminals, and each of those can eventually produce the terminals.\n\nBut this is a bit abstract. Maybe I can check which non-terminals produce the first few tokens.\n\nSo, the first token is t104.

{"custom_id":"request-601","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens like 't171', 't96', etc. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar seems to be using symbols S and NT (which I think stands for non-terminals) along with terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Then each NT symbol on the left has a production rule, for example, NT99 could produce something else, and so on. Some NT symbols have multiple production options.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of these 't' tokens. I need to see if this sequence can be generated by following the grammar's rules.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string must start with the production of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 produces NT61 NT76, according to the rule NT99 -> NT61 NT76. Then, I need to see what each of those produce.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n   - Now, NT61 and NT76 are both non-terminals. Let's see their productions.\n   \n2. NT76 \u2192 NT67 NT71 (according to NT76 -> NT67 NT71)\n   - So NT76 is replaced by NT67 and NT71.\n   \n3. NT67 \u2192 NT67 NT73 (Wait, does NT67 have that? Let me check. Looking at the grammar, I see NT67 \u2192 NT67 NT73 seems not. Looking again: NT67 isn't listed in the productions. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I think I need to verify all the rules for each NT symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT67. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look for NT67. It's not present in the list. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reconstruct the parse tree. Since the string starts with 't171 t102 t105 t73 t130 t102 t71 t145 t60 t76 t48 t50 t80 t118 t13 t69 t124 t56 t93 t76 t34 t124 t11 t1 t41 t121 t0 t172 t26 t48 t118 t146'.\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens, and it starts with 't171'. So perhaps I should see which NT symbols produce 't171'.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, I see that some NT symbols map to 't' followed by a number. For example, NT96 can go to 't157' (from NT96 -> NT106 NT31 and then NT106 has more productions; wait, maybe I should go deeper). Let me see which NT rules end in a 't' terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT57 -> 't172'\n- NT77 -> 't178'\n- NT99 -> 't6' (no, wait, NT99 is replaced by NT61 NT76; looking at NT61's rule, NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44, etc.)\nWait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me look for all the 't' productions.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, some ending in 't' and others remaining as NT rules. For example, many of these rules have 't' plus a number. Let me list them:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't107' 't17'\nNT31 \u2192 't7' 't6'\nNT103 \u2192 't101'\nNT52 \u2192 't177'\nNT21 \u2192 't171'\nNT43 \u2192 't2'\nNT33 \u2192 't' plus some numbers\nNT80 \u2192 't63'\nNT49 \u2192 't157'\nNT69 \u2192 't1'\nNT100 \u2192 't127'\nNT108 \u2192 't118'\nNT65 \u2192 't157'\nNT46 \u2192 't99'\nNT39 \u2192 't48'\nNT96 \u2192 't91'\nNT19 \u2192 't99'\nNT23 \u2192 't156'\nNT67 \u2192 not finding, maybe I missed it.\nNT71 \u2192 't69'\nNT102 \u2192 't13'\nNT68 \u2192 't145'\nNT76 \u2192 't121'\nNT55 \u2192 't72'\nNT35 \u2192 't94'\nNT107 \u2192 't174'\nNT43 \u2192 't2'\nNT52 \u2192 't177'\nNT40 \u2192 't21'\nWait, I might be overcomplicating.

Maybe I should consider the first few steps.\n\nThe string starts with t171. Let's see which NT can produce 't171'. Looking through the rules, I see NT21 \u2192 't171'. So to get 't171', we need NT21, which comes from S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Wait, no. The first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, but 't171' would have to come from one of those NTs.

Let me check the productions again. Oh, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct it.\n\nLooking back, for NT29, the productions are:\n\nNT29 -> 't36'\n\nNT29 -> 't156'\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, under NT29, there are two entries:\n\nNT29 -> 't36'\n\nNT29 -> 't156'\n\nSimilarly, NT99 has multiple productions.\n\nSo, for NT29, the productions are:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't36' (1st occurrence)\n\nNT29 \u2192 't156'\n\nWait, but in the initial list, it's written twice as NT29 -> 't36' and NT29 -> 't156'. So each of these is a separate rule.\n\nSimilarly, NT99 has:\n\nNT99 -> 't6'\n\nNT99 -> 't103'\n\nSo, each is a separate production.\n\nThis means that when parsing, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and each non-terminal can be broken down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me start by noting that the entire string is a sequence of terminals, which are the labels like t94, t151, etc. Our goal is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nThe first step is to check the structure of the string. The entire string can be thought of as a sequence where each symbol is 't' followed by a number, which are the non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nSo, let's list all the symbols:\n\n1. t94\n\n2. t151\n\n3. t2\n\n4. t144\n\n5. t36\n\n6. t115\n\n7. t51\n\n8. t21\n\n9. t115\n\n10. t123\n\n11. t99\n\n12. t133\n\n13. t134\n\n14. t177\n\n15. t54\n\n16. t23\n\n17. t124\n\n18. t178\n\n19. t17\n\n20. t139\n\n21. t108\n\n22. t105\n\n23. t67\n\n24. t141\n\n25. t2\n\n26. t170\n\n27. t2\n\n28. t71\n\n29. t145\n\n30. t65\n\n31. t13\n\n32. t158\n\n33. t26\n\nSo, this is a list of 33 symbols, each being a 't' followed by a number. Each of these corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nNow, let's see how the grammar builds up the string. Starting from S, which becomes NT99 NT89. So, the string starts with NT99, then NT89.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: t94. Let's find what non-terminal generates 't94'. Checking the productions for NT94 \u2013 but wait, looking back at the grammar, NT94 isn't directly listed as a production. Instead, the non-terminals can produce certain terminals.\n\nLooking again, we see NT99 and NT48. Wait, no, let me check each non-terminal:\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals produce certain terminals:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t6 or t103 (NT99 -> 't6' and NT99->'t103')\n\nNT89 \u2192 t44 or t1 (NT89->'t44' and NT89->'t1'?)\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 't61' and 't68'? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the grammar as given has:\n\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\n\nNT89 -> NT44 NT1\n\nWait, so NT89 can produce either 't61 t76' or 't44 t1'.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT89 has two productions:\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\nand NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nSo, NT89 cannot directly produce 't61' or 't44' alone. Instead, each of these is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the t94 is the first symbol. So, t94 must be produced by a non-terminal, but looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't94' except if it's derived from something else. Let me check all terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt94, t151, t2, t144, t36, t115, t51, t21, t115, t123, t99, t13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-614","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t104 t171 t129 t94 t139 t174 t54 t157 t54 t54 t123 t48 t45 t130 t144 t159 t47 t9 t56 t104 t134 t60 t104 t93 t73 t154 t45 t171 t101 t60 t169 t167 t139`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means it's structured with each production having exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with NT99 and NT89. But in the string, I immediately see a 't104' which is a terminal. That makes me think that the initial productions from S might not directly match, so S itself must be expanded through other non-terminals. \n\nI need to trace the string backwards, checking if each terminal can be matched by a production. The grammar is a bit complex with many non-terminals and terminals mapped to specific numbers. I'll try to construct possible derivations.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual tokens and see which productions can generate them:\n\n- The first token is 't104', which according to the grammar, can be produced by NT64 or NT52. Looking at the grammar:\n  - NT64 -> NT100 NT93\n  - NT52 -> NT28 NT70 or NT107 NT81, etc. \n  - Since 't104' is mapped, let's see if NT64 or NT52 can produce 't104'. \n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar mappings, I see that a lot of the NTs have specific terminals. For example, NT106 -> NT35 NT107 and so on. So, each NT has a series of productions that eventually lead to terms like 't144', 't171', etc.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can start from the beginning and see if each 't' corresponds to a terminal that's the result of a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a parser approach or construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree for the string must have a structure where each node is a non-terminal and has exactly two children, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't104'. So, let's find a production that directly produces 't104'. Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT64 -> 't104'? Checking the grammar, NT64 is defined as NT100 NT71, which doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe 't104' is from NT12, which is in the grammar: NT12 -> 't80'. No, that's 't80'. \n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that many NTs produce other NTs and some produce terminals. For example, NT68 can produce 't47' or other NTs. Similarly, NT93 produces 't56' or other NTs.\n\nBut going through each possible production manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down into parts that match known productions.\n\nAnother plan: Build a table mapping each terminal to the production that can generate it, then see if the sequence of terminals can be connected through these productions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't104' can be produced by NT52 (since NT52 -> 't104').\nWait, checking the grammar, no, NT52 is defined as, for example, NT52 -> NT28 NT70 or NT107 NT81. But one of the mappings says NT52 -> 't54', so that's not 't104'. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar mappings, I see lines like:\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n- NT16 -> 't112'\n- NT29 -> 't156'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT12 -> 't80'\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT39 -> 't144'\n- NT68 -> 't145'\n- NT29 -> 't129'\n- BT96 -> 'something'\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals in the string and map each to their possible NT parents or directly to terminals.\n\nThe string is: t104 t171 t129 t94 t139 t174 t54 t157 t54 t54 t123 t48 t45 t130 t144 t159 t47 t9 t56 t104 t134 t60 t104 t93 t73 t154 t45 t171 t101 t60 t169 t167 t139.\n\nLet's list each token and see:\n\n1. t104 \u2192 Could be from NT64 (but in the grammar NT64 -> NT100 NT93; but looking at the bottom, I see NT106 -> NT35 NT107, etc., which eventually produce 't's. Wait, perhaps t104 comes from NT64, which is in production NT64 -> NT100 NT93. So, if NT64 can produce 't104', then maybe NT64 is involved.\n\nWait, looking for 't104' in the grammar: Looking through the bottom section, I see NT171 is a terminal, so NT171 -> 't171', which is in the string. Similarly, NT106 -> 't157', but t104 is not there. \n\nWait, perhaps t104 comes from a production like NT64 -> NT12 NT44, or something. Alternatively, maybe it's NT52.\n\nWait, looking at the production NT52 -> NT107 NT81, and in the grammar, NT107 can produce 't94' according to: NT107 -> 't94'. So if NT52 can produce 't104', but in the grammar, NT52 is mapped to 't104'? Or perhaps other ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't104' comes from NT64, which is derived from other NTs. For example, NT64 -> NT100 NT93. Then, NT100 can produce 't104'? Looking, NT100 -> 't127', so no. Maybe NT64 is derived from NT52. Wait, looking at NT52: do any of its productions produce 't104'? Checking:\n\n- NT52 -> NT28 NT70: No.\n- NT52 -> NT107 NT81: Let's see what NT107 and NT81 produce.\n- NT107 maps to 't94' and other NTs.\n- NT81 can produce 't80' or other NTs. So, perhaps NT52's NT107 can produce 't104', but I don't see NT107 mapping to 't104'; instead, I see NT107 -> 't94'.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should construct a parse tree starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't104'. So, I need to find a derivation where the first symbol is 't104'. In the grammar, the first symbol is either NT99 or NT89 from S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't104', which isn't directly 't99' or 't89', so the initial S must expand through a chain that allows the first symbol to be 't104'. \n\nSo, S starts as S -> NT99 NT89. Then, NT99 expands, and NT89 expands. But in the string, the first token is 't104', which must come from some NT production. So perhaps NT99 or NT89 eventually produce 't104' through a series of steps.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT99 is defined as NT55 NT23. Then, NT55 -> NT55 NT23? Wait, no, NT55 is defined as NT23 NT57. Wait, let me check:\n\nNT99 -> NT55 NT23"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-636","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to check if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t67 t123 t129 t96 t178 t73 t162 t63 t177 t164 t129 t8 t67 t2 t174 t90 t99 t165 t156 t105 t165 t127 t104 t159 t108 t118 t36 t0 t91 t172 t24 t96 t90 t104`. That's a lot of tokens!\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. But looking at the provided grammar, I see some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right side, like NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76. Wait, but that's not terminal symbols\u2014it's non-terminals. Oh, no, wait, the grammar is in CNF, so perhaps each production has exactly two non-terminals. Let me check. Oh, for example, NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. Also, some rules end with 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nSo, the goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me look at S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string must start with either NT99 or NT89. Let me check the first token, which is t67. Wait, no. The string starts with t67, but the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which are non-terminals. So, S can't directly produce t67. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, because the productions convert non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals. So, each non-terminal must derive a terminal string.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step, decomposing each non-terminal into terminals and further non-terminals. But the string starts with t67, which is part of the output. So, maybe S needs to derive a sequence that produces all these t's in order.\n\nBut let me first list out the non-terminals and see their possible productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (from NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36, but I need to check each rule)\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, it's a bit extensive. Let me try to find which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFor example, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103. NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, and NT45 \u2192 NT24 NT88, NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, etc. But a lot of these produce other non-terminals.\n\nBut let's see which NTs directly produce a terminal. Scanning the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't21' (so NT7 produces t21)\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't36' and 't156'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80' -- wait, no, looking at the rules, NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT48 \u2192 't11'\n- NT11 \u2192 't17'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT36 \u2192 't47'\n- NT52 \u2192 't104' (twice)\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT57 \u2192 't172'\n- NT15 \u2192 't90' twice\n- NT23 \u2192 't171' or 't156' (multiple paths)\n- NT73 appears in two places, once as NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70 and once as NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\n- NT68 \u2192 't145' and 't28'\n- NT91 \u2192 't164' and 't133'\n- NT65 \u2192 't157' and 't8'\n- Wait, perhaps I should list all possible NTs that produce terminals and their corresponding t tokens.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t21\n- NT16 \u2192 t112\n- NT29 \u2192 t36, t156\n- NT12 \u2192 t80\n- NT48 \u2192 t11\n- NT11 \u2192 t17\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- NT36 \u2192 t47\n- NT52 \u2192 t104\n- NT77 \u2192 t56\n- NT57 \u2192 t172\n- NT15 \u2192 t90\n- NT23 \u2192 t171, t156\n- NT68 \u2192 t145, t28\n- NT91 \u2192 t164, t133\n- NT65 \u2192 t157, t8\n- NT2 \u2192 t26\n- NT77 \u2192 t56 (already listed)\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT80 \u2192 t63\n- NT49 \u2192 t115\n- NT28 \u2192 t76\n- NT67 \u2192 t67 (produced when NT67 is broken down)\n- NT35 \u2192 t94, t40, etc. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I think some non-terminals may produce a mix.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break down the string token by token and see if each can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the string: `t67 t123 t129 t96 t178 t73 t162 t63 t177 t164 t129 t8 t67 t2 t174 t90 t99 t165 t156 t105 t165 t127 t104 t159 t108 t118 t36 t0 t91 t172 t24 t96 t90 t104`\n\nFirst token is t67. So, which NT produces t67? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t67. Therefore, if t67 is in the string, it must be derived from an NT that eventually produces t67.\n\nBut looking at the provided grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t67. Let's check each rule to see:\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT67 \u2192 NT98 (no terminal), and NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, etc. So, no direct production of t67. Hmm. So, the first token is problematic because it's not directly produced by any NT in the given grammar. Therefore, perhaps the string cannot be produced, which would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me not jump to conclusions. Maybe there's a way to derive t67. Let me see if any NT can produce a substring that includes t67.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t67. Let me think if any longer chain could produce t67. For example, does any NT eventually derive to t67?\n\nLooking through the rules, let me check each NT that produces other NTs:\n\nNT89 appears in S \u2192 NT99 NT89, but NT89's production seems to be NT73 \u2192 ... No, wait, NT89 is S's production, not directly in the rules. Wait, no. Let me check the rules for NT89: I don't see an NT89 rule in the given list, except for the production at the top, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, NT89 is a terminal? No, but looking at the rules, perhaps NT89 is a non-terminal that can produce other terms.\n\nWait, no, the NT symbols are all capital, like NT99, NT89, etc. Are these terminals or non-terminals? Wait, in context-free grammars in CNF, the terminals are lowercase letters, but in the provided grammar, the non-terminals are the ones starting with NT, like NT1 to NT100, etc., and each has production rules to other NTs or terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I don't see any rules that produce t67.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string is a sequence of t's with numbers. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's a tree of productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except the start symbol S which goes to NT99 and NT89. Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal (t followed by a number) or another NT.\n\nThe given string is: `t49 t165 t170 t158 t69 t36 t50 t99 t24 t22 t124 t146 t54 t41 t178 t171 t48 t169 t41 t123 t177 t45 t96 t93 t11 t145 t51 t108 t17 t110 t165 t159 t144 t41`.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Maybe I can start from the top and see if each production leads to the correct terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\nSo the string should start with the symbols derived from NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t49. I need to see which NT can derive t49. Looking through the rules, I see NT106 -> NT35 NT107 and others, but I don't see a direct rule for NT39 or NT35 leading to t49.\n\nWait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT96: NT96 -> NT33 NT36.\nAnd NT33: NT33 -> NT80 NT23.\nNT80 -> NT67 NT73.\nLooking further, NT67 -> NT67... Oh wait, no, there's NT67 in another rule: NT67 -> NT102 NT92.\nWait, maybe another approach. The token is t49. Let me look for any NT rule that includes t49.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT52 -> NT24 NT88\nBut wait, there's also NT49: NT49 is mentioned in multiple places. Wait, actually, the rules include:\n\nLooking for t49, I see that NT49 is a terminal in the grammar. NT49's production: I see in the rules that NT49 is on the right side, but does any NT produce NT49?\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT69 and NT16, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking at NT49:\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT with a production that includes t49 as the result.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I don't see any NT rule directly yielding t49, except maybe in the definition of NT49. Wait, looking back, the initial problem statement says: grammar is presented in a certain way, and then at the end, all the NT rules are listed.\n\nWait, let me check each NT rule:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce t49. For example, looking at NT70: NT70 -> NT102 NT92. Not helpful.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT52 -> NT24 NT88. No t49.\n- NT96 -> NT33 NT36. No.\n- NT12 -> NT91 NT69. No.\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT71. No.\n- NT54 -> NT42 NT75. No.\n- NT64 -> NT106 NT93. No.\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107. No t49.\n- NT35 -> NT68 NT103. No.\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT12. No.\n- NT84 -> NT1 NT65. No.\n- NT95 -> NT130 NT65.

Oh, here's a t24, but the token is t49.\n- NT92 -> 't133'. No, it's t133, but in our string, is there a t133? Let me check. The string has t165, t158, t69, etc. No, t133 isn't present. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Are the NT rules for the non-terminals, and the terminals are the t's with numbers? So when an NT rule like S -> NT99 NT89 is used, each NT99 and NT89 should derive to some sequence of t's.\n\nSo S starts as NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99: In the rules, NT99 -> NT6 NT103. Then NT6 and NT103.\n\nNT6: NT6 -> 't108'. So that's a terminal.\n\nNT103: NT103 -> 't101'. Another terminal.\n\nSo from NT99, we get t108 and t101.\n\nThen NT89: NT89 -> NT61 NT76.\n\nNT61: NT61 -> NT84 NT44.\n\nNT84: NT84 -> NT1 NT65.\n\nNT1: NT1 -> NT107 NT17.\n\nNT107 is 't174' somewhere in the rules? Wait, looking back at the NT rules: Yes, near the end, there are several NT107 entries leading to 't174', 't65', etc., but in the provided list, I don't see exact matches, but looking through, there's NT107 -> 't174' and others.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to trace back the derivations. Let me try again.\n\nNT84 -> NT1 NT65.\n\nNT1: NT1 -> NT107 NT17.\n\nNT107 -> 't174' or 't65'... I'm not sure, but looking back, some NT107 rules produce tn, like 't174', 't65', etc. But in our string, the first part is t49. So this approach might not yield the right tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should approach it with the entire string and try to parse it backward.\n\nLet me list the tokens in reverse:\n\nThe last token is t41. So where does t41 come from?\n\nLooking at the rules, t41 can come from NT41, but I don't see any NT rule ending with 41, except maybe NT79 or others. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT production that results in t41 directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe t41 comes from a production like NT53 -> t41, but checking the rules, I don't see any such rule. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a production like NT42 -> t41? Looking at the rules: NT42 -> 't165'... No, wait, looking for NT42's production, in the rules I see NT42 -> 't158', 't165', etc., but not t41.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT49 is a terminal, right? Because in the last rule, it's written that some NT produce 't49', such as NT49 -> 't49'. Wait, wait, looking at the rules as presented:\n\nWait, in the initial list, for example, there's:\n\nNT16 -> 't112'\n\nNT36 -> 't47'\n\nNT43 -> 't2'\n\nNT57 -> 't172'\n\nNT77 -> 't124'\n\nAnd towards the bottom:\n\nNT24 -> 't76'\n\nNT69 -> 't24' \u2013 wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking carefully, at the very end of the provided rules:\n\nNT107 -> 't174'\n\nNT107 -> 't65'\n\nNT107 -> 't174'.\n\nWait, no, it seems more that in the rules, for example,\n\nNT73 -> 't167'\n\nNT57 -> 't172'\n\nNT107 -> 't174'.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-653","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see several productions that transform non-terminals into terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t154 t174 t94 t80 t65 t170 t156 t22 t17 t177 t123 t60 t0 t139 t177 t71 t13 t115 t72 t174 t21 t139 t51 t9 t2 t97 t146 t63 t123 t48 t54 t60 t157 t54 t100.\n\nFirst, I'll note that each segment separated by a space is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the string should be split into exactly two parts unless there are intermediate non-terminals that expand further.\n\nLooking at the list of non-terminals, many of them transform into specific terminals. For example, NT99 \u2192 t154, NT174 \u2192 t154? Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, NT177 \u2192 t177, and similarly NT174 \u2192 t174. So the string has t154 and t174, which correspond to NT154 and NT174.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, each production has a specific terminal. For example, NT48 \u2192 t11, NT29 \u2192 t129, etc. So each NT corresponds to a specific terminal string.\n\nNow, the original S production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the terminals from NT99 and NT89. Let's check what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. \nNT6 \u2192 t108.\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45.\nNT24 \u2192 NT123.\nNT45 \u2192 t98. Wait, no, looking again, NT45 is terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT45 isn't a production, but looking at the list, there's an entry: NT11 \u2192 NT81 NT29, which leads to terminals. Wait, no, I think some of these are terminal productions, others are non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking carefully, most of the entries are non-terminals. For example, NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe string starts with t154, which must come from NT154. Let's see what NT154 can produce. Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT154 directly. Instead, looking for NT15, which is t151, and so on. It seems NT99 is involved early on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT in the string refers to a specific production. Since the grammar is large, perhaps we can look up which terminals each NT corresponds to.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 t154\n- NT174 \u2192 t174\n- NT94 \u2192 t80\n- NT80 \u2192 t65\n- NT65 \u2192 t157\n- NT170 \u2192 t170\n- NT156 \u2192 t156\n- NT22 \u2192 t22\n- NT17 \u2192 t17\n- NT177 \u2192 t177\n- NT123 \u2192 t123\n- NT60 \u2192 t60\n- NT0 \u2192 t0\n- NT139 \u2192 t139\n- NT177 \u2192 t177 again\n- NT71 \u2192 t71\n- NT13 \u2192 t13\n- NT115 \u2192 t115\n- NT72 \u2192 t72\n- NT174 \u2192 t174 again\n- NT21 \u2192 t21\n- NT139 \u2192 t139 again\n- NT51 \u2192 t51\n- NT9 \u2192 t9\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT97 \u2192 t97\n- NT146 \u2192 t146\n- NT63 \u2192 t63\n- NT123 \u2192 t123 again\n- NT48 \u2192 t48\n- NT54 \u2192 t54\n- NT60 \u2192 t60 again\n- NT157 \u2192 t157\n- NT54 \u2192 t54 again\n- NT100 \u2192 t100\n\nNow, the initial production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo let's track what each NT produces:\n\nStarting with NT99 \u2192 t154.\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT99 isn't directly defined, so perhaps I need to trace the productions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. NT99 as a non-terminal must have a production rule. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nNT6 \u2192 t108\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45\nNT24 \u2192 NT123\nNT45 \u2192 t98? Wait, does NT45 produce a terminal? Looking back, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT45: hmm, looking through the list, I don't see NT45 as a production. It seems NT45 is a terminal because in the string, there's a t48 and t54, but in the grammar, NT48 and NT54 have productions that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n- NT45 is a terminal because it's not listed as a non-terminal in any production.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, many non-terminals are further broken down, but some are terminals if they aren't the left-hand side of any production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build an interpretation tree for the string.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Let me consider that the grammar's start symbol is S, which breaks down into NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the string should be the concatenation of NT99's derivation and NT89's derivation.\n\nSo, for the first part, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Then NT6 \u2192 t108. Now, NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. NT24 \u2192 NT123. NT45 is a terminal (since it's not a left-hand side of any production), which is t45? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT45 is not listed as a production, so it's a terminal.\n\nSo NT103 \u2192 t123 t45. Then NT6 \u2192 t108, so NT99 \u2192 t108 t123 t45.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t154, which is from NT99. So maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps NT99 doesn't expand beyond t154 directly. Wait, in the list, looking for NT99: yes, in the list, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nSo NT99: step 1. NT6 \u2192 t108. Then NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. NT24 \u2192 NT123. NT45 is terminal t45. So NT99 \u2192 t108 t123 t45.\n\nBut the string starts with t154, which isn't t108, so that doesn't match. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I should look at the string and see which NT corresponds to each part.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt154 t174 t94 t80 t65 t170 t156 t22 t17 t177 t123 t60 t0 t139 t177 t71 t13 t115 t72 t174 t21 t139 t51 t9 t2 t97 t146 t63 t123 t48 t54 t60 t157 t54 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string: `t112 t172 t67 t26 t162 t145 t71 t145 t145 t177 t13 t146 t156 t50 t146 t104 t24 t41 t133 t67 t100 t159 t80 t108 t91 t169 t108 t76 t76 t8 t115 t76 t26 t101 t17`.\n\nEach token here is like a terminal symbol, probably representing a terminal in the grammar. The grammar has a bunch of rules, like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and others that split into two NTs. Each NT eventually resolves into a string of t-something.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent approach or a top-down parser.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens:\n\n1. t112\n2. t172\n3. t67\n4. t26\n5. t162\n6. t145\n7. t71\n8. t145\n9. t145\n10. t177\n11. t13\n12. t146\n13. t156\n14. t50\n15. t146\n16. t104\n17. t24\n18. t41\n19. t133\n20. t67\n21. t100\n22. t159\n23. t80\n24. t108\n25. t91\n26. t169\n27. t108\n28. t76\n29. t76\n30. t8\n31. t115\n32. t76\n33. t26\n34. t101\n35. t17\n\nI notice that t26 appears in the grammar. Looking at the production rules, I see that NT26 and others might be involved, but wait, the initial grammar only has S and NTs up to NT100. So I need to see if these t-values are covered.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t1\n- NT88 \u2192 t69\n- NT76 \u2192 t121\n- NT71 \u2192 t50\n- NT28 \u2192 t76\n- NT76 \u2192 t121\n- NT88 \u2192 t69\n- NT91 \u2192 t164\n- NT52 \u2192 appears in several places, like NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70, and also NT52 \u2192 NT107 NT81.\n\nWait, but looking through the terminals, some of them might correspond to the non-terminals. For example, if NT26 is a terminal, it could match t172, which is another token in the string.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should see which terminal productions exist in the grammar. Let me list the terminal productions:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't21' (from S and others, not sure if relevant)\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT33 \u2192 't23'\n- NT80 \u2192 't67'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134' and 't145'\n- NT52 \u2192 't177'\n- NT96 \u2192 't105' and 't1' etc.\nWait, no, actually the terminal productions are:\n\nLooking back, each rule where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 't172'\n- NT96 \u2192 't105' also 't178'? Wait no, looking at the rules, some right-hand sides are terminals. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't134' and 't145'\n- NT96 \u2192 't105' is one, 't1' is another?\nWait, perhaps I need to look for all rules where the RHS is a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT18 \u2192 NT35 NT43\nWait, no, NT18 \u2192 NT35 NT43\nBut that's non-terminals. Let me look for any rules where the RHS is just a terminal.\n\nWait, here are the terminal-containing rules:\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\n1. NT96 \u2192 't91' from NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 and other branches.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the rules earlier. Let me scan each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT89\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\n- NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n- NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n- NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\n- NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT39 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n- NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT96 \u2192 NT35 NT65 (duplicate maybe)\n- ... Wait, some rules have the RHS as a terminal and non-terminals.\n\nAfter reviewing, it's clear that many rules have a mix. The direct terminal outputs are:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT70 \u2192 't162'\n- NT76 \u2192 't121'\n- NT45 \u2192 't98' (Wait, no, looking again: NT22 \u2192 't99', etc.)\nWait, perhaps I should list each terminal production.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t134 and t145\n- NT96 \u2192 t105 and t178? No, I think I'm mixing with other rules.\n\nWait, let's go line by line:\n\nLine: NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36. Hmm, both non-terminals.\n\nLooking for any RHS that is just a single terminal:\n\nWait, actually, the rules may have both sides as non-terminals or terminals combined. For instance, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. That's two non-terminals.\n\nBut there are rules like NT7 \u2192 t21, or NT106 \u2192 t94?\n\nWait, from the given grammar, many rules are splitting into non-terminals, but some have RHSs that are two non-terminals, unless the non-terminals eventually resolve to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If a non-terminal's production includes a terminal, that terminal is part of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals:\n\nFor example, is there any rule where an NT directly goes to a terminal? Let me check the rules again.\n\nYes, I see some:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t134 and t145: Wait, no. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nHere's a more methodical approach:\n\n1. NT96 \u2192 t33? No, looking at the rules:\n\nNT96 was defined in several places, but in the given rules, NT96 is:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- Also, in another place, NT96 \u2192 t157?\n\nWait, no, looking back.

{"custom_id":"request-679","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful. The string is a sequence of ts followed by numbers, like t91, t104, etc. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal (A) can produce two other non-terminals or a terminal. The string in question seems to consist of terminals, so maybe the non-terminals are being expanded into these terminals through the productions.\n\nI see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT9 -> 't24', which is just a terminal. So, to check if the string is generated, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which initially produces NT91 and NT99. Let's look at each of these.\n\nStarting with S -> NT91 NT99:\n\n- NT91 seems to produce 't91' directly, according to the productions (NT91 -> 't91').\n- NT99 also directly produces 't99' because NT99 is defined as 't99'.\n\nSo, the initial expansion would produce 't91 t99'. But the given string starts with 't91 t104 ...', which doesn't match 't99'. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the initial productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar rules for NT91 and NT99:\n- NT91 is 't91' according to one of the rules.\n- NT99 is 't99' as well, because I see NT99 -> 't99'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't91 t104 ...'. So according to the initial production, S -> NT91 NT99, the string should start with 't91 t99'. However, the given string starts with 't91 t104', which is different.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something about the grammar. Let me double-check the productions. Did I copy them correctly? The user list many NTX productions that sometimes replace NT with 't' and a number, but maybe some non-terminals have multiple rules, and S is not directly producing NT91 and NT99.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, S is correctly written as S->NT99 NT89? No, no, wait the initial problem says:\n\n\"Grammar: S->NT99 NT89 NT15->NT75 NT57 NT81->NT55 NT23...\"\n\nWait, let me clarify. I might have miscalculated earlier. The user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me parse the initial part again:\n\nWait, the first line says S->NT99 NT89? No, no, the initial problem says:\n\nWait, no, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nWait, that's not what he wrote. Looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: ```\n\nS-> NT99 NT89\n\n...\n\n```\n\nWait, that's wrong. Let me check. No, in the problem statement, the user lists the grammar as:\n\nS-> NT99 NT89\n\nNT15-> NT75 NT57\n\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\n\n...\n\nWait, S is producing NT99 and NT89. Hmm, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the initial production is S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nWait, but in the user's message, the actual grammar is a list of productions, starting with S->NT99 NT89, and then all the others. So, that's the starting point. So the string starts with t91 and has t104, which seems to diverge.\n\nBut let's get back to the string: \"t91 t104 t110 t2 t134 t141 t172 t165 t36 t54 t91 t90 t167 t49 t171 t13 t26 t133 t8 t118 t146 t102 t72 t71 t146 t130 t8 t69 t56 t24 t34 t105 t65 t115 t36 t123\"\n\nWait, actually, the string is a space-separated list of t followed by numbers, which are probably the terminals in the grammar. So each tX represents a terminal symbol, perhaps based on NT rules.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT99 NT89, the expansion must produce a string that matches the terminal symbols in the order given by S's production.\n\nBut in the given string, the first part is t91 t104, which would require that NT99 (from S->NT99 NT89) expands to t91 and NT89 expands to t104. Or alternatively, if there is a different path where NT99 or NT89 can produce these ts.\n\nWait, but according to the provided grammar, NT99 -> 't99' directly, as per one of the rules. So NT99 produces 't99'. But the string starts with 't91', which is different from 't99'. So that's a problem. That suggests that the string cannot be generated from S, unless there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in looking at the initial production. Let me check: in the user's initial message, the grammar starts with S->NT99 NT89. So the initial step is S produces NT99 and NT89.\n\nIf NT99 -> 't99' and NT89 -> something, but according to the provided rules, NT89 is in the grammar as:\n\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\nNT61 -> NT84 NT42\nNT84 -> NT68 NT11\n...\n\nWait, so NT89 is not directly an 't' terminal. Instead, it's a non-terminal that needs to be expanded. So to get 't91', maybe we need to see if NT89 can expand into a sequence that includes 't91' in the terminal part.\n\nAlternatively, if the string is to be generated, perhaps S must expand into a sequence that includes 't91' and others. But I'm getting mixed up because the initial production of S is NT99 NT89, which in turn are non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps S is actually split into two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89, each of which expand into multiple symbols.\n\nSo the string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT99 and NT89. So the string should be the concatenation of what NT99 expands into and what NT89 expands into.\n\nThe string starts with t91, which would be the first symbol. For that to happen, the expansion of NT99 must start with t91. Looking at NT99's productions:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see NT99 appears as:\n\nNT99->'t99'\n\nSo NT99 can only produce the terminal 't99' directly. Therefore, if the string starts with t91, it must come from NT89's expansion.\n\nWait, but the initial S produces NT99 and NT89, which must be expanded. So the first symbol comes from NT99, which is 't99', but the string starts with 't91'. There's a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S has another production that I'm missing, but according to the user, the first line is S->NT99 NT89 as per the initial statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Let me see: the user wrote the grammar starting with S->NT99 NT89, and then provided a long list of other rules. So the entire grammar comprises these rules, and S starts by producing NT99 and NT89.\n\nEach non-terminal on the left side of the rules has their own production lists. For example, NT15 -> NT75 NT57, etc.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't91', which comes from NT91, but in the initial expansion S -> NT99 NT89, the NT99 produces 't99', so the string should start with t99. However, the given string starts with t91. This suggests that either the string is not generated by this grammar, or I'm missing something.\n\nAnother possibility is that I made a mistake in looking for NT99's production. Let me scan through the grammar rules again to confirm.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules:\n\nNT99 is defined as 't99'. So NT99 directly produces 't99'. So S -> NT99 NT89 would generate 't99' followed by whatever NT89 expands into. But the string starts with 't91', which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me map each 't' in the string to the correct NT production.\n\nThe first token is 't34' which comes from NT24.\n\nLooking at NT24's production: NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT165 (which is 't165').\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT130 NT96.\n\nNT130 \u2192 NT46 NT69.\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT69 \u2192 NT99 NT1.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here. Alternatively, let me see if any of the 't's in the string match the results of the grammar rules.\n\nWait, 't141' comes from NT46. NT46 \u2192 NT69, which is NT99 \u2192 NT107 NT17. NT107 \u2192 NT65, which is 't65'? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, let me check each 't' in the string against the grammar.\n\n- t34: comes from NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65. NT54 is NT42 NT75. NT42 is NT165, which I don't see in the string. Wait, but t34 might be from NT68 \u2192 t34? Let me check NT68 rules.\n\nLooking at NT68 production: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT2 NT99.\n\nNT2 \u2192 t26.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT69 \u2192 NT107 NT17.\n\nSo, NT68 produces t26 (from NT45) and t from NT69 which is NT99 production. So t26 is from NT2 \u2192 t26, and t17 from NT17. But in the string, the first 't34' is from NT24, which must come from NT54 and NT65. But I can't see NT54 leading to t34 directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a path.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by constructing the derivation tree step by step. Starting from S, which must split into NT99 and NT89. Then, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So first, after S, we have NT6 (which leads to 't6') and NT103. Then, NT103 splits into NT55 and NT57.\n\nWait, NT103's production is NT55 NT57. So now, S => NT99 NT89 => NT6 NT103 NT89. Then, NT103 is NT55 NT57, so now it's NT6 NT55 NT57 NT89. Then, NT55 is NT65, leading to 't65', and NT57 is NT68, which leads to 't68' or 't172' (since NT57 \u2192 NT68 NT103, and NT68 has production to t172, among others).\n\nWait, but the string starts with t34, which doesn't fit here. Maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with 't34', so the first part should come from NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65. NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75. NT42 \u2192 NT165 (t165). NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18. NT95 \u2192 NT130 NT96. NT130 \u2192 NT46 NT69. NT46 \u2192 NT69 (t69). NT69 \u2192 NT107 NT17. NT107 \u2192 NT65. So, 't65' comes from this path, but in the string, the first token is 't34', not 't65'. So this suggests that the string can't start with NT24 if NT24 is supposed to lead to something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NT rules. Let me check the productions again for NT24.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules provided, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT54 NT65\n\nNT54 -> NT42 NT75\n\nNT42"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-696","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a specific way with all the productions, each having two non-terminals on the left and two on the right. This means it's in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production step only replaces one symbol with two others. I remember that in such a grammar, each parse step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, but since every production is two symbols, I'll have to think about how the string can be built up from these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols starting with t and some numbers, which must be generated by the grammar. The goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of steps using the grammar.\n\nLet me first list out the production rules and see if I can find any that might generate parts of the string. The string given is:\n\nt134 t110 t110 t54 t98 t54 t71 t36 t65 t24 t172 t47 t1 t108 t67 t91 t48 t121 t45 t94 t50 t129 t139 t134 t99 t146 t129 t130 t67 t169 t130 t23 t34 t45 t41 t156 t127.\n\nWait, there are a few symbols that appear multiple times, like t134, t110, t54, etc. Also, some of these t's might be derived from the non-terminals. Since the grammar uses NT followed by a number for non-terminals, like NT15, NT73, etc., I'll have to check if these TS correspond to those non-terminals.\n\nSo the plan is to see if each t can be mapped to any NT via the productions, and then see if the sequence of t's can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol t134. I need to check if there's a production rule that has NT134 on the left or right, but looking at the grammar, it seems that NT134 is a terminal (from the rules, I see NT134 appears on the right side but not as a production, meaning it's a symbol that can't be split further, so it's a terminal). So t134 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, t110, t54, t98, etc., are terminals. So to build the string, these terminals must be derived from specific non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I check for NT134: I see it appears in the productions, but it's not a non-terminal\u2014it's a terminal. So in the string, each t must correspond to a specific NT.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The production rules for NT134 might derive into something else. Wait, looking at the provided grammar, I see that NT100 produces t127 and t127 again? Or maybe I should think about which non-terminals derive into t134.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I can see:\n\n- NT100 -> NT108 t118 (from NT100's production, but there might be others). Let me check each production for NT100.\n\nNo, NT100's productions are listed as:\n\nNT100 -> NT108\n\nWait no, looking through the given grammar, for example, NT106 -> NT35 NT107; NT35 produces t40 and t105. But looking for NT134, it's a terminal, which suggests it can't be further split. So each t in the string must come from a specific NT production.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps each t is a terminal, and the NT's must produce sequences of these t's. So I have to see if the grammar can generate a sequence where the non-terminals resolve to these specific t's in order.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string from the bottom up, trying to see if it can be built using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the reverse: trying to see if each pair of symbols in the string can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t134 t110 t110 t54... So perhaps t134 is from some NT, say NT134 produces t134. But looking at the grammar, I don't see NT134 as a production; instead, t134 is a terminal. So NT134 must be a symbol, but since it's a terminal, it cannot be split, so t134 must be a direct leaf.\n\nSimilarly, t110: does any NT produce t110 as a single symbol? Checking the grammar, NT110 is not present as a non-terminal. So t110 is a terminal. So the first part is t134, then t110, which are both terminals, so the first two symbols must correspond to NTs that produce those t's, but since t134 and t110 are terminals, perhaps NT134 and NT110 are not present as non-terminals; but wait, they are present as terminals in the productions when they appear.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each t to an NT.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I can list all the NTs and see their productions, which might produce certain ts as leaves.\n\nWait, the provided grammar seems long. Let me try to list all the NTs and note which ts each NT might produce.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT7 -> 't151'\n\nNT15 -> 't154'\n\nNT100 -> 't127'\n\nNT108 -> 't118'\n\nWait, but that would mean NT7 produces t151, but looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT7: From the given productions, NT89 -> NT61 NT76, and NT77 seems to produce t124 and perhaps others. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach: for each production, find the corresponding t terminals that are produced.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many NTs produce a pair of t's. For example:\n\nNT11 -> 't17'\n\nNT16 -> 't112'\n\nNT24 -> 't123'\n\nNT27 -> 't169'\n\nWait, but since NT11 produces t17, then if I have a production like A -> B C, and B produces t17, then that part of the string would be t17.\n\nBut this approach might take too long as there are 45 NTs. Alternatively, perhaps considering that each of these t's corresponds to specific NT productions, the string must be a concatenation of these t's, each of which comes from a production rule.\n\nSince the string to evaluate has 48 symbols (since each t is a single symbol?), wait, the string provided is a sequence like t134, t110, etc., each separated by spaces, so it's 48 t's? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the string: t134 t110 t110 t54 t98 t54 t71 t36 t65 t24 t172 t47 t1 t108 t67 t91 t48 t121 t45 t94 t50 t129 t139 t134 t99 t146 t129 t130 t67 t169 t130 t23 t34 t45 t41 t156 t127.\n\nThat's 48 t's. So I need to figure out if each t in the string corresponds to a production step, and the overall string can be constructed from the start symbol S through the grammar's rules.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps looking for a parse tree is too time-consuming. Instead, maybe I can look for patterns or specific NT productions that could generate these t's.\n\nFor example, the start symbol S is NT96. Let's see what NT96 can produce.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT96 has several options:\n\nNT96 -> NT33 NT36\nNT96 -> NT1 NT108\n\nSo NT96 can split into either NT33 and NT36, or NT1 and NT108.\n\nLet me check NT33: According to the grammar, NT33 -> NT80 NT23, and NT108 is 't118'.\n\nSo NT96 can produce NT33 and NT36, which in turn might produce t80, t23, etc., or other parts.\n\nAlternatively, NT96 could produce NT1 and NT108. NT1 appears to have a production: NT1 -> NT107 NT17."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding what each part of the problem entails.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single non-terminal symbol, which could expand into two symbols. Looking at the grammar, it's a set of productions where each right-hand side has either two terminals or two non-terminals, except possibly the start symbol. Wait, actually, in CNF, productions can be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, looking through each production, they all seem to have two non-terminals on the right, which is a bit unusual because typically in CNF, the left side can go directly to a terminal. Hmm, maybe this is a special case or perhaps the grammar allows for non-terminals that eventually derive terminals. Anyway, moving on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t73 t9 t26 t134 t108 t96 t157 t169 t134 t47 t141 t0 t17 t36 t102 t45 t98 t108 t1 t105 t93 t174 t169 t169 t8 t151 t26 t144 t104 t1 t21 t21 t17 t23 t121 t0`.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers. The grammar seems to have many productions that map certain non-terminals to specific 't' values. For example, NT91 \u2192 't17', NT73 \u2192 't69', etc. These seem like terminals are defined by the non-terminals, each non-terminal expanding into a particular 't' value based on some rule.\n\nI need to trace back from the string to see if each 't' can be accounted for by the grammar. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't91'. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't91'? Yes, looking through the productions, I see NT91 \u2192 't17'. So, the first part of the string should come from NT91 \u2192 't17', but that doesn't match the first token 't91'. Wait, maybe I need to look for a production that has NT91 \u2192 't91'. Alternatively, perhaps 't91' is a terminal and needs to be matched directly. However, looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where NT91 directly produces a 't' other than 't17'. So, 't91' might not be part of the grammar, which would mean it's not derivable. But wait, the string starts with 't91', so if the grammar can't produce 't91', then the answer is No. Let's confirm.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions, I don't see any NT91 \u2192 't91'. The only production for NT91 is NT91 \u2192 't17'. So, the first token 't91' cannot be derived from the grammar. Therefore, regardless of the rest of the string, since the first token is ungenerable, the entire string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string represents a sequence of terminals derived from non-terminals, so perhaps 't91' is a derived symbol, but according to the grammar, it's not. So the first token is a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if each 't' in the string can be matched by some production. Let's list out all the 't's and see if they can be matched.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt91, t73, t9, t26, t134, t108, t96, t157, t169, t134, t47, t141, t0, t17, t36, t102, t45, t98, t108, t1, t105, t93, t174, t169, t169, t8, t151, t26, t144, t104, t1, t21, t21, t17, t23, t121, t0.\n\nNow, let's go through each 't' and see if it's covered by any production.\n\nt91: Looking at the grammar, there's NT91 \u2192 't17', but no production for NT91 \u2192 't91'. So 't91' isn't in the grammar, meaning it's not derivable. Therefore, the string starts with a token it can't get from the grammar. \n\nSince the first token can't be derived from the grammar, the string as a whole can't be generated. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the grammar might have many productions that eventually derive these 't's, but if any 't' in the string can't be matched by a production, then the string isn't generated. Since t91 and t73 are early in the string and can't be derived, it's a no-go.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-721","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That might be helpful because there's an algorithm for parsing such grammars, like the CYK algorithm, which can efficiently check if a string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the production rules, they all seem to break down symbols into other non-terminals or terminals marked with 't'. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89 breaks down into two non-terminals NT99 and NT89. The terminals are denoted with 't' followed by a number, like t118, t104, etc.\n\nThe input string is a series of these t terms: `t118 t104 t91 t99 t102 t112 t145 t169 t91 t130 t102 t50 t2 t104 t11 t157 t17 t124 t102 t165 t110 t129 t69 t134 t34 t151 t118 t164 t36 t48 t96 t129 t13 t141 t174 t8 t34 t63`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, I can apply the CYK algorithm here. Let me recall how CYK works. It builds a table where each cell represents a substring of the input, and it checks possible productions for each position. The algorithm proceeds in passes, starting from the first symbol and moving to the end, checking for possible non-terminals that can generate the substring.\n\nHere are the steps I need to follow mentally:\n\n1. **Initialize the Table**: Create a table where each row corresponds to a position in the string, and each column is for a non-terminal. The table's dimensions would be the length of the string by the number of non-terminals. For each position, I'll check if any production rule can generate the current substring.\n\n2. **Starting with Single Symbols**: The first pass starts with each single symbol in the string. For each symbol, I'll check if there's a production where the right-hand side (RHS) is that symbol. If yes, mark that non-terminal in the current position.\n\n3. **Building Up the Table**: For each subsequent pass, the substring length increases by one. For each position, I'll consider the substring ending at that position. For each possible split point, I'll check if there's a production where the first part can be generated by the previous non-terminals and the second part by the current non-terminal.\n\n4. **Final Check**: After processing all positions, if the start symbol S is present in the last cell of the table, it means the string is in the language, so the answer is 'Yes'. Otherwise, it's 'No'.\n\nBut wait, manually building the CYK table for a 35-symbol string is going to be tedious. Maybe I can look for patterns or specific productions that can help me decide without going into the full CYK process.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that S is at the top, and all productions derive into non-terminals NT1-NT99. The string provided has a lot of t terms. I can perhaps try to reverse-engineer the possible production rules that led to this string.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string manually, step by step, using the rules. Let's see if each part of the string can be matched.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string: `t118 t104 t91 t99 t102 t112 t145 t169 t91 t130 t102 t50 t2 t104 t11 t157 t17 t124 t102 t165 t110 t129 t69 t134 t34 t151 t118 t164 t36 t48 t96 t129 t13 t141 t174 t8 t34 t63`.\n\nI can check if the string starts with any production rule. For example, the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string should split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT99 and the second by NT89.\n\nLooking at the first few t's:\n\nt118 t104 t91 t99 t102 t112 t145 t169 t91 t130 t102 t50 ...\n\nThis could potentially be part of NT99. Similarly, the second half might be part of NT89.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is context-free, perhaps I can trace back through the productions.\n\nBut without knowing the exact derivation path, it's tricky. Maybe I can look for specific symbols that might indicate a certain production.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that some t's repeat, like t118, t104, t91, etc. Maybe these correspond to non-terminals that can repeat.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that each non-terminal is a sequence that can be expanded, so for example, NT99 might break down into other non-terminals, which ultimately generate t symbols.\n\nGiven that I'm not entirely sure, perhaps checking if the first t can be derived from any rule. For example, t118: looking at the rules, is there a production that results in t118?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT61 \u2192 t178, NT106 \u2192 t13, etc., but t118 is only mentioned as NT6 \u2192 t108, which isn't the same. Wait, no, looking again: NT6 is defined in another rule. Let me scan the rules.\n\nWait, I see that some non-terminals directly map to t with certain numbers, but t118 is not among them. That suggests that t118 must come from a non-terminal that derives into t118, but I don't see any such production. Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me look again. Scanning through the rules, I see lines like NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107 and other combinations, but I don't see any direct production for t118. So how is t118 generated? It must come from a non-terminal that can expand into t118, but looking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly mapping to t118.\n\nWait, maybe t118 is produced by a non-terminal that is defined by the rules provided. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t118. For instance, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, but I don't see NT35 mapping to t118. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, I realize that the NT rules have some mappings to t terms. For example, NT61 \u2192 t108, but t118 is not directly produced. So, perhaps t118 is not directly produced by any NT in the grammar. If that's the case, the string cannot be in the language because there is no production rule that generates t118.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Did I miss any NT that directly produces t118? Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, which doesn't produce t118.\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9, etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 t151\n- NT24 \u2192 t123, etc.\n- Wait, I don't see any NT that directly produces t118.\n\nIf that's the case, then t118 cannot be in the language because there's no production that directly produces it, and all productions only split into other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-715","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems that all the rules except some are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTuv NTwx, but I notice that some have a terminal as the right-hand side, like NT1 \u2192 't24'. So, they all are in CNF since they produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t167 t141 t26 t80 t134 t112 t171 t26 t17 t60 t41 t36 t154 t23 t167 t165 t124 t123 t96 t170 t164 t145 t96 t144 t41 t178 t96 t56 t156 t45 t157 t178 t156 t36 t8 t11 t115 t101`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to trace back from the string to the start symbol by trying to match the right-hand sides of the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either generates a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two other symbols (which could be terminals or non-terminals).\n\nI'll try to build a parse tree from the bottom up, matching the string starting from the root (the entire string). Alternatively, I can work backwards, seeing if each part of the string can be derived from a production.\n\nLet me look at the string and see if I can find matches for the productions.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's check the first symbol: t167. I'll look for a production that has t167 as its output.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 't167'. But wait, in the grammar provided, looking for NT73:\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT73 has two rules:\nNT73 -> NT83 NT70\nNT73 -> NT6 NT39\n\nSo, NT73 can produce 't167' (as per the given string) or two non-terminals. Since the first symbol is t167, that suggests the production NT73 \u2192 't167' must be used. So, t167 is derived from NT73.\n\nNow, the string after t167 is the rest. But in a leftmost derivation, we would have derived t167 first, so the remaining string would be t141 t26 t80 t134 t112 t171 t26 t17 t60 t41 t36 t154 t23 t167 t165 t124 t123 t96 t170 t164 t145 t96 t144 t41 t178 t96 t56 t156 t45 t157 t178 t156 t36 t8 t11 t115 t101.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT73 can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the first t167 is matched by NT73 \u2192 't167', and the first part of the string is consumed. The remaining string is the rest after t167.\n\nWait, no. The initial string is the entire sequence. So, in a leftmost derivation, the first symbol is t167, which must come from NT73 \u2192 't167'. Then, we have to see how the rest of the string is derived.\n\nBut actually, in terms of the parse tree, the entire string must derive from S. So, the root is S, and the leaves are the symbols in the string. So, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be formed by the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the parse as starting from S and expanding non-terminals until we get the entire string.\n\nBut given the complexity, I might consider using the follow method or the Pratt parsing algorithm, but perhaps for simplicity, I can try to see if each symbol in the string matches a production's RHR (right-hand side) in order.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to find a way to match it by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to structure this.\n\nFirst, the entire string is 45 symbols long. Each production in CNF either adds one terminal or two non-terminals. So, the parsing will proceed by recursively expanding non-terminals until all are terminals, matching the input string.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in my mind.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT99. Wait, no, the first rule is S \u2192 NT99 NT99. Wait, looking back at the grammar: the first line is S -> NT99 NT99. Wait, in the provided grammar, the first line is S->NT99 NT99? Let me check the user's message.\n\nYes, the first line is S -> NT99 NT99. So, S expands to NT99 and NT99.\n\nSo, the start symbol S produces two NT99s. Then, each NT99 can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT99: I don't see a rule for NT99 in the provided grammar. Wait, the provided grammar has rules like NT15, NT81, etc., but does it have NT99? Let me scan through the rules.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT29, NT35, NT40, etc., but not NT99. Hmm, that's odd because the string starts with t167, which is produced by NT73. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps NT99 is on the left or right side of a production. Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT99 is the name of a non-terminal that can produce some string of terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, perhaps NT99 is defined as generating a certain string. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT99: Not found. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me scan again.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has rules like:\n\nNT99 -> ... Let me check.\n\nNo, looking through all the provided rules, I don't see NT99 as a left-hand side. That seems odd. So, if S \u2192 NT99 NT99, but NT99 does not have a production, then S can't produce anything beyond that, which would be a problem because the string starts with t167.\n\nWait, this suggests that the provided grammar might not be complete or I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check again. The first line is indeed S->NT99 NT99. But in the rest of the grammar rules, I don't see any rules for NT99. So, how can S generate any string if NT99 is undefined?\n\nThat's a problem. Because without any production for NT99, the grammar can't generate any string that starts with the symbols generated by NT99. In this case, the string starts with t167, which comes from NT73 \u2192 't167', but to get NT73, the initial step would need to have S \u2192 ... which includes NT73.\n\nWait, unless the way S expands leads to NT99, which somehow can then produce other non-terminals that lead to the start. But in our case, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT99 NT99, so those two NT99s must eventually generate the tokens in the string.\n\nBut if NT99 has no production, then S \u2192 NT99 NT99 can't lead to anything, meaning the grammar can't generate any string at all. But that can't be, because the question is asking whether the given string is generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in scanning the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the user's provided grammar, I see:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nS -> NT99 NT99\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\nNT84 -> NT1 NT65\nNT73 -> NT83 NT70\nNT40 -> NT39 NT35\nNT52 -> NT28 NT70\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\nNT73 -> NT6 NT39\nNT64 -> NT100 NT93\nNT80 -> NT67 NT73\nNT35 -> NT68 NT103"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-733","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF means each production is either a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. The start symbol is 'S', but looking at the rules, I see production rules starting with 'NT' followed by things like 'NT15 -> NT75 NT57'. Wait, 'NT' seems like just a prefix, probably just for numbering. So, the main symbols here are probably like NT1, NT2, etc., which are non-terminals, and some of them are terminals (the 't' followed by numbers).\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, after NT, the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT15 -> NT75 NT57. But some rules like NT100 -> 't127' have a terminal on the RHS. So, the 't' followed by digits are terminal symbols, meaning they don't get broken down further in the parsing.\n\nSo, the string given is: t105 t99 t115 t151 t177 t162 t98 t108 t130 t110 t165 t26 t146 t130 t139 t171 t102 t97 t121 t91 t49 t154 t54 t23 t172 t105 t73 t11 t129 t80 t177 t146 t124 t11 t146 t0 t13 t11 t164.\n\nThat's quite long. But each 't' number is a terminal. To see if the string is generated by the grammar, I think I'll have to find a way to rewrite it using the productions.\n\nBut considering this could be time-consuming, maybe I can approach it by looking for patterns or key nodes that might help me break down the string. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I notice that 't107' appears twice in the string, at the 15th and 16th tokens. In the grammar, I see NT107 produces 't174', but also, 't107' is involved in other productions? Wait, looking back, I see a production like NT107 -> 't... I don't see any NT107 in the given grammar, except in a rule: wait no, looking at the grammar, I don't see 'NT107' appearing on the left side of any production, except one occurrence in the note at the end: 'NT107 -> t...'. Hmm, maybe I missed that in the grammar provided. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, but when I scroll through, I see:\n\nAt the end, it's written as:\n\nNT107 -> 't94'\n\nAnd another:\n\nNT107 -> t174\n\nWait, no, looking at the last part of the grammar:\n\nNT107 -> t174\n\nAnd earlier, there is a rule: NT96 -> NT107 NT108.\n\nSo NT107 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal 't174' or maybe other stuff?\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial list, 'NT107' is only on the RHS of a production for 't174'. But where is NT107 on the LHS? Let me check the full grammar list provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where NT107 is on the LHS except in the last line:\n\nNT107 -> 't94' and another: NT107 -> t174.\n\nWait, actually, the last two lines seem to be a continuation, but in the user's message, it's a bit split. So probably:\n\nLooking at the end:\n\nNT60 -> 't0'\n...\nNT107 -> 't94'\nNT107 -> 't174'\n\nWait, no, the grammar provided includes multiple entries:\n\nAt the end, it's written as:\n\nNT107 -> t174\n\nAnd earlier:\n\nNT11 -> 't17'\n\nBut I think I need to clarify which lines correspond to which.\n\nBut for this analysis, perhaps it's better to focus on the string and see if I can find possible substitutions.\n\nThe string starts with t105, t99, etc. Looking at the grammar, I can see that NT105 appears in multiple rules. Let's list some productions for NT105:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT105 -> NT69 NT71 (line 39), and earlier:\n\nNT68 -> NT45 NT71 (line 66), and NT33 -> NT80 NT23 (line 33). But wait, perhaps focusing on NT105.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLine 46: NT39 -> NT23 NT16\n\nLine 53: NT93 -> NT95 NT65\n\nLine 59: NT77 -> NT95 NT65\n\nWait, not helpful. Let me look for NT105.\n\nLooking through:\n\nLine 104: NT105 -> NT24 NT45\n\nSo NT105 produces NT24 and NT45.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for all the production rules where NT105 is on the LHS or as a RHS.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, I need to check all rules.\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n\nLine 53: NT96 -> NT33 NT36\n\nLine 63: NT24 -> NT54 NT65\n\nLine: Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to approach this problem by trying to build the parse tree for the string or see if each token can be derived.\n\nBut the string is a series of terminals. So each part of the string that is a single 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the string itself is a concatenation of these terminals, and we need to find if this entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so we can treat them as atomic symbols. So, the string is a sequence of these symbols.\n\nBut to generate such a string, the grammar must produce this exact sequence through left- or right-derivations.\n\nGiven the length of the string, this could be tedious, but perhaps we can find key substitutions or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to look for the tokens and see if any of them correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each non-terminal, the RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, each production can generate either symbols on the stack or a single terminal.\n\nThus, each terminal production represents a single token.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each 't' is a node generated by a production that directly yields that terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, the parser would start at the root symbol S and expand using the productions until all tokens are matched.\n\nGiven the problem, the string is quite long. Maybe it's possible to break it down into parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption. Wait, the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nIn this grammar, many of the non-terminals only produce two non-terminals, which would mean the string is built from a series of non-terminals and terminals, but in this case, the given string is entirely terminals, meaning that the derivation must be such that all non-terminals are expanded into the string.\n\nWait, but the given string is all terminals, which suggests that each non-terminal must be fully expanded into terminals. But wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So, the only way a non-terminal A can contribute to the terminal string is if there's a production that allows it to expand into terminals, i.e., A->a.\n\nBut in this grammar, I see that non-terminals can produce other non-terminals, which in turn can produce more non-terminals or terminals. So, to get a terminal string, all non-terminals must be expanded into terminals, and their productions must chain together in such a way that the entire string is covered.\n\nThis could be complex, but maybe we can look for patterns or specific paths.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for non-terminals that can produce certain 't' numbers, or see if any of the 't' tokens in the string can only be produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nFor example, let's look at 't105' at the 13th token. Looking back, I see that NT105 is on the RHS of the production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t23 t17 t178 t178 t121 t2 t11 t145 t101 t72 t162 t112 t134 t118 t47 t151 t154 t1 t144 t105 t170 t73 t22 t51 t91 t110 t146 t118 t129 t98 t156 t124 t73 t157 t9 t54 t100 t24 t51`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions are in the form like S -> NT99 NT89, and many of the NTs also produce two NTs. Some have terminals, though. Wait, no, in CNF, everything is either terminals or non-terminals, and each production has two non-terminals. Oh, but the end of the grammar shows rules where some NTs produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal, like NT17 -> 't22'. Wait, that's not in CNF because CNF requires productions to have either two non-terminals or a terminal terminal. Oh, but wait, in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a (where a is terminal). So actually, the grammar here mixes both; some rules produce two non-terminals, and others produce a terminal and a non-terminal. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or I'm misreading it. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking again, some rules like NT17 -> 't22'\u2014those are terminal symbols followed by another terminal or something? Or is it that 't22' is a single terminal? Because in the provided grammar, I see rules where NTs are followed by terminal strings, like NT23 -> 't167'. Oh no, that means that in the grammar, this is not CNF anymore because a production is on the right side a mix of NTs and terminals. So the grammar isn't in CNF. But the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be either A->BC or A->a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So if any production has more than two non-terminals on the right, or a terminal followed by non-terminals, it's not CNF. \n\nBut looking at the provided grammar, some lines have rules like NT23 -> 't167'. 't167' is a terminal symbol. So perhaps in this grammar, some of the productions are allowed to have a mix, but that would contradict CNF. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps it's a variation. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is in something else, but the user says it's CNF. \n\nBut regardless, to solve the problem, I need to parse the given string against the grammar. The string starts with 't23' which is a terminal symbol. Let's see if the grammar can produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't167' (according to the last line: NT23 -> 't167'). So that would mean NT23 directly produces 't167', which is a terminal. But in the string, we have 't23', not 't167'. So that's a problem. Unless 't23' corresponds to another rule. Wait, let me check another line.\n\nLooking back, I find NT29 -> 't36' and another line: NT29 -> 't156'. So NT29 can produce either t36 or t156. But in the string, we have 't23', which isn't produced by any of these. So unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check other terminals. For example, there's NT23 -> 't167' and NT29 is present multiple times, but none produce t23. So the string has 't23', and according to the grammar, that's not possible because no NT directly produces 't23'. \n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the production works. Could it be that the NTs can produce combinations that eventually derive to the terminal t23? For example, maybe starting from NT23, which can't produce t23. Alternatively, maybe t23 is the result of a longer derivation. Hmm, no, I think each production is fixed. For example, NT23 can only produce 't167', not t23. So the string has 't23' which is not in the possible terminals produced by the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again. Looking through the grammar, any NT whose right-hand side includes t23? No. So I think the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-753","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of t-terms like t123, t144, etc. \n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling what a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form looks like. It has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure since each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal, all in the form of NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 something ending with a letter like 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe task is to check if the string provided can be derived from the start symbol S. The string given is a concatenation of t-terms, so I need to see if each t-term in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar, and whether the entire string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal. For example, NT12 \u2192 t80, which is a terminal, so it's a direct production. But some productions like NT89 produce another NT, like NT65 or something else, which may lead to more t-terms down the line.\n\nBut actually, the string provided consists entirely of t-terms, which suggests that each t-term in the string must be generated by a production that directly outputs it. So, for each t in the string, there should be a production in the grammar that exactly matches that t-term. \n\nI'll go through each part of the string and check if each t exists as a terminal in the grammar:\n\nThe string is:\n`t123 t144 t65 t23 t2 t154 t94 t76 t67 t24 t167 t76 t50 t0 t67 t151 t26 t112 t23 t145 t48 t178 t49 t65 t134 t144 t123 t172 t91 t154 t177 t170 t65 t174 t100 t47 t108 t48 t34 t172`\n\nSo, each t-term is a two-part: t followed by a number. I'll check if each of these exists in the grammar's terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that several t-terms are defined:\n- t123 is produced by NT24 \u2192 t123\n- t144 is from NT27 \u2192 t144\n- t65 is from NT7 \u2192 t65\n- t23 is from NT35 \u2192 t23\n- t2 is from NT113 \u2192 t2 (Wait, no. Let me check the grammar. Looking under NT23: NT23 \u2192 t156. t156 isn't in the string. Wait, I might have misremembered. Let me go through each t-term in the string and see if it's present.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have rules where certain non-terminals produce a t followed by a number. For example, NT24 \u2192 t123, which is in the string. Similarly, NT35 \u2192 t23, which is also present. \n\nI'll list all the t-terms in the string and check their existence in the grammar's productions:\n\nt123: Yes, NT24 \u2192 t123\n\nt144: Yes, NT27 \u2192 t144\n\nt65: Yes, NT7 \u2192 t65\n\nt23: Yes, NT35 \u2192 t23\n\nt2: Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production where NTx \u2192 t2. The closest is NT23 \u2192 t156, which produces another t-term, but wait, is there any production that directly produces t2? Scanning through, I don't see any NT production that ends with t2. So t2 is not a terminal in the grammar. Hmm, but in the string, t2 is present. That would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar because there's no production that directly generates t2. So right there, this could mean the answer is No.\n\nBut let me continue checking the rest to be thorough.\n\nt154: Yes, NT29 \u2192 t154\n\nt94: Let's see, looking in the grammar, is there a production for NT94? Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT96 \u2192 t91, but not t94. Checking all NTx, I don't see t94 being directly produced by any production. So t94 is missing. That's another issue.\n\nt76: Looking for NT76 in the grammar. Oh, there's NT76 \u2192 t121, which is t121, not t76. Hmm, so t76 isn't directly produced. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again: Is there a production where NTx \u2192 t76? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NTx where the production ends with t76. So t76 is also not present. That would mean the string can't be generated because it includes t76 which isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the production chain can generate t76 indirectly. For example, if a non-terminal A can produce another non-terminal B, which then produces t76. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT76 \u2192 t121. So to get t76, we'd need a production that ends with t76. Since that doesn't exist, the string cannot be generated because t76 isn't a terminal in the grammar. Similarly, t94 and t2 don't have corresponding direct productions.\n\nContinuing:\n\nt24: NT24 \u2192 t123, but where does t24 come from? Wait, let me check the string again. The string has t24 towards the end. So if no NTx produces t24, then it's not possible.\n\nWait, actually, NT24 is defined as a non-terminal, not a terminal. So any t-term in the string must be directly produced by some NT \u2192 t-number production. So if the grammar doesn't have t24 as a terminal, then t24 can't appear in the string.\n\nSimilarly, t178: Is there any production that produces t178? Looking through, I don't see NT178 in the grammar. So t178 can't be generated.\n\nBut maybe I'm making a mistake. Perhaps some NTs can produce other NTs that then produce t-terms. For example, NT23 \u2192 t156, which is a t-term. So t156 is present in the grammar as a terminal. But the string has t154, which is from NT29.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each t-term in the string individually.\n\n1. t123: NT24 \u2192 t123 (Yes)\n2. t144: NT27 \u2192 t144 (Yes)\n3. t65: NT7 \u2192 t65 (Yes)\n4. t23: NT35 \u2192 t23 (Yes)\n5. t2: No production for t2 (No)\n   - The answer is already No because of t2.\n\nBut since the string includes t2, which isn't a terminal in the grammar, it can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-754","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are quite long and complex, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure allows for efficient parsing and can be checked using algorithms like CYK, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try a different approach.\n\nThe given string is: `t2 t164 t21 t127 t0 t105 t60 t71 t21 t56 t36 t48 t167 t65 t134 t141 t9 t101 t156 t96 t48 t165 t47 t0 t151 t41 t123 t93 t144 t172 t124 t157 t1 t177 t127 t24 t130 t8 t151`.\n\nI see that the string consists of a series of 't' tokens with numbers appended, like 't2', 't164', etc. From the grammar provided, there are many productions that connect non-terminals to terminal symbols, so perhaps the string is built up by expanding these non-terminals step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and terminals. For example, some start with NT followed by numbers, like NT15, NT24, etc. Some of these do have terminal production rules, like NT42 \u2192 't165', NT43 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. To generate the string, the derivation must eventually produce all the 't' symbols through these production rules.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down into such production steps. Each step would involve replacing a non-terminal with its right-hand side, which could be another mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to work backwards, starting from the end of the string and seeing if it can be reduced using reverse productions. However, considering that the string is long, this might not be feasible without a specific strategy.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the terminal symbols in the grammar and see if they match the string. For example, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't2'. In the grammar, NT43 \u2192 't2', so if the start symbol S can derive down to include 't2', that's a good sign.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT99 NT99. So S leads to NT99 NT99, which in turn is handled by productions of NT99.\n\nLooking back, I see NT16 is part of a production where NT16 \u2192 't93', but also NT16 might be derived through other paths. Wait, looking at the productions, I can see NT19 \u2192 't99' and NT29 can produce 't36', but not sure if that helps.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in a CNF grammar, the number of symbols in the string must satisfy certain properties. Specifically, each step replaces a non-terminal with a pair of symbols (non-terminals or terminals). Starting from one non-terminal (the start symbol S), the length of the derived string must be 2^n, where n is the number of production steps.\n\nBut the given string has 40 symbols (let me count: the string is separated by spaces, so each 't' with numbers is a separate token. Counting them: t2, t164, t21, t127, t0, t105, t60, t71, t21, t56, t36, t48, t167, t65, t134, t141, t9, t101, t156, t96, t48, t165, t47, t0, t151, t41, t123, t93, t144, t172, t124, t157, t1, t177, t127, t24, t130, t8, t151. That's 40 symbols. So the length is 40.\n\nSince 40 is not a power of 2 (the closest are 32=2^5 and 64=2^6), this suggests that the string cannot be generated by a CNF grammar, which would require the string length to be a power of 2. However, I'm not entirely sure because the grammar might allow for certain non-terminals to expand in ways that result in different lengths, but wait, no, because each production step adds exactly one symbol (in CNF, each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a), so starting with S, each step increases the length by adding symbols. So each derivation step goes from k symbols to k + 1 or k + something? Wait, no, in CNF, each production replaces one symbol with two, so each step increases size by 1. Starting from S (1 symbol), then after one step, 2 symbols, then each step increases by 1, so possible lengths are any number greater than 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for a string derived from a single S, which is processed by replacing S with something, each replacement replaces one symbol with two, increasing the number of symbols by 1 each step.\n\nWait, more precisely: Starting from S, the initial string is just S (length 1). Then, the first replacement: S \u2192 NT15 NT15, which makes the string of length 2. Then, each replacement of a non-terminal in this string would replace one non-terminal with two, increasing total length by 1 each step.\n\nSo, the number of symbols in the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of replacements. But wait, in the first step, after replacing S, length is 2. Each step after that adds one symbol, so lengths could be 2, 3, 4, etc. So 40 is possible. But that's only if each replacement in each step is applying a production that increases the length by 1.\n\nWait, no, in each production, a symbol is replaced by either two (if it's a non-terminal) or one (if it's a terminal). So the number of symbols can increase by 1 when a non-terminal is replaced, or stay the same when a terminal is reached.\n\nBut starting from S (length 1), after first replacement, you have two symbols. Then, replacing each of those could add one more each time, but the exact number of symbols depends on how many non-terminals are replaced.\n\nBut it's not strictly necessary for the length to be a power of 2. For example, you can have a string of any length, as long as each production adds one symbol. So if the string has 40 symbols, it's possible to derive it with 39 production steps from S, assuming that all replacements are non-terminals turning into two symbols, except when a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: In CNF, every production is either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a non-terminal expanding into a single terminal. So, starting from S, each step from a non-terminal can add one symbol.\n\nThus, the process is as follows:\n\n- Start with S (length 1).\n- Replace S with NTa NTb (length 2).\n- Then, replace one of NTa or NTb: say NTa becomes a terminal or another NT.\n  - If NTa becomes a terminal, string becomes terminal + NTb (length 2).\n  - If NTa becomes NTc NYT, string becomes NTc NYT + NTb (length 3).\n- Continue replacing non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo the length can vary depending on the number of replacements. Therefore, a string with 40 symbols is possible, as it's just 2 + (n-1) for some n, which is allowed.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the length is 40. So whether it's possible depends on whether the productions allow a derivation path that ends with 40 symbols.\n\nHowever, checking 40 steps manually is impractical. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to see if all the terminals can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can check for the presence of any conflicting terminals or non-terminals. For example, if a non-terminal is supposed to produce certain terminals and the string has a contradiction, that could be a problem.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't2' which comes from NT43 \u2192 't2'. So, in the derivation, we must have expanded NT43. But wait, from the grammar, NT43 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t123 t63 t133 t174 t11 t50 t105 t80 t158 t144 t145 t41 t102 t130 t73 t23 t1 t170 t169 t177 t102 t130 t170 t91 t93 t73 t127 t169 t67 t17 t94 t60 t63 t34 t17 t17 t164 t98 t102 t94 t159`. I see a lot of 't' tokens with numbers. \n\nWait, in the grammar, some of these 't' values are produced by certain non-terminals, while others are part of multiple derivations. I should try to map each 't' to its possible source in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals expand into specific 't's. For example, NT77 expands into t56, and NT96 into t91. But many other non-terminals produce multiple different 't's or other non-terminals, which complicates things.\n\nI think the best approach is to construct a parse tree for the string, starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is broken down into NT99 and NT89. Let me see:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nSo each of these will be in the tree. Let's break them down:\n\nNT99 expands into which production? Looking through the rules, NT73 -> NT83 NT70, but I don't see NT99 here. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nHmm, doesn't look like there's a production for NT99. Wait, wait\u2014looking through the list again, I see NT99 is on line 33: NT99 -> NT6 NT103. So NT99 splits into NT6 and NT103.\n\nSimilarly, NT89 is on line 28: NT89 -> NT44 NT1. So NT89 becomes NT44 and NT1.\n\nNow, NT6 is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014NT6's expansions are listed. Let me see the rules:\n\nLooking for NT6: It's on line 39 and 68. For example, NT68 -> NT45 NT71, and NT61 -> NT48 NT49, but NT6 isn't a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up NTs. Maybe some NTs produce a terminal 't' instead of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, some have 't' on the right side. For example, line 19: NT2 -> 't26'. Similarly, line 30: NT56 -> 't178'? Wait, no, line 77 shows NT77 -> 't56'. Wait, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar may have 't' symbols on the right side, meaning they can be terminals. Let me look through the rules again for any 't's:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see several lines where non-terminals expand into 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT24 -> 't123', NT77 -> 't56', NT76 -> 't121', NT21 -> 't171', and so on. So each of these productions contributes a specific 't' token.\n\nBut each 't' in the string might have come from different non-terminals, depending on the derivation.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, each 't' in the string must correspond to an expansion of some non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, I'll need to ensure that each 't' token in the string can be produced by some non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, let me map each 't' to its possible non-terminal. The 't's in the string are:\n\nt123, t63, t133, t174, t11, t50, t105, t80, t158, t144, t145, t41, t102, t130, t73, t23, t1, t170, t169, t177, t102, t130, t170, t91, t93, t73, t127, t169, t67, t17, t94, t60, t63, t34, t17, t17, t164, t98, t102, t94, t159.\n\nLet's go through each one:\n\n- t123: from NT24\n- t63: looking for where 't63' is in the grammar. Wait, 't's are on the RHS, but each has a number. Looking through, I don't see any rule that expands to exactly 't63'. Wait, unless NT52 is 't123' etc. Wait, perhaps I need to check all rules to see which NTs produce which t's.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all 'tX' and see which NTs expand into them:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't107' and 't17' \u2192 t107, t17\n- NT31 -> 't34', 't7' \u2192 t34, t7\n- NT48 -> 't11', 't105' \u2192 t11, t105\n- NT57 -> 't172'\n- NT77 -> 't56', 't124'\n- NT86 \u2192 not present in the grammar. Wait, perhaps 'tX' comes from NT99 or some other.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me first note where each 'tX' comes from. I think the problem is that I don't have a comprehensive list. Maybe I should go through the given string and see if each 't' in the string is covered by the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look at each 't' and see which non-terminal it can come from. For example, the first 't123' must come from NT24's production, which is NT24 -> 't123'. So that's possible.\n\nNext, 't63'\u2014I don't see a rule that expands to 't63' directly. Let me check all the rules for any 't63' entries. Looking through all the given rules:\n\nNo, I don't see 't63' as a terminal in any of the productions. Hmm, that's a problem. So if the string contains 't63', but there is no non-terminal in the grammar that expands to 't63', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe 't63' is produced by some NT. Let me go through each line to check for 't63'.\n\nLooking at line 35: NT68 -> 't45' and 't71'.\nLine 93: NT73 -> 't167'.\nLine 85: NT50 -> 't50'?\nWait, let me look through all the rules:\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT15 -> 't90' and 't21'\n- NT35-> 't40' etc. I don't see 't63' anywhere as a terminal.\n- Wait, on line 17: NT12-> 't80', so not 't63'.\n- Looking for NTs that produce 't63': Not seeing it.\n\nSo, if 't63' is part of the string, but there's no production rule in the grammar that generates 't63', then the string can't be generated, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps 't63' is generated by some combination of NTs. Or maybe I missed a line with 't63'.\n\nLooking again through all the rules:\n\n- NT61 expands to 't93' and 't71', etc.\n- NT39->'t44' and 't1' etc.\n- NT92->'t74' and 't18'.\n- I don't see any production that contains 't63'.\n\nSo 't63' is not in any of the RHS of the grammar's rules.

{"custom_id":"request-779","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of token values, and each token is represented as 't' followed by a number. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, I should check if the given grammar follows CNF. Looking at the productions, all are either two non-terminals or a single terminal, so it is in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of tokens: t91, t96, t93, t50, t130, t104, t121, t13, t115, t11, t165, t9, t141, t50, t169, t162, t157, t100, t169, t96, t72, t139, t162, t97, t156, t60, t72, t105, t123, t90, t102, t36, t51, t157, t145, t71, t156, t72, t98, t94, t100.\n\nSince the tokens are terminals, each token must correspond to the right-hand side (RHS) of some production. My approach should be to parse this string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking for the first token, t91. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT1 -> 't171' and others, but I need to see how t91 is derived. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT9 -> 't134', NT15 -> 't90', NT9 -> 't41' from another production, but not directly t91. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, in the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at the production NT9 -> 't134' and NT9 -> 't41', but nothing for t91 directly. That might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe t91 is a result of combining non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't91', which comes from a production where a non-terminal expands directly to that token. Looking through the productions, I see NT91 -> 't164' and other NT91 productions, but none that produce t91. So maybe I'm misunderstanding how the tokens map to the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'tN' corresponds to a production's RHS. So if the string is a sequence of terminals, each must be the result of a single production.\n\nAlternatively, the tokens could be the result of a series of productions. So, perhaps I should parse the string as a sequence of terminals, trying to match a leftmost derivation.\n\nGiven that it's a single string, I need to see if there's a sequence of productions that can derive exactly this string.\n\nMaybe starting by looking at the first few tokens:\n\nt91 t96 t93 t50 t130 t104 t121 t13 t115 t11 t165 t9 t141 t50 t169 t162 t157 t100 t169 t96 t72 t139 t162 t97 t156 t60 t72 t105 t123 t90 t102 t36 t51 t157 t145 t71 t156 t72 t98 t94 t100\n\nWait, the first token is t91. Let's see what non-terminals produce t91.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT73 -> 't151' and NT17 -> 't22', and NT68->'t145'. There's no NT91 or S->something that gives t91 except through left-hand side, but wait, the first production is S->NT99 NT99. Hmm, perhaps more systematically:\n\nEach token 'tN' must correspond to some production. So, for each token, find a production A -> a, where a is the token. Then, the string is a concatenation of such a's.\n\nBut in the given productions, many non-terminals produce multiple t's. For example, NT1 -> 't171', which means if NT1 is expanded as a single production, it produces t171. But it doesn't produce t91.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals can produce multiple tokens. For example, NT33 can produce t23 from one production and potentially others from others, but in the given list, NT33 is 'NT33 -> 't23'', but perhaps through other productions?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a mapping from non-terminals to their possible terminal tokens.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT1 -> 't171', 't22'\n- NT7 -> 't151', 't49'\n- NT9 -> 't134', 't41', 't169', 't49', 't73', '112', '41', '141', '169', '16', '134', '16', '151', '102', etc. Wait, but actually, each production is a single production. Wait, the way it's written, for example, NT7 -> 't151' is a production; also, NT7 -> 't49'. So NT7 can produce either t151 or t49.\n\nWait, but the way it's written, each line is a production. So for NT7, the productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t151\n\nNT7 \u2192 t49\n\nSo NT7 can produce either t151 or t49.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 has multiple productions.\n\nSo, for each non-terminal, we can list the possible tokens it can produce directly.\n\nLet's start:\n\nNT1: ['t171', 't22']\n\nNT7: ['t151', 't49']\n\nNT9: ['t134', 't41', 't169', 't49', 't73', 't16', 't112', 't41', 't141', 't169', 't16', 't151', 't102']\n\nWait, wait, let's parse the productions line by line correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each line is a production for the non-terminal on the left, with the RHS as a sequence of tokens and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, each line is a production. For example:\n\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\nSo NT15 expands into NT75 NT57.\n\nBut also, looking at:\n\nNT35 -> t68 or t103, as multiple lines show.\n\nWait no, looking at the grammar, each line represents a single production. So, for example, NT7 has two productions: NT7->t151 and NT7->t49.\n\nSimilarly, NT9: multiple production rules, such as NT9->t134, NT9->t41, etc.\n\nSo, for each non-terminal, the RHS can be a combination of non-terminals or single terminals.\n\nThus, the first step is to parse the entire string via the grammar.\n\nBut this might be a bit complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct an automaton that represents the grammar and see if the string can be accepted. But parsing manually is error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the grammar is in CNF, we can perform a leftmost derivation, expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut with a string of 39 tokens, that's quite lengthy manually. Maybe I can find a pattern or a chain of productions that could generate some of these tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the tokens in the string don't correspond to any production, meaning the string cannot be generated.\n\nLooking at the first token: t91.\n\nIs there a production where a non-terminal directly produces t91? Scanning through the productions:\n\nLooking for 't91' as a RHS:\n\nI see NT68-> t145\n\nNT1 -> t171 or t22\n\nNT73-> t151 or t162 or t96\n\nWait, in the productions, NT73 -> t162 and t67.

{"custom_id":"request-794","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how the non-terminals and terminals are related. The start symbol is S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S is followed by NT99 and NT89. Each NT followed by a number is a non-terminal, and some of them seem to produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18, NT57 \u2192 NT40 NT103, and so on. The terminal symbols are those strings that appear at the end of the productions, like NT7 \u2192 't21' or NT2 \u2192 't26'. Each NT can expand into other NTs or directly into a 't' followed by some number, which represents a terminal character.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms. Let me write it down:\n\nt51 t50 t108 t118 t73 t9 t108 t47 t49 t108 t60 t69 t146 t164 t129 t45 t45 t177 t178 t67 t71 t115 t112 t167 t121 t50 t158 t71 t100 t90 t172 t47 t90 t174 t17 t73 t51 t26 t98 t169 t167 t54.\n\nI need to check if this sequence can be derived by the grammar starting from S. Since all productions are in Chomsky normal form, I can attempt to parse the string using a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if the string can be built up.\n\nStarting with S, it must be NT99 AND NT89. So the first two symbols should correspond to the expansion of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, and NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar provided, I see that NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So NT99 expands into NT6 followed by NT103. NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45, and so on. Let me see the expansions step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backwards. For each 't' token, I need to find which NT produces it. For example, looking at the first token: t51.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT6 \u2192 't108', which isn't helpful. Wait, maybe I should make a list of all the terminal symbols and their corresponding NTs.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt17, t24, t29, t35, t42, t43, t45, t46, t47, t49, t52, t53 (wait, actually, looking at the productions, the terminals are things like NT2 \u2192 't26', NT1 \u2192 't107', NT9 \u2192 't134', and so on. So for each 't' in the string, I need to find which NT it comes from.\n\nLet me list out each 't' in the string and see which NT it corresponds to:\n\n1. t51: Looking through the grammar, does any NT produce t51? Let's see. Wait, in the list of productions, I see NT95 \u2192 't130', NT67 \u2192 't67', but nothing directly for t51. Hmm, perhaps I need to find which NT leads to t51.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list mapping each NT to its terminal or other NTs. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for each terminal in the grammar and see which NTs can produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some of the NTs have multiple productions, so I'll note which terminals they produce:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't171'\n- NT22 \u2192 't21'\n- NT23 \u2192 produces 't156', 't14', etc. Wait, let me go through each NT.\n\nStarting from NT1: \n- NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17.\n\nLooking for terminal 't17': In the grammar, NT21 \u2192 't171', but that's not 't17'. Wait, perhaps I need to look for 't17'. Looking through:\n\nLooking at the end of each production, NT45 \u2192 't165', NT47 \u2192 't109'? Wait, let me check each production that ends with a terminal:\n\nIt seems like the terminals are the strings after certain NT productions. For example:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't107' and 't17'\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT3 \u2192 't112'?\nWait, maybe I should make a table of NTs and their possible expansions, both NTs and terminals.\n\nLooking again, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT21, NT9, etc. So NT7 could produce NT21 or NT9.\n\nBut it's getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model the grammar and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string step by step, starting from the first symbol.\n\nThe string starts with:\n\nt51 t50 t108 t118 t73 t9 t108 t47 t49 t108 t60 t69 t146 t164 t129 t45 t45 t177 t178 t67 t71 t115 t112 t167 t121 t50 t158 t71 t100 t90 t172 t47 t90 t174 t17 t73 t51 t26 t98 t169 t167 t54.\n\nBut looking back at the grammar, let's see which NT is connected to these terminals.\n\nFirst, starting with t51.\n\nLooking for which NTs produce 't51'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT107 \u2192 't96', 't107', 't91', 't108', 't118', 't109' or something? Wait, no, probably each NT is associated with multiple terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that each NT can produce a certain combination of NTs and terminals. For example, NT108 \u2192 NT118, which might not directly produce a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any NT directly produces t51.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nDoes any NT have a terminal production that includes t51? Looking for it:\n\nLooking at all the productions, it seems that the only direct t is:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't108'\n- NT1 \u2192 't17', 't107'\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT7 \u2192 't108', 't91' (Wait, actually, looking at the first NT7 production: NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT9, etc. It doesn't produce a terminal directly. Hmm.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me see: in the grammar, each production is of the form NT -> something, and in the end, some of these something are terminals. For example, looking at the end of each production:\n\nNT73 is present in the first production, but I don't see any NT73 that ends with a terminal. So perhaps NT73 itself leads to other NTs, not terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of all the NTs that can produce a 't' symbol.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\n- NT7 produces t151.\nWait, no, actually, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, the production NT7 \u2192 t151? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, the productions are listed as NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, etc. and some of them have terminals. For example, looking at some of the entries:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t11, t106.\n\nWait, here's an example: NT45 \u2192 't165', 't45' or something? No, I think I need to make a list of all terminal symbols and which NTs produce them.\n\nPerhaps it's better to create for each terminal, the NTs that derive it.\n\nLooking through the production rules, let's find which NTs can produce each 't':\n\n1. t17:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific form where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to consist of a bunch of terminals (like 't101', 't177', etc.) and non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals or these terminals. The right-hand sides of all production rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal, which fits the CNF criteria.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' terms, each looking like \"t123\", which are probably the terminals that the grammar can produce. So the grammar can both generate and consume these 't' tokens. Now, I need to figure out if the string provided can be derived from the start symbol, S.\n\nThe string given is: `t101 t177 t1 t80 t139 t67 t24 t112 t34 t133 t21 t162 t36 t72 t171 t145 t21 t56 t36 t8 t26 t99 t139 t63 t97 t0 t23 t144 t17 t124 t36 t156 t48 t171 t21 t63 t51 t73 t171 t48 t100 t100`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a leftmost derivation since it's CNF. So the only way to generate a string is by expanding the non-terminals step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it seems to always expand into NT99 and NT89: S -> NT99 NT89. So the string should start with these two expansions. Let's check the first few 't' terms.\n\nThe string starts with 't101 t177 t1 ...'. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which production leads to these 't's. For example, the production NT106 -> NT35 NT107, which ends up in 't's, but it's hard to track without a detailed parse tree.\n\nWait, another approach: since each production gives either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string length should be 2^(n+1) where n is the number of productions. However, this might not directly help because the number of steps isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that correspond to known expansions. Let me see which 't's appear and if the grammar can produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce specific 't's:\n\nFor example, NT177: according to the rules, NT177 -> NT57 NT159, and NT57 -> NT43 NT52, NT159 -> NT52 NT105. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for which 't's are products of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I see some 't's being generated by specific non-terminals:\n\n- NT100 -> 't127'\n- NT99 -> 't6'\n- NT177 -> 't177'?\nWait, checking the rules: the grammar has NT177: looking back, actually, I should check each rule again.\n\nWait, in the list provided, I have to look for any rule that directly produces a 't' terminal.\n\nLet me scan through all the production rules:\n\nLooking for any production where A -> a (terminal):\n\nI see rules like NT96 -> NT105 NT1, but 105 doesn't lead to a terminal. Wait, no, NT96 -> 't91' as per the later rules. Wait, looking at the end of the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, some have 't' as a terminal:\n\n- NT100 -> 't127'\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n- NT33 -> 't23', 't23'\n- NT19 -> 't99'\n- NT77 -> 't56'\n- NT102 -> 't13'\n- NT100 -> 't96' (another rule)\n- NT43 -> 't2'\n- NT45 -> 't98'\n- NT55 -> 't72'\n- NT35 -> 't94'\n- NT107 -> 't174'\n- NT107 -> 't65'\n- NT106 -> 't35' (multiple rules)\n- NT61 -> 't84', 't71'\n- NT65 -> 't157', etc.\n\nWait, specifically, 't101' appears in the string. Is there any rule that produces 't101'? Looking through the production rules, I don't spot any NT production directly leading to 't101'. Similarly, 't177' is produced by which NT?\n\nLooking up, for example, NT177: The grammar has NT177 -> NT57 NT159. Where does NT57 come from? NT57 -> NT43 NT52. NT43 is in the rules, but NT43 -> 't2' or other non-terminals. Hmm, not 't177'. \n\nWait, maybe other non-terminals produce 't101'. Let me check the grammar rules. I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I spot NT107 -> 't174' and 't65', but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The given grammar has a lot of entries, and I need to check each production to see if any yield a 't' token. Let me list the ones where A \u2192 a:\n\n- NT100 -> 't127'\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT19 -> 't99'\n- NT77 -> 't56'\n- NT102 -> 't13'\n- NT76 -> 't45'\n- NT91 -> 't164'\n- NT42 -> 't139'\n- NT69 -> 't1'\n- NT88 -> 't69'\n- NT103 -> 't101'\n- NT171 -> 't162'\n- NT23 -> 't156'\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT64 -> 't24' (Wait, that's redundant because NT17 is also 't24'. So perhaps NT64 also leads to 't24' directly)\n- NT11 -> 't96', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some NTs produce specific 't's:\n\n- NT103 -> 't101' (Yes, so that means if NT103 can be expanded, it can produce 't101')\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT144: but looking through the rules, I don't see a rule for NT144. Probably, it's a 't' in the string, but from the grammar, I can't see a rule that directly produces 't144'.\n\nWait, in the string, I see 't144', but in the grammar, I don't see any production where NT144 is replaced directly by 't144'. So that's a problem because the grammar can't produce 't144' directly. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\n- The list of production rules includes NT73 -> 't162' (no, because it says NT73 -> NT162), wait, no: NT73 -> NT68 NT44, and so on. Hmm, perhaps I need to check each 't' in the string and see if there is a rule for the respective non-terminal.\n\nLet's go through each 't' in the string:\n\n1. t101: Check if any NT \u2192 t101. Looking through, is there an NT that can produce 't101'? Yes, NT103 -> 't101' (from the rules).\n2. t177: Looking for NT \u2192 t177. I don't see any production where an NT directly gives 't177'.\n3. t1: NT76 -> 't45', but I don't see NT76 leading to 't1'. Wait, looking again: NT76 \u2192 't45'. No. Wait, in the rules, I see NT76 is NT76 -> NT28 NT43. Not helpful. Maybe through expansion. Wait, but the start symbol is S, so the tree starts at S, which leads to NT99 and NT89, and then"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-820","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a non-terminal and a terminal on the left with exactly two symbols on the right (like S \u2192 NT1 NT2). Wait, actually, the initial production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so it's a bit different. Also, I notice that some of the rules have a terminal and a non-terminal. For example, NT1 \u2192 't24'. These terminals are part of the string we need to generate.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t71 t108 t91 t178 t146 t76 t9 t102 t100 t127 t24 t36 t45 t141 t60 t0 t127 t133 t72 t141 t65 t91 t174 t112 t162 t165 t144 t69 t21 t22 t146 t21 t141 t63 t164 t80 t99 t156 t34 t1 t100 t8`.\n\nWow, that's a long string. I think the best approach is to work backwards. Starting from the string, I can parse it from the end and see if I can derive the entire string using the given grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the string in parts to see where it ends up. The last few tokens are t80, t99, t156, t34, t1, t100, t8. So, the entire string ends with t8 at the end. That might be a clue because looking at the grammar, some NT rules end in specific terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT89\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (from some other rules, like NT68: NT45 NT71)\n- Wait, let me find where 't8' is produced. Scanning through the rules, I notice that some NT's produce 't' with numbers, like NT1 \u2192 't24', NT2 \u2192 't26', NT9 \u2192 't134', etc.\n\nWait, let me check each rule that ends with a terminal. For example, NT1 \u2192 't24', NT2 \u2192 't26', NT9 \u2192 't41', NT990 \u2192 Wait, looking back, I see NT16 \u2192 't112', NT17 \u2192 't22', NT19 \u2192 't99', NT23 \u2192 't156', NT24 \u2192 't123', NT28 \u2192 't76', NT31 \u2192 't7', etc. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the possible derivations. The start symbol is S, which generates NT99 NT89. So, the string should consist of two parts: the output of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's t49 t71 t108 t91 t178 t146 t76 t9 t102 t100 t127 t24 t36 t45 t141 t60 t0 t127 t133 t72 t141 t65 t91 t174 t112 t162 t165 t144 t69 t21 t22 t146 t21 t141 t63 t164 t80 t99 t156 t34 t1 t100 t8.\n\nI think the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT99 and the second by NT89. So, the string should be a concatenation of the output of NT99 and NT89.\n\nBut wait, NT99 and NT89 both can be further decomposed. Let me look at NT99 and NT89 rules.\n\nLooking at NT99, in the rules, I see:\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (line 17: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, but that's a production with terminals). Wait, looking back at the rules, I think I misread. Let's check again.\n\nWait, line 17: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71 (no terminal), line 69: NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12 (no terminal). Hmm, let me check all the rules to find where NT99 is.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT91 \u2192 't164', and other NT rules produce t-strings. But to find NT99, I need to find a production where NT99 is on the left with two symbols on the right.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't immediately see NT99. Wait, let's check the initial rules again: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So NT99 must be derived from other NT's on the right. Let me find where NT99 is produced.\n\nWait, from the rules, I see NT99 is used on the left in lines like NT68: NT45 NT71, but that's a production without a terminal. Wait, maybe I got the rules wrong. Let me go through each rule to see if any right-hand side uses NT99 with two symbols.\n\nWait, I think I need to go line by line to find all NT productions:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT99 NT89\nLine 2: NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\nLine3: NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\nLine4: NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\nLine5: NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\nLine6: NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\nLine7: NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\nLine8: NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\nLine9: NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\nLine10: NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93\nLine11: NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73\nLine12: NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\nLine13: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\nLine14: NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nLine15: NT39 \u2192 NT23 NT16\nLine16: NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\nLine17: NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\nLine18: NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\nLine19: NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69\nLine20: NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\nLine21: NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\nLine22: NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\nLine23: NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\nLine24: NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92\nLine25: NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18\nLine26: NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\nLine27: NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88\nLine28: NT52 \u2192 NT70 NT52\nLine29: NT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11\nLine30: NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17\nLine31: NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23\nLine32: NT83 \u2192 NT15 NT2\nLine33: NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75\nLine34: NT11 \u2192 NT81 NT29\nLine35: NT92 \u2192 NT52 NT99\nLine36: NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71\nLine37: NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71\nLine38: NT71 \u2192 NT80 NT42\nLine39: NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46\nLine40: NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18\nLine41: NT18 \u2192 NT35 NT43\nLine42: NT61 \u2192 NT93 NT80\nLine43: NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\nLine44: NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\nLine45: NT31 \u2192 NT7 NT6\nLine46: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (line17: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, but NT68 is different)\nWait, line17 is NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71.

{"custom_id":"request-818","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me start by recalling what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right. Also, the start symbol doesn't lead to empty strings, and no symbols are left unprocessed.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, every production except for the start symbol seems to split into two non-terminals. The start symbol S is replaced by NT99 and NT89. So the starting string should be a combination of two non-terminals, not any terminals. The given string starts with 't156', which is a terminal symbol, so it makes sense. But wait, in CNF, the entire start symbol S can only produce non-terminals, so the initial parse would be from the start symbol, which is S, generating two non-terminals.\n\nSo the first two symbols of the string must come from the productions of NT99 and NT89. Let me check the string: it starts with 't156 t134', which are two terminals. I need to see if these correspond to the results of the productions for NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT99 has a production: NT99 -> NT61 NT76. Then, NT61 and NT76 need to be expanded.\n\nNT61 -> NT84 NT44\nNT76 -> NT46 NT12\nSo, NT61 becomes t? Let's check NT84: NT84->NT1 NT65, which then is NT1 and NT65. NT1 produces 't107 t17' and NT65->'t157' as per the rules. So NT84 expands into t107 t17 t157. Wait, but in the string, the first part is t156. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the first part of the string is t156, t134, etc. Maybe I should map the terminals to their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking for t156, I see it's a terminal, does any production lead directly to t156? Looking through the rules, for example, NT48->t11, NT106->t35 t107, etc. Wait, but none of the non-terminals directly produce t156 except for maybe some through a series of replacements.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which NT can generate t156. Let me check the productions for each terminal. For instance, t156 is mentioned in NT106->NT35 NT107 and NT57->NT171 NT76, but no direct rule. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should map each terminal in the string to the NT that can produce it and then see if that forms a valid derivation from the grammar.\n\nLet me take the string 't156 t134 t169 t91 ...'. Each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal. So, 't156' is a terminal, which must come from a production of NT156? But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t156. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reverse-engineer the given string and try to trace back through the grammar to see if each terminal can be generated by some NT.\n\nLet's take the first terminal, 't156'. Looking at the grammar, it seems that 't156' is produced by NT106. Because in the RHS of some rules:\n\nFor example, NT106-> NT35 NT107, and looking for where '107' appears, NT107-> 't94'. Wait, but 't156' isn't directly listed. Looking through all the rules where a non-terminal is replaced by 'tX', I see that some NTs produce 'tX's. For example, NT52->t123, NT12->t80, etc.\n\nWait, looking specifically, t156 is indeed one of the NT106-> NT35 NT107, where NT107->t94? Hmmm, that doesn't directly produce t156. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's list all the terminals and their corresponding NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for each 'tX' occurrence:\n\nt17: NT17->'t22' Wait, no, t17 is in a production: nt17-> NT21->'t171', no. Wait no, let me see. The grammar has lines like:\n\n'NT17 -> 't22''. Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, I see nt17 -> 't24', no:\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar: For NT57->NT23 NT76, etc.\n\nWait, actually, let me read the grammar correctly.\n\nStarting with the first line:\nNT99 -> NT61 NT76\n\nAnd looking through the grammar, for example:\nNT67 -> NT67 NT73\nWait, I think I see some lines where terminals are used as results:\nFor example, NT52->t123\nNT12->t80\nAnd others like t134, t157, etc.\n\nLooking through all the definitions, I notice:\n\nLet me list all the direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT52->t123\n- NT12->t80\n- NT7->t21\n- NT1->t107 t17\n- NT31->t7\n- NT52->t177\n- NT29->t156\n- NT28->t76\n- NT70->t162\n- NT73->t167\n...and so on.\n\nLet me collect all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT29->t156\nNT28->t76\nNT67->t67\nNT77->t95\nNT89->t99\nNT42->t139\nNT91->t9\nNT84->t102\nAnd several more.\n\nSo, in the string, t156 appears once, which is generated by NT29. So the production for NT29 must be considered.\n\nNow, I need to see if each tX in the string can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the main issue is that the initial expansion from the start symbol S must produce two NTs: one from NT99 and the other from NT89. So, let's look at the first two symbols: t156 t134.\n\nt156 is generated by NT29, but in the grammar, NT29 is defined as NT103 NT156?\n\nWait, no: in the grammar, NT29 can be:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT29 -> 't156' comes from NT106->t35 t107? Or perhaps looking at NT106-> NT35 NT107, and in another rule, NT107-> t94? Hmm, not directly. Or NT29 is defined as 't156' directly, but checking, I don't see NT29 defined as such. Wait, wait, in the grammar rules, there are several 't's.\n\nWait, looking through all productions, I see lines like:\n\nNT52 -> 't123'\nNT12->'t80'\nNT29-> 't156', which is defined as: Looking at the first part of NT29.\n\nWait, actually, after NT29, the production seems to be NT29-> 't156' (from another line), but perhaps NT29 has the productions NT29 -> 't156' or 't136'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse all the terminal NTs.\n\nLet me collect all the non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT29-> t156\n- NT28-> t76\n- NT52-> t123\n- NT7-> t21\n- NT1-> t107 t17\n- NT31-> t7\n- NT54-> t48\n- NT11-> t96\n- NT16-> t54\n- NT46-> t99\n- NT19-> t99\n- NT23-> t171\n- NT33-> t23\n- NT106-> t35 t107 (and t107 is another NT leading to t94, etc.?)\n- NT91-> t9, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to model the expected initial expansion.\n\nS -> NT99 NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-833","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and I have a string that I have to check against it. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. CNF means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. The start symbol here is S, and the productions involve various NT with numbers and some terminals like 't' followed by numbers or multi-character numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t73 t63 t104 t108 t54 t56 t0 t174 t104 t144 t21 t23 t177 t105 t102 t13 t76 t22 t145 t101 t2 t1 t63 t2 t156 t101 t17 t141 t94 t145 t13 t101 t159 t13 t0 t22 t11 t129 t115 t129`.\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens. Each 't' followed by numbers seems to be a token. So, each token here represents a terminal symbol derived from a production rule in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two non-terminals. This implies that the parse tree will have a binary structure. Therefore, the derivation of the string should factor into pairs of non-terminals that eventually reduce to the terminals in the string.\n\nI need to reconstruct a parse tree for the given string or find a way to derive it step by step. However, since the string is quite long, doing this manually might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the production rules lead to the given sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by building a derivation starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can reach the string.\n\nBut before diving into that, let me see if I can identify some key production rules that might be involved. For example, looking at the string, the first token is 't73'. Looking for productions that lead to 't73'.\n\nWait, the productions are in reverse order because they are given as NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, but when reversed, we can see how a terminal might be derived from NTx. For example, if a production is NT73 \u2192 NTsomething NTsomething else, then in the derivation, we can get 't73' if that production is used.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, each production is of the form NTa \u2192 NTb NTc, implying that each NTa expands into two NTs which might then expand further. Since the start symbol is S, which is NT99 followed by NT99. So S \u2192 NT99 NT99.\n\nEach NT has its own productions. For example, NT99 has a production NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. But looking through all the productions, many are for specific NTs. For example, NT99: looks like it has a production to NT6 and NT103.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, some of the NTs have multiple productions. For example, NT93: NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77. Wait, but NT15 has a production NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9. Hmm, that might get complicated.\n\nLet me see the token sequence again. The first token is 't73'. Let's find which NT produces 't73' directly. Looking at the list, there's a production like NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42, but wait, I'm looking for terminal tokens. Wait, but in the grammar, some NTs immediately produce terminals. For example, looking through all the productions, some end with 't' followed by numbers. For instance, NT2 \u2192 't26', NT7 \u2192 't151', NT11 \u2192 't17', and so on.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the production NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, that doesn't produce a terminal. But other NTs do. So to get a terminal like 't73', there must be a production that ends with it.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice one production: NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42, but that still leads to two NTs. Another production: NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39, again not a terminal.\n\nLooking further, there seems to be a NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39. No terminal there. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check again.\n\nIn the list, I see NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42 and NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39. Both lead to NTs, so they don't produce terminals directly. Hmm. That suggests that 't73' is not produced directly by any of these productions, but perhaps through some other expansion.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, is there any production that leads directly to 't73'? Scanning through all the productions, I see NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9; NT21 \u2192 NT171 NT1; NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17; NT171 \u2192 NT43 NT52; NT43 \u2192 NT2 NT16; NT52 \u2192 NT70 NT52. Hmm, perhaps that's a long path, but I don't see NT73 directly producing a terminal.\n\nWait, let me look again. The tokens in the string are 't73' etc. So I need to see if any NT production leads to 't73'. Going back to the grammar, perhaps NT73 has a production that includes a terminal? Or maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, the first NT production for 73 is NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42, which is two NTs. Another is NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39. No, both go to NTs, so no direct terminal 't73'. Hmm, that's a problem because if there's a 't73' in the string, but it's not directly produced by any of the NT73's productions, that suggests that it must have been produced by an expansion of some other NT.\n\nSo perhaps NT73 is derived from another NT somewhere. Let's see, perhaps another NT produces a sequence that eventually becomes 't73'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the production rules. Let me go back and check.\n\nLooking through the grammar list again: I see NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39, and another NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42. So no direct terminal, but maybe through expanding those further.\n\nFor instance, NT6 is a production NT6 \u2192 't91'? Let me check the grammar. Yes, NT6 has production NT6 \u2192 't91'. Similarly, NT39 \u2192 't144', and so on.\n\nWait, so if NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39, then each of those NTs would expand to their terminals. So NT6 becomes 't91' and NT39 becomes 't144', making the expansion 't91 t144'. But in the given string, the first token is 't73', but according to this, it would be 't91' followed by 't144'. So that doesn't match 't73'.\n\nSo maybe another path. What if NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42, which both expand into 't103' and 't73'? Wait, no, NT80 \u2192 't63', NT42 \u2192 't165'. Wait, actually, let me check: NT80 has a production NT80 \u2192 't63'. So NT80 \u2192 't63', NT42 \u2192 't165'. So 't63 t165' would be the result of expanding NT80 NT42. But in the given string, the second token is 't63', then 't104', so maybe the first production after S is different.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is NT99 NT99. Each NT99 can expand into other NTs. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Let me check that: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 \u2192 't91', NT103 \u2192 't101'. So NT99 \u2192 't91 t101'. If S is expanding to that, then the first two tokens would be 't91 t101', but the string starts with 't73 t63...', so that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT99 uses a different production. Let me check NT99 productions. Looking through the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Is there another production for NT99? Let me scan again. Oh, wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see for NT99:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-832","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses 't' followed by numbers as terminals. So, each 't' followed by a number must be derived from one of the productions. For example, 't156' could come from NT15, because in the grammar, NT15 -> NT75 NT57 and NT57 could lead to 't57' or something else. Wait, actually, looking at the productions, some of the NTs derive to 't's. Like NT15 -> 't90', so when NT15 is used, it produces 't90'. Similarly, NT57 is not a terminal but maybe it's used in another production.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have 't156', which isn't directly a value in the productions I see. Let's check: for example, NT23 -> 't156' or something like that? Looking at the productions, I see NT23 -> NT40 NT107 (among others). Also, NT23 -> 't156'? Let me scan through the productions.\n\nWait, under NT23, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT40 NT107\nNT23 -> 't156'\n\nYes, so NT23 can produce 't156'. So 't156' would come from NT23 -> 't156'. That's one part.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with 't156 t71 t121 t97...'. Let me see:\n\nFirst symbol: 't156' comes from NT23.\n\nNext, 't71': Looking at productions, does any NT produce 't71'? Let's see. Maybe NT43 -> 't2' is not useful. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT23 is the only one that has a 't156', but for 't71', perhaps another NT. Looking, for example, NT12 -> 't80', but 't71' is another one. Let me search:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't71' except maybe from some production. For example, NT75 -> 't71' from the production NT75 -> 't98'? No. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nLooking at NT75: It has a production to 't98', which is different. But maybe it's derived from other steps. Alternatively, maybe NT81 -> 't71', looking at the productions of NT81: NT81 has a production to 't71' as per the line NT81 -> NT55 NT23, and somewhere else it's written NT81 -> 't71'. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the productions include:\n\nLooking through all, for example, NT81 has a production to 't71' not listed here. Wait, no, in the given productions, I don't see NT81 -> 't71'. Let me check each NT's productions.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT23 has NT23 -> 't156'.\n\nLooking for 't71' in the productions, is there any NT that directly produces 't71'? For example, looking at NT19: it has a production to 't99', so that's different. NT75: it has a production to 't71' as per line NT75 -> 't98'? No, wait, no, let me carefully check.\n\nLooking through each NT, for example:\n\n- NT1 -> 't107', 't17'.\n- NT19 -> 't99', 't99' (from NT19 -> NT74 NT46, each leading to more NTs, which eventually may produce 't99' which is 't99' as a terminal? Or wait, what's NT46? NT46 has a production to 't99', so if NT19 produces NT74 and NT46, and both of those eventually produce 't99', then 't99' is produced.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more efficient to model this as a series of steps, but given the complexity, maybe another approach is to see the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down into the grammar productions.\n\nAlternatively, building a parse tree for the string based on the grammar. Let's try to break it down:\n\nThe string is: t156 t71 t121 t97 t112 t110 t171 t157 t174 t157 t36 t21 t174 t139 t45 t151 t164 t141 t98 t154 t26 t167 t101 t110 t54 t174 t9 t9 t167 t100 t23 t8 t129 t21 t13 t11 t60 t45 t162 t90 t96.\n\nFirst, starting from the beginning:\n\n1. t156: From NT23 -> 't156'.\n2. Next, t71. To produce t71, need NT71 -> 't71' or a production that leads to t71. Looking at the NT71 productions, looking at NT96 -> 't91' etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to look for a chain of symbols that fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the start symbol is S, which is generated by S -> NT99 NT99 (since S -> NT99 NT99 is the first production). So the entire string must be a combination of two NT99s.\n\nBut that might not be the case, maybe S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nWait, looking at the productions: the first line is S -> NT99 NT99, which is perhaps more common, but another production could be S -> NT99 NT89. Looking back, yes, the second production is S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nSo the string should be a combination of two NT99's, possibly.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the string is too long or doesn't fit the production rules.\n\nWait, let's look for 't9' in the string. It's at the end and appears twice. Looking through the productions, for example, NT6: NT6 -> 't108' and also NT6 has a production to NT108, which is 't108'.\n\nWait, 't9' is produced by NT100 -> 't96' or NT23 -> 't156', but not directly. Maybe 't9' comes from NT9 which is 't134', but in the productions, I don't see NT9 directly producing 't134' except one production says NT9 -> 't134', so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, another production line is NT35 -> 't134', so another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map the string in reverse. Starting from the end.\n\nThe last token is 't90', which comes from NT96 -> 't91' and NT96 also produces 't11'. Wait, looking at the productions, NT96 has two terminals: 't90' and 't11'. Wait, looking at the production NT96 -> 't91' and 't6' because I see NT68 -> 't67' and NT6 -> 't91'.\n\nWait, I might be getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for each token and see if it's possibly produced by some NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the string begins with 't156', which is from NT23, then next 't71' \u2014 could that be another NT23, but NT23 also can produce 't156' as well. Wait, but multiple NT23 could produce those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or has a structure that doesn't align with any possible parse tree.

The string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms, which I assume are terminals that need to be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky normal form entails.

To approach this, I'll consider the structure of the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nI need to map each 't' in the string to an applicable production from the grammar. Each non-terminal (NTx, S) must eventually be expanded into the corresponding terminal string.\n\nLet me list the string elements again for clarity:\nt139, t17, t93, t171, t133, t164, t115, t121, t73, t63, t156, t21, t177, t108, t34, t151, t54, t141, t156, t36, t96, t0, t73, t169, t0, t22, t145, t80, t24, t23, t112, t178, t98, t169, t41, t115, t139, t162, t157, t169, t169, t171, t112, t98, t162.\n\nFirst, I notice that each terminal is of the form 't' followed by a number. The grammar defines each of these numbers as either 'a' productions directly (like NT7 -> 't24') or through other non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the beginning of the string: t139.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I find that NT139 is not directly defined as a terminal. Instead, I need to trace back or find which production could lead to t139.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT52 -> NT28 NT70\n- NT43 -> 't2'\n- NT52 -> 't123'\n\nWait, I thought all the 't's were in NTx, but looking back, it seems some non-terminals have direct terminal productions. For example, NT7 -> 't24' is given, meaning that NT7 can produce 't24' directly.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the grammar productions are listed, and each production either has two non-terminals on the RHS or a terminal. So, 't's are directly produced by some non-terminals.\n\nSo, to proceed, I think the way is to build the parse tree from the root S down to the leaves matching the given string. Alternatively, I can reverse-engineer the string by seeing if each terminal can be derived starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is quite complicated, maybe the string can be split into chunks that match parts of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few elements are t139, t17, t93, etc. So, the first step is to see if t139 can be produced by some non-terminal. From the grammar, I see NT139 is not directly a terminal, but it's produced as part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that can directly produce a terminal 't' number:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> 't24'\n\nNT16 -> 't112'\n\nNT24 -> 't123'\n\nNT77 -> 't108' (Wait, NT77 has two productions: NT77 -> 't56' and NT77 -> 't124').\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, several non-terminals have direct terminals:\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> 't24'\n\nNT16 -> 't112'\n\nNT24 -> 't123'\n\nNT35 -> 't94'\n\nWait, no\u2014let me go through the productions step by step to find all NTx that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-853","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions, S is directly producing NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals is further broken down into combinations of other non-terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and so on. Some of the non-terminals eventually produce terminals with strings like 't112', 't56', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms. Let me list them out to see their order:\nt112, t56, t93, t146, t51, t50, t139, t146, t177, t130, t91, t146, t145, t91, t73, t73, t76, t56, t48, t158, t151, t22, t145, t47, t112, t170, t121, t69, t76, t174, t108, t17, t112, t90, t80, t34, t169, t146, t9, t129, t157, t22, t171, t171, t121.\n\nEach 't' seems to correspond to a specific non-terminal, which is a rule in the grammar. My task is to see if this string can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar is composed of non-terminals that eventually expand into a chain of 't' productions. Each non-terminal leads to a combination of two others until we hit a terminal.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the first two symbols derived from S will be from NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two 't's are t112 and t56. So, NT99 must produce t112 and NT89 must produce t56. Let's check if this is possible.\n\nLooking up NT99 \u2192 in the grammar, there's a production NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Then, NT6 \u2192 't108' (from the rules). Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nWait, the rules for NT6: the production is given as NT6 \u2192 't108'.\n\nAnd for NT103: I see rules like NT103 \u2192 't101', and others. Wait, looking more closely:\nLooking through the rules, I see NT103 \u2192 NT101 NT23, but also NT103 appears as NT103 \u2192 't101' (as per the rules: NT99 -> NT6 NT103; elsewhere, NT103 -> 't101' is present but I need to find an exact rule.\n\nWait, let me parse the rules correctly. For example, looking for NT99:\n- NT99 is produced by NT6 NT103.\n\nNT6 is in the rules as:\n- Looking through the rules, I find NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT43, and NTT28 \u2192 NT67 NT73, but wait, let me find where NT6 directly goes. I see:\n- NT6 is the terminal in some productions, like NT96 \u2192 NT67 NT73. But is there a direct production for NT6?\n\nLooking through the entire rule list, I don't see a production where NT6 \u2192 't...', but I do see for NT76: NT76 -> NT45 NT71, and others.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65\n- NT20? Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps, rather than focusing on the non-terminals, I should try to see what each 't' corresponds to and trace back the possible paths.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work backwards. Let's parse the string step by step to see if it can be broken down into possible substitutions.\n\nFirst, the string is:\nt112, t56, t93, t146, t51, t50, t139, t146, t177, t130, t91, t146, t145, t91, t73, t73, t76, t56, t48, t158, t151, t22, t145, t47, t112, t170, t121, t69, t76, t174, t108, t17, t112, t90, t80, t34, t169, t146, t9, t129, t157, t22, t171, t171, t121.\n\nStarting with t112. Looking through the rules, what non-terminals produce 't112'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129'. Wait, looking more carefully, the rules seem scattered. Let me try to find which non-terminals directly produce each 't'.\n\nLooking for each 't' and the rules:\n\nt112: Looking for any rule where the RHS includes 't112'. For example:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't151' (from the rules)\n- NT71 \u2192 't156' (from NT73 \u2192 NT80 NT42, NT42 is 't165' etc.)\nWait, maybe this approach isn't working. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string is a concatenation of sequences that correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if S can derive this string by correctly choosing substitutions in the grammar.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the first two symbols in the string are t112 and t56, so let's see if NT99 can produce t112 and NT89 can produce t56.\n\nLooking at NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nFor NT6: Are there any rules where NT6 produces a 't'? From the rules, I don't see an explicit NT6 \u2192 't...', unless I missed it. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36, but that's NT96, not NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 is a terminal in some contexts, but from the rules, I might need to see NT6 is a terminal if it only appears in a production where it's a leaf. Let me check: the rules for NT6 are:\n\nLooking at all production rules for NT6:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT43\n- NT67 \u2192 NT67 (but that's a self production, likely a mistake, but assuming it's a production)\n- Wait, no, actually, the rules might not include NT6 directly. I don't see any rule where NT6 is on the left; all NT6's are on the right-hand side (RHS).\n\nSo, NT6 must be a terminal. Therefore, in the string, any occurrence of a 't's that correspond to NT6's must have been generated by NT6 rules.\n\nBut in the rules, I don't see NT6's productions. So, for NT6 to produce a 't', maybe NT6 only appears in a production that directly results in a 't', but since no rule has NT6 on the left except in combinations, perhaps NT6 is a terminal that's defined elsewhere. Wait, no: in CNF, the left-hand side variables are non-terminals, so if a non-terminal is a leaf in the parse tree, it must be a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in the rules, looking for NT6 \u2192 't X', that doesn't exist. So perhaps NT6 is not a terminal, but a non-terminal whose productions all go to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, that contradicts the 't' sequence in the string.

{"custom_id":"request-880","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) are defined in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either:\n1. A terminal followed by a non-terminal (A \u2192 aB)\n2. A non-terminal followed by two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC)\n\nLooking at the grammar, all productions seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89 is a non-terminal (S) producing two non-terminals (NT99 and NT89). Another example is NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of t followed by numbers, like t141, t134, and so on. I notice that the grammar has terminals that match these strings. For instance, NT15 \u2192 't90', which seems to correspond to t90. I think each production that has a terminal matches one of these tX terms.\n\nThe goal is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals according to the grammar. The string has 40 tokens, each starting with 't', followed by a number. I need to map these tokens back to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into possible parts that match the grammar's terminals. The first few tokens are t141, t134, t65, t170, and so on. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT65 \u2192 't157', so t157 could be produced by NT65. Wait, but the second token is t134, which corresponds to NT99's production: NT99 \u2192 't134'. Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT99 \u2192 't6' and NT65 \u2192 't157', but in the string, the second token is t134, which isn't directly listed. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check: NT19 \u2192 't99' and NT77 \u2192 't56'. Hmm, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each token in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, and I need to see if the sequence of terminals can be traced back to the start symbol S through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\n1. t141: Which NT produces t141? Looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT directly producing t141. Wait, maybe it's a combination. Let me check all NT productions for t141. Hmm, I don't see any NT production that directly gives t141. Maybe it's derived from a chain. For example, an NT might produce another NT which then produces t141. Without knowing exactly, it's hard, so maybe another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the productions of the grammar. Each token needs to be matched by a terminal in a production.\n\nFor instance, the string starts with t141. Let me check which NT can produce t141. Checking all the NT productions:\n\nLooking through, I don't immediately see any NT production that ends with t141. Wait, perhaps it's part of a larger production. For example, NT11 \u2192 't96', which doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe multiple NTs combine to form t141. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I should map each token to its possible NT. For example:\n\nt141: Looking through all NT terminals, I don't see a direct production for t141. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each NT:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't151', no.\nNT74 \u2192 't100', no.\nNT76 \u2192 't121', no.\nNT17 \u2192 't22', nope.\nNT22 \u2192 't17', nope.\nNT170 \u2192 't94' (Wait, is there an NT95 elsewhere?), not seeing t141.\n\nMaybe t141 is produced by a combination of NTs. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so perhaps both NT99 and NT89 are involved. Let's see, NT99 \u2192 't134' and NT89 \u2192 't60' (from NT89 \u2192 NT60 t6, but wait, looking back, no, I think NT89 \u2192 t60, but in the grammar I see NT89 \u2192 't60'. So t134 and t60 would be produced from NT99 and NT89. But the string starts with t141, which doesn't seem to match t134 or t60. Maybe this isn't the right way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t141 is produced by NT69 \u2192 't91' is incorrect. Wait, NT69 \u2192 t51, not t141.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern or an alternative approach. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that each correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLet's try to split the string into smaller parts:\n\nt141 t134 t65 t170 t65 t8 t171 t169 t47 t23 t2 t146 t162 t112 t0 t104 t93 t178 t67 t159 t99 t121 t24 t101 t158 t178 t69 t145 t110 t171 t50 t174 t164 t48 t91 t123 t127 t141 t56 t177 t154 t23 t21 t65 t102 t115.\n\nThis is 40 tokens. Let me see if I can find a starting production. The start symbol is S, which produces NT99 NT89. So the first step should produce two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t141, t134, t65, t170. Maybe the first NT99 produces t134 and NT89 produces something. Or perhaps NT99 produces t134, and NT89 produces t141. But checking the NT productions:\n\nNT99 \u2192 't134', yes, that's NT99 \u2192 't134'. So that would match the first token as t134 from NT99.\n\nThen, the second token is t141. So what produces t141? Looking for an NT that ends with t141. Hmm, I don't see any. So maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps NT11 produces t96, but that's not helpful. Maybe NT99 produces t134 (first token), and then the next NT89 needs to produce t141. Wait, NT89 has productions:\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT60 t67, but I don't see t67 in the string. Alternatively, NT89 \u2192 t60. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with NT99 \u2192 t134 (first token), and then NT89 producing the rest. But the second token is t141, which doesn't directly match any NT production for NT89. Maybe I'm not looking correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps NT89 produces t60, and then t60 is another NT production. Maybe t60 is NT60 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the grammar, what's NT60? I don't see NT60 as a definition. Maybe NT60 is derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has t60 somewhere else. Let me check. Oh, in the grammar, NT89 \u2192 NT60 NT76, and NT60 is not listed, but wait, looking again, NT60 is not a production\u2014maybe I'm confused. Wait, in the grammar provided, the productions are:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 NT60 NT76\n- Wait, actually, looking back, in the grammar, NT89 \u2192 NT60 NT76 is written as \"NT89 -> NT60 NT76\". So if NT60 and NT76 are non-terminals, then their productions need to be traced. Maybe the string includes parts derived from NT60 and NT76.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe a better approach is to try to see if the entire string can be derived by the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has 40 tokens, which is an even number. The grammar S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so if the string's length (in terms of NT and terminals) can be reduced step by step.\n\nWait, the string is in the form of t followed by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-872","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is a specific type where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It consists of multiple production rules starting from S and other non-terminals, with many terminals (like t80, t167, etc.). My string is `t80 t167 t169 t121 t101 t169 t22 t99 t60 t178 t146 t49 t90 t145 t110 t22 t50 t49 t96 t8 t162 t96 t157 t72 t47 t159 t47 t47 t1 t105 t91 t110 t22 t121 t50 t134 t69 t130 t141 t94 t72 t21 t172 t8 t73 t26`.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string using the grammar, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, I can look for any parts that don't fit the grammar based on the possible terminals and how they can be formed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals have productions that either split into two non-terminals or produce a specific terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Each of these non-terminals (NT99, NT89) must themselves be able to produce the respective terminals or split further.\n\nLet me look at NT99 and NT89 in the string:\n- The string starts with t80, which is produced by NT100 \u2192 t96. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT100 \u2192 t127, but in the provided grammar, I see:\nNT100 -> t127\nBut the string starts with t80. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t80?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n- NT28 \u2192 t76\n- NT77 \u2192 t121\n- NT77 \u2192 t56\n- NT23 \u2192 t156\n- NT69 \u2192 t1\n- NT84 \u2192 t8\nWait, hold on. Let me find where t80 is produced. Hmm, in the provided grammar, I don't see a production for t80. But wait, the string has t80 as the first token.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, NT106 -> NT35 NT107. NT35 has several productions:\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n- NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\n- NT35 \u2192 NT43 NT52\n- Also, checking if there's a terminal for NT35 elsewhere:\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT35 that directly becomes a terminal. So unless it's part of a larger production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. The string contains t80 as the first token. Let me check if any production in the grammar has t80 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT68 \u2192 t145\n- NT11 \u2192 t17\n- NT48 \u2192 t11\n- NT29 \u2192 t156\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT61 \u2192 t93\n- NT96 \u2192 t91\n- NT93 \u2192 t170\n- NT91 \u2192 t9\n- NT16 \u2192 t112\n- NT29 \u2192 t129\n- NT68 \u2192 t145\n- NT29 \u2192 t129\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- NT12 \u2192 t80 \u2192 Wait, here it is! NT12 \u2192 t80.\n\nSo, the non-terminal NT12 produces t80.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, where does NT12 appear? The production is S \u2192 NT12 \u2192 t80. So S \u2192 NT12 \u2192 t80. So to produce t80, we first have to derive it from NT12.\n\nNow, the string starts with t80, so that part is fine. The next token is t167. Let's see where t167 comes from. Looking at the grammar, is there a production that produces t167?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see t167 being a terminal in any production. The closest is NT28 \u2192 t76, which is another terminal. So unless t167 is produced by some non-terminal, which I don't see in the given grammar. Wait, no, looking through all the productions for terminals:\n\nThe terminals are things like t80, t167, t169, etc. But I only see t80 explicitly produced by NT12. The others, like t167, must come from some non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, let's see if any NT produces t167. Checking each rule:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT directly producing t167. So perhaps I need to see if t167 can be derived from some NT, but since I don't see any such production, it's possible that the string contains a term that isn't in the grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t167 is a result of a long derivation, but given that the grammar doesn't have a rule for t167, it's impossible to produce it. So if the string contains t167, which is not a terminal of any production, it means the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but looking again, the grammar does have some rules that end up producing terminals through splits. For example, NT12 \u2192 t80. So a non-terminal can split and produce a terminal.\n\nBut other terminals like t167, t169, etc., must be produced directly by their own NT rules. So maybe the grammar has rules where certain NTs produce these terminals.\n\nWait, I'm looking at the grammar and I don't see any NT that directly produce t167, t169, etc., except for some that produce terminals. Let me list the productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals are:\n\nt80: NT12 \u2192 t80\nt99: S's NT99 \u2192 t80? Wait, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Let's see if NT99 or NT89 produce t99.\n\nWait, NT99: Looking through the rules, I don't see NT99 directly producing a terminal. Let me check:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT55 NT23. Both NT55 and NT23 are non-terminals. So NT99 can't produce t99 directly.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT99 NT89. NT99 and NT89 are further non-terminals. So maybe t99 is produced through another path.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to see if all the tokens in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are: t80, t167, t169, t121, t101, t169, t22, t99, t60, t178, t146, t49, t90, t145, t110, t22, t50, t49, t96, t8, t162, t96, t157, t72, t47, t159, t47, t47, t1, t105, t91, t110, t22, t121, t50, t134, t69, t130, t141, t94, t72, t21, t172, t8, t73, t26.\n\nSo, the first token is t80, which is produced by NT12. The second is t167, which I don't see being produced anywhere. Let me check all the NT rules again to see if any produce t167.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t56, t121, t96\n- NT93 \u2192 t170, t124, t159, t72, t71\n- NT107 \u2192 t174, t65\n- NT70 \u2192 t102, t92, t88\n- NT42 \u2192 t165, t75\n- NT73 \u2192 t73 (from S)\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-893","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, okay, so the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I think all the rules either produce two non-terminals or specific terminals.\n\nThe string we have to check is pretty long: `t134 t127 t174 t90 t145 t63 t121 t164 t156 t159 t170 t172 t56 t145 t80 t0 t71 t105 t90 t94 t11 t8 t164 t169 t98 t23 t169 t100 t21 t129 t72 t162 t134 t0 t9 t169 t171 t162 t63 t145 t11 t101 t23 t80 t156 t54 t178`.\n\nFirst, I notice that 't' followed by numbers are probably terminal symbols. The grammar seems to have several rules with different terminals, so I need to see if the string can be broken down according to these rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if each 't' in the string corresponds to some production rule. For example, starting from the first symbol, let's look at t134. Looking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals derive into t134. Like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and then NT99 might be 't134', but I'm not sure exactly how each 't' is derived.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, some non-terminals directly derive into certain 't' values. For instance, NT39 \u2192 't144', and there are multiple rules where 't134' is the result. Let me check where 't134' comes from. Oh, NT73 \u2192 't167'? Wait, no. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't134', I see NT107 \u2192 't174'? Hmm, not directly. Wait, is there any NT that directly gives 't134'? Or does it come from a combination of other non-terminals?\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has more steps. For example, maybe 't134' is produced by one of the NTs that are connected through other rules.\n\nLet me pick another approach. Let's look at the entire string and see if each 't' is covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the string, each 't' is followed by a number:\n\nt134, t127, t174, t90, t145, t63, etc.\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these 't' values can be generated by some production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT can produce one or more terminals. For instance:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57 \u2192 and so on until it reaches a terminal.\n\nLet me pick NT15. From the grammar, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, then NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18, and so on. Eventually, NT15 will derive into some terminals. Hmm, wait, in the grammar, NT15 can eventually produce 't151'.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69, and looking further down, NT91 \u2192 't164', and NT69 can produce 't69' or more steps. Wait, but in the string, I have t63, which is not directly in the terminals I see from NT production.\n\nWait, let me check the given string again. The first symbol is t134. So I need to see if the grammar allows for NT that can derive into t134.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT107 \u2192 't174' and 't65'. Not t134. Hmm.\n\nWait, is there any NT that can directly produce t134? Let me scan through:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't immediately see an NT that directly produces t134. So maybe t134 is a result of a combination of non-terminals.\n\nFor example, starting from NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, which can then be broken down further. Let's see: NT6 \u2192 't108', which is terminal, and NT103 \u2192 't101'. So NT99 would produce 't108' 't101', which is t108 t101, not t134.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another path. Let's see NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69. NT91 \u2192 't164', NT69 \u2192 't169' (perhaps). So t164 t169, which isn't t134.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a longer chain. Let's look for a NT that can produce something like t134.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me list all NT symbols: NT1, NT5, NT7, ..., up to NT95, NT100, etc. Maybe I can see if any of these can derive into t134.\n\nLooking at NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71. NT45 isn't a terminal, but NT71 \u2192 't169'. Then, NT45 might produce something else. NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT76, which then breaks down into NT28 \u2192 NT121 NT70, and others.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nBut parsing a large string manually would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at the string, for example: t127 appears twice. Let's see if any NT rules produce t127. Scanning through the production rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t127. So that might be a problem.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t90: NT15 \u2192 't151', NT19 \u2192 't99', etc. Wait, in the string, t90 appears multiple times. Let me check if any NT can produce t90.\n\nLooking at NT19 \u2192 't99', NT83 \u2192 't2', NT17 \u2192 't22', etc. Wait, where does t90 come from? Looking through the grammar, perhaps NT90 is a terminal or derived from another NT.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces t90 except for NT15, which produces t151, but in the string, t90 appears like NT15's t151 might not match.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a step-by-step breakdown would help.\n\nAlternative approach: find if each 'txxx' in the string is matched by some rule in the grammar. Starting with the first symbol t134.\n\nIs there any NT that can produce t134? Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT where the rule's terminal includes t134.\n\nFrom the production rules:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't123' or maybe 't171'? Wait, no, in the given rules, NT52 is NT52 \u2192 NT24 NT75, etc. Wait, in the provided grammar, the last part of NT52 is: NT52 \u2192 NT54 NT75, but I don't see NT52 directly producing any 't's listed in the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the rules. Let me re-examine the given grammar. Here are some key parts:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT76\n- NT28 \u2192 NT121 NT70\n- NT70 \u2192 NT102 NT92\n- NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, etc.\n\nLooking for where 't134' appears. Maybe NT52 \u2192 NT24 NT75, and if NT24 \u2192 't123', NT75 \u2192 't95', so t123 t95. Hmm, but in the string, t134 isn't present in that case.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and some of these might produce t134. For example, NT35 \u2192 't40', 't43', etc. Wait, but the string has t134, which is a high number.

{"custom_id":"request-896","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, so I'll need to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It starts with S and has productions that combine symbols, often involving other non-terminals (like NT15, NT89, etc.) and eventually terminals (starting with 't'). Each production is of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, meaning each non-terminal can expand into two other non-terminals, and some end with terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given starts with 't178' and has multiple 't' terms, each followed by a number. My first thought is that each non-terminal in the grammar leads to a specific terminal and another non-terminal or terminal. Since all the terminals in the grammar seem to be of the form 't' followed by a number, the string being checked is made up of these terms.\n\nSo, I need to see if there's a way the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions. Given that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a terminal.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol S in the possible derivations. S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the initial step is to replace S with NT99 and NT89. That would create two branches in the derivation tree. Each of these non-terminals will then expand further.\n\nLooking at NT99, I'll check the grammar for any rule that starts with NT99. Scanning through, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So NT99 can become NT6 and NT103. Similarly, NT89 has a rule NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. So one branch from NT89 will involve NT44 and NT1.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals (NT6, NT103, NT44, NT1) will have their own productions. NT1 is a terminal, so that's the end of that branch. NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88, so now I'm into another layer of non-terminals. NT24 has a production NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65. NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71, which then branches further.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll try to match these expansions. The string starts with 't178', so I'll look for what can produce 't178'. Scanning the grammar, I see NT52 \u2192 NT67 NT73, and some other rules. Wait, more importantly, some rules have terminals at the end. For example, NT57 \u2192 NT77 NT70, but I don't see a terminal there immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for each production that ends with a terminal. For example, is there any NT production that directly gives a terminal? Actually, no, all the non-terminals produce other non-terminals. But looking closer, some productions have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. But some productions in the grammar provided seem to have two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal, but in this case, the provided grammar only has NT productions ending in non-terminals except for some with a terminal.\n\nWait, I need to re-examine the grammar rules. Maybe I'm missing something. For example, looking for any NT production that ends with a terminal. Scanning through:\n\nThe grammar has rules like NT16 \u2192 't112', NT29 \u2192 't36' or 't156', NT12 \u2192 't80', and so on. Oh, I see some NT productions do indeed directly produce terminals. So for example, NT16 \u2192 't112', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT29 can produce 't36' or 't156', etc.\n\nSo the string has several terminals, so the derivation must involve using these NT productions that generate terminals.\n\nNow, considering the string starts with 't178', I'll need to find which NT leads to 't178'. Let's see which rule produces 't178'. Looking through the grammar, I notice that some NT have rules ending with specific numbers. For example, NT68 \u2192 't145' among others, and other NT rule productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can reverse-engineer this. Let me see if any NT productions include 't178' in their expansion. For instance, looking at:\n\nNT107 \u2192 't65', NT52 \u2192 't123', etc. Doesn't seem to have 't178' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through the grammar again carefully. Looking for any NT followed by \u2192 and a terminal.\n\nYes, here are some NT rules that produce terminals:\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't36'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT99 \u2192 't177'? Wait, no: looking again, there's NT99 -> NT6 NT103, and NT103 \u2192 't101'. So NT99 expands to NT6 (which can eventually become terminals) and NT103 which becomes 't101'. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other NT rules: wait, I see rules like NT1 \u2192 't107', which is a terminal. So to get a 't' term, we have to follow a chain of NT productions that eventually expand into a terminal.\n\nSo, for the first 't178', I need to see how it can be produced. Let's look for any NT with a production that includes 't178'. Suppose there's no NT that directly produces 't178', so perhaps it's produced via a multi-step expansion.\n\nLooking through each rule, I notice:\n\nNT53 \u2192 [Not present], but looking at the list. Wait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't107'\n- NT76 \u2192 't45'\n- NT95 \u2192 't130'\n- NT96 \u2192 't91'\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT65 \u2192 't157'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT70 \u2192 't162'\n- NT74 \u2192 't106'\n- NT17 \u2192 't74'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't36' or 't156'\n- NT48 \u2192 't11'\n- NT42 \u2192 't139' or 't158'\n- NT45 \u2192 't98'\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT66? Wait, perhaps not. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar again, I see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 't106' and 't8'\nNT106 \u2192 't90' ? No, wait: For example, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107 or 't35' and others. Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't0', which appears in several NT productions:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't123'\nNT93 \u2192 't170'\nNT99 \u2192 't178' Wait, no, NT99 is transformed earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me list out the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't107'\n- NT76 \u2192 't45'\n- NT95 \u2192 't130'\n- NT99 \u2192 't178'? Wait, no: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So to get 't178', perhaps it's through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should approach this by starting from the string and seeing if each terminal can be explained by some NT production. Let's take the first 't178'. I need to find an NT that can derive 't178', which would mean that NT178 is a terminal? But in the grammar provided, 't' terms go up to 't169' or 't178', but perhaps it's a typo or part of the given rules.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT19 \u2192 't99' and NT76 \u2192 't45', etc. But maybe I need to see if any NT production leads to 't178'.\n\nWait, here's a possible path: Let's suppose a NT can expand to 't178'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT100 \u2192 't127'\n- NT108 \u2192 't118'\n- NT11 \u2192 't96'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41' or 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-921","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and notice it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing because each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which initially produces NT99 and NT89. So, the first step is to generate strings starting with these two non-terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check is: \nt129 t121 t124 t69 t127 t24 t123 t124 t13 t133 t121 t118 t134 t169 t23 t98 t157 t124 t22 t11 t141 t63 t76 t98 t93 t102 t115 t24 t129 t91 t141 t164 t127 t102 t177 t22 t104 t41 t157 t65 t73 t154.\n\nI'll approach this by checking each production and seeing if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many produce pairs of non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and so on. Each of these splits into more non-terminals until there are no more non-terminals left, at which point they produce a terminal string.\n\nI should construct the derivation tree for the given string. Starting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nLet's see if the string starts with any of the productions of NT99 or NT89.\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nSo, let's see what the first few symbols correspond to.\n\nThe string starts with t129, t121, etc. I need to see what the productions of NT99 and NT89 would produce in terms of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT99's productions:\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 NT6 produces t91 (from NT6 \u2192 t91), NT103 \u2192 t101 (from NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45, which then \u2192 t123 and t115? Wait, let me check the exact mappings.\n\nWait, looking at the substitution rules, the grammar replaces each non-terminal with a terminal string. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 t91 t103. Then, NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45 \u2192 t123 t115. So, concatenating these, NT99 would produce t91 t103 t123 t115, which would be four terminals.\n\nBut that seems long. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the given grammar, each non-terminal maps directly to a terminal string:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t6, t103 (I think each rule ends up producing a specific set of terminals). So, looking at the NT99 rule:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 which, looking at the given production rules, for NT6, it's assigned to t91, and NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. Now, NT24 \u2192 t123, and NT45 \u2192 t115. So, NT103 becomes t123 t115. So, NT99 becomes t91 t123 t115.\n\nSimilarly, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1 \u2192 NT44 \u2192 t11, and NT1 \u2192 t169. So NT89 would become t11 t169.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT99 NT89 \u2192 (t91 t23 t94 t14) (t77 t147 t41)? Wait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should refer back to the substitution rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, each non-terminal is mapped to several terminals:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, each production leads to a specific terminal or another non-terminal, but in the end, all non-terminals terminate into specific terminals. So, for example:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 t108? Or... Hmm, no, NT6 is t91, and NT103 is t103. Wait, no, in the substitution rules, each non-terminal is given a direct production. For example, NT6 \u2192 t108, NT103 \u2192 t123, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look through the substitution list to see each non-terminal's output.\n\nLooking through the substitution rules, let me build a map from each non-terminal to its terminals:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t91 (from production NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 t108 (wait, no, NT103 is actually: NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45 \u2192 t123 t115. So NT99 \u2192 t91 t123 t115.\n\nWait, actually, each production rule is either a pair producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for NT99, the rule is NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, which then would expand further. But in the provided substitution rules, each non-terminal either maps directly to a terminal string or keeps splitting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution rules are each non-terminal replacing into a fixed string. Let me list them:\n\nLooking through the given substitution rules:\n\nNT99 \u2192 t6, t103\nNT89 \u2192 t44, t1\nNT91 \u2192 t6, t17\nNT100 \u2192 t127\nNT108 \u2192 t118\nNT65 \u2192 t157\nNT17 \u2192 t24\nNT35 \u2192 t68, t103\nNT106 \u2192 t35, t107\nNT39 \u2192 t23, t16\nNT77 \u2192 t95, t65\nNT70 \u2192 t102, t92\nNT68 \u2192 t28, t12\nNT73 \u2192 t15, t29\nNT42 \u2192 t165\n... and many others.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should make a list where each non-terminal (NT) is associated with a string of terminals (including other NTs, which will be expanded further). Alternatively, perhaps each non-terminal eventually resolves to a specific terminal string, and I just need to map each NT to the terminal string it represents.\n\nBut that's time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity, another approach is to see if each part of the string corresponds to a valid path in the grammar.\n\nGiven the string:\n\nt129 t121 t124 t69 t127 t24 t123 t124 t13 t133 t121 t118 t134 t169 t23 t98 t157 t124 t22 t11 t141 t63 t76 t98 t93 t102 t115 t24 t129 t91 t141 t164 t127 t102 t177 t22 t104 t41 t157 t65 t73 t154\n\nI notice it's quite long. Let me start by looking at the beginning and see if they can be generated by NT99 and NT89.\n\nStarting with NT99:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 t91 t103.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t129, t121, t124. Hmm, t129 is produced by NT52 \u2192 t129 (from NT52 \u2192 t129). So how can t129 appear here?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nEach symbol in the string is a terminal, so we can think of the string as a sequence of NT replacements. Let's split the string into parts that correspond to the possible replacement sequences.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t129 t121 t124.\n\nLooking at substitution rules:\n\nt129 is NT23 \u2192 t156 (but in the rules, NT23 \u2192 t40? Wait, no, looking back through the substitution rules:\n\nWait, the substitution rules are all these lines that look like \"NT123 \u2192 ...\" which I need to map correctly.\n\nLooking through the substitution rules:\n\nFor example, NT12 \u2192 t91.\n\nWait, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-912","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is big, and the string is quite long, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. The provided grammar seems to fit CNF because each production either has non-terminals on both sides or a single terminal, and the start symbol S doesn't appear on the right side of any production.\n\nThe string given is \"t115 t69 t154 t93 t144 t133 t165 t123 t24 t73 t170 t171 t54 t56 t102 t133 t146 t110 t91 t67 t71 t48 t80 t167 t105 t67 t110 t129 t99 t41 t80 t69 t9 t178 t51 t102 t26 t2 t8 t21 t110 t112 t98 t23 t49 t91 t72 t139\". Each token here seems to be a terminal symbol, as they all start with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe plan is to try to parse this string from left to right, expanding non-terminals according to the grammar's rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should consume exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but I need to be careful because CNF can have productions with two non-terminals, so each step might process two symbols at a time. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each step can either produce two non-terminals (which will each need to be expanded further) or one terminal.\n\nBut given the string consists of a sequence of terminals, I think each step will consume one terminal at a time. No, wait, that's not right. Because in CNF, each production only has one or two symbols on the right. So the parse would proceed by expanding any non-terminals as per the rules. Since the string is being read from left to right, each non-terminal production would expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, I might be mixing up how the string is processed. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when parsing, starting with the start symbol S, each step would produce two non-terminals, which in turn need to be parsed. However, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I think the parse is going to involve looking for each terminal and seeing if it matches the right-hand side of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about how to approach this systematically.\n\nI need to check whether the string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a right-deriving parser. Each production either generates a terminal or two terminals (if a production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, they would each need to be processed).\n\nAlternatively, if a production is A \u2192 a terminal, then that terminal is matched directly. So the process would involve starting with S, expanding it into non-terminals, and then each of those non-terminals would either expand into two non-terminals or consume a terminal if they have a production to a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, the input string is entirely terminals, which suggests that all non-terminals in the grammar must eventually derive terminals. So, I think I can model this as a tree where each non-terminal is expanded into its production, and each production's right-hand side must match the string's symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be derived by the grammar. Since each production can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals, I can try to parse the string by checking possible splits at each step.\n\nBut parsing this manually with such a long string is going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for certain patterns or check the start symbol expansions.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Therefore, the string must start with whatever NT99 produces and then whatever NT89 produces.\n\nLooking at NT99: in the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 and NT103. Hmm. NT6 \u2192 't108' according to the provided rules, which is a terminal, and NT103 \u2192 't101'.\n\nSo NT99 would produce 't108' and 't101', so the first two symbols should be 't108 t101'.\n\nLooking at the given string: the first two symbols are 't115 t69'. That doesn't match 't108 t101', so if the first two symbols don't align with that, then S's expansion doesn't match. So does that mean the string isn't generated by the grammar? Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string should begin with NT99 productions followed by NT89. So, the first part would be what NT99 produces, which is 't108 t101', followed by what NT89 produces.\n\nLooking up NT89: NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88. NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65. NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, looking up NT89's productions. Wait, from the provided grammar, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1, and NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88, NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75, but wait, from the grammar data above, I see that some non-terminals have multiple productions.\n\nBut maybe it's better to look for each non-terminal and their possible terminal symbols.\n\nLooking up each NT's possible terminal productions:\n\nLooking for NT99: in the grammar, NT99 appears as:\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103\n\nIs there any rule where NT99 is on the right-hand side? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT99 is on the RHS, e.g., NT106 \u2192 ... but no, NT99 itself is only on the RHS.\n\nSo NT99's only production is NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So NT99 must be expanded into NT6 followed by NT103, which are then expanded further.\n\nNT6 is in the RHS, and its production is NT6 \u2192 't108'. So that's a terminal.\n\nNT103's production is NT103 \u2192 't101', which is a terminal. So NT99 produces two terminals: 't108 t101'.\n\nSimilarly, NT89:\n\nLooking at NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88.\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, I don't see NT44 having a terminal in its production. Wait, no, the key lines are:\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT45 NT71, NT69 \u2192 NT133, etc., but NT89's production leads into NT44 and NT1, which might have terminal outputs.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me list all the non-terminals that have terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar data, the lines that have 't' followed by numbers are:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't1', 't90'\nWait, no:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, a lot of lines have 't' followed by numbers as terminal productions.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't108'\n- NT103 \u2192 't101'\n- NT15 \u2192 't21', 't90'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT49 \u2192 't11', 't1'\nWait, no, looking again, the last lines include:\n\n- NT108 \u2192 't118'\n- NT100 \u2192 't127'\n- NT69 (twice?) I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, I should go through the provided rules methodically.\n\nLooking at each production line, when a non-terminal is on the left, and on the right is a terminal, that's how we know what terminal that non-terminal produces. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57 \u2192 ... but that doesn't produce a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-932","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So the string starts with two non-terminals, meaning the first symbol of the string should be part of a production of NT99 or NT89. The string starts with 't121', so I need to see if that can be derived from either NT99 or NT89.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT99 and NT89. \n\nNT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76\nNT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\nWait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking for NT99:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see:\n\nNT99 -> NT61 NT76 (line 106?)\n\nWait, let me scan all the lines for NT99.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLine 106: NT96 \u2192 NT61 NT93\nLine 109: NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18\nLine 116: NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71\nLine 117: NT96 \u2192 NT106 NT73\nWait, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Wait, perhaps NT99 is not directly a start symbol. Wait, the start is S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo the initial string should start with two non-terminals, either NT99 and NT89.\n\nNow, the string given is: `t121 t158 t60 t48 t51 t170 t34 t21 t154 t127 t99 t97 t24 t164 t26 t145 t69 t171 t45 t123 t100 t99 t172 t56 t72 t172 t56 t23 t123 t105 t49 t9 t90 t93 t130 t73 t172 t90 t115 t22 t156 t76 t133 t108 t101 t69 t151 t23 t177`\n\nWait, the string starts with 't121', which is a terminal. So the first part of the string is a terminal. But the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so the string should start with two non-terminals. However, the string given starts with a terminal. That suggests that the string is not possible because the initial production is two non-terminals. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Perhaps the NT symbols can derive into strings that include terminals and non-terminals. So perhaps each NT eventually has to produce a terminal. But the initial production for S is NT99 NT89, so the first two symbols should be from NT99 and NT89 productions.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the first step is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the next string symbols must come from NT99 and NT89. If the string starts with a terminal, then that's not possible because NT99 and NT89 produce non-terminals. Therefore, the first two symbols must come from the NT99 and NT89 productions, meaning each of them must expand into a sequence that starts with a terminal. But in our case, the string starts with 't121', so perhaps the first non-terminal (NT99) produces 't121', but let me check if NT99 can derive into 't121' and NT89 can derive into something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead look for the string in the grammar expansion. Each terminal in the string must correspond to a direct production. Let me see if any non-terminal's production starts with 't121'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT6 \u2192 't108', NT9 \u2192 't169', NT7 \u2192 't22', etc. Wait, none of the productions directly produce 't121'. Wait, let me check all the direct productions to see if any non-terminal directly goes to 't121':\n\nLooking through all the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't123', NT106 \u2192 'nt93', wait no. Let's check each non-terminal:\n\nLooking for NT that directly go to 't121' in their productions.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT:\n...\nNT69 \u2192 't121' (Yes, line: NT69 \u2192 't121'.)\n\nSo NT69 directly produces 't121'. That's one way to get 't121'.\n\nSimilarly, another way could be through a longer chain.\n\nBut let's see. If the string starts with 't121', then the first non-terminal must be NT69.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is 't121', which can only be produced by NT69.\n\nSo the first part of the string is:\n\nt121 t158 t60 t48 t51 t170 t34 t21 t154 t127 t99 t97 t24 t164 t26 t145 t69 t171 t45 t123 t100 t99 t172 t56 t72 t172 t56 t23 t123 t105 t49 t9 t90 t93 t130 t73 t172 t90 t115 t22 t156 t76 t133 t108 t101 t69 t151 t23 t177.\n\nBut since NT69 produces 't121', the next symbols must come from the expansion of NT69 and NT89.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the initial string after S is NT99 and NT89. So the first symbol is from NT99, then the second from NT89.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Since S is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the string must be a combination of derivations from NT99 and NT89, concatenated together. So the entire string is the result of NT99 expanded into a string, followed by NT89 expanded into a string. Therefore, the entire string is the concatenation of the two expansions.\n\nBut the string starts with 't121', which would correspond to the first part of NT99's expansion. Then, after NT99's part, the rest should be NT89's expansion.\n\nLet me try to parse the string in this way.\n\nThe first symbol is 't121', which is the expansion of NT69. So perhaps NT99 must expand into something that starts with 't121'.\n\nLooking at NT99's productions, line 106: NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So NT99 can go to NT61 NT76.\n\nThen NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71 (line 116). NT19 \u2192 NT99 NT17 (line 22). Wait, that can't be right because NT19 is 't99'? Wait, no. Let me check the productions for NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT99 NT17 (line 21). Hmm, that seems circular. Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, line 21: NT19 \u2192 't99' (Wait no, line 21 is NT19 \u2192 't99'? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-937","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Let me look through the grammar rules to see how the non-terminals and terminals are connected.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the rules have the form NTnn \u2192 NTmm NTmk, where nn, mm, mk are numbers. These seem to be non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals. There are also some rules where a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal followed by either a space or another number. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, but some directly expand into terminals with numbers like NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35 or NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31.\n\nThen there are some rules where NTn \u2192 'tX', where X is a two-digit number. These seem to be the terminal symbols in the string. So each terminal in the target string is represented by one of these 't' productions.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t110 t139 t47 t60 t134 t65 t102 t65 t178 t172 t104 t0 t110 t172 t69 t36 t130 t139 t139 t151 t159 t121 t97 t99 t141 t71 t123 t172 t72 t108 t159 t71 t141 t133 t1 t171 t67 t127 t171 t11 t94 t96 t169 t177`.\n\nFirst, I should parse this string into individual symbols. Each 't' followed by two digits is a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of these terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will have a binary structure. Each non-terminal will split into two non-terminals (or a non-terminal and a terminal). But wait, some rules directly produce terminals with numbers, so those terminals can be part of the string directly.\n\nSo, to start, I need to ensure that each symbol in the string is either a terminal produced directly by the grammar or can be broken down into a sequence that aligns with the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the terminals in the string to see which ones are present:\n\nt110, t139, t47, t60, t134, t65, t102, t65, t178, t172, t104, t0, t110, t172, t69, t36, t130, t139x3, t151, t159x2, t121, t97, t99, t141x2, t71x3, t123, t172x2, t72x3, t108, t159x2, t71x2, t141x2, t133, t1, t171x2, t67, t127, t171x2, t11, t94, t96, t169, t177.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of these are directly produced by non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT60 \u2192 (Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT60 directly, but maybe it's part of a production)\nWait, maybe it's better to look for each terminal and see if it's produced by any rule.\n\nSome rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nNT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\nNT107 \u2192 NT94\nNT57 \u2192 NT94 NT1\nNT91 \u2192 NT71\nNT71 \u2192 NT50 or NT93\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to map each terminal to the non-terminal that produces it. For example, if 't102' is a terminal, does any NTn \u2192 't102' exist? Looking through the grammar, I see NT96 \u2192 NT105 and NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT45. But wait, are there any rules that directly produce 't102'? Hmm, no direct rule seems to produce t102 directly; it's part of the string, so perhaps the string isn't generated by the grammar because none of the non-terminals directly produce t102. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NTn \u2192 't102'. So if the string contains 't102', and the grammar doesn't have a production that produces 't102' directly, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Scanning all the rules:\n\nNT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\nNT45 \u2192 t98\nNT105 \u2192 NT24 NT45\nNT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\nSo, no, 't102' is not present as a terminal on any rule's right-hand side. So if the string has 't102', it can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-959","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to check whether it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The grammar is given as a series of production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols like 't1', 't123', etc. \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The productions given here look like they fit CNF because each right-hand side has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe string to check is: `t1 t123 t50 t144 t124 t65 t115 t21 t156 t158 t110 t13 t80 t154 t60 t71 t54 t145 t154 t9 t158 t60 t22 t172 t130 t146 t146 t50 t141 t162 t63 t169 t26 t97 t177 t104 t146 t165 t45 t141 t17 t54 t123 t121 t118 t97 t118 t145 t105 t129`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a good candidate for a parser that uses either the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent approach, but given the size of the string, maybe there's a pattern or a way to track the non-terminals and terminals through the productions.\n\nBut wait, each production in CNF is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a terminal. The string is all terminals (they all start with 't'), so the starting symbol S must expand directly into terminals through a series of productions. \n\nLet's start by looking at the grammar rules. The starting symbol is S, which according to the first rule: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S must be expanded into two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89, each of which should then expand into terminals or non-terminals as per their productions.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a single string of terminals. So perhaps each of these non-terminals (NT99, NT89) and their descendants should eventually produce the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as building a parse tree where each step uses the productions. Since the string is quite long, maybe it's easier to see if the terminals in the string match the patterns in the productions.\n\nBut another thought: maybe the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the rhs of the productions. Since in CNF, each production is a chain of terminals and non-terminals, so the string should be a series of these rhs.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is that each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the entire string is in terminals, the derivation must terminate when all non-terminals in the string have been replaced by terminals via their productions.\n\nBut the string given is a linear sequence of terminals, which doesn't match the structure of productions, which have two non-terminals per production except for the terminals.\n\nWait, no. That's not right because in each step of the derivation, a single non-terminal is replaced, so the string grows, not shrinks. But in this case, the string given is already a sequence of terminals, so it implies that every non-terminal has been expanded into terminals.\n\nBut that might not make sense because to get to terminals, every step must terminate, so perhaps the string corresponds exactly to what can be generated by expanding S.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, maybe each step can be traced through the string to see if each non-terminal in the string corresponds to a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' in the string is a terminal, and each part is generated by a production. But wait, the string is a sequence of t-something, which suggests that each t is a symbol. So perhaps each t like 't1' corresponds to a single terminal symbol 1, 't123' corresponds to 123, and so on.\n\nWait, the way the production rules are written, for example, NT96 \u2192 NT105 NT109, which would mean NT96 becomes two non-terminals, which would each need to be produced further until we get to a terminal production.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, some have more than one terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, every production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (a terminal). So all terminals in the string must result from a production that directly matches a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each 't...' must have been produced by a rule of the form NTxxx \u2192 a, where a is a terminal like t1, t2, etc.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the given productions, I can see that each production either is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 a, where 'a' is a terminal like t1, t123, etc.\n\nSo each terminal 't...' in the string must be exactly matched by such a rule.\n\nNow, to check if the entire string can be generated, each 't...' must belong to the terminal productions of some NT.\n\nThus, for each 'tN' in the string, there must exist a production NTN \u2192 tN.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I should check if every 't' in the string is matched by a terminal production for some NT.\n\nLet me go through each 't' in the string and see if each is present in the productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt1, t123, t50, t144, t124, t65, t115, t21, t156, t158, t110, t13, t80, t154, t60, t71, t54, t145, t154, t9, t158, t60, t22, t172, t130, t146, t146, t50, t141, t162, t63, t169, t26, t97, t177, t104, t146, t165, t45, t141, t17, t54, t123, t121, t118, t97, t118, t145, t105, t129.\n\nNow, look at the productions and see which of these are terminal productions.\n\nFor example, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 't134', NT7 \u2192 't151', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, several NTs directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 'txxx' productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't134' (from production: NT9 \u2192 t134)\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT7 \u2192 't151'\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT3 \u2192 't133'\n- NT5 \u2192 't108'\n- NT6 \u2192 't91'\n- NT11 \u2192 't17'\n- NT19 \u2192 't99'\n- NT35 \u2192 't43'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156' (Yes, NT29 \u2192 t156)\n- NT89 \u2192 't61'\n- NT33 \u2192 't23'\n- NT53 \u2192 't107' (Not in the given, but in the production NT53 is present?)\nWait, in the given productions, I see NT29 \u2192 t156, among others.\n\nSo let's check each 't' in the string to see if they are covered by any terminal production.\n\nt1:\nLooking through the terminals, I don't see any NT production that directly produces t1.

Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I should remember that Chomsky normal form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, most of the rules seem to fit the form, like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which is a start symbol producing two non-terminals. But I noticed a few that have numbers, like NT15 -> NT75 NT57\u2014wait, these are non-terminals, so all the rules are in CNF because each rule has either a single terminal or two non-terminals, except for the ones with three symbols? Wait, no\u2014it's not three, because in the given grammar, all rules are two symbols except for some with three? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no\u2014Looking again, most rules are two symbols. For example, NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31, which is two non-terminals. But I remember that a key feature of CNF is that every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So if there's a production with more than two symbols on the right side, that's not CNF. But looking through the provided grammar, I don't see any rules that have something like ABC\u2014I think they're all either single terminals or two non-terminals. So the grammar seems to be in Chomsky normal form, but I'm a bit confused because the problem statement says one of the non-terminals is NT107, but in the grammar, NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT71, which seems redundant because it has the same non-terminal on both sides. That might be something to note, but perhaps it's a typo or part of the way the grammar is structured.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t26 t48 t80 t105 t124 t144 t80 t151 t158 t108 t36 t2 t50 t56 t49 t67 t49 t24 t98 t102 t65 t167 t23 t8 t67 t165 t141 t71 t22 t94 t101 t98 t91 t97 t67 t165 t112 t134 t93 t76 t105 t97 t118 t102 t158 t22 t63 t146 t21 t47`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The idea is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by the productions until we derive the entire string. However, with such a long string, this would take a lot of steps manually. Maybe a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string corresponds to the rules provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Then, each of those NTs can produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nThe first step is to check what NT99 and NT89 can lead to. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\nSo, S starts with NT99 NT89 \u2192 (NT6 NT103) (NT61 NT76). That gives us four NTs to expand further.\n\nEach of these NTs then needs to be expanded. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT35 NT43, according to the grammar. Similarly, NT103 is another NT that produces other NTs or terminals.\n\nI see that some of the NTs produce terminals, while others produce non-terminals. For example, NT92 can produce a terminal 't26' and NT94 can produce a terminal 't174'. Wait, no, looking back, in the provided grammar, the rule NT92 \u2192 t174? Or is it something else? Wait, in the grammar, most of the rules are like NT92 \u2192 NT77 NT49, but some like NT107 produce tertinals. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see:\n\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nNT107 \u2192 NT94 NT1\nNT94 \u2192 NT49 NT115\nAnd so on. So some NTs produce two NTs, others produce a terminal and an NT.\n\nSo, the process would involve expanding each NT step by step until all are terminals or we reach a dead end.\n\nLet me take the string and see what each terminal corresponds to.\n\nThe string starts with t26. Looking for which NT can produce t26.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT71 \u2192 t67, but that's not it. Wait, let's scan through all the rules to see which NTs produce t26.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t24\nBut that's not it. Wait, let me check all the rules carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t95 and t65\n- NT24 \u2192 t12\n- NT72 \u2192 t72?\nWait, looking back, I think I remember that some rules directly map to terminals, like:\n\nNT96 \u2192 t91\nNT106 \u2192 t127\nNT108 \u2192 t118\nNT6 \u2192 t108 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see NT6 producing a terminal. Let me check the given rules carefully.)\n\nLooking through the grammar list, most of the production rules are for NTs \u2192 NT and NT, but a few have terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT94 is not a terminal; looking for any NTs that produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t108? Let me check:\n\nIn the rules, looking for something like NTx \u2192 'tX'. Looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t24\n\nYes, NT68 can produce t24.\n\nSimilarly, NT76 \u2192 t178? Wait, NT77 \u2192 t95 but 't71' is another rule. Wait, maybe I'm mixing them up.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for which NTs lead to the terminals in the string. The string starts with t26, which is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t24 (Wait, it says NT17 \u2192 t21 nt99 and nt21. Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar rule list is long, but looking for NT \u2192 't...'.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 t84?\nWait, looking through the rules, here's what I see:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't...':\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t167\n- NT39 \u2192 t144\n- NT89 \u2192 t61 nt76\n- NT77 \u2192 t95 nt65\n- NT46 \u2192 t99 nt99\n- NT68 \u2192 t24 nt12\n- NT106 \u2192 t35 nt107\n- NT15 \u2192 t95 nt75\n- NT65 \u2192 t157 nt71\nWait, maybe I'm missing one.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's structured with a series of productions. Each non-terminal symbol on the left produces two other non-terminals on the right. Some of these are terminals (like 't24', 't17', etc.), which likely represent the actual tokens in the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89.

{"custom_id":"request-21","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t91 t101 t60` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, the grammar looks quite complex, with lots of non-terminals and productions. I'll start by trying to understand the structure of the grammar and the target string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of three tokens: `t91`, `t101`, and `t60`. Each of these seems to correspond to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. My goal is to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with `S -> NT99 NT89`. So, S produces two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Therefore, the string we're trying to generate must correspond to the concatenation of these two non-terminals. Wait, but our string is three tokens, so perhaps each NT99 and NT89 breaks down further.\n\nLet me check the definitions of NT99 and NT89. \n\nNT99 has a production `NT99 -> NT6 NT103`. So, NT99 produces NT6 and NT103. Then, I need to see what NT6 and NT103 produce.\n\nLooking at NT6, the productions are:\n- NT6 -> NT45 NT71\n- NT6 also has multiple entries, but I think the Chomsky normal form would pick one. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is split into two non-terminals, so I think only the relevant one is considered. Looking again, NT6 has `NT6 -> NT45 NT71` and others, but the correct one would be `NT6 -> NT45 NT71` since that's a direct production.\n\nSimilarly, NT103 is defined as `NT103 -> NT129 NT107`. So, NT103 breaks down into NT129 and NT107.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me actually try to track this step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, NT99 is `NT99 -> NT6 NT103`. So, S becomes NT6 NT103 NT89.\n\nNow, each of these needs to be broken down further. But from the string we have, it's `t91 t101 t60`. So, maybe the NT99 and NT89 each produce two non-terminals, making a total of four, but the string is three. Hmm, perhaps one of them produces two non-terminals that then produce something?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me try to expand S -> NT99 NT89 into their respective parts. Suppose NT103 is `NT103 -> ...`, but looking at the grammar, NT103 seems to have a production `NT103 -> NT101 NT65`. So, perhaps NT103 can become `t101 t53`, but wait, no, because in the right-hand side of the productions, some are strings (like `t's)` and others are non-terminals.\n\nWait a minute, in the given grammar, some productions end with '=' and a string. For example:\n\nNT52 -> NT107 NT81\nNT96 -> NT33 NT36\nAnd so on, but then I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't134'\nNT16 -> 't93'\nAnd several others like NT29 -> 't156', etc.\n\nSo, some of these non-terminals, when derived, produce a terminal string. So, when a non-terminal appears in a production and has an entry like -> 't...', it means that this non-terminal can produce that terminal directly.\n\nTherefore, the process is to derive the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with their productions until we get terminals.\n\nSo, let's approach this systematically.\n\nStarting with S, which is the start symbol. S can produce NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo, the string generated from S is NT99 NT89.\n\nNow, to generate the string `t91 t101 t60`, we need to see if NT99 and NT89 can expand to these terminals.\n\nLooking at NT99 first: its production is NT6 and NT103. So, NT99 -> NT6 NT103.\n\nThen, NT6 can produce NT45 and NT71. NT103 can produce NT129 and NT107, but wait, looking into the grammar, NT103 is defined as:\n\nLooking back, NT103 is indeed NT103 -> NT129 NT107.\n\nThen, NT129 and NT107 would each break down further. Wait, but none of these directly produce terminals. Looking into the given productions for NT129 and NT107:\n\nNT129 is only present in one production: `NT129 -> NT52 NT75`. And NT107 is in several productions, like `NT107 -> NT65 NT107` and others, but perhaps I'm missing the correct one.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe it's better to build a parse tree from the start symbol and see if we can reach the string `t91 t101 t60`.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to reverse the process: see if the string can be derived by looking at each token and seeing how they can be generated.\n\nSo, the string is `t91`, `t101`, `t60`. Let's check each token.\n\nFirst, `t91` is present in the grammar as a terminal. Looking at the productions, `NT48 -> 't11'`, `NT42 -> 't165'`, etc. Wait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't56', NT40 -> 't21', NT17 -> 't22', NT45 -> 't98', NT22 -> 't112'? Wait, no, looking into the productions, I don't see a production that directly yields 't91'.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT91 -> 't169' (I think not, let's check)\n- Wait, no, looking through all the productions, I see:\n\nWait, under the grammar, I see NT77 is replaced with t56, NT40 with t21, NT17 with t22, NT45 with t98, NT22 is not a terminal, but perhaps NT67 is a terminal? Wait, no, in the list, I see NT67 -> ... but no terminal listed.\n\nWait, let's check all the productions for non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT52 ->... but no terminal.\n- NT96 ->... 't11', so NT96 is one that can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all productions:\n\nNT19 -> 't99' (so yes, NT19 can produce 't99')\nNT16 -> 't93'\nNT29 -> 't156' and 't15' (but wait, NT29 has two productions: `NT29 -> NT156`, and another? No, let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT29 -> NT156\n- Wait, no, in the grammar, the lines under NT29 are:\n\n\"NT29 -> NT129 NT156\". Wait, no, looking more carefully, under NT29, it's:\n\n\"NT29 -> 't156' NT156'\"? No, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, for example:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine: `NT29 -> 't156' NT29?` No, let's look at the actual grammar entries.\n\nThe given grammar has:\n\n- NT52 -> NT75 NT71\n- NT52 -> NT106 NT52 (this is a loop)\nWait, perhaps I should parse each production correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a list of all non-terminals that directly produce terminals. Let's go through the productions:\n\nLooking for any '->' with an equal sign and a string of terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't151' (line: `NT7 -> 't151'`)\n- NT2 -> 't26' (line: `NT2 -> 't26'`)\n- NT16 -> 't93' (line: `NT16 -> 't93'`)\n- NT1 -> 't107' 't17' (line: `NT1 -> 't107' 't17'` I think)\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-43","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t91 t101 t97 t50 t121` is generated by the given context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the grammar produces two non-terminals, and the string is a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if there's a way to derive the string using the productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts: t91, t101, t97, t50, t121. Each of these is a terminal symbol. I'll need to see how each of these could be generated from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So each branch of this productions should eventually generate a substring. \n\nLooking at NT99: The productions for NT99 may or may not exist, but I see at the end of the grammar there's NT99 \u2192 't6'. Wait, no, looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT99. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under the non-terminals, I see NT99 is not present, but NT99 is a start symbol? No, S is the start symbol. So, perhaps NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. Let me check if NT99 and NT89 have productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT99 has a production: NT99 \u2192 't6', which directly gives a terminal t6? Wait, but the string has t91, not t6, so maybe that's not the way. Similarly, NT97 is present with NT97 \u2192 't151'. Hmm, but the string has t97, which is the terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. The grammar's non-terminals NT have productions that sometimes produce terminals. For example, looking at NT96, there's a production NT96 \u2192 't109', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT91 \u2192 't9'. So the string has t91, t101, etc.\n\nBut to get the string, let's think about the tree structure. The top-level string is generated by S, which splits into NT99 and NT89. Each of these needs to generate a terminal sequence that, when combined, forms the given string.\n\nBut looking at the string `t91 t101 t97 t50 t121`, it's a sequence of five terminals. So S must produce two sequences that, when combined, total five terminals. That would require each side producing multiple tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and each of NT99 and NT89 expand into sequences of terminals. So for example, NT99 could produce three terminals, and NT89 could produce two, totaling five. \n\nBut looking through the grammar, it's possible that NT99 and NT89 have productions that generate multiple terminals. Let's see:\n\nFor instance, considering NT91: The grammar has NT91 \u2192 't151', which is one terminal. So NT91 can't produce a sequence longer than one. Similarly, NT97 \u2192 't99' (no, wait, looking at the list, I see NT97 isn't present. Wait, the grammar's non-terminals: I might be misreading. Let me check again.\n\nActually, looking through the list of productions, I see some non-terminals like NT106, NT35, NT7, etc., but many are absent. For example, NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65. So NT84 can produce a sequence of two terminals, which when expanded, could give us multiple tokens.\n\nWait, but in our string, each part is a single terminal. So perhaps each NT in the decomposition must correspond to a single terminal, except for those that can expand into multiple.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is t91, t101, t97, t50, t121.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the first token in the string is t91. That would correspond to NT99. So NT99 must produce t91, but looking at the grammar, NT99 isn't defined. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT definitions. Let me see if any NT in the grammar can produce t91.\n\nWait, in the list provided, under NT definitions, I see NT91 \u2192 't151'. So perhaps NT91 can produce 't151', not t91. Hmm, that's confusing because the string has t91. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are defined with their productions. For example, NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70, which means it produces two non-terminals, which can be further expanded. \n\nBut the terminals are specific symbols, like 't91', 't23', etc. So for example, NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103. If NT68 is a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal like 't134' (from NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, and then NT45 \u2192 't98', etc.), then perhaps each non-terminal can be broken down.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to list out each terminal in the string and find a path through the grammar that produces each terminal.\n\nThe string is: t91, t101, t97, t50, t121.\n\nLet's list each terminal and see if they can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nt91: Looking at the grammar, NT91 \u2192 't151', so perhaps t91 is derived from NT91 \u2192 't151' but that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding, perhaps NT91 can produce t91. But in the given grammar, I don't see NT91 having a production that includes t91. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I missed the productions for some NTs. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list, under NT definitions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't171' (terminals are 't' followed by numbers)\nNT23 \u2192 't156' or 't172' or other NTs\nNT29 \u2192 't156' or 't129' or NTs\nNT43 \u2192 't2'\nNT48 \u2192 't11' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce 't91'. From the list, NT91 \u2192 't151', which is the only production. So NT91 can only produce 't151', so it can't generate 't91'. Therefore, unless another non-terminal can produce 't91', it's a problem. Wait, but in the list, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking again, under NT7's production: NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9. Both NT21 and NT9 are non-terminals. So NT7 produces two non-terminals, which would have to generate the t-values. But I don't see an NT that produces t91. Let me check all NTs for any that can produce t91.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't1' (from NT69 \u2192 NT1 't1')\n- NT121 \u2192 't69' (since NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT35, but I might be mixing up)\nWait, looking at the list, I see NT69 \u2192 't67' (from NT67 \u2192 't67')? Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, looking at the list, some NTs have terminals as their base productions. For example:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT35\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\nWait, perhaps these are not the base. Maybe the base NTs are those that produce a single terminal. For example:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 nt where nt is a single character like 't91'.\n\nFrom the list, I don't see any NT with a production that ends in a single terminal other than 't's that are products of other NTs. So perhaps all the NTs eventually generate sequences of 't's, which are the leaves.\n\nBut in the string, we have t91, which would need to come from a non-terminal that can produce t91, but in the given grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t91.

{"custom_id":"request-48","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t91 t101 t97 t50 t45\". \n\nFirst, let me recall that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Each production's right-hand side has exactly two symbols. Since this grammar is already in CNF, each production has one non-terminal or start symbol on the left, and two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals) on the right.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's quite extensive with multiple non-terminals. Each production seems to connect various non-terminals, building up to terminal symbols. My task is to trace the grammar's steps to see if the given string can be generated.\n\nThe given string is \"t91 t101 t97 t50 t45\". Each of these is a terminal symbol. So, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet's break down the string into each symbol: t91, t101, t97, t50, t45.\n\nI think I should start from the start symbol S and see how it can derive sequences that eventually produce these terminals. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, S must be broken down into two parts, each of which needs to generate a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT99 and NT89, I need to see what these non-terminals can produce. From the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Similarly, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. Let me explore these.\n\nFirst, NT99: It breaks down into NT6 and NT103. Now, NT6 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t108. Wait, but in the grammar above, I see that NT6 \u2192 't108' is commented out, but elsewhere like NT68 \u2192 t45 appears. Wait, maybe I need to check all productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have multiple productions. For example, NT68 has NT68 \u2192 t45 and also in other productions, NT68 appears on the left side. Let me check each non-terminal step by step.\n\nStarting with NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 \u2192 't68'? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 t45, but also NT6 is supposed to be derived from... Wait, no, NT6 is not in the grammar as a terminal. Looking back, I see that in the grammar, NT6 is on the left side, but looking at the productions, I don't see any direct terminal productions for NT6. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t45\nNT67 \u2192 t67\nSo, NT67 is a non-terminal that produces t67 as a terminal, but NT68 produces 45.\n\nWait, but the string includes t91, t101, etc. Let me check each production step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a parse tree for the given string and see if the root is S and each step aligns with the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is five terminals: t91, t101, t97, t50, t45.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So, the length of the string should be compatible. Starting from S, we have two non-terminals, each can produce another two non-terminals, building up until we reach the terminals. For a string of length n, the derivation should have n-1 splits. \n\nThe string has 5 terminals, so the derivation tree would have 5 leaves. The number of internal nodes would be 4, leading from S down. Each non-terminal splits into two until we get to the terminals.\n\nSo, let's attempt to parse the string step by step. Let's denote the string as [t91, t101, t97, t50, t45].\n\nLet's try to find the possible splits.\n\nWe can consider the string as t91 followed by t101, t97, t50, t45. Wait, but that's 5 terminals. So the parse tree would have to break it down into two non-terminals for each step until we reach single terminals.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, S must derive into two parts: one part that generates [t91, t101, t97] and another part that generates [t50, t45]. Alternatively, any other split as long as both halves can produce the respective parts. But more accurately, each part must produce a substring, and together they make the full string.\n\nSo, perhaps NT99 produces the first part and NT89 the second part.\n\nLooking at NT99's productions, we have NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So, NT99 is split into two, each generating a segment. Similarly, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1.\n\nSo, if we proceed, let's see:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n\nNT6 is a non-terminal, and NT103 is another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: Wait, I don't see a production where NT6 \u2192 a terminal, because in the grammar, NT6 is defined as NT55 \u2192 NT23 NT57, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT6 appears on the right side with a terminal, except for something like NT6 \u2192 t something? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\nNT68 \u2192 t45\nNT67 \u2192 t67\nBut I don't see NT6 on the right of any production with a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the initial grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions. Let me go through it systematically.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT52 NT107\nNT107 \u2192 NT65 NT71\nNT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nNT6 \u2192 ... Is there a production for NT6?\n\nLooking through all productions, I don't see NT6 on the right side with a terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 t45, but NT68 is a non-terminal. Wait, so perhaps NT68 is a terminal? Because it's being assigned to a terminal symbol 't45', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. NT68 is a non-terminal, but it's being assigned to the terminal 't45'. So, NT68 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal t45. So, when we see NT68 in the grammar, it can be replaced by 't45'.\n\nSimilarly, NT67 \u2192 t67. So, NT67 is also a terminal.\n\nSo, going back, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. What can NT6 and NT103 produce?\n\nLooking at NT6: I don't see a production where NT6 is on the left side with any terminals, so perhaps NT6 is a non-terminal that must be further expanded. But wait, that can't be, because in Chomsky Normal Form, every non-terminal on the left must have exactly two symbols on the right. However, looking through the grammar, some non-terminals (like NT67 and NT68) have a single terminal as their production, which would imply that they can produce that terminal in one step.\n\nWait, Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, a production like A \u2192 a is allowed, but for NT6, if there's no production where NT6 \u2192 a, then NT6 must be defined as some other non-terminals, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT6 on the right of a production, except in places like NT55 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me see: in the grammar, NT6 is not present on the right side of any production as a terminal. So, if there's a production where NT6 can produce a terminal, then the grammar is not in CNF. But since it isn't, then perhaps NT6 can only produce a terminal t6 or something else.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, the productions after NT6 are:\n\nNT67 \u2192 t67\nNT65 \u2192 t106\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t45\nNT67 \u2192 t67\nNT65 \u2192 t106\nWait, actually, no.

The string is `t91 t101 t97 t63 t165 t178`. The grammar is provided with all these production rules, and I have to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all the rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, so I need to see if S can produce the given string through these rules.\n\nLooking at the string `t91 t101 t97 t63 t165 t178`, I notice that each word is a terminal symbol. My task is to find a derivation path starting from S that leads to this sequence.\n\nI'll start from the beginning of the string and see which production rules can generate `t91` and how that connects to the next word.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals produce `t91` in their production rules. For example:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT63 NT17 (since one of the rules is NT91 -> NT63 NT17)\n- NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46 (another rule)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT16 (but this gives 't156', so that's not it)\nWait, let me look more carefully.\n\nLooking for NT91: I see NT91 \u2192 NT63 NT17 in the rules. So, to get 't91', that's from NT91 \u2192 NT63 NT17, which expands to 't63' and 't17'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is `t91`, which would come from NT91. So I need to see if S can derive NT91, and then have NT91 produce 't91', which is NT91 \u2192 NT63 NT17. But wait, NT63 is another non-terminal, so we'll have to expand that.\n\nWait, no, because 't63' is a terminal, so the expansion of NT63 must be 't63'. So let me check if NT63 produces 't63'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a direct rule where NT63 \u2192 't63'. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules for NT terms that might produce 't63'.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT94 NT... wait, no. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let's see: the rules are all for different non-terminals. Let me check rules for non-terminals that might produce 't63'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT15 NT2, which is terminals. So NT83 can produce 't15' and 't2', but that doesn't help here.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I realize that some non-terminals might produce multiple terminals. I need to find which non-terminals can directly produce 't63' or other parts of the string.\n\nLet me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking for 't63', is there any production rule that directly has 't63'? Yes, I see that in the rules:\n\n- NT6: NT68 NT43 \u2192 produces 't43' and NT68 \u2192 't145', but maybe that's not useful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should start from the beginning of the string and see if each step can be matched.\n\nSo, the first token is 't91'. As per the grammar, the only rule that gives 't91' is NT91. So, the derivation must start with S \u2192 NT91 NT99 (from the first rule).\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT91 NT99.\n\nNow, the first token is 't91', but the first part of the derivation is NT91. So, NT91 must expand to 't91', but looking at the grammar, NT91 only has one rule: NT91 \u2192 NT63 NT17. So 't91' as a terminal isn't directly produced by NT91.\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem. If the first token is 't91', and NT91 only has a rule that produces two non-terminals, then how can 't91' appear as the first symbol? It can't, because NT91 doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nThis suggests that 't91' can't be the first symbol unless it's produced by a non-terminal that has a direct terminal production. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nLooking again at the production rules, perhaps I missed a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't91'. Let me check each rule again:\n\nLooking for any production that directly gives 't91'. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46 (does this give 't46'? No, but NT46 isn't directly producing a terminal.)\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the steps are as follows:\n\nEach production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, to get a terminal symbol, a rule must directly produce it.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is 't91', which is a terminal. So, for the first part of the string 't91', it must come from a rule where a non-terminal A is directly expanded to 't91'.\n\nLooking at the production rules for each non-terminal, do any of them have a rule A \u2192 't91'?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT63 NT17 (so it doesn't produce 't91'; it produces two non-terminals)\n- NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46 (another two non-terminals)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT16 and 't156' or 't129' (so no direct 't91')\n- NT17 \u2192 't171' (so NT17 can produce a terminal; does it produce 't17'? I see NT17 \u2192 't22' in another rule?)\nWait, let me re-examine all the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't157'\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's look for each non-terminal's direct terminal productions.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking for any rule that is A \u2192 tX where tX is a terminal. Let's go through each production rule:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-62","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t108 t101 t123 t141 t94 t24` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. It seems pretty complex with many non-terminals and terminals. Each non-terminal on the left has exactly two symbols on the right, either two non-terminals or one terminal. My goal is to see if I can parse the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components: `t108`, `t101`, `t123`, `t141`, `t94`, `t24`. These are all terminals, so I need to check if they can be produced by the grammar. \n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\n- `t108`: I remember that in the grammar, NT108 is part of the productions. Specifically, looking at the productions, NT108 appears in a production where `NT108` is replaced by `NT6 NT65`. Wait, no, actually, `t108` is directly a production from NT108. So, NT108 can produce `t108`. So `t108` is valid.\n\n- `t101`: I check if there's a production for `t101`. Looking through the rules, yes, NT101 is `t101`. So that's valid.\n\n- `t123`: Checking for `t123`, it's produced by NT123. So that's valid.\n\n- `t141`: NT141 produces `t141`, so that's valid.\n\n- `t94`: NT94 produces `t94`, valid.\n\n- `t24`: NT24 produces `t24`, valid.\n\nSo each terminal in the string is accounted for by a non-terminal that can produce it. Now, I need to see if these terminals can appear in the correct order based on the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the derivation must have exactly n-1 steps for a string of length n. Here, the string has 6 terms, so the derivation should have 5 steps.\n\nEach step involves replacing the leftmost symbol (a non-terminal) with two symbols. But wait, actually, since the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation would involve expanding non-terminals until all internal symbols are replaced until you get the terminals.\n\nBut another approach is to look for a leftmost derivation or to see if there's a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be generated by the given grammar by checking if each terminal can be derived from the starting symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with S: `S -> NT99 NT99`. Then, each of these NT99s would need to derive a terminal, but wait, looking at the rules, NT99 is `t108` according to the given rules. Wait, no, according to the grammar provided, NT99 \u2192 t108? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT99: `NT99 -> t108`. So, yes, NT99 produces `t108`.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-read the grammar rules to be precise.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\n\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n\n- NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93\n\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92\n\n- NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT70 NT52\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT15 NT2\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT81 NT29\n\n- NT92 \u2192 NT52 NT99\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71\n\n- NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT80 NT42\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46\n\n- NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT35 NT43\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT93 NT80\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n\n- NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nAlright, so NT99 \u2192 t108. So, NT99 in S's production would give `t108 t108`? But our string starts with `t108 t101`. Hmm, that's a problem because S \u2192 NT99 NT99 would first produce `t108 t108`, which doesn't match the start of the string.\n\nWait, that's a critical observation. If S is S \u2192 NT99 NT99, then the first two symbols must both be derivations of NT99. But in the starting string, the first is `t108` and the second is `t101`. But NT99 can only produce `t108`, so the second symbol must also be `t108`. But in our case, the second symbol is `t101`, which is from NT101, not NT99. That suggests that S cannot derive this string because the first symbols can't be `t108` and `t101` unless there's a way to have NT99 and NT101 in the same derivation, which isn't possible because S only splits into two NT99s.\n\nWait, that seems like a dead end. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check: does NT99 produce `t108`? Looking back, yes, in the grammar, NT99 \u2192 t108.\n\nSo if the string starts with `t108` and `t101`, but NT99 can't produce `t101`, because NT99 only produces `t108`, then the second symbol in the string must come from NT99, which only gives `t108`. Thus, the second symbol can't be `t101`. Therefore, I'm starting to think the string is not possible.\n\nBut wait, the string is six tokens, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's production. Let me make sure.\n\nThe starting symbol S is `S -> NT99 NT99`. Therefore, the entire string must be a derivation where both NT99s expand into their terminals. But NT99 can only produce `t108`. So both would produce `t108`, leading to `t108 t108`, not the given string which is `t108 t101 ...`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I was wrong earlier about NT99. Let me check again. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nIn the provided rules, I see `NT99 -> t108`? Let me check:\n\nYes, under NT99 \u2192 t108.\n\nSo NT99 can only generate `t108`. So if S is `NT99 NT99`, then the first two non-terminals must both produce `t108`.

{"custom_id":"request-90","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t108 t101 t154 t94 t91 t63 t45`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a grammar in CNF looks like. CNF is a specific form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal symbol. However, in this case, the grammar seems to have all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, which is a subset of CNF where each production has two non-terminals. Some productions do seem to have a terminal on the right, like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, where S is non-terminal, and NT99 and NT89 are also non-terminals (assuming NTxx are non-terminals). Wait, but looking back, actually, some productions have terminals, like NT77 \u2192 't56', which is a terminal. So, this grammar includes both terminals and non-terminals on the right-hand side, which is a bit different from strict CNF that typically doesn't use terminals in productions. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the exact definition here.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 B, or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, most productions are two non-terminals, but some have a mix, like NT77 \u2192 't56' which is a terminal on the right. So it's possible that this grammar is slightly different than pure CNF because it allows terminals on the right. However, the problem states it's given in CNF, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider it as such, or maybe it's a mix. Either way, I'll proceed.\n\nLooking at the string `t108 t101 t154 t94 t91 t63 t45`, it's a sequence of terminals. The grammar's production has the initial symbol S, and the string starts with t108. From the given productions, I can check which non-terminals produce t108.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107 and NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12, NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for NT rules that directly produce t or any terminal.\n\nWait, let me list the productions that have a terminal on the right side, as those are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT91 \u2192 't164'\n- NT68 \u2192 't24'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT76 \u2192 't121'\n- NT67 \u2192 't67' (Wait, that's a terminal for NT67)\n- NT63 \u2192 't238'? No, wait, looking for t in the rules:\nWait, looking back, some of the NTxx seem to be defined, like NT30 is another one.\n\nWait, let me scan through the list:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side is a single terminal (tX):\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT91 \u2192 't164'\n- NT68 \u2192 't24'\n- NT66 \u2192 Wait, NT67 is 't67'\n- NT65 \u2192 't157'\n- NT64 \u2192 't24' according to this line: NT64 -> NT100 NT71. So no, it's a non-terminal. Wait, looking at NT67: production is NT67 -> 't67'\nWait, wait, looking at the list:\n\nAlright, let's list all the right-hand sides that are terminals:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT91 \u2192 't164'\n- NT68 \u2192 't24'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT67 \u2192 't67'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT65 \u2192 't157'\n- NT96 \u2192 't91'\n- NT1 \u2192 't107' (Wait, NT1's production is NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17, so no)\nWait, let's check each production:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\n- NT35 -> NT68 NT103 \u2192 non-terminal\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT71 \u2192 non-terminals except NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT40 -> NT33 NT64 \u2192 non-terminals\n- NT93 -> NT15 NT77 \u2192 non-terminals except NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT96 -> NT1 NT108: NT1 is non-terminal, NT108 may be a terminal? Wait, in the productions, NT96 is not a t, but looking elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking through the entire list:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT68 \u2192 't24'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- NT67 \u2192 't67'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT91 \u2192 't164'\n- NT96 \u2192 't91' \u2192 Wait, NT96's production? Let's see: NT96 has multiple rules, like NT96 -> NT106 NT73, NA \u2192 't157', or NT96 -> NT1 NT108. Wait, looking for NT96 with RHS t. Yes, see line: NT96 -> NT105 NT102 and NT96 -> 't157'.\n\nAh, so NT96 can produce 't157'.\n\nWait, let's list all these productions where the RHS is a terminal:\n\n1. NT77 \u2192 't56'\n2. NT68 \u2192 't24'\n3. NT28 \u2192 't76'\n4. NT67 \u2192 't67'\n5. NT71 \u2192 't69'\n6. NT91 \u2192 't164'\n7. NT96 \u2192 't157'\n\nSo these are the NTs that produce terminals.\n\nNow, the given string is `t108 t101 t154 t94 t91 t63 t45`. So let's see if these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let's think about how the terminal counts work. The string has 7 terminals: t108, t101, t154, t94, t91, t63, t45.\n\nIn the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S is non-terminal, and the first productions from S would lead to two non-terminals, which in turn expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nEach non-terminal production that produces a terminal reduces that non-terminal into a single terminal, and each such production corresponds to a step in the parse tree.\n\nThe length of the generated string in terms of the number of terminals should be equal to 2^k, where k is the number of split steps, because each application of a production that generates two non-terminals increases the number of symbols in the string.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. For context-free grammars in CNF, the number of symbols in any derivation starting from S is a power of two. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 A B (2 symbols)\n- Each A and B could be further split into 2 each, leading to 4, 8, etc.\n\nSo, a string with 7 terminals would have a length that's a power of 2, but 7 is not a power of 2. The nearest powers are 4 (2^2) or 8 (2^3). 7 is not a power of 2, so it's impossible for this grammar to generate a string of 7 terminals. Hence, the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, some productions allow a single non-terminal to produce a single terminal. For example, NT108 could have a production like NT108 \u2192 't108' (although I didn't see that in the provided rules). But I would need to check if any NT directly produces 't108'.\n\nLooking at the productions, it seems NT108 doesn't appear. Wait, the given string includes t108, which is not directly produced by any NT in the given rules. So, unless there's another production that leads to 't108' as a terminal, it cannot be generated. \n\nWait, the given string starts with t108, so the first step must be from S to something involving NT99 and NT89, which would not produce t108 directly.\n\nWait, but let me"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t108 t101 t134 t96 t123 t141 t178\". \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it seems to be in Chomsky normal form, which is a form where all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar here starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the start symbol is S, and it's expanding into these NT99 and NT89 non-terminals.\n\nThe string given consists of multiple t prefixes, like t108, t101, etc. Each of these seems to correspond to a terminal symbol generated by the grammar. For example, NT99 is linked to t108, which suggests that whenever NT99 appears in the grammar, it directly expands to 't108'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, each NTX seems to correspond to a specific terminal. For instance, NT99 \u2192 't108', NT89 \u2192 't64', NT68 \u2192 't134', etc. Wait, no, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 't64' (I think I might have misread earlier; let me check: NT89 is on the left side, and in the rules, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. But then where does it link to? Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see that some NTX have direct expansions. For example, NT99 \u2192 't108', NT89 \u2192 't64' (I think I need to scan all rules properly).\n\nWait, this could take a while, but perhaps a better approach is to consider each production rule and see if I can parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each t... to the corresponding NT they come from.

Wait, but the string starts with t108, which matches NT99's production, which goes to 't108'. So the first part, 't108', is from NT99. Then the next part is 't101' which must come from NT89's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, NT89 is followed by NT44 and NT1.

The string is `t91 t101 t90 t56 t67 t91 t144 t178`. The grammar seems pretty complex with a lot of productions, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, starting from S, the start symbol, I need to see if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t91`. I need to find which production produces `t91`. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT91 has a production. Let me check:\n\nLooking for `t91` in the productions, I see NT91 -> 't134', but that's not matching. Wait, maybe I missed it. Oh, here: NT91 -> 't90' or wait, no, I think I need to look for productions that result in terminals. Oh, here's one: NT101 -> 't91', so to get `t91`, I need to have a production where NT101 produces it. So, NT101 -> 't91'.\n\nSo, the first token `t91` must come from NT101.

Hmm, maybe looking deeper:\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out the entire string and see how it can be built from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t91, t101, t90, t56, t67, t91, t144, t178.\n\nBreaking it down, the string is a sequence of tokens.

The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of symbols denoted by 't' followed by numbers, like t108, t101, etc. From the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals are assigned to produce terminal symbols. For example, NT7 starts with 't24', which is a terminal. So, each production can either lead to more non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me list out the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t24\n- NT16 \u2192 t93\n- NT29 \u2192 t36, t156\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- NT12 \u2192 t80\n- NT9 \u2192 t134\n- NT39 \u2192 t144, t144 (wait, that's a typo, should be the same?)\n- NT68 \u2192 t134\n- NT29 \u2192 t129 (wait, another duplicate perhaps)\nHmm, some non-terminals have multiple rules leading to the same terminal. But in the grammar, each non-terminal has multiple left-hand sides, but they all are unique. Wait, looking back, I see that for NT29, the production is NT29 \u2192 t129, and also NT29 \u2192 t156. So each rule for a non-terminal is unique.\n\nNow, my task is to parse the string `t108 t101 t154 t2 t177 t91 t63 t178` to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the string and see if it can be matched step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt108, t101, t154, t2, t177, t91, t63, t178\n\nI think the best way is to construct the parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S splits into NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string starts with NT99 and NT89.\n\nBut the string starts with t108, t101, etc. So perhaps NT99 is generating t108, and NT89 is generating the rest? Let me check NT99 and NT89 productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT99 has a production: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see:\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Actually, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking deeper, I see:\nNT69 \u2192 t.. hmm, maybe I should list all the rules.\n\nWait, let's parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nI see that NT99 appears in the rules, for example:\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nSo NT99 can go to NT6 and NT103. Similarly, NT69 is another non-terminal:\nNT69 \u2192 t63 (from the data: NT69 \u2192 t63)\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t108. Let's see if any non-terminal X has a rule X \u2192 t108.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t134\n- NT108 \u2192 NT67 NT73 (since NT68 in rules is something else, but wait, in the list given, I see:\n\nLooking more carefully, I think the rule for NT108 is: NT108 \u2192 NT67 NT73. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nThe provided grammar includes:\n\nNT108 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n\nWait, no. Let me look:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nNT77 \u2192 NT56\nNT11 \u2192 NT81 NT29\n...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check for NT108. In the data, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT108 \u2192 NT67 NT73. Ah yes, that's the rule.\n\nSo NT108 \u2192 NT67 NT73.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t108, which would require that NT108 \u2192 t108, but looking at the rules, I don't see any production for NT108 that results in a terminal. Only non-terminals. Therefore, the first symbol t108 would come from NT108, but if NT108 \u2192 ... something, then that something must lead to t108.\n\nWait, no. Because NT108 is a non-terminal, and if it produces other non-terminals, then the string must be the sequence of symbols derived from that. So maybe t108 is generated by a different production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as NT7 \u2192 t24, NT16 \u2192 t93, etc.\n\nLooking through the rules, I think NT108 is a non-terminal, but it only appears as a rule for others. For example, looking through the rules, I don't see any rule for NT108 that directly produces a terminal. Instead, NT108 appears as a left-hand side in a production: NT108 \u2192 NT67 NT73. Wait, no, in the given rules, I think NT68 has a production to t134, but NT108 is a non-terminal that might be part of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the rules.

The string is `t108 t101 t90 t134 t101 t23 t47 t63 t45`. \n\nFirst, I remember Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, all the rules are in CNF because each production is two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT99 NT89. So, any derivation starts with these two parts. The string starts with t108, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar's terminals section, I see that several NTs map to specific t's. For example, NT96 maps to t91, and NT107 maps to t65. But more importantly, I need to see what t108 corresponds to. Scrolling through the terminals, I don't immediately see an NT that maps to t108. Wait, did I miss one? Oh, perhaps I should look through all the rule endings.\n\nWait, no, actually, the terminals are listed after each production. Each rule ends with a terminal or a t followed by a number. But looking again, I don't see t108 in the provided grammar.

Let me check all the rule endings again. Scanning through, I see t107, t104, etc., but not t108. So, that suggests that the string has t108, which isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated because there's a terminal that's not allowed by the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the derivation tree. Starting from S, we have NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals will produce other non-terminals or terminals based on their rules. The stack will expand, but if at any point a terminal is needed that isn't present in the grammar's definitions, it's impossible.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, the productions can be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But here, looking at the grammar, it seems like all productions are of the form A \u2192 NTX NTY, where NTX and NTY are non-terminals, except for some that seem to produce terminals. For example, some rules are like NT1 -> 't24' or others. So some productions have terminals on the right-hand side. That might complicate things because in pure CNF, all productions have non-terminals, but here, some have terminals, which might mean it's not strict CNF. Or perhaps the problem is considering a more general form.\n\nBut regardless, my main task is to check if the string `t91 t101 t97 t67 t108 t156 t54 t158 t45` can be generated by this grammar.\n\nI think I should approach this by breaking down the string into its components and seeing if each 't' token can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t terms: t91, t101, t97, t67, t108, t156, t54, t158, t45. Each of these must correspond to a derivation starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions start with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S splits into two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. From there, each of these needs to derive into the corresponding 't' terms.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT99 NT89\n2. NT99 \u2192 ?\n3. NT89 \u2192 ?\n\nI need to see what NT99 and NT89 can produce.\n\nLooking for NT99 in the productions:\n\nSearch through the list, I see NT99 \u2192 't169' (from the last line of the grammar). So NT99 is a terminal 't169'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT89, I see NT89 \u2192 't60' (from the earlier line). So NT89 is 't60'.\n\nSo the initial split S \u2192 NT99 NT89 directly produces 't169 t60'? But wait, the string starts with 't91', not 't169'. That's a problem because the derived string would be 't169 t60', but the input string starts with t91. So unless there's a way to have a different derivation path, but from the grammar, NT99 only goes to 't169' directly, and there's no further production for NT99 beyond that. So NT99 can't produce t91.\n\nWait, this might mean that the string can't be derived because NT99 can't produce t91, but only t169, and NT89 can't produce t97 either. Let me check the individual components:\n\nLooking at each 't' in the string:\n\n- t91: Does any non-terminal produce t91?\n- t101: Any rule?\n- t97: Does any NT go to t97?\n- t67: Any rule?\n- t108: Any rule?\n- t156: Any NT?\n- t54: Any?\n- t158: Any?\n- t45: Any?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produce these t's. For example, looking through all the productions, I see NT17 \u2192 't22', NT29 \u2192 't156', but no NT that goes to t91, t101, etc.\n\nSo each 't' in the string would have to be generated by some NT production. Since none of these seem to have rules that produce them, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe some of the t's are produced through further derivations, but since T89 \u2192 t60 and NT99 \u2192 t169, and none of the other non-terminals lead to the t's in the input string, it's impossible for the input string to be a derivation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-149","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string is 't91 t101 t174 t24 t105 t158 t98 t8 t141 t178'. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So this grammar consists of a bunch of A \u2192 BC productions and some terminals.\n\nThe string breaks down into tokens: t91, t101, t174, t24, t105, t158, t98, t8, t141, t178. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation should only produce two non-terminals. So the string's length (which is 10 tokens) suggests the parse tree has a certain depth. \n\nLet me think about the structure. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so any string generated must start with NT99 and NT89. But here, the string starts with t91, which is a terminal. So does this mean S can derive into something that eventually leads to t91? Wait, but S is the start symbol, and all derivations from S must end up producing the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So from S, we immediately get two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89. Then each of these can be expanded into other non-terminals. So the string must be a result of expanding S multiple times.\n\nThe given string has ten terminals. So the parse tree must have a depth of 4 at least, because each step can produce two non-terminals. Let me sketch it:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT89 (depth 1)\n- Each NT99 and NT89 can split into more non-terminals. So after two splits, we'd have four, and so on.\n\nBut the string is ten tokens, which is an even number. So the number of leaves (terminals) will depend on how deep the tree is. Wait, actually, each production of S adds two tokens each time. So starting from S, each production increases the count by two, but only at the leaves.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as the number of tokens is proportional to the number of steps. Let me think differently. Each non-terminal can lead to two non-terminals, so each step increases the number of non-terminals by one, but since we're adding two each time, perhaps the total number of terminals can be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to reconstruct a possible parse tree that results in this string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t91. So I need to see if t91 is a terminal or if it's derived from a non-terminal. From the given grammar, some terminals are defined directly by the productions, like 't95' appears in a production? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't107' t17\nWait, no, hold on. The grammar's productions end with some 't' terminals. For example:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT95 nt65\nNT77 \u2192 NT95 nt18\nWait, no, let me look more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see some transitions that produce 't' terminals. For example:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't24' 't133'? Wait, no, let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through each line, I see that NT102 \u2192 't48' 't49', for example. Another line says NT77 \u2192 'nt95' 'nt65', which is a non-terminal. But others like NT42 \u2192 't158' and so on. \n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some non-terminals are expanded into a terminal plus another non-terminal. For example, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, but that's not a terminal. Oh, wait, no, looking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't'91, but wait, no, looking again, there are lines like NT17 \u2192 't24', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT29 \u2192 't156'.\n\nSo the terminals in the grammar are like 't91', 't101', etc.\n\nSo looking at the string, the tokens are t91, t101, t174, t24, t105, t158, t98, t8, t141, t178. So these are all terminals, which means the non-terminals in the grammar must somehow derive down to these tokens.\n\nSo, to see if the string is possible, each token in the string must be reachable via some productions from the initial non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals lead to these 't' terminals.\n\nFirst, t91. In the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't24'. Wait, and looking further, NT73 \u2192 't167'? No, let's go through the given productions step by step.\n\nLooking for rules that produce 't' terminals:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129' etc.\n- NT107 \u2192 't94' etc.\n- NT100 \u2192 't127', etc.\n\nBut in the string, t91 is present. Let's see if any non-terminal produces t91.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT102 \u2192 't48' 't49'\n- NT98 \u2192 't141' 't16'\n- NT77 \u2192 't95' 't65' and 'nt76' 't124'? Maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to see if the grammar has any production that results in 't91' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given productions, I notice that NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23, but not sure. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the productions that produce a 't' terminal.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT73 \u2192 't167'\n- NT43 \u2192 't2'\n- NT46 \u2192 't99'\n- NT96 \u2192 't91'\n- NT19 \u2192 't99'\n- NT23 \u2192 't158'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156', 't129', etc.\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT95 \u2192 't130'\n- NT42 \u2192 't158', etc.\n\nWait, I see that NT96 \u2192 't91' is a rule. Yes, in one of the productions: NT96 \u2192 't91' 'nt1' (I think, based on the given grammar). So that means NT96 can produce 't91' and 't1' (maybe 't1'). Wait, no, let me check: the exact line is 'NT96 \u2192 NT105 nt18' or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLine: NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\nWait, no, that's for NT96. Actually, looking for 't' terminals:\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT105 \u2192 't105' (I think, but actually, from the provided lines, I don't see 't' terminals except for some that might not be in the given grammar. Wait, let me carefully parse the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the user's provided grammar, for example:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36: both non-terminals.\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107 and others.\n- NT69 \u2192 NT1 't133' perhaps? Wait, no, looking through:\n\nLooking for lines that have 't' as a terminal part.\n\nFor example, line: NT17 \u2192 't24' (a terminal)\n\nSimilarly, line: NT29 \u2192 't156' which is a terminal, and also 't129'.\n\nAnother example: NT77 has productions like \u2192 't95' 'nt65' and others.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see any production that produces 't91' directly. Hmm, but looking through the string: the string includes 't91'.\n\nSo maybe 't91' is derived from a non-terminal that eventually becomes a terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps 't91' is derived from NT84, for example. Let's check if any rule includes 't91'.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form is a specific way to structure the rules of a grammar, usually with each production rule having two non-terminals on the left and two terminals or one non-terminal on the right. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it mostly consists of non-terminals (like S, NTX where X is a number) that produce other non-terminals or sometimes terminals like 't' followed by a number. The main non-terminal is S, which starts everything off. The string in question is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this string can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me look at the string: t108 t101 t94 t22 t8 t165 t98 t8 t141 t178. That's 10 elements, all in the form t followed by numbers, which matches the structure of the grammar where non-terminals eventually produce these 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to see which non-terminals are generating these 't' terms. For example, looking at the grammar, there are rules like NT107 -> 't35', which would generate t35. But I need to match each 't' in the string to a possible NT production.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The grammar's non-terminals are rules that produce these terminals. So each 't' must correspond to a non-terminal that can generate that specific 't' number.\n\nLet me list out each 't' number and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT rules that produce various 't' numbers. For example:\n\n- NT15 -> ... -> 't90' (from NT15 -> NT90)\n- NT100 -> 't127' (wait, in the grammar, NT100 -> 't100'? Wait, no, looking again, NT100 -> NT67, and NT67 is broken into other parts.

Wait, no, looking into the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT107 is given as NT107 -> 't164'? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the list is long, so I'll pick each NT and see where they produce 'tX'.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT107 -> 't174' (from NT107 -> 't174'?), wait, no. Wait, the grammar has a long list of rules, so I need to check each to see which 't's are associated.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-169","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t91 t101 t165 t130 t0 t177 t0 t8 t141 t94 t24`. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier, but here I'm just trying to check if the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's quite extensive. It starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the entire string should start with these two NT productions. The string starts with t91, so I need to see if there's a path from these NTs to the terminals in the string.\n\nI notice that NT99 and NT89 are separate production rules. For example, NT99 leads to NT6 NT103, and NT103 eventually leads to 't178' and 't65'. Not sure if that's relevant yet. NT89 has productions like NT44 NT1 and NT1 leads to several t's.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string token by token and see if each can be derived from the grammar. Let's list the tokens:\n\nt91, t101, t165, t130, t0, t177, t0, t8, t141, t94, t24.\n\nI'll start with the first symbol, t91. Looking at the grammar, I see NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. Then NT6 \u2192 NT91 and NT74. Hmm, is that right? Wait, looking again, NT71 \u2192 NT69. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check the relevant rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, there's a rule NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70, and so on. It might be complex, but perhaps I can map each t symbol back to the NT rule that produces it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rules can be traced back from the terminals to the non-terminals. For instance, each terminal tXX can be seen as a result of a production. So for each t, I can see which NT it comes from.\n\nFor example, t91 is from NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT74. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT74. But t91 comes from NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT74, which then has t91 and t74. But t91 is an actual terminal, so is NT91 further expanding?\n\nWait, let me look at the rules again. Oh, for NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. So if NT91 is a non-terminal, it produces NT6 and NT17. Then NT6 can be checked: NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT74. Hmm, but that seems circular because NT91 leads back to NT6 and NT17. Not sure if that's helpful right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that starts from an NT and ends in a terminal, so the overall derivation would be a series of such steps.\n\nGiven the string is long, it's going to require a lot of steps. Maybe a better approach is to look for any patterns or possible derivations.\n\nWait, let's try to map some of the t symbols:\n\nt91: Looking at the grammar, I see that NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. So maybe after deriving, t91 is NT91, but I need to see how it's produced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t91 is produced by some rule directly. Looking through, I don't see a direct production for t91, except perhaps via NT91 which can produce t91. So maybe t91 comes from NT91 \u2192 ... \u2192 t91.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, t91 appears in NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17, and so on. It's getting a bit messy.\n\nI think this approach is not efficient. Maybe a better way is to parse the string step by step, considering each token and seeing if it can be matched via the grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I can look for the sequence t91 t101 t165... and see if these correspond to a possible path in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each step in the grammar produces non-terminals, which in turn produce other non-terminals until terminals are reached, maybe this string is built by a series of such derivations.\n\nAnother thought: the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the parse tree will have a binary structure, with each non-terminal having exactly two children, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the string consists of 11 tokens, which would imply a parse tree with 10 internal nodes (since each production adds one token). But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nPerhaps I can try to map the string tokens back to the grammar. Let's list the terms and see if they can be derived from the NTs.\n\n1. t91: Could be from NT91 or NT101? Wait, let's see:\n   - NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, so t91 could come from NT91's first part.\n   - Looking at NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT74, so that's t91 and t74. But maybe further down the chain.\n   Hmm, this seems too vague.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think about the overall structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which is NT99 and NT89. So, perhaps the string starts with t99 and t89.\n\nBut the string starts with t91, so maybe the NT99 and NT89 lead into t91 and t89 somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the entire string is part of a derivation that combines NT99 and NT89 into the given string.\n\nThis is getting complicated, so perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe I can try to see if each token can be derived from some NT in the grammar, and if the sequence makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can trace the possible path of the string through the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the first token: t91.\n\nLooking through the grammar, t91 appears in NT91 \u2192 ... but I don't see an immediate rule for NT91 to t91, except indirectly via the rules leading to it.\n\nWait, perhaps NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, and then NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT74. So this seems like a loop. Maybe the derivation goes deeper. Alternatively, this could mean that t91 is part of a chain that starts with NT91, which then splits into NT6 and NT17, and so on, which might eventually reach a terminal.\n\nBut keeping track of this for 11 tokens is too much manually.\n\nAnother idea: since the grammar is in CNF, the number of steps in the derivation equals the number of symbols minus one. So, the string has 11 symbols, so the derivation would have 10 steps, each splitting a non-terminal into two parts.\n\nSo, the start symbol S is a pair of non-terminals, so the derivation would proceed as:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 and NT89.\n\nEach of these NTs can split into two, and so on, until 11 symbols are reached.\n\nPerhaps I can construct a parse tree for the given string and see if it fits the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to map each t token to a specific NT that reaches it. For example, t91 is from NT91, which is produced by NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, and so on.\n\nBut without a clear mapping, it's challenging.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that many NTs lead to other NTs that eventually reach a t. For example, NT77 \u2192 nt95 nt65, which in turn lead to t124, etc.\n\nBut perhaps each t like t91 can be traced back through a chain of NTs until a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar can be seen as a binary tree where each node is a production, and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe the best approach is to write a simple parser, but since I'm doing it manually, perhaps I can look for any evident contradictions.\n\nLooking at the string: t91 t101 t165 t130 t0 t177 t0 t8 t141 t94 t24.\n\nLet me check each t whether it's present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the t's are:\n\nt91, t101, t165, t130, t0, t177, t0, t8, t141, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nStarting with S, the only rule is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the top-level structure must be a string that starts with NT99 and is followed by NT89. Splitting the string into two parts, t91 t101 would correspond to these two non-terminals. Wait, no, because S \u2192 NT99 NT89 means the entire string should be split into two parts, each derived from NT99 and NT89 respectively. But the given string has more than two parts. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals, so the overall string is a concatenation of two derived strings. So, the entire string must be divided into two parts, each part being the expansion of one of the NTs. For example, if S \u2192 A B, then the string is the concatenation of A's expansion and B's expansion.\n\nSo, looking at the string `t91 t101 t158 t130 t2 t104 t2 t8 t69 t94 t24`, it has 11 tokens. Since S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the string should be split into two parts. Let's see if I can split it into two.\n\nLet me try different splits:\n\nOption 1: Split after t101, so first part is t91 t101 (2 tokens) and the second part is t158 t130 t2 t104 t2 t8 t69 t94 t24 (9 tokens). Does nt99 produce t91 t101? Looking at the grammar, I need to see if NT99 can produce these tokens when expanded.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. That's a two-step process. NT6 is a terminal? Let me check: NT6 is in the rules, and one of the rules is NT6 \u2192 t108. So NT6 produces t108. Then NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. NT24 is a terminal? Yes, in the rules, NT24 \u2192 t123, so that's t123. Then NT45 \u2192 NT123 NT52, but wait, NT45 is actually a terminal in the rules. Wait, no, all the NTs in the rules are either terminals or point to other rules. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 \u2192 t108, NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. Now, NT24 is a terminal, t123, and NT45 is a terminal, t98. So NT103 \u2192 t123 t98. Then NT99 \u2192 t108 t123 t98. So the first part of the split, t91 t101, would need to match this. But t91 and t101 don't match t108 t123 t98. So split 1 doesn't work.\n\nLet me try splitting the string after the first token, so t91 as the first part and the rest as the second. NT99 must produce t91, but looking at the rules, none of the productions for NT99 lead to a single token. All lead to two non-terminals. So t91 must be the expansion of NT99, which is not possible because NT99 is followed by another NT. So split 2 doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Since the grammar is in CNF, the entire string must be a concatenation of two expansions from S. So each part must be at least one token, but looking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals, and others produce two NTs. So, for example, NT1 \u2192 t107 t17, which is two terminals. But others, like NT24, directly produce a terminal. \n\nSo, perhaps the first part is t91 and t101, each derived from an NT. Wait, but I thought S produces NT99 NT89, each of which is non-terminals. So each of these must expand into a string, and the entire string is the concatenation of their expansions.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is 11 tokens. If S \u2192 NT99 NT89, then the entire string is NT99 expansion + NT89 expansion. So, the total number of tokens should be the sum of the token counts from each expansion. \n\nLet me check how many tokens each NT produces when expanded.\n\nStarting with NT99: \nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nNT6 \u2192 t108 (1 token)\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45\nNT24 \u2192 t123 (1)\nNT45 \u2192 t98 (1)\nSo, NT99 expansion is t108 t123 t98 \u2192 3 tokens.\n\nNow, NT89: \nLooking at the rules, NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT71\nNT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12\nNT28 \u2192 t76 (1)\nNT12 \u2192 t80 (1)\nSo, tracing back:\nNT84 \u2192 t76 t80\nNT68 \u2192 t28 t12 \u2192 t76 t80\nNT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76 \u2192 let's see NT61 and NT76 expansions.\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT71 \u2192 t76 t80 t69 (from NT71 \u2192 t51? Wait, earlier I thought NT71 was derived from NT70 and NT42, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree for each part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to trace the tokens to see if they can form the required expansions.\n\nLooking at the string: t91 t101 t158 t130 t2 t104 t2 t8 t69 t94 t24.\n\nSo, 11 tokens. Let me see how the grammar can split this.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT99 NT89, then the string should be NT99_expansion + NT89_expansion.\n\nNT99_expansion: as above, produces 3 tokens (t108, t123, t98). Let's see if any part of the string starts with t108, but in the string, the first token is t91, which doesn't match t108. So maybe the split isn't at the first part. Wait, but the entire string must be the concatenation of the two expansions. So NT99 and NT89 must each expand into some sequence of tokens, and the combined lengths must add up to 11.\n\nWait, let me think about how many tokens each NT produces.\n\nFrom NT99, I think it's 3 tokens.\n\nFrom NT89: let's see:\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76.\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT71.\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12.\n\nNT28 \u2192 t76 (since NT28 \u2192 t76).\n\nNT12 \u2192 t80.\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 t76 t80.\n\nNT71 \u2192 Let me check: NT71 \u2192 NT70 NT42.\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT102 NT92.\n\nNT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49.\n\nNT48 \u2192 t11.\n\nNT49 \u2192 t157?

{"custom_id":"request-183","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t91 t101 t24 t17 t139 t130 t2 t104 t0 t8 t69 t178`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided consists of such productions, so that's consistent.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT99. That means the derivation starts with NT99 NT99. Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal string.\n\nI'll need to parse the string step by step, trying to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Let's split the string into tokens: t91, t101, t24, t17, t139, t130, t2, t104, t0, t8, t69, t178.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the grammar. The NT rules are various combinations of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals eventually expands to a chain of terminals or other non-terminals, leading directly to a terminal.\n\nSince the starting symbol is S, which splits into NT99 and NT99, the entire string must be derived from a combination of these two NT99s.\n\nLooking at the NT99 productions:\n- NT99 can go to NT61 NT76 or NT108 NT11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t91, which is a terminal. I need to see if any of the NT99 productions can lead to t91.\n\nLooking into the grammar, several non-terminals expand to t91. For example, NT91 \u2192 't151' and others like NT69 \u2192 't153'? Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT91 is production: NT91 \u2192 't151'?\n\nNo, looking back:\n\nThe list includes:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't151'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't151'\n\nNT100 \u2192 't51'\n\nNT100 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT93 \u2192 't170'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't108'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't139'\n\nSpecifically, looking for t91. The productions include NT71 \u2192 't69', NT75 \u2192 't98', NT2 \u2192 't26', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any production that directly expands to t91. So maybe t91 has to come from a longer chain.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce t91 as part of its expansion. Let's check all the NT rules that lead directly to terminals.\n\nFrom the list, the NT productions that expand to terminals are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't134'\nNT7 \u2192 't151'\nNT29 \u2192 't156'\nNT29 \u2192 't129'\nNT24 \u2192 't123'\nNT12 \u2192 't80'\nNT7 \u2192 't151' [duplicate]\nNT1 \u2192 't107' 't17' \u2192 t17\nWait, no, that's an alternative.\n\nWait, some non-terminals expand to a single terminal. For example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't151'\n\nWait, in the list, NT7: 'NT7 -> t151'\n\nSimilarly:\n\nOther NT productions that have terminal outputs:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t107 and t17 \u2192 So NT1 can produce 't107' or 't17'\n\nNT24 \u2192 t123\n\nNT35 \u2192 t94, t40, t105\n\nWait, looking at the NT productions:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that directly produces t91. Let's scan all the rules that directly expand to a terminal string.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nSearch for 't91':\n\n- Looking, NT77 \u2192 t56, NT75 \u2192 t98, NT96 \u2192 t91 (Yes! NT96 \u2192 't91' ) \n\nYes, NT96 can produce 't91'. So if any NT in the derivation reaches NT96, it can produce t91.\n\nSo let's see. Our string starts with t91. So in the derivation, somewhere there's an NT that produces t91, which is 't91'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t91, which is generated by NT96. So we have 't91' coming from NT96.\n\nSo in the derivation, somewhere in the NT96 path, there's a production to 't91'.\n\nBut let's think about the overall structure. The string has 12 tokens, which must be produced by the initial two NT99s.\n\nEach NT99 can expand into either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo the total string should be produced by a combination of these productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this by building the parse tree from the top down or bottom up. Let's try a bottom-up approach.\n\nOur target is to check if t91 is the first token. Since t91 comes from NT96, which is a production rule: NT96 \u2192 't91' or 't115'.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has NT96 \u2192 't91' [yes, one of its rules].\n\nSo the first part is done: t91 is from NT96.\n\nNext token is t101. Let's check if any non-terminal directly produces t101. Let's look through the grammar:\n\nNT107 can produce t94 and t118.\n\nNT107 \u2192 't174' and 't65'\n\nNT102 \u2192 't13 t49'?\n\nWait, in the list, one production is NT102 \u2192 't13' 't49' (t13 and t49).\n\nBut t101 is not among these. Wait, looking for t101. Looking through all the terminals:\n\nLooking at NT production rules, which NTs produce t101.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t101. So perhaps t101 has to come through a longer chain.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each NT eventually terminates or continues. Maybe t101 is derived indirectly. Let me look for NT rules that can chain into t101.\n\nLooking at the string, after t91 (t96) comes t101, which is the second token. So in the derivation, this must come from a non-terminal that, through its chain, produces t96 followed by t101. That seems unlikely because each symbol in the string is separated, so it's more likely that each is independently produced. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must come from a separate chain in the derivation.\n\nSo the initial split would be S \u2192 NT99 NT99, each NT99 can become a chain that produces a terminal. So each token in the string (12 of them) must be generated by one of the rules from one of the two NT99s. But since NT99 can produce two different chains, perhaps some tokens are produced by one NT99 and others by the other.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT99 can produce multiple terminals. So overall, the number of terminals can be variable.\n\nBut let's try to see if each token can be matched by a non-terminal's production.\n\nLet me list all the tokens: t91, t101, t24, t17, t139, t130, t2, t104, t0, t8, t69, t178.\n\nFirst token t91: As established, comes from NT96.\n\nNext t101: Need to find an NT that can produce this. Let's check all the NTs in the grammar to see if any directly produce t101.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t101. So this is a problem because t101 isn't directly derivable from any single NT. So unless t101 is part of a longer chain in a non-terminal, but given the string is 12 separate terminals, each must come from a direct production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible through multiple NTs generating single terminals in such a way that the entire string is produced.\n\nWait, another approach is to reverse-engineer the string to see if each terminal can be matched by some NT in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string given is `t108 t101 t165 t130 t0 t94 t71 t2 t105 t141 t65 t24`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, and the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow this structure because each rule on the left side (like S, NT15, etc.) is being split into two non-terminals. However, I need to be cautious in case any symbol might be the start symbol or a non-terminal, which isn't the case here as all seem to be properly split into two non-terminals except perhaps for t symbols, which are terminals.\n\nNext, the string consists of a series of rule numbers transformed into specific tokens. Each 't' followed by a number seems to represent a terminal symbol, which is a production's right-hand side element. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI think about the approach to solve this. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm or perhaps a recursive descent parser to parse the string. However, implementing CYK might be complex given the number of non-terminals, but since I'm just reasoning, I can try to break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: `t108 t101 t165 t130 t0 t94 t71 t2 t105 t141 t65 t24`.\n\nI notice that it's a sequence of tokens, each potentially corresponding to a production rule. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step splits the string into two parts, each part being a valid string from the grammar. So, the entire string should be a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nThe process would involve checking each symbol from left to right, determining if they can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStarting symbol: S, which produces NT99 and NT89. So the first two symbols of the string must derive from either NT99 or NT89.\n\nBut the string starts with `t108`, which is a terminal symbol. Looking back at the grammar rules, 't108' appears for NT108. Wait, but in the grammar rules, the non-terminals seem to produce t tokens via some chain. Let me check the given rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce t-symbols. For example, NT100 -> t127, NT108 -> t118, etc. So perhaps some terminals can appear directly if the non-terminals have a production that leads there.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. If a non-terminal has a production that directly results in a terminal, that's allowed because in CNF, the right-hand side can be two non-terminals, but also, a non-terminal can have a production to a single terminal (if allowed). But wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, yes, a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, let's check if any non-terminals directly produce terminals. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103: produces two non-terminals.\n- NT89 -> NT44 NT1: two non-terminals.\n- NT108 -> t118: This is a production that directly produces a terminal. So NT108 \u2192 t118 is a valid CNF production because in CNF, a production can be A \u2192 a (where a is a terminal, or a non-terminal in CNF's case, but I think in this context, a is a single terminal symbol).\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT108 -> t118. Similarly, NT107 -> t65, etc. So yes, some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols.\n\nSo, for the first token in the string, which is 't108', it must be produced by NT108\u2192t108. So the first symbol is 't108', which comes from NT108. Now, the next step would be to see how NT108 is derived.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT108 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't118'. So NT108 can only derive 't118'. But in the string, the next token after t108 is t101.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If NT108 produces only t118, then the second token cannot be t101, unless t101 can be derived from another production. So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string starts with 't108', which would need to come from a rule that produces that terminal. But in the grammar, I don't see that NT108 directly produces t108. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule for NT108. Only NT107 seems to have a terminal production.\n\nWait, the last rules end with NT107 -> 't94', etc. But I see some lines like:\n\nNT107 -> t65,\nBut I don't see anything for NT108. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. Let me look again:\n\nThe rules provided are quite extensive, and perhaps I missed 't108'. Looking through the list, I see NT108 is listed as:\n\nNT108 -> t118,\nBut the first token is t108, which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Because in the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t108. For example, NT108 is another non-terminal that maps to t118.\n\nSo, that suggests that the first token 't108' in the string can't be generated by any production in the grammar because there's no rule that produces t108. All the rules for non-terminals either produce two non-terminals or a terminal in other parts, but no non-terminal exists that directly produces t108.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be derived from the grammar because the first token can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token is the result of a derivation starting from S, which first splits into NT99 and NT89, but perhaps not. Wait, but the first token would have to come from one of these non-terminals. If the first symbol is t108, it can't be generated by NT99 or NT89 because NT99 is split into NT6 and NT103, which would produce t127 or other terminals, but not t108.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the parsing direction. Let me think again: Each symbol in the string is part of a sentential form. So to derive 't108' as the first symbol, it must come directly from a derivation starting from S, but S itself can't produce a single terminal. According to the grammar, S is split into two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89. That means the first step would produce a string with two non-terminals, which then each have their own derivations. Therefore, the first token in the resulting string would be a terminal produced by NT99 or NT89, but in reality, the initial step produces two non-terminals side by side, so the first symbol must come from NT99's derivation.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is 't108'. So unless NT99 can produce 't108', which I don't see, it's impossible.\n\nWait, let's check NT99's production. Looking up:\n\nNT99 is under the initial rules:\n\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\n\nBut I don't see NT99 anywhere. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the rules are listed. Let me check:\n\nThe initial rule is:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nSo S directly produces NT99 and NT89. Then, NT99 is part of the production. But looking through the provided rules, I don't see any production for NT99. It must have one, as per CNF, because it's being used. But in the given rules, does NT99 have any productions?\n\nWait, maybe I skipped. Let me scroll down:\n\nI see:\n\nNT99 -> t6 NT103\nYes, that's the line: NT99 -> t6 NT103. So NT99 can produce a terminal 't6' and a non-terminal NT103.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is 't108'. But NT99's only production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-209","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t108 t101 t165 t130 t2 t174 t72 t171 t0 t8 t141 t65 t24`. \n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) has exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since this grammar uses terminals (like t108, t101, etc.) and non-terminals (like S, NT15, NT52, etc.), it's definitely in CNF. \n\nThe string starts with `t108`, which I look at in the grammar rules. In the given grammar, I see that `NT106` has a production to `NT35 NT107` and another to `NT107 NT107`. Additionally, looking within the productions, I notice that some non-terminals like NT108 or NT109 don't directly produce t108. Wait, maybe I should check all possible production paths that can lead to t108.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a production for NT96: `NT96 -> NT33 NT36`, but that's for NT96, not directly t96. Wait, in the production rules, I see `NT96 -> 't105' NT1` and `NT96 -> 't1' NT108`. Oh, so NT96 can produce either a terminal t105 or t1 when combined with other symbols. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t108. So, I need to find a production chain that starts with t108. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT108 directly expanding to t108. Instead, the productions for non-terminals are combinations of two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each rule systematically. For example, NT107 has `NT107 -> NT177 NT80`, `NT107 -> NT94 NT17`, `NT107 -> ...` and I also see `NT107 -> NT72 NT72`. Hmm, but t107 is a terminal in some rules. Let me see an example, like `NT107 -> 't174' NT174` or similar? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, I see `NT76 -> 't121' NT176` or something like that? Not exactly. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the specific terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the production rules that result in t108. In the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT110 -> NT55 NT45? No, wait, looking at the rules given, I see a rule like `NT75 -> 't98' ...` which is NT75 producing a terminal t98. Wait, no, I'm not seeing t108 directly. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see a production like `NT108 -> 't51' NT42` and `NT108 -> 't26' NT60`. So perhaps t108 is a terminal somewhere else? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, maybe I should step back. Since the string is made up of terminals, I need to see if the grammar can derive each terminal in sequence. Starting with t108, perhaps t108 is the result of a non-terminal NT108 expanding into a terminal. Looking through the productions, I see that NT96 has productions that sometimes result in terminals like t105 and t1, but t108 isn't directly produced by any NT rule I can see. Maybe t108 is produced by another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each non-terminal. NT35 has `NT35 -> 't40' NT105` and `NT35 -> 't39' NT52`. Hmm, perhaps not. Similarly, NT52 has `NT52 -> 't107' NT81` and `NT52 -> 't107' NT81`. Wait, not t108.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t108 is produced elsewhere. Wait, looking at the given rules, I see `NT96 -> 't91' NT1` and `NT96 -> 't6' NT100`. Hmm, perhaps t108 is a result of a chain. Alternatively, maybe the string isn't possible if the grammar doesn't directly produce t108.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t108 was generated by a non-terminal that doesn't exist. Wait, perhaps I should look for a derivation path starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which first expands to NT99 NT99, as per `S -> NT99 NT99`. Then, each NT99 can expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me see NT99's productions. I don't see NT99 in the given rules, but looking through the grammar, I see NT99 has `NT99 -> 't16' NT35` and `NT99 -> 't41' NT76` and `NT99 -> 't169' NT6` and `NT99 -> 't61' NT103` from earlier examples. Wait, the initial grammar provided may not have all the NT99 rules, or perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me note that the given grammar has certain non-terminals and their productions.

From the rules, I see NT76 -> 't121' NT176, but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t108 is produced by a non-terminal that is indirectly derived.

But looking through the rules, do any NTs produce 't108'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the terminals and see if they are products of non-terminals. In this grammar, terminals like 't108', 't101', etc., are produced by certain rules. For example, I see:\n\n- NT107 -> 't174' NT12 (line: NT107 -> 't174' NT12)\n- NT96 -> 't118' NT118 (line: NT96 -> 't118' NT118)\n- NT75 -> 't18' NT43 (line: NT75 -> 't18' NT43)\n- NT11 -> 't93' NT29 (but in the rules, I see NT11 -> 't17' and others)\nWait, no. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT107 -> 't174' NT12\n- NT76 -> 't121' NT176\n- NT96 -> 't118' NT118\n- NT69 -> 't1' NT1\n- NT40 -> 't106' NT31\n- NT100 -> 't127' NT100\n- NT108 -> 't51' NT42\n- NT108 -> 't26' NT60\n- NT77 -> 't56' NT71\n- NT19 -> 't99' NT19\nWait, no NT19 produces t99. Looking at NT19 -> 't99' NT146.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should check each terminal in the string to see if it's present as a production in the grammar. Let's take each terminal in order:\n\n1. t108: Does any rule have 't108'? From the rules I see NT108 -> 't51' NT42 and NT108 -> 't26' NT60.

{"custom_id":"request-210","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems that the non-terminals are written as NT followed by a number, and there are several productions defined.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t101 t158 t130 t76 t164 t1 t101 t0 t157 t69 t174 t22`.\n\nI notice that all the terminals in the string are numbers like t91, t101, etc. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the start string must be derived from that. That means the initial step is that S generates NT99 and NT89. But in the given string, the first symbol is t91, which is a terminal. So, I'll have to trace back through the productions to see if t91 can come from NT99 or NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT99 has a production NT99 \u2192 t169. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT99 \u2192 t91, but wait, no\u2014looking more carefully, I see that NT99 isn't listed in the productions, but looking back, I see rules like NT71 \u2192 t69, and NT96 \u2192 t1. Hmm, I might need to check each NT to see what it can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the non-terminals and terminals work. Each NT rule produces a combination of non-terminals and terminals. So, for example, NT91 \u2192 't151'. Let me check that. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 t151\n\nYes, that's one of the rules. So NT91 can produce 't151'. But in the string, I have 't91' and 't101' etc. So I need to see how these can be generated.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t91, t101, t158, t130, t76, t164, t1, t101, t0, t157, t69, t174, t22.\n\nSo, in order, the terms are:\n\n1. t91\n2. t101\n3. t158\n4. t130\n5. t76\n6. t164\n7. t1\n8. t101\n9. t0\n10. t157\n11. t69\n12. t174\n13. t22\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the NTs in the grammar.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S can produce a string that starts with NT99 and NT89, but in the given string, the first symbol is t91, which is a terminal. So I need to find a path from NT99 or NT89 to t91.\n\nLooking at NT99. Does it have a production? I see a rule: NT99 \u2192 t169. Wait, that's 't169', not 't91'. So how does t91 come about?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT99 directly producing t91. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules for all NTs.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 t151\n- NT101 \u2192 t61 (wait, checking the rules, I see NT101 \u2192 t157?\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me go through each rule one by one to find where t91 comes from.\n\nWait, I'm supposed to see all the NT rules that produce terminals. Let me list them out:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t21 (I think) Wait, looking back, there's NT7 \u2192 t21? Or no? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\nAdditionally, wait no\u2014I think I may have missed it earlier. Let me go through each rule line by line.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the NTs and see if any of them produce a terminal:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n- NT99 \u2192 t91? Wait, no, I don't see that. Wait, in the rules, NT99 is there but it produces t169. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\n\"NT99 -> t642\"?

{"custom_id":"request-227","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Chomsky Normal Form is a way to write context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This specific grammar seems to have a mix of productions, but I think it's in CNF because each non-terminal on the left only expands into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: t91 t101 t165 t98 t23 t127 t170 t123 t98 t94 t69 t141 t65 t22.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals or terminals. So each step of derivation takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two symbols. The process continues until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, the NTs eventually produce terminal symbols like t1, t2, etc. These seem to correspond to the tokens in the string. Each production either ends the expansion (like NT1 \u2192 t24 or NT2 \u2192 t26) or continues further.\n\nOne approach is to see if the string can be built by following the derivation steps. Since the string is a sequence of terminals starting from the initial symbol S, I need to break it down into parts that match the grammar's production rules.\n\nBut manually tracking each step might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be split into components dictated by the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list the main parts of the string:\n\n1. t91\n2. t101\n3. t165\n4. t98\n5. t23\n6. t127\n7. t170\n8. t123\n9. t98\n10. t94\n11. t69\n12. t141\n13. t65\n14. t22\n\nLooking at the first few terms: t91, t101, t165, t98, t23, t127, t170, t123, t98, t94, t69, t141, t65, t22.\n\nI notice that t91 appears twice. Looking at the grammar, I see productions like NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, which leads to t17 and t164. Wait, but in the string, after t91, it's t101. Let me check the grammar for t101.\n\nLooking for productions that result in t101: from the grammar, I see NT101 is produced by NT61 and NT67. Wait, actually, looking at the productions, NT61 \u2192 NT16 NT71 and NT67 \u2192 NT95 NT42. Not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's see what each NT can produce towards the terminals.\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and those can go on. But perhaps it's easier to look for the possible sequences that can generate the given string.\n\nWait, another thought: in the string, the first part is t91 t101, which is two terminals. So in the derivation, somewhere, we must have an expansion that results in t91 followed by t101.\n\nFrom the grammar, I look for a production where a non-terminal A directly produces t91 t101. Alternatively, each step is a binary expansion, so the number of symbols doubles each time. But wait, the initial S splits into two, then each of those splits again, leading to exponential growth. However, in this case, the string has 14 terminals, which isn't a power of two. Hmm, that suggests that the derivation might have taken a path that didn't fully expand all non-terminals, or perhaps some of the non-terminals don't go all the way to terminals, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a typical derivation, each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols until all are terminals. However, the length of the string should be 2^n where n is the number of production steps. So a string of length 14 isn't a power of two, which suggests that perhaps the grammar can't generate it, but I need to check more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several expansions. Let me think about the possible sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split into two parts, each of which could result from a single expansion. The first two terms are t91 t101. Let's see if any NT can produce t91 t101. Looking at the productions, I don't see an NT that directly produces t91 and t101. So maybe the first expansion is from NT91 \u2192 t17 t164 (from NT91 \u2192 NT17 NT...? Wait, no. Let's check the grammar.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17.\n\nSo NT91 expands into NT6 and NT17. Then, NT6 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT6 can expand into:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12, NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71, etc. It's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to work backwards. The string ends with t22, so perhaps the last step was an NT that expands to t22. Looking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't22' \u2014 no, wait, in the grammar, NT22 is defined as:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see an NT22. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, there's a production NT22 \u2192 't22'? Let me check the given productions. I see NT24 \u2192 't123', but not NT22. Wait, I might have missed it.\n\nWait, let me list all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT7 \u2192 't151'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' (wait, actually, no, looking back through the grammar, I don't see NT22. Wait, let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar list, I don't see any NT22. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. Oh, I see NT24 \u2192 't123' and NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't129', but not NT22. So perhaps there's no NT that directly expands to t22. Then, t22 in the string must be a production that includes t22. Wait, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t22. So perhaps the string is invalid because t22 has no expansion.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar again. Oh, yes, the only NT that appears to have a 't22' is in the production of NT22 \u2192 't22'? Wait, actually, in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t22. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I only see NT28 \u2192 't76', NT67 \u2192 't67', etc. Hmm, so perhaps t22 can't be generated, meaning the string has a terminal that isn't produced by any NT, making the string invalid. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me make sure I didn't miss any NT that produces t22. Going through the list: NT2 \u2192 't26', NT7 \u2192 't151', NT12 \u2192 't80', NT16 \u2192 't112', etc., but no NT that directly produces t22. Therefore, t22 cannot appear in the string because there's no NT that can expand to it, which means the string is invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given grammar only produces terminals through non-terminals, but there's no NT that produces 't22', so the string contains an unmatched terminal. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-223","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky normal form. The string to check is \"t91 t101 t165 t130 t171 t54 t94 t123 t98 t2 t105 t69 t94 t24\". \n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a set of production rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. \n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived by this grammar. Breaking it down, I think the approach is to reverse-engineer the string by working backwards from the start symbol and seeing if I can reach it by applying the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is the start symbol because it's the topmost rule. The string starts with \"t91\", so I need to find which production rules can produce \"t91\" or sequences leading to it. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT91 can be derived in a couple of ways. For example, NT91 is given by NT69, NT94; NT19 can be NT74, NT46; and NT101 can be NT73, NT30... Wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nI notice that some of the higher numbers like NT91 have multiple productions. For example, NT91 -> NT69 NT94 and NT19 -> NT74 NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t91. Let's see where t91 comes from. In the grammar, I see NT91 is a rule that can produce t91, right? Wait, looking at the definitions:\n\nAh, I see some definitions where NT12 -> 't80', but in the given grammar, not all terminal symbols are explicitly defined. Wait, no, looking through the grammar, most rule RHSs consist of other non-terminals, but some have 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFor example, NT1 -> 't107' 't17', and NT17 is defined as 't22', etc. But in the string, I'm seeing t91, t101, t165, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking carefully, I see that in the grammar, several grammar rules have replacements that include 't' followed by numbers, which are terminal symbols. For instance, NT24 -> 't123', NT49 -> 't144', etc. So these 't' terms are terminals.\n\nSo to process the string, each 'tX' is a terminal symbol, and the other symbols are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, if a term starts with 't', is that a terminal? Or maybe, wait, maybe all the non-terminals have two symbols before the 't', which are actually more operations, but in this dataset, it seems that the non-terminals are the ones with 'N' followed by T, like NT1, NT2, etc. \n\nBut perhaps the 't' terms are the leaves, terminal symbols, and the non-terminals are the intermediate symbols that build up to these 'tX' symbols.\n\nSo, to process the string \"t91 t101 t165 t130 t171 t54 t94 t123 t98 t2 t105 t69 t94 t24\", I'll need to see if it can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me list the terminal tokens in the given string: they are all the t followed by numbers. I'll note their positions:\n\n1. t91\n2. t101\n3. t165\n4. t130\n5. t171\n6. t54\n7. t94\n8. t123\n9. t98\n10. t2\n11. t105\n12. t69\n13. t94\n14. t24\n\nEach of these tX is a terminal.\n\nNow, to see if the string is possible, I need to find a derivation path from S to this string by applying the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is defined as NT91, NT69. So S -> NT91 NT69. So the string must start with the expansion of NT91 and NT69.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terms are t91 and t101. Let's see if that aligns with any production of NT91 and NT69.\n\nWait, NT91 can produce t91, but let's look at how NT91 is defined:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT91 -> NT69 NT94. So that's one possibility. Another possibility is: checking if NT91 can be a terminal. But in the grammar, NT91 is actually defined as NT69 NT94, which are non-terminals. So NT91 must be broken down further.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two symbols are t91 and t101. So in the grammar, if NT91 can be expanded to t91, that's one possibility, but according to the given rules, NT91 is a non-terminal and is defined as NT69 NT94. So I cannot have NT91 being a terminal; NT91 is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the first token in the string must be generated by one of these non-terminals, but I see it's t91, which is a terminal. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, maybe some non-terminals can produce a single terminal, but looking at the grammar, all the non-terminals seem to be generating two other symbols, except for some that have terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let's clarify: some non-terminals have productions that include a single terminal. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nI see NT91 -> NT69 NT94 (two non-terminals)\nAlso, NT12 -> 't80' (terminal)\nSimilarly, NT92 -> 't74' etc.\n\nSo in the given grammar, some non-terminals can produce a single terminal, others produce two non-terminals. So for our string, the first term is t91, which would have to be generated by a production where S or a derived non-terminal produces t91.\n\nBut since S is NT91, NT91 must expand into t91. But in the given productions, NT91 is always expanding into two non-terminals (for example, NT91 is defined as NT69 NT94). So unless NT91 can produce a single terminal somehow.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I realize that some of the non-terminals have productions that include a terminal. For example:\n\nNT91 isn't directly a terminal, but in the string, we have t91. So perhaps through the rules, NT91 can be expressed such that one side is t91, but looking at the provided rules, I don't see NT91 being immediately a terminal.\n\nWait, I see that NT91 has a production as NT69 NT94, but perhaps NT69 can produce t91 or something else.\n\nLet me try to find a way for the string to be generated step by step.\n\nSo starting with S: S -> NT91 NT69.\n\nTherefore, the first two symbols must come from the expansion of NT91 and NT69. The string given has the first symbol as t91, which would have to come from either NT91, NT69, or some other derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to reverse-engineer the string.\n\nWe can model the parsing as beginning with the string and trying to reduce it step by step to the start symbol.\n\nBut sometimes, top-down parsing is not straightforward, so bottom-up parsing is easier but the process can often be complex. Alternatively, I might try to see if the given string can be formed by using the rules.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t91, t101, I need to find if t91 comes from either NT91 or some other non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, t91 is a terminal, so for t91 to appear, it must be produced directly by a rule, but in the given grammar, perhaps NT91 can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see some rules where a non-terminal is followed by a single terminal:\n\nFor example, NT91 -> NT69 NT94 (two non-terminals)\nBut another possibility might be non-terminals that can produce terminal symbols, such as:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice some non-terminals that have RHS of a terminal and another non-terminal. For example, NT73 -> 't50' NT23...

{"custom_id":"request-246","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t91 t101 t139 t130 t98 t63 t139 t101 t2 t94 t174 t50 t69 t94 t22\", and the grammar is a set of production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has each production rule of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, and B and C are not the same. In this grammar, the start symbol seems to be S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that it's a highly complex one with a lot of non-terminals. The production rules produce various terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by a number. For example, some rules include 't17', 't24', etc. So, my task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nThe string given has 15 tokens: t91, t101, t139, t130, t98, t63, t139, t101, t2, t94, t174, t50, t69, t94, t22. I need to check if each of these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF and seems complex, it might be challenging to parse manually. Typically, for such problems, especially with such a large and complex grammar, I would consider a parsing approach. However, since this is a thought process, I'll try to figure out the possible derivations step by step.\n\nI'll start from the beginning. The string starts with t91, which must come from some production rule. Looking at the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S starts with two non-terminals, each of which can produce other terms. \n\nPerhaps I should break down the string step by step, looking for possible connections. Each token in the string must directly come from a terminal production, which in the grammar seems to be a rule that ends with 't' followed by some number, like NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, and then perhaps somewhere downstream, NT75 or NT57 leads to a 't' token. \n\nAlternatively, some of the 't's might be generated by multiple steps. For example, looking at NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39, and then NT6 \u2192 t108 (from the grammar) or NT39 \u2192 t48. Hmm, but I'm not sure if these sequences can form t22, for example.\n\nWait, t22 is at the end. Let me look at the grammar. Hmm, I see a production NT71 \u2192 NT80 NT42. Does that lead to t22? I see NT42 \u2192 NT165, which is beyond my glance, but eventually, maybe some rules lead to t22. But without seeing the exact path, it's hard to track.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of non-terminals and terminals. In a typical leftmost derivation, each step of the grammar expansion introduces more non-terminals. The string length is 15, which would trace back to a derivation length of 15, but without knowing the exact structure, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to look at the string and see if it can be produced by the grammar by checking each step for possible 't's. Since the string starts with t91, I need to see if any of the non-terminals can derive to t91. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule that directly produces t91. But perhaps via a chain of productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice a rule NT74 \u2192 NT146, and NT146 isn't a terminal. Maybe that's not it. Perhaps looking further down, NT75 \u2192 NT98, and then NT98 \u2192 NT1 NT65. NT1 is another non-terminal. Hmm, maybe that's a way to reach t65 or t98. Not directly t91.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any rules that have t91 as a terminal. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT74 \u2192 t100 and NT94 \u2192 t74, and some others. Hmm, maybe through a chain:\n\nLet's see, for example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSuppose NT99 can derive to t91, and NT89 can derive to something else, but I don't see a direct production of t91.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through another production. Let me check NT99. From the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 \u2192 t108, so that would give t108 followed by what NT103 produces.\n\nWait, NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. So if NT24 \u2192 t123 and NT45 \u2192 t98, then that part would produce something like t123 t98. So if S \u2192 NT99 NT89, that could be NT99 (which could produce t108 t103), and then NT89. Hmm, NT89 can also lead to various options.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the entire string. Each 't' must be generated by a rule eventually. Let me pick the first token, t91. Looking at the grammar, is there any rule that produces t91? Scanning through all the terminal rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t22\n- NT16 \u2192 t54\n- NT11 \u2192 t17\n- NT107 \u2192 t174, t65\n- NT96 \u2192 t91, and others\n- NT76 \u2192 t45\n- NT69 \u2192 t133\n- NT91 \u2192 t164\n- NT42 \u2192 t139, t158\n- NT102 \u2192 t13\n- NT139 \u2192 t130\n- NT98 \u2192 t49\n- NT50 \u2192 t96\n- NT69 \u2192 t1\n- NT19 \u2192 t99\n- NT23 \u2192 t156, t171\n- NT36 \u2192 t47\n- NT49 \u2192 t115\n- NT52 \u2192 t107, t81, etc.\n- NT77 \u2192 t124, t56\n- NT68 \u2192 t145, t28\n- NT84 \u2192 t102\n- NT73 \u2192 t167\n- NT15 \u2192 t90\n- NT71 \u2192 t69\n- NT70 \u2192 t162\n- NT75 \u2192 t98\n- NT88 \u2192 t69\n- NT46 \u2192 t99\n- NT39 \u2192 t34, t48\n- NT96 \u2192 t91, t108\n- NT17 \u2192 t22\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- NT11 \u2192 t17\n- NT9 \u2192 various, but I don't see t9 in the string.\n\nLooking at NT96 \u2192 t91. So if at any point a non-terminal produces NT96, which then can produce t91. So if in the string, there's a subsequence that comes from NT96 producing t91, that might be possible.\n\nBut looking at the string, t91 is the second token after a much later part. Hmm. Wait, the first token is t91, so for that, perhaps the entire derivation starts with some production that eventually leads to t91.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, so S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nIf NT99 eventually leads to t91 and NT89 leads to something else, maybe that's a possibility, but I need to see.\n\nLooking at NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nNT6 \u2192 t108 (from rule NT6 \u2192 t108).\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45.\n\nNT24 \u2192 t123, or NT103 leads to NT24 and NT45.\n\nWait, so NT24 could be t123 or perhaps another path.\n\nAlternatively, if NT99 can produce t108 t103, and NT89 can produce something else. Then perhaps this would be further expanded.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that could lead to the first token being t91.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider another production. For example, NT91 \u2192 t164 and t something else.\n\nBut in the string, t91 is used as the first token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S is producing something else, but the only production for S is NT99 and NT89.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplic"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-249","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal on the right, except for the start symbol S, which can produce two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string we're evaluating: `t91 t101 t165 t130 t94 t2 t171 t49 t100 t94 t0 t50 t141 t94 t24`. \n\nI notice that each token like `t91` or `t101` seems to correspond to a non-terminal in the productions. So, I should map these tokens back to their corresponding non-terminals. It looks like each `tX` corresponds to the non-terminal named after the same number, like t91 corresponds to NT91, t101 to NT101, and so on.\n\nNow, let's start analyzing the string step by step. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. `t91`: This is NT91. Looking at the grammar, NT91 is only involved in a production that produces NT94 and NT73 (NT91 \u2192 NT94 NT73). But wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT91 is actually used in NT6's production: NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT42, etc. Wait, let me check the grammar properly.\n\nWait, the grammar provided seems a bit complex. Let me see which non-terminals produce `tX` tokens. For example, `t91` must come from NT91, but looking through the productions, I don't see NT91 as a production. Hmm, actually, maybe each `tX` corresponds to a specific production.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has many productions where a non-terminal is replaced by two other non-terminals that eventually produce a token (like 'tX'). For example, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1, and so on, but I need to figure out which non-terminals lead to the tokens in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers correspond to specific production rules that lead directly to a token. For example, if a production rule for a non-terminal directly results in a 'tX', then using that production would add that token. So maybe I should check which non-terminals have productions that directly write a 'tX'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some rules where the right-hand side is a direct token. For example, NT42 \u2192 NT54 NT65? No, wait, that's another non-terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking for rules that have a token like tX on the right side. But in the grammar, most of the rules are non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the grammar seems to end with certain rules that lead to 'tX' tokens. For instance, look at the rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\nNT16 \u2192 't112'\nWait, no, that's not the case. Wait, the grammar has some rules that end in 'tX', like NT16 \u2192 't112', but that's part of the definition. But in the string, we have `t91`, which should come from a production that eventually reaches NT91 and produces that 't91' token.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'tX' is a terminal symbol derived from a specific non-terminal. For example, NT7 is produced as t151, but looking at the grammar, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I should list all the non-terminals that directly produce 'tX'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see:\n\n- NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49, and in the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31, NT49 \u2192 NT102 NT2, etc.\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe a better approach is to work backwards from each token in the string to see if there's a production path that can generate them.\n\nStarting with the first token, t91. Which non-terminals produce t91? Let's look through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64, but that doesn't give t91. Wait, perhaps I should check which rules directly produce 't91'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't164'? No, wait, in the grammar, the rule is NT91 \u2192 't134' etc. Wait, no, actually, looking again: I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't91'. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'tX' is a terminal symbol that the grammar produces. Therefore, to see if the string is in the language, we have to check if each token can be derived from some non-terminal, and that the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given grammar is such that each non-terminal X produces exactly one terminal symbol, but in reality, most of them split into other non-terminals. So, perhaps the string is built by replacing the start symbol S step by step, and each replacement must match one of the productions.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to consider the start symbol S and see if it can derive the string through a series of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and its initial production is S \u2192 NT91 NT89. So the first step is to expand S into NT91 and NT89. Now, each of these must be expanded into their respective productions, and the resulting string of terminals should match the input.\n\nSo, the string starts with t91 and t101. From the start, S \u2192 NT91 NT89, so after the first expansion, we get t91 and t101, which matches the string's first part: t91 t101.\n\nSo far, so good. Now, let's look at NT91 and NT89's productions.\n\nNT91: Let's find its production in the grammar. Looking through, I see:\n\nNT91 \u2192 't164'\u2014wait, no, that's not right.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t91 t101 t24 t72 t171 t112 t76 t80 t101 t65 t36 t165 t98 t8 t141 t178`. \n\nFirst, I should understand what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided has rules that seem to fit this structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which is a start symbol expanding into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals (like NT99, NT89, etc.) have production rules that expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nMy task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. Since the string starts with t91, I need to trace back how these terminals could have been produced.\n\nI notice that some of the rules have terminals as their right-hand sides, like NT1 \u2192 't26', NT2 \u2192 't26', which might help in breaking down the string.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step, looking for possible matches in the grammar:\n\n1. The first token is t91. Looking at the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, and NT6 \u2192 't108'. But t91 isn't directly a terminal, so maybe trace backward. NT91 \u2192 ... perhaps it can produce t9. Wait, looking at the rules, NT9 \u2192 't134', but I don't see a direct rule for NT91 producing a terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT91 can split into NT6 and NT17, and both might eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need a better approach. Perhaps I should see if each 't' corresponds to a production I know.\n\nLooking more closely:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17\n- NT6 \u2192 't108'\n- NT17 \u2192 NT24\n\nSo, t91 can come from NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. NT6 becomes t108, so maybe it's a way to get a t ending with 108, but in our string, the next after t91 is t101. Hmm, that might not fit directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check if each 't' is present as a terminal in the grammar. I see several t's with numbers like t91, t101, t24, t72, etc., so they must all have corresponding production rules.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't26'\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134'\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT29 \u2192 't36' and 't156'\n- NT31 \u2192 't34'\n- NT33 \u2192 't23' and 't80'\n- NT35 \u2192 't40' and 't105'\n- NT39 \u2192 't23' and 't144'\n- NT42 \u2192 't139' and 't158'\n- NT43 \u2192 't2'\n- NT45 \u2192 't98'\n- NT46 \u2192 't99'\n- NT48 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't115'\n- NT52 \u2192 't104' and 't177'\n- NT57 \u2192 't172'\n- NT61 \u2192 't84' and 't93'\n- NT64 \u2192 't24'\n- NT65 \u2192 't157' and 't8'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT73 \u2192 't167' and 't90'\n- NT75 \u2192 't98'\n- NT76 \u2192 't121'\n- NT106 \u2192 't94'\n- NT107 \u2192 't56' and 't174'\n- NT108 \u2192 't118'\n- NT11 \u2192 't17'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT19 \u2192 't99'\n- NT21 \u2192 't171'\n- NT22 \u2192 ...? Wait, checking the grammar, I see NT27 at the end. Wait, no, the original list ends at several NT19 and others, but I might be missing something.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see NT100 \u2192 't127'.\n\nBut wait, in the rules provided, there's:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't84', 't93'\n\nBut in the string, I see after t91 is t101, then t24. Maybe I'm making it too complicated. Perhaps I should see if the entire string can be derived by chaining the appropriate productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token in the string is t91, which could come from a production like NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. Then NT6 is 't108', but t91's next is t101, which I don't see a direct association with.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of a series of these t's, each from a terminal rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire string as the result of applying the grammar's productions step by step. Each t must be the result of some terminal production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that each production either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and then each of these NTs expand into t's via their production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of all the terminals generated from the grammar, but without considering the non-terminals. Hmm, but the string has only terminals, so the grammar must be able to derive a string of these terminals through leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t in the string is a terminal that appears in some production's right-hand side. So let's map which t's are possible from the given grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t26\n- NT2 \u2192 t26\n- NT9 \u2192 t134\n- NT17 \u2192 t24\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- NT29 \u2192 t36, t156\n- NT31 \u2192 t34\n- NT33 \u2192 t23, t80\n- NT35 \u2192 t40, t105\n- NT39 \u2192 t23, t144\n- NT42 \u2192 t139, t158\n- NT43 \u2192 t2\n- NT45 \u2192 t98\n- NT46 \u2192 t99\n- NT48 \u2192 t11\n- NT49 \u2192 t115\n- NT52 \u2192 t104, t177\n- NT57 \u2192 t172\n- NT61 \u2192 t84, t93\n- NT64 \u2192 t24\n- NT65 \u2192 t157, t8\n- NT71 \u2192 t69\n- NT73 \u2192 t167, t90\n- NT75 \u2192 t98\n- NT76 \u2192 t121\n- NT80 \u2192 t63\n- NT85 \u2192 t...\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some in the initial description.

Let me jot down the grammar rules first to get a clearer picture.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts as NT99 NT99 and others. Each rule seems to break down numbers into other symbols, with some symbols being terminals (like 't' followed by numbers) and others being non-terminals (NT followed by numbers, like NT108). \n\nThe string we need to check consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are probably terminals. So the problem is to see if the string's structure matches the grammar.\n\nFirst, I think I need to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since it's context-free and Chomsky Normal Form, it can be parsed with a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm, but since the string is short, maybe I can try to build a derivation tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t108 t101 t65 t22 t8 ... etc., 15 tokens in total.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar rules and see if they can produce the given tokens. Let me see if any of the NT rules directly produce a terminal. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces a single 't' number, so each node must be made up of smaller non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, maybe some rules produce two terminals and the rest produce non-terminals. That complicates things because the string is all terminals.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Let me double-check: Each rule seems to split into two NT symbols, which might produce other NTs or terminals. Since the given string has 15 tokens, I need to see if there are 14 steps (since each production at each level produces two tokens).\n\nWait, actually, in a context-free grammar, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So to generate a string of length N, you need something like N-1 steps.\n\nGiven the string has 15 tokens, starting from S, the derivations would multiply the number of tokens. So S would produce two NTs, each of which produces two more, etc. So it's a binary tree structure.\n\nGiven that, each production of a non-terminal will produce two tokens, so the number of tokens grows exponentially. However, since some non-terminals may produce more non-terminals, the path through the grammar must generate exactly the given string.\n\nWait, but the given string is all terminals, so each path from S to the string must produce exactly these terminals without any non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, each rule produces two non-terminals (like S->NT99 NT99), meaning the entire string would have to be produced through a series of productions that don't involve terminals. But the given string is all terminals, so that's impossible unless the grammar somehow doesn't have any rules directly producing terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me look again. Oh, some of the NT rules are split into a 't' and another NT. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT108 -> 't118' ?\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided rules, some lines indicate that NTx is a terminal. For example:\n\nNT108 -> t118\n\nWait, maybe they've abbreviated some NT rules as terminal productions. Let me re-express some of these rules as terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking at NT96 -> NT33 NT36 (line 19). Wait, no, line 18 is NT33 -> NT80 NT23. Line 42: NT89 -> NT44 NT1. Line 50: NT12 -> t80.\n\nWait, wait a minute, on the given grammar rules, there are some entries that show NT... -> 't...'. For example:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT68 is defined as -> NT45 NT71, but I also see NT69 is defined as -> 't121', or similar. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the rules are jumbled, but for example, line 19 is NT108 -> NT65 NT71. Earlier, I saw:\n\nNT65 is defined as -> NT106 NT71.\n\nWait, maybe I should more carefully re-transcribe the grammar. Maybe some of the rules are terminal productions. For example:\n\nLooking at line 27: NT60 -> 't90'\n\nWait, in line 43: NT29 -> 't29'?

{"custom_id":"request-290","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like t91, t101, etc.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, all productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems most of the productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz, which fits the CNF structure. Some have terminals, like 't91' or 't99', which are terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t91 t101 t17 t158 t130 t156 t93 t98 t63 t165 t101 t123 t98 t0 t8 t69 t178`\n\nEach of these tokens is a single terminal symbol, so the entire string is a concatenation of these symbols. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nIn CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal, the parsing of the string should correspond to a leftmost derivation that matches this structure.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level production: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string must start with NT99 and NT89. Let's see: the first token is t91, which is T(91), and the next is t101. Hmm, in the grammar, does NT99 correspond to t91 or t101? I need to check the productions for NT99.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36, and NT77 \u2192 NT178 NT65. So, for example, NT96 generates t33 and t36. But the starting symbol S is NT99 NT89. So S must expand into NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo, the first two symbols of the string should be the results of NT99 and NT89. Wait, the string starts with t91 and t101. I need to check if NT99 can produce t91 and t101.\n\nLooking for NT99 in the productions, I notice that NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36, but not directly NT99. Then, looking deeper, maybe NT99 can be decomposed via other productions. For example, NT91 \u2192 NT100 NT42, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should track back. Let me check what NT99 can derive. From the given productions, NT99 is mentioned in a few places. For instance, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (I think I might have misread earlier; looking again, the grammar has NT99: let me check. Oh, looking through the grammar, I see that NT96 is defined, but I don't see NT99; maybe I misread. Let me go through the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at the list:\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT97 \u2192 NT126 NT97\n- Wait, this might get confusing. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t91, t101. If S \u2192 NT99 NT89, then I need:\n- NT99 should generate t91 and its corresponding part.\n- NT89 should generate t101.\n\nLooking at NT99, let me check the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see NT99 as part of NT52 \u2192 NT107 NT81, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should look for NT99 being a non-terminal that can produce terminals. Or perhaps NT99 can be split into multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out which terminals correspond to which non-terminals. For example, some NTs are mapped to specific terminals. For example, in the given grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 T107 NT17\n- But wait, in the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 t22, and NT1 \u2192 t107, etc. Similarly, NT45 \u2192 t98, NT22 \u2192 t123, and so on. So each NT has a specific expansion path.\n\nLet me try to find a path from NT99 and NT89 to t91 and t101 respectively.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT99:\n\nNT99: I don't see a production for NT99 immediately. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan through the productions again. Looking through, I see that NT91 \u2192 NT100 NT42, but that's not directly NT99.\n\nWait, perhaps NT99 is an intermediate non-terminal that isn't directly defined but rather through other steps. Alternatively, maybe it's derived through other productions. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: parse the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string should be T99 T89.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are t91 and t101. Let me check how T91 can be generated.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT91 is defined as \u2192 NT100 NT42 (I think I've seen that). So, NT91 can split into two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals can be further split or generate terminals.\n\nBut the first token is t91, so let me see if NT91 can produce t91.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT91 \u2192 NT100 NT42. Both NT100 and NT42 are non-terminals. Then, each can be split further:\n\n- NT100 \u2192 NT67 NT73 (I think, looking at the productions, I think I saw NT106 \u2192 NT93 NT107, but perhaps NT100 is another case)\nWait, perhaps I need to better map each NT to its possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that in the grammar, each NT can be thought of as a binary tree where each node is a production. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must reduce each non-terminal into terminal steps.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to parse the string using the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing context-free grammars in CNF.\n\nFirst, list the string as tokens: t91, t101, t17, t158, t130, t156, t93, t98, t63, t165, t101, t123, t98, t0, t8, t69, t178.\n\nCyk algorithm steps:\n\n1. Identify all symbols in the string: {t91, t101, t17, t158, t130, t156, t93, t98, t63, t165, t101, t123, t98, t0, t8, t69, t178}.\n\n2. Initialize a table where each cell (i,j) corresponds to the substring starting at i and ending at j (inclusive). For each position (i,j), fill it with the non-terminals that can derive that substring.\n\nBut before that, I think it's better to see if each token in the string is a terminal that can be generated by some NT.\n\nFor example, looking at t91: is there a production NT91 \u2192 t91? Let me check the grammar. Yes, I see NT91 \u2192 NT100 NT42, but does any production for NT91 result in a terminal? Or is it only via multiple steps.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, NT91 is defined as NT91 \u2192 NT100 NT42. Neither of these are terminals, so we have to go further. For NT100, perhaps it produces more non-terminals, and so on. So t91 might not be a direct production of any NT, but perhaps via deeper productions.\n\nSimilarly, t101: I think there's an NT101, but looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT101 defined. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT101 is defined as NT6 \u2192 t91, wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list out all the NT productions and see their possible expansions:\n\nFrom the grammar, here are some key productions:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT100 NT42\n- NT101 \u2192 NT100 NT93 (I think I'm recalling from the grammar; let me look again"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar is given with S and several NT productions. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t-tagged items. Each 't' appears to be a terminal, followed by a number. Each tag like t91, t101, etc., corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, I see 't91' which I know from the grammar corresponds to NT91. Similarly, 't101' corresponds to NT101, and so on.\n\nSo, first, I'll map the given string to its corresponding non-terminals. Let me list them:\n\nt91 -> NT91\nt101 -> NT101\nt65 -> NT65\nt24 -> NT24\nt171 -> NT171\nt93 -> NT93\nt110 -> NT110\nt101 -> NT101\nt123 -> NT123\nt98 -> NT98\nt174 -> NT174\nt50 -> NT50\nt158 -> NT158\nt98 -> NT98\nt8 -> NT8\nt141 -> NT141\nt45 -> NT45\n\nNow, I'll check each of these non-terminals to see if they are defined in the grammar and then try to see if the sequence makes sense as a derivation.\n\nStarting with S:\n- S -> NT99 NT99 (from the given grammar: S->NT99NT99)\nWait, no, looking back, S is defined as S->NT99 NT99. So S is starting with NT99 and NT99.\n\nSo the string begins with t91 t101 t65 t... Hmm, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because according to the grammar, S generates NT99 and NT99. But in our string, the first NT is NT91, which is different. So there's a problem here. Did I get the NT mapping wrong? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is S->NT99 NT99, meaning both symbols must be NT99. So their corresponding t-tag must be t99. But the string starts with t91, which would correspond to NT91, not NT99. That seems inconsistent. Unless I'm miscounting or the mapping is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Let me double-check the grammar. Let me see:\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals. So I need to find if the beginning of the string can derive from NT99.\n\nIn the string, the first two tokens should both be t99, right? Because S->NT99 NT99.\n\nBut in the string, the first is t91, which is NT91, and the second is t101, which is NT101. So that would mean the starting S can't generate these, since S only produces NT99 NT99.\n\nSo that suggests that the string cannot be generated, which would mean the answer is 'No'. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any rules where NT99 can produce other NTs? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT99. It's only in S. So NT99 is only defined as S, which is NT99 -> NT99 NT99. Therefore, NT99 can't derive any other NTs. Therefore, the string starts with NT91 and NT101, which can't be generated from NT99.\n\nWait, but hold on, perhaps I made an error in mapping. Let me check again:\n\nIn the string: t91 t101 t65... etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT91 -> NT65 NT24 (from the grammar: NT91 -> NT65 NT24)\nSo, t91 is NT91, which is NT65 and NT24.\n\nThen, the next part is t101, which is NT101, but in the grammar, looking for NT101, I don't see any production listed. The grammar has NT105: NT105 -> NT24 NT45, but nothing for NT101. So NT101 must be a starting symbol, but in this grammar, NT101 isn't defined. So in the given grammar, the non-terminals are all defined with production rules, so NT101 must be the start, but wait, the grammar starts with S.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The grammar's non-terminals might start with S or other NTs, but in this case, the production for S is S->NT99 NT99, so everything is built from NT99. Therefore, any NTs in the string must be derived from NT99, which only produces NT99 NT99, so all non-terminals must be 99. However, the string starts with 91, 101, etc., which suggests that the string can't be derived from S.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me try to parse the string.\n\nEach tX is a non-terminal X. So the string is a sequence of X1 X2 X3 ... Xn. Let me try to see if this sequence can be generated as a derivation.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT99 NT99. So S starts as NT99 NT99.\n\nSo the first step is that the first NT99 can't produce anything except NT99 and NT99. So NT99 must be expanded to NT99 NT99 again, ad infinitum. So all usages of NT99 will result in strings of NT99.\n\nBut in the string, we have other NTs, like NT101, which must come from somewhere. Since NT101 isn't defined in the grammar (I don't see a production for NT101), it can't be generated. Therefore, the string can't be generated because it contains non-terminals other than 99.\n\nWait, but looking back, the grammar does have some other non-terminals. Let me check for other definitions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT11 is defined as NT81 NT29. So NT11 is a composite. But the string uses t11, which is NT11.\n\nBut in the string, tokens include t91, t101, t65, etc. Let me check if any of these NTs have defined production rules.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT123 is defined as NT103 NT45. So t123 is NT123.\n\n- NT42 is defined as NT54 NT75. So t42 is NT42.\n\n- NT158 is defined as NT52 NT99. So t158 is NT158.\n\nBut looking for NTs in the string:\n\nt91 is NT91, which from the grammar, is defined as NT65 NT24.\n\nt101 is NT101, which is not defined in the grammar (since I don't see a production rule for NT101, unless I'm missing it, but looking again, I don't see any NT101). So NT101 can't be derived, which means the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting or misnaming the NTs. Let me go through each token in the string and see if each NT has a production in the grammar.\n\nt91: NT91 -> NT65 NT24 (yes, defined)\nt101: NT101 -> ? (I don't see a production for NT101; this seems missing)\nt65: NT65 -> NT106 NT71 (yes, defined)\nt24: NT24 -> NT106 NT73 (is it? Wait, I don't see that. Let me check: looking through the grammar, I see NT106 -> NT35 NT107, but not NT24. Wait, in the grammar, under NT24, it's defined as NT24 -> ...? Wait no, checking: the initial grammar starts with S->NT99 NT99, and then it's a list of NT-> production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in mapping"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the initial expansion should start from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t91 t101 t158 t98 t171 t41 t65 t72 t171 t108 t101 t67 t91 t144 t158 t69 t94 t24.\n\nI notice that everything in the string is a terminal symbol (like t91, t101, etc.), so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nEach production rule can be broken down into two parts. For example, S -> NT99 NT89. So, the first step is to produce two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89. Each of these can further expand based on their own rules.\n\nI should list all the production rules involving these terminals to see how they relate. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT89 -> NT44 NT1\n- ... and so on for all NT and the t rules.\n\nWait, some of the terminals in the string are mapped to specific NT rules. For example, t91 is mapped to NT15 -> 't151'. So, each 't' in the string corresponds to a specific NT production rule.\n\nLet me map each 't' to its NT rule:\n\nt91 -> NT15 (since NT15 -> 't151' doesn't directly map, wait, no. Wait, I have to see which NT rules produce terminal symbols. Looking back at the rules, NT15 -> 't151'? Wait, not exactly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules provided:\n\nNT15 -> 't21'? Or wait, no, the rules show:\n\nNT7 -> 't21' (since NT7 -> NT21 NT9, and then in the rules, NT7 is mapped to 't151'? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me list all the terminals and their corresponding NT rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't21' (line: \"NT7 -> NT21 NT9; NT21 -> 't171'; NT9 -> 't24'; so NT7 produces 't21' through NT21 and NT9. Wait, no, actually, the rules show mappings like NT18 -> NT35 NT43, which in another rule says NT35 -> NT68 NT103. But then there are specific t rules: for example, NT21 -> 't171' and NT9 -> 't24'.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me go through each t in the string and find their corresponding NT and then their production.\n\n1. t91: Looking at the rules, which NT rule produces 't91'? Let me scan through.\n\nLooking through NT17: \"NT17 -> 't22'\". No. NT100 -> 't127' and 't96'. NT11 -> 't17'. NT19 -> 't99'. NT29 -> 't156' and 't129'. NT24 -> 't123'. NT68 -> 't145', 't134', 't24'. NT77 -> 't56' and others. Hmm, I don't see 't91' directly. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules provided:\n\nI see NT22 -> 't122'? No, I don't see that. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check each NT rule for terminal mapping.\n\nWait, for example: NT29 -> 't36' and 't156' and 't129'. So, 't29' is mapped to those terminals. But our string has 't91', 't101', etc. Let's look for each 't' in the string.\n\nLet's make a list:\n\nt91: Looking at all the NT rules that produce 't91'. Checking the rules provided, I don't see an NT rule where the production ends with 't91'. Wait, wait, maybe I'm looking in the right place. Let's scan through.\n\nLooking at the longer rules: For example, NT28 -> 't76'. NT67 -> 't67' (so 't67' is exactly the result of NT67). NT33 -> 't23'. NT55 -> 't72'. Wait, maybe 't91' is derived from some NT rule. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Maybe a better approach is to create a mapping from each 't' in the string to its corresponding NT. Let me list each occurrence:\n\n- t91: Looking at the rules, I see some NT rules ending with 't91'. Looking through all the NT rules, for example:\n\nLooking at NT43 -> 't2' (maybe not). NT69 -> 't1'. NT98 -> 't98' (but that's a non-terminal, wait no). Wait, in the rules, there's NT15 -> 't151'? No, I think I'm misinterpreting. Wait, looking for 't91', perhaps it's part of some NT rule. Let me find:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I can see NT15 -> 't151', but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps it's better to note that each terminal is the result of a specific NT's production. For example, each 't...' is caused by a specific NT rule that directly maps to that terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't21' (because NT71 -> 't50' etc.? Wait, maybe I should find which NT rules directly produce a 't' symbol. For example:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 -> 't107' and NT17.\n\nWait, let me scan through all the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> NT107 NT17; NT17 is mapped to 't171'.\n\n- So, NT1 produces 't107' when NT107 expands to that.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t91, t101, etc. Let's check each 't':\n\nt91: Looking for which NT rules produce 't91'. Do any NT rules have 't91' directly? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see an NT rule that directly maps to 't91'. Hmm, maybe multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree. Starting from S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nThen, each NT will expand, potentially creating more NTs, until all leaves are terminals.\n\nBut with a string of 17 symbols, it's quite long, so I need a systematic way.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each 't' in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 't's in the string and see if each can be matched to a possible NT production.\n\n1. t91: Let's check if there's an NT that can expand to 't91'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that NT66 -> NT106 NT71, but I don't see a direct 't91' there. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at the NT rules and see which ones can produce these t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Let me check all NT rules that end with a 't'.\n\nFor example, NT2 -> 't26', NT7 -> 't21', NT9 -> 't16', NT17 -> 't22', etc.\n\nBut in the string, I have t91, which isn't directly a result of any NT rule. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe t91 is part of the terminal sequence derived from two NTs. Let me think about the structure.\n\nEach step in the grammar combines two NTs into terminals or further NTs.\n\nFor example, starting with S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nThen, each of NT99 and NT89 expand into more NTs, which then expand until they become 't's.\n\nBut tracking all 17 't's might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to check if the string can be decomposed into parts that match the possible sequences.\n\nAnother approach is to check the start: the first"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-303","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t91 t101 t158 t130 t110 t101 t2 t171 t134 t177 t108 t101 t67 t167 t165 t141 t94 t24`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars are structured such that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and is followed by two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which fits the form A \u2192 BC, where NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals, and 't91' would be a terminal if it's a terminal symbol. Wait, but in the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully. The grammar is given as rules like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, which is two non-terminals, so that's CNF. Other rules have terminals on the right-hand side, like maybe NT99 -> 't91', but when I look through the provided grammar, I notice that some non-terminals do have terminal symbols as options, like NT24 -> 't123', which could be a production rule where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal symbol. So that's allowed in CNF, as long as it's A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I think I can approach it by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is given in CNF, I can use a CYK parser, which efficiently parses such grammars. But since I don't have access to a CYK parser, perhaps I can do it more manually by tracking possible non-terminals that can generate each part of the string.\n\nLet me try to see if each symbol in the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is composed of the following tokens: t91, t101, t158, t130, t110, t101, t2, t171, t134, t177, t108, t101, t67, t167, t165, t141, t94, t24.\n\nEach token represents either a non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, no, actually, I think that in the context of the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. So for example, if NT24 \u2192 't123', then NT24 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't123'. Similarly, NT67 \u2192 't67' is maybe another rule, like NT67 -> 't67'.\n\nBut looking through the provided grammar, there are a lot of rules that have non-terminals on the right side, and some that have a terminal followed by a non-terminal. For example, NT68 -> 't47', NT91 -> 't134', and so on.\n\nSo perhaps each token in the string is either a terminal (like t91) or a non-terminal (like NT12 or NT89), which needs to be further replaced by other symbols.\n\nWait, but wait, actually, the string is composed of symbols like t91, t101, etc., so it's possible that all these are terminals. That would mean that the string consists of multiple terminal symbols, and the grammar must have each of these terminals as either direct productions from a non-terminal or through some chain of productions.\n\nSo perhaps each 'tX' is a terminal and the grammar must have rules that produce each of these. Let me check the given grammar for any rules that have a terminal followed by non-terminals. Wait, many rules have a mix: for example, NT15 -> NT75 NT57, which is non-terminals, but some rules have terminals, like NT91 -> 't134', as per the grammar. So, for example, NT91 can produce 't134'.\n\nThus, to generate the string, each 'tX' would have to be produced by some non-terminal, perhaps through a series of productions. So let's start by seeing if the string can be constructed step by step.\n\nLet me split the string into individual symbols:\n\n1. t91\n2. t101\n3. t158\n4. t130\n5. t110\n6. t101\n7. t2\n8. t171\n9. t134\n10. t177\n11. t108\n12. t101\n13. t67\n14. t167\n15. t165\n16. t141\n17. t94\n18. t24\n\nNow, each of these 'tX' symbols might be a terminal that is directly produced by some non-terminal. Alternatively, they might have to be produced via a chain of productions.\n\nLet me start by checking if each token is a terminal or if it can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nWait, for example, 't91' appears twice in the string. Looking through the grammar, there's a rule NT91 -> 't134', but no direct rule for 't91' except in another rule: NT15 -> NT75 NT57, but that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Are the 'tX' the terminals, and the 'NT' the non-terminals?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\nNT84 -> NT1 NT65\nNT73 -> NT83 NT70\nNT40 -> NT39 NT35\nNT52 -> NT28 NT70\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\nNT73 -> NT6 NT39\nNT64 -> NT100 NT93\nNT80 -> NT67 NT73\nNT35 -> NT68 NT103\nNT68 -> NT45 NT71\nNT106 -> NT35 NT107\nNT39 -> NT23 NT16\nNT7 -> NT21 NT9\nNT48 -> NT106 NT31\nNT96 -> NT33 NT36\nNT12 -> NT91 NT69\nNT40 -> NT33 NT64\nNT93 -> NT15 NT77\nNT96 -> NT1 NT108\nNT61 -> NT84 NT44\nNT106 -> NT7 NT92\nNT92 -> NT74 NT18\nNT35 -> NT40 NT105\nNT44 -> NT24 NT88\nNT52 -> NT70 NT52\nNT84 -> NT68 NT11\nNT91 -> NT6 NT17\nNT33 -> NT80 NT23\nNT83 -> NT15 NT2\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each 'tX' in the right-hand sides of the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-327","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF grammars have each production rule on the left-hand side (LHS) that expands to exactly two non-terminal symbols, and the start symbol is non-terminal. The right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals. Additionally, the grammar doesn't have any epsilon productions, but in this case, I see some terminals being produced, so I need to be careful.\n\nThe given string is: `t108 t101 t90 t0 t162 t76 t94 t65 t121 t71 t100 t134 t101 t0 t174 t22 t118 t63 t121`.\n\nI see that the string consists of several identifiers like t108, t101, etc. These seem to be terminal symbols because of the 't' prefix, which is common in such notations to denote terminals in grammars.\n\nThe CFG provided has production rules where each non-terminal (NT) expands into a combination of other non-terminals. Each rule is of the form NTAB -> NTCD, meaning two non-terminals replacing one. The start symbol is S, which in CNF would expand into two non-terminals, exactly as it does here: S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nNow, I need to see if the string can be derived from this grammar. This involves figuring out the derivation steps that could lead from S to the given string.\n\nI think the first step is to analyze the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down into subparts that match the production rules. Each rule in the grammar is applied in a way that each step replaces a non-terminal with two others. So, to generate a string of multiple terminals, the derivation would involve replacing non-terminals with other pairs until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the string segment by segment:\n\n1. t108 appears at the beginning and later again. Looking at the grammar rules, I need to find where t108 is produced. Scanning through, I find NT6->t108, NT108->t118, NT106->t94, and NT100->t51. Hmm, I don't see t108 directly as a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Oh, yes, NT108->t118 and NT106->t94. So t108 might not be a terminal, maybe it's part of a non-terminal's expansion. Wait, perhaps I need to trace back how t108 is produced.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the entire derivation. Let's consider the starting symbol S and see how it can expand into this string.\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nNow, let's see what NT99 and NT89 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT99: check the production rules for NT99. Scanning through, I see NT99 -> NT6 NT103.\n\n- NT89: NT89 has two production rules: one is NT89 -> NT61 NT76, and another is NT89 -> NT44 NT1. Hmm, so NT89 can expand into either of these.\n\nSo, let's say we take S -> NT99 NT89 \u2192 NT6 NT103 NT44 NT1, for example. But wait, that's just the LHS being replaced by RHS, but we need to see how NTs expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each NT and their possible expansions:\n\nLet's try to find out what each part of the string corresponds to:\n\n- t108: Not directly in the NT productions, but looking at the grammar, maybe it's part of some NT's expansion. Let me check: NT68->t28 and NT67->t67, etc. Wait, perhaps t108 comes from NT11 or similar. Looking at the rules, I see NT11 -> NT81 NT29. NT81 is NT55 -> NT23 NT65, and NT29 has multiple productions, one of which is NT29 -> 't36' (but that's a terminal) and another NT29 -> 't156'. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to see the entire string and break it down:\n\nt108 t101 t90 t0 t162 t76 t94 t65 t121 t71 t100 t134 t101 t0 t174 t22 t118 t63 t121\n\nLooking for possible NT expansions that result in these terminals.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nLet's take S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Then, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76 (I'll consider this possibility first).\n\nSo S becomes NT6 NT103 NT61 NT76.\n\nNow, each NT6, NT103, NT61, and NT76 need to be replaced.\n\nLooking at NT6: in the grammar, NT6 has production rules. Wait, wait, actually, looking through the given production rules, I don't see an NT6. Let me check the rules again. Hmm, I see NT68, NT67, but not NT6. Did I miss it? Wait, the grammar list provided earlier starts with S -> NT99 NT89 and proceeds with other production rules. It looks like NT6 is not directly present as a LHS of a production, but wait, perhaps it's a typo or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's list the NTs present:\n\nLooking through the given rules, the NTs I see are: NT1, NT2, up to NT108, but some might be duplicated. However, I don't see NT6 as a LHS in any production. Hmm, that's odd. Wait, let me check the given production rules again.\n\nLooking through the provided list, I don't see NT6 -> ... in any rule. The first few are S -> NT99 NT89, NT15->NT75 NT57, etc. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me read through all the productions.\n\nNT1\u2192NT107 NT17, NT2\u2192t123, NT3\u2192t108, NT4\u2192t93, NT5\u2192t144, NT6\u2192t108? Wait, looking at the end of the production rules, I see NT96\u2192t118, NT93\u2192t170, etc. Wait, I think I need to better organize these.\n\nPerhaps I should list all the production rules with LHS and RHS:\n\n1.

The task is to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string I need to evaluate: `t108 t101 t165 t130 t2 t76 t162 t0 t171 t134 t100 t0 t104 t0 t63 t139 t69 t94 t22`.\n\nHmm, the string consists of several segments like t108, t101, etc. I notice that many of these are 't' followed by numbers, which are quite long. I should check the grammar to see which symbols produce these t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce 't' symbols. For example:\n- NT29 -> 't156'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT76 -> 't178'\n- NT42 -> 't139'\n- NT68 -> 't134'\n- NT29 -> 't129'\n- NT89 -> 't60'\n- And so on.\n\nEach of these is a production rule where a non-terminal NT followed by a number produces a specific 't' symbol. My approach should be to parse the given string by replacing 't's with the corresponding NTs and then see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSo, let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t108 t101 t165 t130 t2 t76 t162 t0 t171 t134 t100 t0 t104 t0 t63 t139 t69 t94 t22\n\nEach token is separated by a space. I'll list them as t1, t2, ..., t20.\n\nFirst, I'll convert each 't' token to the corresponding NT. Let's check each one:\n\nt108: Looking at the grammar, NT108 isn't a terminal, but I see production rules that produce t's. Wait, looking through the productions, I notice some NTs produce t's, like:\n- NT29 -> 't156'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT76 -> 't178'\n- NT42 -> 't139'\n- NT68 -> 't134'\n- NT29 -> 't129'\n- NT89 -> 't60'\n- etc.\n\nBut t108... I don't see any rule that produces 't108'. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking through, I don't see any NT that produces t108. The available t's are t0, t1, t2, t3, t6, t9, etc., but t108 isn't listed. That's a problem because if a token doesn't have a corresponding production, the string must not be generated by the grammar, right?\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. I'll scan through all the rules to see if any produce 't108'. Scrolling through, I see rules like NT16 -> 't112', NT74 -> 't146', NT105 -> 't24', NT12 -> 't80', etc. Oh, wait, I don't see any rule that produces 't108'. So t108 can't be derived from any NT in this grammar because there's no production rule that directly produces it.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string can't be generated by the grammar because t108 is missing. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if t108 can be derived indirectly. For instance, is there a chain of productions that can generate t108? Looking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT which produces 't108' as a terminal. The closest is NT35 -> 't68' and others, but nothing for t108.

{"custom_id":"request-346","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one non-terminal and the start can go to terminals. But looking at the grammar, I see that some productions have terminals on the right, which isn't allowed in Chomsky normal form as per my understanding. Wait, no\u2014the provided grammar has terms like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, etc., and some rules like NT9 -> 't169'. So this grammar isn't in strict Chomsky normal form because it allows terminals on the right-hand side of the productions. Hmm, maybe the user meant Chomsky normal form, but with the possibility of terminals on the right. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is in a different form, but that's beside the point.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of tokens starting with 't108' and ending with 't98' and 't0', etc. The challenge is to parse this string based on the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar rules and see which terminals appear and try to see if the string can be broken down according to these rules. The grammar seems to consist of non-terminals NT followed by numbers and some terminals with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT99 NT89. So the string must start with NT99 followed by NT89. Let's check the string: the first token is t108, which doesn't match NT99 (which would be some production leading to t99, maybe). Alternatively, maybe the NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals that expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string using the rules. Let me list the string tokens: t108, t101, t102, t139, t130, t23, t24, t165, t130, t2, t65, t72, t171, t0, t157, t98, t0, t157, t69, t45.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nS produces NT99 NT89.\n\nSo after S, the first part is NT99 and then NT89. So the string should be split into two parts, starting with NT99 and ending with NT89.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: the first few tokens are t108, t101, t102, t139, t130, t23, t24, t165, t130, t2, t65, t72, t171, t0, t157, t98, t0, t157, t69, t45.\n\nThat's 20 tokens. Let's see how many tokens would be in NT99's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT99:\n\nThe production for NT99 is not explicitly given, but looking at the rules, I see NT96 -> 't63', which is a terminal. But for NT99, I see several rules:\n\n- NT99 isn't in any production, but looking back, maybe it's derived from another NT. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the first NT is NT15 -> NT75 NT57, which suggests that higher-level NTs break down into lower-numbered ones. So perhaps NT99 is produced by a chain of rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string corresponds to some combination of these NTs that lead to the given terminal tokens.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part after S is NT99, so I need to see if t108 is part of NT99's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with NT99, which expands into a series of terminals. But in the grammar, the NT rules seem to branch into other NTs, not necessarily terminals. For example, NT64 -> 't24' is a terminal, but most NT rules produce other NTs. So I need to see if there's a path from NT99 to t108, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string and see which grammar rules they correspond to. Let's list all the terminals and their possible origin:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each terminal token (e.g., t108, t101, etc.) must be the result of a production rule that ends in a terminal. For example:\n\nNT24 -> 't123' (rule 24)\nNT43 -> 't2'\nNT15 -> 't154'\nWait, no\u2014looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> 't123' (rule 24)\nNT15 -> 't154'\nAnd others:\n\nLike NT106 -> 't178' (rule 106, production 178 is NT77). Also, NT24 -> 't123'.\n\nBut in the string, we have t108, t101, etc. Do any of these exist in the grammar as productions ending with a terminal?\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I can see several terminals:\n\n- NT9 -> 't169', 't41', 't134', 't68', 't29', 't43', 't15', 't76', 't65', 't100', 't108', 't69', 't23', 't17', 't26', 't45', 't107', 't121', 't16', 't54', 't75', 't91', 't19', 't107', 't57', 't24', 't171', 't22', 't141', 't54', 't158', 't89', 't2', 't11', 't36', 't12', etc.\n\nSo for example, t108 is present as NT9's production: NT9 -> 't169'? No, wait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking for t*:\n\n- 't108' is a terminal, specifically in the grammar as NT24 -> 't123', but t108 is not listed in the provided grammar except in one rule:\n\nWait, let's scan through the provided rules for any production that ends with a particular t.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar lines:\n\nHmm, I see multiple NTs producing 't*' tokens:\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't108' appears in NT108? Wait, no. The grammar has:\n\nNT106 -> 't178'\n\nBut looking for 't108' specifically, I don't see an NT production that ends with t108. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, the provided grammar includes:\n\n- NT9 -> 't134', 't68', 't29', etc., but not t108.\n\nWait, no production ends with t108, according to the provided grammar. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't169' (line 15)\nNT9 -> 't41' (line 9)\nNT9 -> 't134' (line 14)\nNT68 -> 't134' (line 8)\nNT9 -> 't68' (line somewhere?\nWait, let me go through the entire list in order:\n\nThe grammar is a long series of lines. Let me look for any where a terminal starts with t followed by a number.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT68 -> 't134'\n- NT106 -> 't178'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT15 -> 't154'\n- NT7 -> 't151'\n- NT75 -> 't98'\n- NT91 -> 't164'\n- NT68 -> 't145'\n- NT52 -> 't177'\n- NT21 -> 't171'\n- NT77 -> 't124'\n- NT17 -> 't22'\n- NT84 -> 't102'\n- ... and others. I don't see any terminal starting with t108 in the provided grammar. So that suggests that the first token in the string, t108, cannot be derived from any rule, because no NT production ends with t108.\n\nIf that's the case, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, because the parser cannot derive t108 from any rule.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-345","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars consist of non-terminals and terminals, with rules that expand non-terminals into other symbols. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's quite comprehensive with many production rules. Some non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, others into terminals like 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if the string can be generated through a series of these expansions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n\n`t108 t101 t165 t130 t24 t101 t2 t151 t146 t21 t165 t98 t8 t98 t2 t63 t139 t141 t65 t22`\n\nI'll start by trying to parse this string from left to right, seeing if each terminal can be matched through the grammar's productions. It might help to build parse trees, but given the complexity, I'll focus on breaking down the string into components that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the first token, `t108`, I check the grammar for any production that results in `t108`. Scanning through, I notice that NT100 has a production `NT100 -> NT96 NT93`, but that doesn't directly expand to a terminal. However, I remember that NT40 has `NT40 -> NT33 NT64` and later NT33 can lead to terminal symbols. But more directly, I spot NT106: `NT106 -> NT35 NT107`. Checking NT35, there's `NT35 -> NT68 NT103` and NT68 expands to `NT68 -> NT28 NT12`. NT28 leads to `NT28 -> NT70 NT76`, and NT76 goes to `NT76 -> NT45 NT71`. NT45 is a terminal `t98`, and NT71 is `t100`. Wait, there's also NT67: `NT67 -> NT67 NT73`, but that's a left recursion which should be handled, or maybe it's a typo. Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nLooking again, I realize NT102 has a production `NT102 -> NT48 NT49`. NT48 expands to `NT48 -> NT106 NT31`, and NT106 again to NT35 and NT107. This chain seems too involved. Alternatively, NT100 can directly lead to `t96` and `t93`, but NT93 has a production `NT93 -> NT15 NT77`, which goes to terminals. But wait, looking at the string, I notice `t108` comes first. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces `t108`. Scrolling through the productions, I see NT108: `NT108 -> NT118 NT119` which are terminals, but also NT108: `t108` directly? No. Wait, looking again, the production NT108 is `NT108 -> t118 t119`, but that's not a terminal. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake; some terminals are written as 't' followed by numbers. So, looking for direct productions that result in 't108'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see `NT89 -> t60`, `NT107 -> t94`, and so on. Hmm. Maybe I need a different approach. Another way is to look at the string and see if it can be built by combining the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first part: `t108 t101 t165 t130 t24`. Let's see what these correspond to. Checking NT108, I don't see an immediate production, but perhaps looking for the sequence. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for sequences in the string that match production chains.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reconstruct the parse tree. Starting from the entire string, see if it can be divided into parts that correspond to non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to notice if any parts of the string represent the start symbol S. Since S is `S -> NT99 NT99`, so each part after the split should be generated by NT99. Wait, but the entire string is a single string, so I'll have to see if it can be split into two parts, each generated by NT99, but given that NT99 is part of the string, maybe I can break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to split it:\n\n`t108 t101 t165 t130 t24 t101 t2 t151 t146 t21 t165 t98 t8 t98 t2 t63 t139 t141 t65 t22`\n\nLet me see if I can find meaningful splits. For example, the first token is `t108`. Looking back at the grammar, I see that NT108 has a production to `t118 t119`, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe NT108 can be built through other non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT108 -> NT118 NT119, which are both terminals. So `t118` and `t119` are the results, meaning they're directly generated. So `t108` cannot be directly generated by any non-terminal except perhaps itself, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I should look for non-terminals that expand into combinations including `t108`. For example, NT118: but I don't see any NT that directly expands to `t108`. So maybe `t108` is generated by NT108, but NT108 only expands to `t118 t119`. Therefore, since `t108` isn't present there, perhaps the string is invalid unless there's an error. Wait, but the first token is `t108`, so unless NT108 can generate `t108`, it's not possible. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back, I don't see any production for NT108 that results in `t108`. The closest is NT100, which expands to `t96 t93`, but `t108` is not among them. Similarly, NT106 produces `t35 t107`? Wait, no, NT106: `NT106 -> NT35 NT107` and NT35 is `NT68 NT103`. NT68 is `NT28 NT12`, and NT28 is `NT70 NT76`, which leads to `t67 t67`, which isn't helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here.\n\nWait, maybe `t108` isn't present as a terminal, so the string can't be generated. Alternatively, perhaps another non-terminal expands into `t108`. Checking all non-terminals, I don't see any production for any NT that results in `t108`. Therefore, the string must contain a token that no NT can produce, meaning the string is not part of the language.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with `t108`, which isn't generated by any production in the grammar. So the answer must be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-369","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Both are in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to parse or generate strings. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. A CFG is in CNF if each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Importantly, in CNF, there are no epsilon productions, and every production leads directly to non-terminals or a single terminal. The start symbol doesn't produce epsilon, and the grammar has no useless symbols.\n\nThe grammar given starts with S -> NT99 NT89, so the start symbol is S, and it generates two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions. For example, NT99 can produce NT61 NT76 or the terminal 't178'.\n\nThe string provided is: `t108 t101 t101 t104 t108 t101 t167 t91 t101 t104 t94 t67 t90 t139 t141 t65 t22`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions. Let's break this down.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t108. Checking the grammar, I see NT108 is defined as NT46 NT71. Let's verify that:\n\nNT108 -> NT46 NT71. So t108 is either NT46 followed by NT71 or vice versa. But looking at the grammar, NT108 has only this production. So in the string, t108 can come from NT46 and NT71.\n\nNext, the second token is t101. Checking for t101, in the grammar, I see that NT91 and NT101 (if any) but scanning the provided grammar, I don't see an NT101. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, I see NT91 is 't164' only, and NT70 as 't67' (maybe). Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through the grammar entries line by line:\n\n- NT91 -> 't164'\n- NT100 -> 't127'\n- NT108 -> 't118'\n- NT65 -> 't157'\n- NT46 -> 't99'\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT67 -> 't67'\n- Wait, NT67 is in NT67 -> 't67'? Wait, no, in the list provided, I see:\n\nLooking for 't101': checking the productions:\n\n- NT89 -> 't60'\n- NT90 -> 't109' (Wait, I don't see NT90, let me recheck:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 -> 't169'\n- NT19 -> 't99'\n- NT23 -> 't171'\n- NT17 -> 't22'\n- NT43 -> 't2'\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT80 -> 't63'\n- NT49 -> 't157'\n- NT69 -> 't1'\n- Wait, perhaps I miss a production for NT91. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT91 is defined as -> 't164'. So t101 isn't present in any NT's terminal, except perhaps NT101 if it exists. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, I'm looking through all the NTs provided.

{"custom_id":"request-389","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because CNF has a specific structure that can make parsing easier, though maybe not for me right now. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar and the string. The grammar has non-terminals like S, NT15, NT89, and so on, each expanding into pairs of other non-terminals. The string provided is a sequence of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers, like 't91', 't101', etc. It seems like each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the non-terminals are being expanded into combinations of these terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t101 t94 t22 t171 t169 t100 t94 t2 t50 t165 t98 t171 t49 t174 t72 t171 t108 t101 t69 t141 t45`.\n\nHmm, that's 21 tokens. The first thing I notice is that in the grammar, some non-terminals expand into two terminals, while others might expand into more non-terminals. For example, S -> NT99 NT89. So S is a start symbol that expands into two non-terminals, which themselves might expand until we get to the terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, every production rule seems to be of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, which means each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals. That's standard for CNF. Now, the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers. So each non-terminal expansion leads us closer to these terminals.\n\nSo the general process would involve starting from S and seeing if we can derive the given string through a series of derivations.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Each non-terminal in the grammar has a production that expands into exactly two non-terminals. So, for the string to be derived, each of these non-terminals must produce exactly two terminals each. Wait, but if a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, each of those could be terminals or further non-terminals. So for example, a string is built by replacing each non-terminal step by step, ending when all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree is a binary tree with the start symbol S at the root. Each node is a non-terminal, and each internal node has exactly two children, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The length of the string (number of terminals) should be 2^n where n is the depth of the derivation tree. Wait, that's for context-free grammars in CNF without the start symbol. Let me think.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is a non-terminal -> two non-terminals or a terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, the right-hand side must consist of two non-terminals. So actually, in this grammar, all productions are non-terminals expanding into two non-terminals. So all the terminals in the string must be the result of terminal symbols, so our analysis has to see if the string's terminals can be produced by this grammar.\n\nSo, perhaps another way is to model the string as the result of expanding S, step by step, checking for possibilities.\n\nBut with 21 tokens, that would be a lot. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be split into a structure that aligns with the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, let's list the tokens in order: t91, t101, t94, t22, t171, t169, t100, t94, t2, t50, t165, t98, t171, t49, t174, t72, t171, t108, t101, t69, t141, t45.\n\nI see that each of these is a 't' followed by a number, but the numbers vary. Since the grammar consists of non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals, I need to see if each token in the string can be matched by a terminal in a production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production has on the right-hand side, two non-terminals. So, when a non-terminal is expanded, it must produce exactly two non-terminals, which then must eventually produce two terminals each, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string by checking if it can be generated by the grammar. Given that the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, perhaps using a recursive approach would work, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if each token in the string can be matched by a production's terminal.\n\nWait, but no, the productions don't have terminals on the right-hand side; they have non-terminals. So each step of expansion replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers in the string.\n\nBut in the given grammar, looking at each production, they all have a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right. So each production doesn't have any terminals, which suggests that the generated language consists solely of terminal symbols derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because if all productions expand into non-terminals, how do we get any terminals? Unless the grammar is defined such that some productions have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form only allows non-terminals to produce two non-terminals, so all terminals must appear as leaves in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me check the given grammar again. Indeed, all rules are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, with nothing else. So all productions are non-terminals to two non-terminals. So the start symbol S will expand into two non-terminals, each of which expands into two non-terminals, etc. The leaves will be terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string provided must be made up of these terminal symbols. So perhaps the way to approach this is to see if each token in the string is a terminal that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a leaf in the derivation tree. So, for the given string, which has 21 tokens, we'd need the derivation tree to have a structure that leads to a string of length 2^n. But 21 is not a power of two, so that's problematic.\n\nWait a second\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be non-terminals expanding into exactly two non-terminals. So the generating language would consist of all strings that can be formed by replacing each non-terminal step by step, ending up with only terminals. The length of the strings must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps of expansion from the start symbol.\n\nSo, if the start symbol S is non-terminal, and it starts by producing two non-terminals, each of which may split further, the length doubles each time. So the number of terminals in the string must be 2^k for some k. Let's see: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. But the given string has 21 tokens, which is not a power of two. So that suggests that the string cannot be produced by a grammar in CNF, because the length isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the grammar provided does have some expansions that may eventually produce terminals. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each rule is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So, for example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. NT99 is a non-terminal that must expand into two non-terminals, each of which must expand, and so on, until we reach a terminal. So each production on each non-terminal is to two non-terminals, which implies that each expansion increases the length by a factor of 2 each time. So the total length after n steps would be 2^n. But the given string is of length 21, which is not a power of two. 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, so 21 is in between. Therefore, the string cannot be generated, because in a CNF grammar, the number of terminals must be a power of two.\n\nSo, the immediate conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's presented in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol here is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are multiple non-terminal symbols, such as S, NT15, NT89, etc., and several terminals like 't108', 't101', and so on. My task is to parse the string `t108 t101 t108 t144 t151 t154 t157 t123 t98 t2 t63 t139 t69 t94 t22` and see if it can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nThe strategy here is to perform a recursive descent parsing or use the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar isn't provided in a standard format, maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree step by step. Alternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, I can treat it as a series of possible non-terminals that can produce sequences of terminals.\n\nStarting with the first symbol 't108'. Looking through the grammar, I need to find a production that starts with 't108'. Scanning the rules, I see that NT96 \u2192 't108' is a production. So, the first part could be NT96 producing 't108'. Then, the next symbol is 't101'. Let's see what produces 't101'. Checking the rules, NT15 \u2192 't101' is present. So now, we have the sequence NT96 \u2192 't108' and NT15 \u2192 't101'. So the string starts with NT96 NT15, which produces 't108 t101'.\n\nMoving on, the next symbol after 't101' is 't108', so let me check what produces that. Again, NT96 \u2192 't108' as before. Then 't144'\u2014looking for 't144' in a production. From the rules, NT89 \u2192 't144' is a production. So the current part is NT96 NT15 NT96 NT89, producing 't108 t101 t108 t144'.\n\nContinuing, after 't144' is 't151'. Looking for 't151' as the result of a production. Scanning the rules, NT7 \u2192 't151' is a production. So now we have NT96 NT15 NT96 NT89 NT7.\n\nAfter 't151' is 't154'. Checking for 't154', it seems NT15 \u2192 't154' is a production. So adding that, we have NT96 NT15 NT96 NT89 NT7 NT15.\n\nNext, 't157'\u2014looking for that, NT68 \u2192 't157' is a production. Adding that, now we have NT96 NT15 NT96 NT89 NT7 NT15 NT68.\n\nNext, 't123' produces via NT106 \u2192 't123'. So now it's NT96 NT15 NT96 NT89 NT7 NT15 NT68 NT106.\n\nThe next symbol is 't98'. Looking for a production that produces 't98'. From the rules, NT9 \u2192 't98' is present. So now we have NT96 NT15 NT96 NT89 NT7 NT15 NT68 NT106 NT9.\n\nNext is 't2'. Looking for 't2', I see that S \u2192 NT96 NT31, but 't2' isn't directly produced. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe another production can reach 't2'. Wait, in the rules, NT22 is involved. Looking at NT22 \u2192 't22' is a production. Perhaps somewhere else it's part of a production.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the top-down approach again. Let me try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step, maybe starting with the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT96 NT31\n\nSo the entire string would have to be derived from NT96 NT31. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't108', which is produced by NT96. So after that, the next part should be NT31. From the rules, NT31 \u2192 't123' (from production NT31 \u2192 't123'), but wait, in the given rules, NT31 \u2192 't123' is present as NT31 \u2192 't123'? Yes, looking back: NT31 \u2192 't31' and 't123'\u2014wait, the provided grammar has:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n- NT31 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I might have made a mistake in my parsing. Let me double-check the rules because this step is crucial.\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT31, I see:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT7 NT6\nNT31 \u2192 't34'\n\nSo, NT31 can produce either NT7 NT6 or the terminal 't34'. So in the top-down approach, the start symbol S is NT96 NT31. So the string starts with NT96 producing 't108', then NT31 can be either NT7 NT6 or 't34'. But the string after 't108' is 't101', which is from NT15, but in the top-down approach, the next symbol after S would be the first part of NT96's production. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine this.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the top-down approach would expand S first. Let me try again.\n\nS \u2192 NT96 NT31\n\nSo the string must be a sequence of the first parts of NT96 and NT31.\n\nNT96 \u2192 't108' (from NT96 \u2192 't108')\n\nNT31 \u2192 't34' or NT7 NT6\n\nSo, S's expansion would start with 't108' followed by whatever NT31 expands to.\n\nBut in the given string, the second symbol is 't101', which comes from NT15, but in the top-down approach, the next symbol should be the terminal from NT96's production. However, after 't108' in the string, the next is 't101', but according to the grammar, NT96's production starts with 't108', so the next symbol should be something else, unless NT31's expansion starts with 't101'.\n\nWait, no. Let's think carefully. When we are parsing the string, we start with S. S can be NT96 NT31. So the first symbol should be the terminal that NT96 produces, which is 't108'. Then, after 't108', the next part comes from NT31.\n\nNT31 can be either 't34' or NT7 NT6.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't108' comes 't101', which needs to be the expansion of NT31. But NT31's production is either 't34' or NT7 NT6, which are non-terminals or terminals? Wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So in this case, NT31's first production is NT7 NT6, which is two non-terminals, so when expanded, it would give terminals from NT7 and NT6.\n\nBut looking back at NT7 and NT6:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't151'\n- NT6 \u2192 't91'\n\nWait, from the given rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't151'\n- NT6 \u2192 't91'\n\nSo NT7 can produce 't151', and NT6 can produce 't91'. So when NT31 is expanded as NT7 NT6, it would produce 't151' 't91'. So after 't108', the next symbols should be 't151 t91'.\n\nBut in our string, after 't108' is 't101', which would require NT31 to produce 't101' as a terminal. But NT31 doesn't have a production that directly produces 't101'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLooking at NT15, it's NT15 \u2192 't101', correct"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. That\u2019s helpful because it might make parsing easier, but with such a long string, maybe I should think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which goes directly to NT99 and NT89. Then each of those non-terminals has their own productions, mostly splitting into two NT symbols. It looks like many of these are recursive, meaning they can split further until they reach symbols that produce terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the string: `t108 t101 t102 t165 t130 t23 t24 t65 t112 t110 t101 t123 t98 t0 t171 t41 t65 t71 t91 t101 t69 t69 t45`. It's a list of all the lowercase t's followed by numbers, which are probably the terminal symbols according to the grammar.\n\nEach production rule either starts with two NT symbols or a single terminal. For example, S is NT99 and NT89. Then NT99 presumably leads to a production that eventually produces t108. Similarly, NT89 leads to the end.\n\nWait, let me think about how the productions work. Each NT symbol (like NT99, NT97, etc.) can produce combinations of two other NT symbols until we reach a terminal. So to parse the string, each step in the string should be derivable from one of the NT productions.\n\nBut parsing manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can break down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108. Let me see where that comes from. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT96 can produce t108 (NT96 -> NT105 NT93, but I don't see t108 here. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT96: NT105 NT93 is one production, another is NT1 NT108. Oh, there we go. So NT96 can produce t108 NT39, for example, but specifically, NT96 has a production that starts with NT1 and NT108. So actually, there's a production NT96 -> NT1 NT108. But wait, in the grammar, NT96-> NT1 NT108 is a production?\n\nWait, let me look again. Yes, I see: NT96-> NT1 NT108 is a production. So this would mean that NT96 can produce t1 (but I'm not sure what t1 is) and t108. But wait, in the grammar, t1 is a terminal; in the provided string, I see t108 as a terminal, so maybe that's a way to get t108.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me list the productions that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, the ones that produce t are:\n\nNT7 -> t151\n\nNT16 -> t54\n\nNT17 -> t22\n\nNT19 -> t99\n\nNT23 -> t156\n\nNT24 -> t123\n\nNT29 -> t136\n\nNT29 -> t156\n\nNT24 -> t123\n\nNT35 -> t43 (wait no, NT35 has a production that leads to t43 and something. Wait, no, for NT35, looking at the grammar it has: NT35-> NT68 NT103 and another NT43 NT52. So those are both productions with two NT symbols. So NT35 doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example, NT7: NT7-> NT21 NT9 (so two NT symbols), NT16->t54, NT17->t22, etc. So some NTs produce terminals. So for each token in the string, it must be the result of an NT production that ends in that terminal.\n\nBut if I have a token like t108, I need to see if any NT rule produces t108 as the result of a production. For example, looking at the grammar, does any production have t108 as a result?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT96-> NT1 NT108 and also NT6-> t108. So both NT96 and NT6 can produce t108. That's helpful.\n\nSo the string starts with t108. So either from NT96 or NT6.\n\nBut NT6 is a single symbol that directly produces t108, so t108 can be generated by NT6. Let me consider the entire string.\n\nThe string is: t108 t101 t102 t165 t130 t23 t24 t65 t112 t110 t101 t123 t98 t0 t171 t41 t65 t71 t91 t101 t69 t69 t45.\n\nSo each of these should be a terminal, derived from some NT production.\n\nOne approach is to work backward from the start symbol S, see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find a parse tree that can generate the string, step by step.\n\nLet me write out the string as a series of tokens and see how they can be built.\n\nFirst token is t108.\n\nAs we noted, t108 can come from NT6->t108 or NT96->NT1 t108.\n\nSo let me explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Assume t108 comes from NT6.\n\nThen NT6's production is directly t108. So the start symbol S goes to NT99 and NT89. So the left side must derive to include this. Alternatively, maybe NT99 and NT89 can each generate part of the string.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to see if each token can be matched to an NT production, considering possible parsing from the left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to check if the string is a concatenation of all possible terminals produced by NT99 and NT89.\n\nBut let's take the first token, t108, and see where it comes from. Let me look at all possible NTs that can produce t108:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT96 -> NT1 NT108 (so t108 is part of this)\nNT6 -> t108\n\nSo t108 must be either derived from NT96 or NT6.\n\nLet's pick t108 from NT96.\n\nSo NT96= t1 NT108.\n\nWait, no: NT96 can produce NT1 followed by NT108. So that would produce the string \"t1 followed by whatever NT1 generates and t108.\"\n\nBut in our string, the first token is t108. Hmm, so that doesn't align because if NT96 produces t108, that should come first. Or wait, perhaps NT96 produces another NT symbol followed by t108.\n\nWait, the production for NT96 is NT1 and NT108, which are then each replaced by their own productions until terminals are reached. So in NT96's production, it's actually producing the combination of NT1 and NT108, which would each need to produce sequences of terminals.\n\nSo in the case where the first token is t108, if it's from NT108, but NT108 might not be a terminal; actually, in the grammar, looking for terminals, NT108 is not defined as a terminal it seems. Because there's a rule NT96-> NT1 NT108, which suggests NT108 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, a bunch of terminals are given in quotes, like t1, t2, etc. Wait, maybe not\u2014the grammar is a set of production rules, but in the given grammar, the NT symbols are all in NT, and the terminals are specific t's with numbers. So I need to figure out from the grammar which NT symbols produce which t's.\n\nLooking again, some NTs produce t's.

{"custom_id":"request-402","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t91 t101 t165 t130 t94 t0 t67 t90 t26 t13 t162 t104 t108 t101 t156 t24 t123 t98 t94 t69 t69 t174 t22`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 string, where A, B, C are non-terminals except the start symbol. Looking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and other non-terminals like NT15, NT81, etc., have productions that split further until reaching terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI think this might be a tree grammar where each non-terminal breaks down into two other non-terminals until the terminals are reached. The function of 't' followed by a number might represent a terminal symbol, perhaps a token. Each 't' number is a separate token.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' tokens. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, in any derivation, S will produce two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Therefore, the string must start with the tokens from NT99 and NT89, in order.\n\nSo, the string is `t91 t101 t165 t130 t94 t0 t67 ...` and the first part is t91 t101. Let me check if NT99 can produce t91 t101.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 is a non-terminal. Does NT99 have a production that leads to t91 and t101? Looking through the productions:\n\nI don't see NT99 directly in the productions provided. Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The productions given are for NT99:\n\nLooking back, yes, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So, NT99 splits into NT6 and NT103.\n\nNow, next step: NT6 and NT103.\n\nI need to see what NT6 and NT103 produce. Wait, no. Actually, after NT99 breaks into NT6 and NT103, each of those can further break down.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me correct: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Then, to produce the string, NT99 must derive into some sequence, and NT89 must derive into another.\n\nSo, starting with NT99:\n\nFrom the productions, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nSo NT99 must split into NT6 and NT103. Each of these can further produce their own sequences.\n\nSimilarly, NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1.\n\nSo, NT89 splits into NT44 and NT1.\n\nI need to see what NT44 and NT1 produce.\n\nLooking at NT44: does it have a production? In the grammar, NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nYes, NT44 has NT24 NT88.\n\nAnd NT1 is a terminal. Wait, does NT1 derive further? Looking back, NT1's production: looking through the list, I see NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17. So, NT1 splits into NT107 and NT17. But NT107's production is NT65 NT71. NT65 splits into NT49, and so on. Wait, this might get complicated.\n\nWait, but NT1 also might directly correspond to 't26', as per some rules. Looking, yes, NT1 \u2192 't26' is one of the productions. So, NT1 can directly produce 't26'.\n\nBut then, going back, the first part of the string is t91 t101. So S must be producing two parts: one that starts with t91 and the other with t101.\n\nWait, the string starts with t91 t101. So let's check if NT99 can produce t91 and t101.\n\nFrom S, the first part is NT99. So NT99 must derive into a sequence that starts with t91, and NT89 must derive into a sequence that starts with t101.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the derivation from S would be ( derivation of NT99 ) ( derivation of NT89 ).\n\nSo the full string is the concatenation of the sequence produced by NT99 and the sequence produced by NT89.\n\nLooking back, the entire string is 23 tokens. So, we can split it into two parts: the first part corresponding to NT99's derivation and the second part to NT89's.\n\nLooking at NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT100 NT93 (from the grammar: NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71; wait, no, looking for NT6: does it produce something? Checking, I see NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, but NT68 isn't NT6. Let me check NT6's productions. Is there a rule for NT6? It looks like some NT6-like entries: NT100 is in a production, but not NT6. Hmm, actually, I might be confused. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar's NT6 production: looking through all the productions, I see NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70, NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35, NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93. There's NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, but not NT6. So maybe NT6 only appears in the production of something else.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t91 t101. So, the first part is t91, and the next is t101. So probably, NT99 must derive into a sequence that starts with t91, and NT89 must derive into a sequence that starts with t101, and then the next token is t165, which is part of NT103. Hmm, no, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the derivation as (A (B ... )) followed by (C (D ... )), where the final string is the concatenation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parse tree approach would help.\n\nWait, maybe I can parse the string top-down using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a tree grammar in CNF, I can try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: assign each 't' token in the string to be a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S, which generates two non-terminals, each of which should produce sequences of tokens.\n\nSo, the first token is t91. Let's see if t91 is a terminal or if it's derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have 't' as a terminal. For example, NT1 \u2192 't26', NT9 \u2192 't41', etc. But t91 is not directly a terminal in the grammar; it's a terminal derived from some non-terminal. Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I can see some 't' followed by numbers being the terminal symbols, like 't76' etc. But in the string, we have 't91', 't101', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar converts non-terminals into these 't' symbols. So, for example, NT77 \u2192 t77, perhaps. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see rules like NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65. And there are entries like NT77 \u2192 't56' as well, which suggests that some non-terminals directly derive into these 't' tokens. So, each time a non-terminal appears in the left-hand side of a production, it can produce other non-terminals, until it reaches a production that has a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the initial productions, the S is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which is a start symbol. Then, these non-terminals NT99 and NT89 have their own productions, which in turn sometimes produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the entire process is a tree where leaves are the terminals, and internal nodes are non-terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string, let's start from S.\n\nS must produce two sequences, let's call them A and B, such that A followed by B equals the given string.\n\nSo, the string should be split into two parts, each being the result of A and B"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-427","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it starts with S -> NT99 NT89. This means the start symbol S expands into NT99 and NT89. Each of these NTPs probably stands for non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals.\n\nLooking at the NTPs, many have productions to two other NTPs, which suggests a recursive structure. The rest seem to be terminal symbols, with some converting into 't' followed by a number or specific strings.\n\nThe string provided is: `t91 t101 t165 t130 t48 t0 t177 t123 t98 t2 t171 t41 t11 t157 t177 t91 t101 t177 t108 t101 t69 t69 t94 t22`.\n\nThis is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. Each 't' represents a token, like a number or a specific string. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, the first expansion is NT99 and NT89. So, the first two symbols of the string should come from these. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are 't91' and 't101'. I need to check if these can be derived from NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT99 -> NT6 NT103, and NT103 has several productions. Let's follow that:\n\nNT99 expands to NT6 NT103. Then, NT103 can expand to NT24 NT45 or other NTPs. NT6 is a terminal, 't91', as given in the string. NT103's first production is NT24 NT45. Let me check what NT24 and NT45 expand into.\n\nNT24 can go to NT54 NT65. NT54 expands to NT42 NT75, and NT65 to NT106 NT71. NT42 is another variable, and NT75 to NT95 NT18. NT95 is a terminal, 't130'. NT18 can expand to NT35 NT43. NT35 is another NTP, but in the string, the next token after 't91' is 't101', which doesn't directly correspond to anything I'm seeing yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's step back. The first symbol is 't91'. In the grammar, NT6 is a terminal, which is defined as 't91'. Okay, so the first part checks out. Now, what about the second symbol, 't101'? Let's see where 't101' comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT101 is an NTP. There's a production NT101 -> NT52 NT81. NT52 can expand into NT107 NT81, and NT81 into NT15 NT23. NT15 is another NTP, which expands to NT90 (a terminal, 't90'), and NT23 which can expand to NT40 NT107. NT40 can go to NT33 NT64, which then can be NT45 NT64 or other NTPs.\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me see which 't' tokens in the string correspond to NTP productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t91, t101, t165, t130, t48, t0, t177, t123, t98, t2, t171, t41, t11, t157, t177, t91, t101, t177, t108, t101, t69, t69, t94, t22.\n\nNow, checking each 't' against the grammar:\n\nt91: In the grammar, this is the terminal of NT6. So NT6 is 't91'.\n\nt101: Let's see if there's an NTP that expands to 't101'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any terminal 't101' directly. Maybe it's derived from two NTPs? So I need to find a production where the two derived symbols give 't101' in the string. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nt165: I don't recognize this as a direct terminal in the grammar. So perhaps it's another combination.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start symbol's expansion and see if the string can be generated step by step. S starts with NT99 and NT89.\n\nSo the first step is S-> NT99 NT89.\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103. So the first two symbols should be 't91' (NT6) and whatever NT103 expands to.\n\nLooking at NT103's productions: NT103 can be NT24 NT45, NT45 NT97, NT34 NT52, or NT34 NT107.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't91' comes 't101'. So perhaps NT103 expands to 't101' as part of its production.\n\nBut wait, NT103 is a two-symbol production, so it would expand into two terminal tokens. Let's see if the first expansion after 't91' is 't101'.\n\nLooking at NT103's possibilities:\n\n1. NT24 NT45: NT24 is 't123' (as per the grammar, NT24 -> NT54 NT65, which ends as 't123'); NT45 is 't99' (from grammar, NT45 -> NT99). So if NT103 expands to NT24 NT45, that would be 't123 t99'. But the next token after 't91' is 't101', which doesn't fit here.\n\n2. NT45 NT97: NT45 expands to 't99', NT97 is a terminal 't97' (from NT97 -> 't97'). So 't99 t97' would not match 't101'.\n\n3. NT34 NT52: NT34 is 't34' (from NT34 -> 't34'), and NT52 can be 't177' or other. So 't34 t177' doesn't start with 't101'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if 't101' is directly derived somewhere else. Looking at the grammar, I see NT91 -> 't91', which is already in the string. But that's only for NT91, which isn't present here.\n\nWait, S is NT99 NT89. NT89 in the grammar expands to NT44 NT1. Let me check what that gives. NT44 -> NT24 NT88, and NT88 can expand to 't141' (since NT88 -> 't141' or other). So maybe NT89 expands to something like 't141 t171' or similar. So perhaps the second symbol in the string, 't101', would come from somewhere else.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the possibility step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the start, using the grammar as I go, ensuring that each step can derive the next token.\n\nLet me try that. Starting with S, the string is t91 t101 t165...\n\n1. Start with S -> NT99 NT89.\n   So the first two symbols are from NT99 and NT89.\n   NT99 expands to NT6 NT103, which is 't91' and NT103.\n   So the first token is 't91', which matches. The second token comes from NT103.\n\n2. Now, looking at NT103. The possible productions are:\n   - NT24 NT45\n   - NT45 NT97\n   - NT34 NT52\n   - NT34 NT107\n\n   The second token is 't101', so we need NT103 expansion to produce a token that starts with 't101'. Let's see if any of these productions result in two tokens starting with 't101'.\n\n   - NT24->'t123', NT45->'t99' \u2192 't123 t99' \u2192 doesn't include"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, each production in the grammar will be rules like S -> AB, where A and B are non-terminals. The given grammar has all the rules in this form.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of symbols of the form 'tN', where N is a number. These 'tN' symbols seem to be representing terminal symbols. In the grammar, these terminals appear on the right-hand sides of the productions. For example, I see rules like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, but also individual terminals like NT73 -> 't167', etc.\n\nWait a second, I should check if the 't108', 't101', etc., exist in the grammar's terminal productions. From the provided grammar, I need to look for any NT... rules that produce these 't' strings.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- I see NT96 -> 't91'\n- NT42 -> 't139'\n- NT68 -> 't145'\n- NT6 -> 't108'\n- NT102 -> 't13'\n- NT91 -> 't164'\n- NT11 -> 't17'\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT40 -> 't21'\n- NT77 -> 't56'\n- NT35 -> 't40', etc.\n\nWait, for example, NT6 -> 't108' is a rule that directly produces 't108'. Similarly, NT42 -> 't139', so 't42' is produced by NT42. So when parsing the string, I can only have symbols that exist in the grammar's terminal rules.\n\nLooking at the string symbols:\n\n`t108 t101 t158 t130 t67 t73 t144 t0 t104 t174 t127 t170 t123 t98 t0 t151 t76 t162 t108 t101 t69 t141 t65 t24`\n\nI need to check if each 't' symbol is present in the grammar.\n\nLet's go through each symbol:\n\n1. t108: exists (NT6 -> 't108')\n2. t101: Not directly in the grammar. Let's see if any rule produces 't101'.\n   Looking through the rules, I don't see any rule that ends with 't101'. So this might not be a problem yet, but perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only 't's are for NT6, NT42, NT35, etc. 't101' doesn't appear. Hmm. But maybe through concatenation of other symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string requires each symbol to be produced by a single NT production. Wait, in the grammar, each production is two non-terminals, so the top-down approach would parse the string from the start symbol, splitting it into two parts, then each part further into two, etc., until all are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the entire string, considering that each 't' must be matched by a terminal production.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the string is `t108 t101 t158 t130 t67 t73 t144 t0 t104 t174 t127 t170 t123 t98 t0 t151 t76 t162 t108 t101 t69 t141 t65 t24`.\n\nThat's 24 elements, so the entire string must be a sequence of 24 terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the start symbol S can produce 2N-1 non-terminals, but in reality, each production is two non-terminals, so the start symbol would generate a sequence that builds up to more non-terminals until the terminals are left.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the entire string in the context of the grammar, checking each symbol to see if it can be derived by any rule.\n\nLooking at each 't' in the string:\n\nt108: exists (NT6 -> 't108')\nt101: Does any rule for an NT produce 't101'? I don't see 't101' in the terminal productions. So if the string contains 't101', the grammar must have a production that generates it.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT63 -> 't51' but nothing for t101. Similarly, looking through the list, perhaps 't101' doesn't exist, which would mean the string has a symbol not present in the grammar, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar to make sure I didn't miss any 't' productions for t101.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the last line is 'NT102 -> 't13''. So no, there's no nt rule for 101. Therefore, the string includes 't101', which is not present in any of the grammar's terminal productions.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-447","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to figure out if the string \"t91 t101 t130 t2 t162 t76 t13 t65 t72 t156 t91 t101 t0 t172 t130 t105 t67 t130 t0 t104 t0 t159 t26 t162 t178\" is generated by it. Hmm, this is going to be a bit tricky, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is also a non-terminal. So, in this grammar, the starting symbol seems to be S, as it's the first rule.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string must be derived from this starting point. The string given starts with t91, so I need to see if t91 is reachable from NT99 or NT89.\n\nNext, I'll try to trace possible derivations. Maybe starting with S. Let's see, S produces NT99 and NT89. I'll need to explore both branches, but perhaps t91 is in NT99's expansion.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT99: Oh, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 is not a terminal yet, so I need to see what NT6 and NT103 produce. NT6 is in the rules, right? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12, but how does NT6 work? Wait, looking through, I see NT6 \u2192 NT68? No, wait, the rules I see: I think I might have missed some. Wait, actually, I don't see NT6 being a production. Wait, in the list, do I have any rule for NT6?\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. Scanning through, I see NT6 is used in a rule: NT69 \u2192 NT6 NT17, but I don't see a rule for NT6 elsewhere. Wait, perhaps NT6 isn't a non-terminal and is actually a terminal, but looking through the rules, the only thing I see is t68, t67, etc., but NT6 isn't mentioned. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT6 is referenced in some productions. For example, NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46, but NT46 is also a non-terminal. Wait, maybe NT6 is a terminal, but looking through, I don't see any rule where NT6 is on the left side. So perhaps NT6 is a terminal, but that's not clear. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that NT6 is a non-terminal that can produce 't68' or something else. Wait, wait, in the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12, but that's more about how NT68 produces two symbols. But according to the rules, NT6 also appears in some other productions, like NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46, and NT46 is in the rules. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here because NT6 isn't defined as a production. Maybe that's a typo or misinterpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 is a terminal represented by 't68' or something else, but looking at the string, I don't see 't68' in the string provided. The string has 't28', 't25', etc. Alternatively, maybe the string's terms like t65 are from specific productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for terminals in the string that can be matched to the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see if t91 is a terminal produced by any NT. Let's look through the production rules to see where the terminals appear.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23, but wait, there's a rule NT39 \u2192 NT144, and NT48 is there, etc. Hmm, actually, let's look through all the rule's right-hand sides for any terminals.\n\nWait, let's check each rule's right-hand side. For example:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the production NT71 \u2192 NT50, which is another non-terminal. Wait, but sometimes, in the productions, I see 't' followed by a number, which I think are terminals. For example:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT154 \u2192 I think all the right-hand sides either are non-terminals or have 'tX' somewhere.\n\nLooking through each rule's right-hand side:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT31 \u2192 't34'\n- NT103 \u2192 't101'\n- NT52 \u2192 't177'\n- NT96 \u2192 't118'\n- NT35 \u2192 't172'\n- NT91 \u2192 't91' (Wait, actually, looking back, there's a rule NT91 \u2192 't134', no, wait, earlier in the list, after NT91, it's t164. Let me check the rules again.)\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals transition to terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't159' \u2192 so NT49 produces the terminal 't159'\n- NT35 \u2192 't172' \u2192 but wait, the rule for NT35 is: NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT103. But in another line, it says NT35 \u2192 't40' NT103, which is different. Wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any rules where the right-hand side includes a terminal. For example, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't80' NT23 \u2192 So, NT33 produces 't80' and NT23\n- NT19 \u2192 't99' NT46 \u2192 So, NT19 produces 't99' and NT46\n\nSimilarly, I see NT43 \u2192 't2' and NT19.\n\nSo, I can see several terminals in the right-hand sides. For instance, NT43 produces 't2' and NT19, which can produce various things.\n\nGiven that, to see if the string can be produced by this grammar, I can think of each terminal in the string and see if there's a path from the start symbol (S) through the grammar that ends at that terminal.\n\nThe string is: t91 t101 t130 t2 t162 t76 t13 t65 t72 t156 t91 t101 t0 t172 t130 t105 t67 t130 t0 t104 t0 t159 t26 t162 t178.\n\nSo, each of these is a terminal. Let me process them in order, trying to find if each fits into a chain.\n\nStarting with t91: Does any NT produce t91 directly?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT91 \u2192 't164'. Not helpful. Wait, let's see all the rules for various NT:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT95 and 't56'\n- NT107 \u2192 't174' and 't65'\n- NT6 \u2192 't68'? Hmm, but earlier I thought NT6 might not be a valid production.\nWait, perhaps I need to note that in the rule NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I need to organize this better.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that the string starts with t91. So, if t91 is a terminal, does any NT in the grammar produce t91? Let's see if any production of NT91 or others produce t91.\n\nWait, in the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce t91. For example, looking through the rules for NT49, it's 't159'. For NT31, it's 't34'. Wait, actually, I don't see any NT directly producing t91, so I'm a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me ensure that I'm correctly identifying the rules. Wait, looking through the production rules again, I realize that some lines might have typos or typos, making it hard to match directly. Let me verify.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT52 NT43\n- NT38 \u2192 NT89 NT53\nWait, perhaps this is an"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t108 t101 t165 t98 t23 t96 t170 t158 t98 t0 t104 t94 t67 t90 t158 t98 t94 t67 t154 t26 t162 t139 t141 t174 t24`.\n\nFirst, I'll map the string into the sequence of symbols: [t108, t101, t165, t98, t23, t96, t170, t158, t98, t0, t104, t94, t67, t90, t158, t98, t94, t67, t154, t26, t162, t139, t141, t174, t24].\n\nNow, I'll look at the grammar productions and see if the non-terminals can be expanded in a way that leads to this string.\n\nLet's start by looking at the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string should start with NT99 and NT89.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, but in the string, it starts with t108. But NT99 and NT89 in the grammar are non-terminals that can produce various other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking deeper, I see that some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 't24'. So, certain NTs have productions that end in terminals like 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let me start by checking if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar productions.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t108. Looking at the grammar, I see NT108 \u2192 NT65 NT71. So, t108 can be produced by NT108, which in turn needs to produce NT65 and NT71.\n\nNow, NT65 has a production NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71. So, NT65 needs to produce NT106 and NT71.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t108 followed by t101. Let me try to map this.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with t108. So, the first symbol is t108, which comes from NT108. Then the next symbol is t101, which comes from NT101.\n\nLet me check NT101's production. Looking at the grammar, NT101 \u2192 NT24 NT65. So, NT101 would produce t24 (from NT24's production) and then t65.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t108 comes t101, so that would imply NT108 \u2192 NT101 NT71. But according to the grammar, NT108 \u2192 NT65 NT71, not NT101 NT71. So that might not fit.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking up NT108. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT108 is not present. The only NT close to 108 is NT65, which comes from NT108. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71. And NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12. Also, NT12 \u2192 't80'. So, maybe that's a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to follow the productions recursively. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nStarting with the string: [t108, t101, t165, t98, t23, t96, t170, t158, t98, t0, t104, t94, t67, t90, t158, t98, t94, t67, t154, t26, t162, t139, t141, t174, t24].\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, we have NT99 and NT89 as the first two non-terminals.\n\nLet's take NT99. I need to see what NT99 expands into. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT99's production. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the list again.\n\nAh, here's NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT56 NT75. So, NT99 expands into NT56 and NT75.\n\nNow, NT56: Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT56. Hmm, but maybe other NTs produce NT56. Wait, NT35 \u2192 NT43 NT52, and NT52 \u2192 NT70 NT52 again? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT52 appears multiple times: NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70, NT52 \u2192 NT107 NT81, etc. So, NT52 can produce various combinations.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should take a different approach. Let me see if the string can be parsed by the grammar using a top-down or bottom-up method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check each symbol against the possible productions.\n\nStarting with t108. As we saw earlier, NT108 \u2192 NT65 NT71.\n\nSo, the first symbol t108 comes from NT108, which must expand into NT65 and NT71.\n\nNow, NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71.\n\nSo, NT65 needs to expand into NT106 and NT71.\n\nNext, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107.\n\nSo, NT106 expands into NT35 and NT107.\n\nThen NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT103.\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23.\n\nSo, NT33 expands into NT80 and NT23.\n\nNT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73.\n\nSo, NT80 expands into NT67 and NT73.\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT67 is a rule: NT67 \u2192 NT67 NT90. Wait, no, looking back, I see NT67 is defined elsewhere. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT67 \u2192 NT67 NT90. Oh, that's a left recursion, which might cause issues, but perhaps it's allowed if we handle it.\n\nBut in the current context, after NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73, I have a problem because NT67 is recursively defined, and we're trying to expand it. Maybe that's a problem, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a way to expand NT67 to a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT67, I see:\n\nNT67 appears in NT86 \u2192 NT67 NT85, and in NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12. So, perhaps NT67 can produce terminals?\n\nWait, looking for NT67 \u2192 ... I see NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12, but NT67 doesn't seem to produce a terminal directly. Instead, perhaps through other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to approach this using the CYK algorithm or some other parsing method. But since I'm doing this manually, let me try a different tack.\n\nLet me see if the given string can be generated step by step by following the production rules.\n\nAnother approach: The given string is a sequence of t's with numbers. Each t corresponds to a terminal symbol, which is produced by a NT.\n\nSo, each t is a terminal, and each non-terminal can produce various combinations of NTs.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, the first two non-terminals are NT99 and NT89.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT56 NT75, as per the grammar.\n\nNow, NT56 is a non-terminal, so we need to find its production. But looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT56. This might be a problem, unless I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me scan again:\n\nLooking through the production list, I don't see NT56 defined anywhere.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t101 t139 t98 t171 t41 t11 t97 t11 t97 t146 t134 t101 t2 t104 t108 t101 t174 t72 t171 t108 t101 t50 t69 t174 t24`\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar's productions.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, since it's efficient for CNF grammars. Alternatively, I could try to build a parse tree manually, but with a long string, that might be error-prone.

{"custom_id":"request-469","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals, making it easier to handle for certain parsing techniques. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of symbols starting with 't108' and ending with 't141'. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to have many productions of the form A \u2192 B C, which will be useful for checking the string's structure.\n\nLooking at the string: t108 t101 t65 t22 t8 t158 t130 t144 t21 t174 t112 t94 t123 t98 t123 t98 t2 t76 t80 t101 t94 t67 t90 t165 t141 t121. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to see if I can derive this string by working backwards from the top-level non-terminal, which in this case is 'S'. The string starts with t108, so I'll check the productions for terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see that 't108' is produced by the production NT68 \u2192 t108. So, the first symbol 't108' must come from NT68.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to replace t108 with NT68. Now, let's look at the next symbols after that. The next symbols are t101 and t65 t22 t8, but wait, looking at the string: t108 is followed by t101, t65, t22, t8, etc. Wait, no, the string is t108 t101 t65 t22 t8 t158 t130 t144 t21 t174 t112 t94 t123 t98 t123 t98 t2 t76 t80 t101 t94 t67 t90 t165 t141 t121.\n\nSo, after NT68, we have t101, which must come from a production of NT101. Looking at the grammar, I see a production for NT144, but not NT101. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me double-check. In the grammar, we have NT144 and NT108, but I don't see NT101 listed as a non-terminal. Hmm, this could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT's and the terminals directly derived from them. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t108\n- NT101?\nWait, not every NT ends with a terminal. Let me check each production to see if they derive specific terminals.\n\nLooking through the given production rules:\n- NT96 \u2192 t33 and t36\n- NT68 \u2192 t28 (from NT28?), but wait, in the productions, it's NT89\u2192NT61 NT76; NT61\u2192NT44 NT80; NT44\u2192NT24 NT88; etc. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to identify which NTs produce which terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with a problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of terms like 't108', 't101', and so on. \n\nFirst, I\u2019ll try to recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. It doesn\u2019t have any \u03b5-productions ( productions that generate the empty string) unless we're considering the special case of allowing the empty string. The terminal symbols are those that can't be split further.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to consist of a bunch of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT15, NT89, etc.) produces combinations of other non-terminals. Some rules end with 't' followed by a number, which I assume are terminal symbols. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9, but NT7 also has a production to 't151'. So, each rule is a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to parse the string step-by-step using the grammar. The string is: \n\nt108 t101 t170 t67 t154 t26 t151 t162 t76 t13 t100 t2 t162 t162 t76 t162 t2 t108 t101 t151 t91 t97 t65 t71 t108 t101 t45\n\nI need to check if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, S must produce two non-Terminals: NT99 and NT89.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with t108, so I need to see if t108 can be derived from NT99 or NT89. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the production for NT99: in the given grammar, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Also, from other rules, NT6 can produce various things. For example, NT6 can go to 't108' (from NT6 \u2192 't108'). Wait, actually, no, NT6 is a non-terminal. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12, NT92 \u2192 NT52 NT99, etc. Wait, but the terminals are the 't' terms, so for example, NT92 can produce t178 via NT76 \u2192 t178, but looking at NT76 later in the rules, I see NT76 \u2192 t178, so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to walk through the possible derivations.\n\nLet's first check if each 't' in the string can be matched by any non-terminal's productions.\n\nLet's list all the 't' terms in the string:\n\nt108, t101, t170, t67, t154, t26, t151, t162, t76, t13, t100, t2, t162, t162, t76, t162, t2, t108, t101, t151, t91, t97, t65, t71, t108, t101, t45.\n\nI'll need to find a path for each of these from their respective non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, NT99 and NT89 must each derive to sequences that start with t108, etc. Let's look at NT99 and NT89 separately.\n\nFirst, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Now, NT6 can produce 't108' (from NT6 \u2192 't108'), and NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT52. Wait, NT24 \u2192 't123' (from NT24 \u2192 't123'), NT52 \u2192 't104' (since NT52 \u2192 't104'). So if NT99 is producing NT6 (which gives 't108') and NT103 (which can produce t24 and t104). Wait, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for each 't' term in the string and see if it can be derived.\n\nLet's take the first 't108'. This corresponds to the terminal 't' generated by NT6: looking in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't108'. So for the first step, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and both NT99 and NT89 must derive to strings starting with 't108', 'something'.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each production produces exactly two non-terminals (except for terminals), and S is the start, so perhaps we need to consider S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the string will be the concatenation of NT99's derivation and NT89's derivation.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' is a single terminal, so each must be produced directly by a non-terminal in one step (since all other production rules involve combinations of two non-terminals, which would mean multiple steps, but the grammar in CNF allows for only two symbols at a time, either another non-terminal or a terminal). So each terminal must be a direct production of some non-terminal.\n\nLet's list all the non-terminals and see which terminals they can produce:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't107' (from NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17)\nNT17 \u2192 't22' (from NT17 \u2192 NT22)\nNT22 \u2192 't24' (from NT22 \u2192 NT99 NT24)\nWait, no. Wait, NT17 \u2192 't22', so NT17 can produce 't22'. Then, NT22 \u2192 't24'.\nWait, perhaps not. Let me go through each non-terminal.\n\nWait, it's easier to make a list of each non-terminal and their direct terminal productions. Let's go through the grammar:\n\n NT15 -> NT75 NT57\n NT15 \u2192 nothing terminal here except looking up other rules; actually, NT15 doesn't directly produce terminals, but let me check:\n\nWait, let's check NT15: all the rules are about producing other non-terminals. None of its rules directly have a terminal. So NT15 must be derived by combining other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 't107'\u2014yes, NT1 can produce 't107'.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't151'\nSo NT7 can produce 't151'.\n\nNT21 \u2192 't171'\nSo NT21 can produce 't171'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't108', which would come from NT6 or other non-terminals. Let me check each non-terminal for direct terminal productions.\n\nLet's make a list:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't107' (1)\nNT7 \u2192 't151' (2)\nNT17 \u2192 't22' (3)\nNT21 \u2192 't171' (4)\nNT25: Not sure, since in the grammar, NT25 isn't mentioned\u2014Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT25.\n\nWait, I need to parse all the given non-terminals and their direct terminal productions.\n\nLet me go through each line in the grammar:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like \"t91 t101 t170...\" and so on. The grammar seems pretty complex with many productions, each taking two symbols to produce another two or leading to a terminal 't' with some number. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this grammar does. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> t, where t is a terminal. In this case, all the productions either combine two non-terminals or produce a terminal with a specific number or a combination of a 't' and a number. The terminals in the string are of the form t followed by a number, so my job is to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the target string: it's \"t91 t101 t170 t67 t130 t0 t13 t76 t13 t146 t2 t76 t13 t146 t0 t177 t0 t2 t91 t101 t162 t177 t0 t172 t26 t162 t45\". Let me count how many tokens there are. Each 't' followed by a number is a token. Counting them: 1,2,3,... up to 27 tokens. So the string is 27 tokens long.\n\nNow, to determine if this is in the language, I'll need to figure out how the string could have been generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. \n\nI notice that the grammar has a lot of productions leading to 't' followed by specific numbers. For example, NT7 -> NT21 NT9, which might produce t22, because looking at 't21' in the grammar, NT21 -> 't171' according to the productions. Wait, NT21 is 't171', so if NT7 -> NT21 NT9 and NT9 -> 't49', then NT7 would produce t171 t49, which is \"t171 t49\". But in the string, we have \"t171 t0...\". Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, some of the productions result in just a terminal, like NT1 -> 't107'. In the string, I see \"t107\" as token 5: the fifth token is 't130', which might come from a longer production.\n\nWait, let me try to look for patterns in the string. For example, the string starts with t91, then t101, then t170, t67, t130, t0, etc. Maybe these numbers correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar, and I can try to trace back through the productions.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. There are several non-terminals and each production sometimes leads to combinations of t's with specific numbers. For example, let's see the production NT9 -> 't134' in the grammar (NT9 -> 't134'). So, NT9 produces just t134. Similarly, NT7 -> 't151' and NT100 -> 't127', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, there are multiple occurrences of t91, t101, and others. Perhaps these numbers correspond to a particular non-terminal that branches into those t's. Another approach is to see if these t's form a valid sequence according to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S. The initial production is S -> NT99 NT99. From S, we derive into two NT99s. Now, each NT99 would produce something. Looking at the grammar, NT99 has two productions: NT99 -> NT61 NT76 and NT99 -> 't63'. So, NT99 can either split further into NT61 and NT76 or produce 't63'.\n\nIn our string, the first token is 't91', which is t91. Let's see what can produce 't91'. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that directly results in 't91'. For example, checking NT7: NT7 has a production NT7 -> NT21 NT9, which if NT21 produces 't171' and NT9 produces 't49', that would make 't171 t49', which isn't 't91'. Alternatively, NT1 -> 't107', but that's not 91 either.\n\nWait, maybe 't91' comes from NT6, but looking at NT6: NT6 has a production -> 't51'? Let me check. In the grammar, NT6 -> 't108' (wait, no, looking at the given grammar, the production NT6 is 't108'? No, wait: the grammar entries say for NT6: \"NT61 -> NT84 NT73\", \"NT68 -> NT45 NT71\", \"NT6 -> 't108'\", \"NT19 -> 't99'\", etc. Wait, so NT6 -> 't108'. So if I see a 't91', that doesn't come from NT6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't91' is from NT41, but the grammar entries include \"NT16 -> 't112'\", \"NT14 -> 't23'\", etc. Not sure. Maybe 't91' is from NT9: NT9 -> 't134' (from \"NT9 -> 't134'\"), so that's a terminal, but not 91. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider the overall structure. Starting from S, which is NT99 NT99. So each of these can be expanded either into NT61 NT76 or into 't63'. Since the string starts with 't91', which is different from 't63', the initial split must be NT99 -> NT61 NT76. Then, NT61 and NT76 are further expanded.\n\nWait, let's try to see: the first part of the string is t91 t101 t170 t67 t130 t0... Let me see how these could fit into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should represent the entire string as a parse tree according to the grammar. But that's complex. Another approach is to see if each token can be derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token: t91. The only way to get t91 is if there is a non-terminal that directly produces t91. Looking through the grammar entries, I don't see any production that results in t91. The closest is NT7 which goes to 't151' or combining NT21 and NT9, which might result in higher numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each t followed by a number is a production, but the grammar might have productions that combine to form strings. Maybe it's possible that t91 is part of a larger production chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t numbers in the string correspond to a part of a non-terminal's expansion. For example, if a non-terminal NT15 has a production like NT15 -> NT23 NT57, which might result in a t followed by 23 and 57, or maybe in another production.\n\nWait, let me take a step back. Since the string is a series of t's with numbers, the grammar must have enough productions that can chain these t's together in the correct order.\n\nWait another thought: maybe t91 is part of a production where a non-terminal NT77 -> 't56' according to the grammar. Or maybe a combination. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or the sequence of t's cannot be connected by the given productions. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider which non-terminals can produce which t's. For example:\n\nLooking for where t91 appears: I don\u2019t see any NT production directly leading to t91. However, in the grammar, NT68 -> 't134', NT91 -> 't164', and others. Hmm, no t91 is generated by a rule. So perhaps 't91' arises from a combination of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT73 -> 't167'. NT17 -> 't22', and so on. Let me think about the productions that result in t91 or nearby.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down into tokens that come from different production paths.\n\nWait, another thought: since it's a leftmost derivation, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be split into substrings that each come"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That makes parsing easier because each production can split the string into two parts at each step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t108 t101 t146 t105 t67 t130 t67 t73 t171 t54 t94 t174 t51 t130 t94 t0 t172 t124 t158 t98 t105 t98 t0 t172 t26 t162 t139 t178`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT99 NT89. So the string should start with the concatenation of symbols derived from NT99 and NT89. Let me check what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT99 is `NT99 NT57` and NT89 is `NT61 NT76`. So, breaking it down, the string must come from two branches: one starting with NT99 and the other with NT89. \n\nLet me consider the first part: NT99 \u2192 NT57. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT99 is `NT57 NT93`. Wait, no, actually, looking again: the grammar for NT99 is `NT68 NT103`. Wait, let me correct that. Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT99: It's in the list as `NT99 -> NT68 NT103`. So NT99 splits into NT68 and NT103.\n\nSimilarly, NT89: In the grammar, it's `NT89 -> NT44 NT1`. So for NT89, it becomes NT44 and NT1.\n\nSo the initial string should start with NT68 (from NT99) and NT44 (from NT89), or rather, the NT99 branch starts as NT99, which becomes NT68 and NT103, and the NT89 becomes NT44 and NT1.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol S is NT99 NT89, so the first step is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which becomes NT99 NT99 NT89 NT89? No, wait, no. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the entire string is the concatenation of the derivations of NT99 and NT89. So each of these non-terminals will expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, and their concatenation forms the entire string.\n\nSo the string is \"t108 t101 t146 t105 t67 t130 t67 t73 t171 t54 t94 t174 t51 t130 t94 t0 t172 t124 t158 t98 t105 t98 t0 t172 t26 t162 t139 t178\".\n\nSo to parse this, I need to see if it can be split into two parts, one generated by NT99 and the other by NT89.\n\nLet me first see what each NT99 and NT89 derive into.\n\nNT99 is `NT68 NT103`. Let's see what NT68 and NT103 produce.\n\nNT68 in the grammar is `NT45 NT71`. NT45: Looking through, NT45 is `NT24 NT88`. NT24: `NT54 NT65`, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, NT45 is directly mapped to 't98' because looking at the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce a 't'.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar rules step by step.\n\nI think it's easier to break down each production into terminals and non-terminals and see the steps.\n\nFor NT68: It is `NT45 NT71`. NT45 is `NT24 NT88`. NT24: Looking in the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, but further down, I see NT24 is mapped to 't123'. Wait, but that's a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, at the end, there are rules where some non-terminals are assigned to a single 't' value, like NT24 \u2192 't123', NT17 \u2192 't22', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, let me see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT24 NT88\n\nNT24 \u2192 't123' (from NT24 \u2192 t123?)\n\nWait, looking at the list, no: I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT54 NT65\n\nNT54 -> NT42 NT75\n\nNT42 -> NT163 (Wait, no, looking through the grammar, some entries have rules like NT11 -> 't96', NT48 -> 't11', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by building a tree, but that might take a while. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, but that requires building a parse table. Alternatively, consider breaking down the string into possible branches.\n\nWait, the string starts with t108, which comes from either NT99 or NT89. But wait, in S, it's NT99 and NT89, so after splitting, the two parts are NT99's expansion and NT89's expansion.\n\nSo let me see:\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT99 NT89, the string starts with the NT99 part and then the NT89 part.\n\nSo the first part should be derived from NT99, which is NT68 NT103. So the first two elements of the string should come from NT68 and NT103.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108. Let's see if t108 is in the productions of NT68 or NT103.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT68 is mapped to 't123' (if I remember correctly, but wait let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> 't123'\n\nNT48 -> 't11'\n\nNT24 -> 't123'\n\nSo, for example, NT24 can be 't123'. Now, looking for 't108', what is its origin?\n\nLooking through all entries, I see:\n\nNT108 is mapped to 't118', NT106 \u2192 't35', etc. Wait, but in the initial list, I see:\n\n- NT108 \u2192 't118'\n\nBut wait, the string has t108 as the first token. So perhaps t108 comes from NT108, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT108 would be a terminal if in the grammar it's directly mapped.\n\nWait, the parsing is in CNF, so the derivation would go through non-terminals, each splitting into two, until terminals are reached.\n\nSo let me map out the possible splits.\n\nAnother approach is to see whether the entire string can be covered by two sequences, one starting with the expansion of NT99 and the other with NT89, each sequence consisting of productions that split into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, for each part (NT99 and NT89), try to see if their derived sequences can match the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nSo, starting with the NT99 part:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n\nSo the string is split into two: before NT103 and after. The initial token is t108. Let's see if t108 can be generated by NT68 or by NT103.\n\nLooking up NT68, in the grammar, it's `NT45 NT71`, and NT45 and NT71 are further broken down.\n\nBut perhaps in the grammar, some non-terminals are mapped directly to terminals. For example, NT24 \u2192 't123', NT17 \u2192 't22', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, some non-terminals map to terminals directly:\n\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT17 -> 't22'\n- NT29 -> 't156' and 't156'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT76 \u2192 't178'? Wait no, according to the grammar, NT76 is mapped to 't178"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in CNF, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can see that each non-terminal on the left side of a production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the terminals, which are single. So, the parsing will involve expanding non-terminals step by step, but each step reduces the number of non-terminals.\n\nThe string given has many `t` followed by numbers, which likely correspond to terminals in the grammar. Each `t` part like `t108`, `t101`, etc., is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to analyze the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar by starting from the start symbol S and expanding it. \n\nThe start symbol S produces NT99 NT89 according to the first production:\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nSo, the string should start with the symbols derived from NT99 and NT89. Let me check the string.\n\nThe first part is `t108 t101`. Let's see if NT99 and NT89 produce these symbols.\n\nLooking at the NT99 production, in the grammar:\nNT99 has a production that includes `t108`\u2014for example, `t108` is in the production of NT99. Similarly, NT89 has production that includes `t101` from `NT64 -> NT100 NT93`, and `NT64` produces `t100`. Wait, no, let me check directly.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, each non-terminal can have multiple productions. But in the grammar, each production for a non-terminal is on a line, so for example:\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\n... etc.\n\nBut looking for NT99, perhaps the only production for NT99 is something like producing a `t` and another non-terminal, or maybe it's a two-step process. Wait, the given grammar seems long; I should perhaps find the productions for NT99 and NT89.\n\nChecking through the list:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, and they are all in Chomsky Normal Form. Each non-terminal on the left becomes a production with two non-terminals on the right until it reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for NT99:\n\nI have to scan through all the rules to find NT99. Let me see. The rules given are lengthy, and I have to find where NT99 is.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (from the fourth rule after NT83)\nWait, actually, looking through the rules:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT15 NT2\nNT55 \u2192 NT95 NT18\nNT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93\nNT100 \u2192 NT51 NT96\nNT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n...\nWait, perhaps I should parse the entire list systematically.\n\nWait, I notice that in the initial rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\nNT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n...\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to check which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the given string:\n\nThe first two symbols are `t108` and `t101`. So, perhaps NT99 and NT89, when expanded, start with `t108` and `t101`, respectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbol NT99 expands to a terminal followed by another non-terminal, but in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal. So, looking for a production where NT99 directly leads to t108 and another symbol.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the possible terminals that each non-terminal can produce.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by working backwards. Let's check if the string can be constructed by starting with the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t108 t101 t165 t130 t21 t158 t130 t110 t101 t0 t105 t98 t0 t151 t100 t144 t94 t158 t130 t94 t0 t105 t98 t2 t50 t141 t94 t22`\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to check if each `t` in the string corresponds to a production that exists in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, each non-terminal that directly produces a `t` is listed.

Hmm, I notice that each production in the grammar seems to follow the CNF structure, which typically has productions of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t108 t101 t158 t130 t144 t134 t101 t123 t98 t0 t156 t93 t134 t101 t165 t130 t110 t101 t2 t157 t98 t65 t67 t108 t144 t139 t141 t174 t24`.\n\nI realize that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, the string consists of several terminal symbols. The non-terminals in the grammar (like NT99, NT89, etc.) will need to be expanded until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either splits into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. Since the string contains only terminals, all non-terminals must have been expanded in some way.\n\nI'll start by examining each symbol in the string and see if it can be matched by any rule in the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is t108. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT68 can produce t134, and NT108 can produce t118. Wait, but t108 isn't directly produced by any NT symbol in the grammar. Let me check the rules again. NT100 -> t127, NT108 -> t118. Hmm, so t108 isn't directly in the terminals. That seems like a problem because the string starts with t108, which isn't present in any terminal production. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the NT symbols that expand into terminals. For example, NT1 -> t171, NT2 -> t26, etc. But nowhere in the grammar do I see an NT symbol directly expanding to t108. So that's strange because the first symbol is t108, which isn't allowed by any production. So that would immediately make the string invalid because none of the NT symbols expand directly to t108.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me go through each terminal symbol in the string to see if any production can generate them.\n\nt108: As per the grammar, no NT symbol directly produces t108. It only appears in NT108 -> t118, but not t108 itself. So the first symbol can't be produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nThat would mean the answer is 'No' because the string can't be generated by the provided grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, that's a long string, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, the string is made up of a series of terminal symbols like t108, t101, etc. So each token in the string is a terminal that must be derived directly from a production rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which initially produces NT99 and NT89. Let's see what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nNT6 \u2192 t108\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45\nNT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\nNT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75\nNT42 \u2192 NT165 NT81\nNT165 \u2192 NT107 NT171\nNT107 \u2192 NT94 NT174\nNT94 \u2192 NT23 NT171 \u2192 Wait, I need to look at the productions for NT107 and NT94. Let me check:\n\nNT107 \u2192 NT94 NT174\nNT94 \u2192 NT23 NT171\nNT23 \u2192 NT40 NT107\nNT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\nAnd so on. Hmm, this seems a bit tangled. Let me try building the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 NT6 is t108, so that's the first part. Then NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45.\n\nNT24 \u2192 t134? Wait, looking at the productions, let me check NT24. Oh, in the grammar, there's a production NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT54. And NT43 \u2192 NT2 NT1? No, wait, let me check the productions properly.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT54\n- NT43 \u2192 NT2 NT1? No, NT43 isn't in any of the initial lines. Let me go through the list again to find NT43's definition.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't2'\n\nAh, right. Wait, the grammar is provided in a long list. Let me find where NT43 is defined.\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\nNT43 -> 't2'\n\nYes, so NT43 produces the terminal 't2'. So NT43 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. That means in the production NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT54, since NT43 is a terminal, this production effectively becomes 't2' followed by whatever NT54 produces.\n\nSo, let's process this:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 \u2192 t108 NT103\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45 \u2192 't2' NT54 NT45\nWait, no: looking back, NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. So NT24 \u2192 't2' NT54 (since NT43 is a terminal, so NT24 becomes 't2' plus NT54).\n\nWait, NT45 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT45 does. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT45 listed as an LHS. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, in the grammar, each rule is for a specific non-terminal. So if a non-terminal appears on the RHS, we need to check its production.\n\nLooking for NT45: in the provided grammar, I don't see NT45 as a head of any production. Wait, let me look again. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan through the list.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT105 \u2192 't115'?\nWait, the list seems quite long. Let me check if any rules have NT45 as the LHS. Scanning through, I don't see any NT45 \u2192 ... So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the given grammar rules. Maybe I can see.\n\nYes, looking through the list, I see terms like NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70, so if NT24's productions are defined in terms of NT43 and NT54, which may themselves have productions.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to start from the string and work backward to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt108 t101 t165 t130 t23 t127 t154 t130 t171 t169 t104 t108 t101 t69 t139 t98 t2 t162 t174 t72 t171 t94 t69 t98 t2 t157 t141 t65 t24\n\nThat's 30 tokens. Each token is a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of terminals. Our goal is to see if this sequence is generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step of derivation increases the length by one, starting from S (which is a non-terminal) and each expansion replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must eventually replace all non-terminals with these terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from right to left, trying to match it with the grammar using reverse\u5de5\u7a0b.\n\nMethod: Start from the end of the string and try to build a production tree.\n\nThe end of the string is t24. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce a terminal as their last symbol. Looking at the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT89\n- NT1 \u2192 't107'... etc.\n\nLooking for a production where the last non-terminal on the right-hand side is t24.\n\nWait, NT24 \u2192 't134'? No. Wait, looking back, I found a production for NT48 \u2192 't11', NT42 \u2192 't141'? Hmm.\n\nWait, more carefully:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't139' NT41\n- NT24 \u2192 't123' NT17\n- NT12 \u2192 't80' NT69\n- NT17 \u2192 't22' NT171\n- NT67 \u2192 't67'\n- NT68 \u2192 't145' NT12\n- NT105 \u2192 't115' NT31\n- NT65 \u2192 't157' NT71\n- NT108 \u2192 't118' NT118 (maybe)\n- Wait, I think I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each production is context-free and in CNF, so each step splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for the string, each terminal must be the result of a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the last symbol, t24. So, which productions end with a terminal? For example, NT24 \u2192 't134'? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT54 \u2192 but NT43 is a terminal (from NT43 \u2192 t2).\nWait, no: in the given grammar, NT43 is defined as a production to 't2', yes.\n\nSo, NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT54. Since NT43 is a terminal, this becomes t2 followed by whatever NT54 produces.\n\nBut for this to be the case, the string must end with t2 ... t54... but the last token is t24. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps there's another production for NT24 that ends with t24 directly.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't134' NT25 \u2192 No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, wait, the numbers are part of the terminal symbols. So, each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal, but the grammar is supposed to be in CNF. Hmm. Wait, CNF has productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So in this case, the grammar seems to have some terminals, which would mean it's not strictly in CNF. But the user said it's in CNF, so perhaps the numbers are part of the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each rule is a terminal (the number) or two non-terminals, which makes sense because in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC. So each rule in the grammar either is a terminal (like 't134') or two non-terminals (like NT7 -> NT21 NT9). Wait, but looking at the grammar, some rules have three parts separated by spaces, which might indicate a mix. For example, the first rule is S -> NT99 NT89, which is two non-terminals. Then, looking further, some have three parts like NT107 -> NT35 NT108, which would mean three non-terminals, which isn't allowed in CNF. So that must be a mistake. Oh, perhaps the formatting is such that some rules are presented incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the space is just formatting, and each rule is two elements, some of which are terminals. But then, wait, in that case, some rules would have two terminals, which would still be allowed in CNF, but that's not typical.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is misrepresented here. It's possible that the actual grammar only has each rule as two elements, with the numbers being terminal symbols. So, for example, S is rewritten as NT99 NT89, which are both non-terminals. Then NT99 is rewritten as something else, and so on. Wait, but in the given grammar, I see some rules like NT11 -> 't17' which seems like a terminal. So maybe the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals as right-hand sides. That would make it not strictly CNF because in CNF, each production is either one terminal or two non-terminals. So if the grammar has, for example, NT11 -> 't17', which is a single terminal, that's okay. But if there are any two-terminals, that's fine too, as CNF allows two terminals.\n\nWait, but going back, in the user's message, they provided the grammar followed by the string, which includes 't108 t101 t170 t67 t90 t26 t13 t100 t23 t24 t139 t98 t98 t69 t101 t94 t67 t90 t26 t94 t174 t34 t71 t177 t91 t101 t158 t98 t2 t121'.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, all terminals. So each token in the string is a terminal symbol, which would mean that in the grammar, all productions should be either single terminals or two non-terminals. So for example, S -> NT99 NT89 is okay because both NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals. But other rules like NT35 -> NT68 NT103 are also okay because both are non-terminals. However, some rules have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which would be acceptable because that's just two terminals. Wait, no: in the grammar, the rule is written as NT107 -> NT35 NT108, which is two non-terminals, so that's okay. But if a rule is like NT99 -> t170 NT99, that would have a terminal and a non-terminal, which is allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side if they're non-terminals, or one terminal if it's a single terminal. So the grammar provided has some right-hand sides with two symbols, which are either both non-terminals (like S -> NT99 NT89) or one might be a terminal if allowed.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, for example, the first rule is S -> NT99 NT89. So, both NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals. Then, looking at the rest, there are rules like NT11 -> 't17', which is a terminal. There's also a rule like NT48 -> NT106 NT31, which is two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but then some rules have three parts, like NT107 -> NT35 NT108, which is two non-terminals, so okay. Hmm, but wait, in the initial grammar, I see this: \"NT107 -> NT35 NT108\" and \"NT107 -> NT65 NT177\". So, both are two non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused because in the user's message, they wrote the grammar as a series of lines, some with two parts and others with more. For example, some lines say:\n\nNT7 -> NT21 NT9\n\nand others:\n\nNT49 -> NT68 NT118\n\nWait, that's okay. So each production is either a single terminal (like 't134') or two non-terminals. So in the grammar, each rule has either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nSo the entire grammar is in CNF, containing both types of productions.\n\nNow, the string to analyze is: t108 t101 t170 t67 t90 t26 t13 t100 t23 t24 t139 t98 t98 t69 t101 t94 t67 t90 t26 t94 t174 t34 t71 t177 t91 t101 t158 t98 t2 t121.\n\nEach token is a terminal, so each must appear as a right-hand side of a production.\n\nThe approach is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through successive applications of the grammar rules.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, and it's in CNF, perhaps using a CYK algorithm would be the way to go. Alternatively, we can simulate the parsing by checking if the entire string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut simulating the CYK algorithm here would be time-consuming, especially as the string is 30 tokens long, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since all productions except for the terminals allow splitting into two non-terminals, we can check if each step reduces the string correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string step by step, starting from the longest possible leftmost derivation, but that might take time.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any non-terminal can directly produce the terminal tokens in the string. Looking at the first rule: S -> NT99 NT89, which would need both NT99 and NT89 to produce the first two terminals. So, let's see what NT99 and NT89 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 is defined as NT55 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the string is a sequence of these tokens. The grammar is given in CNF, which has production rules where each rule's left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, several non-terminals are mapped to terminal strings. For example, NT15 is 't90', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT17 is 't171', which is also a terminal. I can make a list of all the production rules and their corresponding terminals.\n\nThe initial symbol in the grammar is S, which produces NT99 NT89. So, the derivation starts with S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nNow, I want to see if I can construct the given string by replacing non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, matching the given string.\n\nLet's break down the string token by token and see if each can be matched by the RHS of some grammar production.\n\n1. `t91`: Looking at the grammar, NT17 is 't171', NT19 is 't99', and NT21 is 't171' again. Wait, maybe I should check all NTs that map to 't91'. Hmm, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly maps to 't91'. That's a problem because the string starts with `t91`, which would require a production that directly outputs that, but none of the NTs map exactly to 't91'. \n\nWait, maybe the NT is somewhere else. Let me check each NT to see if any map to 't91'. Scanning through the grammar, for example, NT21 is 't171', NT28 is 't76', etc. I don't see any NT that maps to 't91'. So this seems like a red flag. If the string starts with `t91`, but none of the NTs in the grammar produce 't91', then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar. But I should double-check in case I missed something.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT15 -> NT90\n- NT17 -> 't171'\n- NT19 -> 't99'\n- NT21 -> 't171'\n- NT23 -> 't156'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n- NT35 -> various, none is 't91'\n- NT39 -> various\n- NT40 -> various\n- NT45 -> 't98'\n- NT46 -> 't99'\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT52 -> 't177' etc.\n- NT64 -> 't24'\n- NT68 -> several\n- NT71 -> etc.\n- NT73 -> etc.\n- NT76 -> etc.\n- NT89 -> various.\n\nI don't see any NT that produces 't91', so the string `t91` cannot be part of any derivation since no NT can directly produce 't91'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check if any production rule can resolve to 't91'. For example, if a non-terminal could eventually derive 't91' through several steps, but looking through the grammar, it seems that none of the RHS of the productions result in a terminal 't91'. Each NT's production either results in terminals like 't26', 't67', etc., or other non-terminals that might produce more tokens.\n\nSince the first token is `t91` and there's no NT that can directly produce it, the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-566","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of productions, and the string is a sequence of tokens, each represented as 't' followed by a number. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions start from there. Looking at the grammar, it's mostly non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals or terminals that represent numbers. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which means S is two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals probably eventually leads to producing a 't' token with a specific number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t108 t101 t101 t0 t76 t98 t69 t101 t174 t34 t97 t151 t104 t91 t101 t121 t115 t146 t76 t80 t101 t0 t104 t108 t101 t0 t8 t69 t94 t24`.\n\nEach token in this string is like a terminal symbol, and I need to check if there's a derivation path that produces this sequence starting from S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first production. S can produce NT99 and NT89. So each of these, when resolved, must produce the corresponding tokens in the string. Let's see the order: the string starts with t108, then t101, t101, t0, etc. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89 would mean that the first non-terminal NT99 produces something, the second NT89 produces something else. Each non-terminal must derive into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 is a non-terminal. Let me see what productions are for NT99. Scanning through, I see NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. So NT99 splits into NT6 and NT103. Each of these might produce specific numbers.\n\nContinuing this way, NT6 can then produce further non-terminals. For example, NT6 might split into NT67 and NT73. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT73 has a production NT73 \u2192 NT68 NT70, and so on, eventually leading to terminals like t69, t71, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT eventually produces a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, there are productions like NT23 \u2192 't23', NT24 \u2192 't24', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce t23, t24, and so on.\n\nSo, for the string, each segment must correspond to the non-terminals in the correct order. So, starting with S, I need to split the string into parts that each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking at the first part: the string starts with t108. So perhaps that's the result of one of the non-terminals coming from S. Let's see which NT can produce t108. Looking at the grammar, I can't see any NT directly producing t108 because in the given productions, the only terminals are things like t107, t16, t24, t76, etc. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t108 or t101 or t76 or others, except for those in the later productions. Wait, no, perhaps I need to check the grammar again.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the later productions have 't' as their terminal. For example, looking at the production NT57 \u2192 NT52 NT75. But I'm looking for something that directly produces a t. Let me scan for 't' in the productions. Wait, the given productions end with things like NT84 \u2192 't17', or earlier 't108', 't118', etc. Oh, I see.\n\nSo, for example, some NTs directly produce t24, t17, t93, etc. So each step in the string is a result of a non-terminal expanding into one or more terminals, which in CNF, each production is a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string has 30 tokens, so the parse tree must have a structure that results in exactly 30 output symbols. Each step in the parse tree either adds two symbols (like A \u2192 BC) or one (A \u2192 a).\n\nSo, starting with S, which splits into NT99 and NT89. Each of these could be non-terminals that split further into other non-terminals or terminals. The first token is t108. Let's see what production can produce t108.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT80 \u2192 t67 (looking at NT68 \u2192 t67, no, NT67 doesn't produce t67? Wait, looking for t108: in NT52 \u2192 't17', NT107 \u2192 't174', NT77 \u2192 't121', but I don't see any NT directly producing t108. Hmm, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps the NTs split and then somewhere down the line a production leads to t108. For example, perhaps NT96 \u2192 t105, which is another NT that splits into NT52 and something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into the possible non-terminals that could produce that token.\n\nLet me start with the entire string:\n\nt108 t101 t101 t0 t76 t98 t69 t101 t174 t34 t97 t151 t104 t91 t101 t121 t115 t146 t76 t80 t101 t0 t104 t108 t101 t0 t8 t69 t94 t24\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT99 NT89, we need to split the string into two parts: the first part ends when NT99 is resolved, and the second part starts with NT89, which then splits into terms.\n\nWait, not necessarily splitting into two parts immediately. Each non-terminal could produce multiple symbols, so it's a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is built step by step, choosing non-terminals to expand. But with such a complex structure, it's hard to track.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the bottom-up derivation, starting from the string and trying to reduce using the grammar's productions. But the grammar is presented in CNF, which makes it easier for top-down parsers, but for reduction, perhaps we can approach it as follows.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is 't24'. So the last production must be something that produces t24 directly. Looking in the grammar, I see several NTs that produce t24: for example, NT24 \u2192 't24', but also, looking for terminals in the productions:\n\nLooking through all the grammar productions for t24, I see NT24 \u2192 't24' and maybe others? Wait, for example, NT89 \u2192 't24' is a production? Wait, looking through the given rules:\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the productions don't show NT89 \u2192 't24'. Let me check: in the list, I see NT89: the last few rules are NT89 \u2192 't169', 't60', etc., but not 't24'.\n\nWait, perhaps somewhere in the middle, some NT splits into a terminal and another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I see rules like NT91 \u2192 't164', NT69 \u2192 't94', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the token 't24' comes from an NT that eventually splits into NT24. Let me think: to produce 't24', perhaps the production is NT24 \u2192 't24'. Looking for any NG24 in the productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under the productions, there's a rule NT24 \u2192 't24' as per the rule: NT24 \u2192 't24' (assuming I'm reading the list correctly).\n\nLooking through the provided list, some of the later rules do have 't' as the terminal. For example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't123'\nWait, no, looking through the given rules, at line 12: NT24 \u2192 't123'\nWait no, line 12 says NT24 \u2192 't123'? No, looking again:\n\nList of rules:\n\nI see a rule at line 24: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-562","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal and a non-terminal or two non-terminals. This should make parsing easier because Chomsky normal form has a specific structure that can be handled with certain algorithms.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and it directly produces NT99 and NT89. So the string must start with these two tokens, right? Or wait, in the grammar, S -> NT99 NT89. So the start symbol produces two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89. So the first two tokens in the string should come from these two NTs.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t91 t101 t158 t98 t151 t162 t11 t71 t174 t71 t108 t101 t13 t100 t94 t0 t13 t65 t72 t23 t24 t174 t91 t101 t177 t108 t101 t50 t141 t174 t24.\"\n\nThe first two tokens are t91 and t101. Are these the results of NT99 and NT89? Let me check the productions for NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT99 only appears on the right-hand side of a production: NT106 -> NT35 NT107; NT68 -> NT45 NT71; NT73 -> NT83 NT70; etc. Wait, actually, NT99 isn't a left-hand side of any production. The only non-terminals on the left are S and various NTs, but NT99 is only on the right in some productions.\n\nLooking for NT99, I see in the grammar:\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT96 -> NT1 NT108\n- NT61 -> NT84 NT44\nWait, no NT99. So perhaps I need to look for which parts generate t91 and t101.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should build a tree from the given string using the grammar. The process would involve starting from S and applying the grammar rules step by step until I get the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there's a way to derive the given string by replacing non-terminals with terminals according to the rules.\n\nAnother approach is to create a parse tree. Let's try to see how the string can be generated.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string should start with t99 and t89, but in the given string, the first two tokens are t91 and t101. So maybe S is not the start node here? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, S is the top symbol, so any derivation must start with S. So the first step must replace S with NT99 NT89. But in the string, the first two tokens are t91 and t101. So perhaps these are from NT99 and NT89's productions.\n\nLooking for t91 and t101 being generated from NT99 and NT89 respectively, but in the grammar, I don't see any production that introduces t91 or t101 directly. So maybe t91 and t101 come from deeper in the derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar production rules, let's see what produces t91. Scanning through the production rules, I see NT17 -> 't24', NT19 -> 't99', NT22 -> 't12', etc. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT73 -> 't167', but that's not it. Also, NT1 -> 't107 NT17', but that seems to mix a terminal and a non-terminal, which may not be a problem, but I'm looking for a production that directly gives a terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar rules also have some that directly produce a single terminal, like NT100 -> 't127', NT108 -> 't118', etc. So perhaps t91 is produced by some NT rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, none of the NTs directly produce 't91', and none directly produce 't101'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe t91 and t101 are generated by other rules that I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking again, the rules have some production that result in single terminals. For example, NT100 -> 't127'. Wait, but the string has a 't91' in position 3, which is the third token. So if the first two tokens are NT99 and NT89, their productions would involve other non-terminals, which would then produce the 't91' and 't101' as their results.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how 't91' is generated. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT71 -> 't69' and NT73 -> 't73', but not 't91'. Wait, I'm not seeing any production that directly produces 't91' except maybe in a two-step process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work backward from the given string and see if it can be reduced by the grammar. That is, see if the string can be broken down into the productions of the grammar, substituting the non-terminals.\n\nLet's start from the end. The string is a series of t's followed by numbers. The order is: t91, t101, t158, t98, t151, t162, t11, t71, t174, t71, t108, t101, t13, t100, t94, t0, t13, t65, t72, t23, t24, t174, t91, t101, t177, t108, t101, t50, t141, t174, t24.\n\nHmm, this is a very long string. Maybe a better approach is to see if there's a pattern or if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar again and see how the non-terminals can generate the terminals.\n\nFor example, NT106 -> NT35 NT107, which could potentially generate more non-terminals. But some of these produce terminals. For instance, NT88 -> NT69 NT11, and NT11 is a terminal 't17', and NT91 is 't174'? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT88 -> NT69 NT11. Oh, and NT69 is 't51', and NT11 is 't17'. Wait, so NT88 can be replaced by 't51 t17'. Similarly, NT91 is replaced by 't164', according to one of the rules where NT91 -> 't164'. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see NT91 -> 't164' only once, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the rules, I see some lines where NT107 -> 't94', but that's NT107 -> 't94', but NT68 -> 't63' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the production rules and map each NT symbol to its possible productions to understand how the tokens can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a repeating or repetitive structure, which could suggest that it's generated by a certain part of the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I notice that the initial part is \"t91 t101 t158 t98 t151 t162 t11 t71 t174 t71 t108 t101 t13 t100 t94 t0 t13 t65 t72 t23 t24 t174 t91 t101 t177 t108 t101 t50 t141 t174 t24\".\n\nThe first token is t91. Let's see if any NT symbol can generate t91. I see that NT17 -> 't24' and NT19 -> 't99', but that's not helpful. Wait, searching through the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce t91?

{"custom_id":"request-583","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). CNF means each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal, except for the start symbol which can have just a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. Then each of those expands into other non-terminals, eventually leading down to terminals like 't108', 't101', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t108 t101 t158 t130 t110 t101 t0 t171 t169 t146 t0 t13 t100 t94 t0 t13 t100 t98 t50 t101 t0 t104 t91 t101 t104 t0 t50 t141 t94 t22.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Each step must produce the next token in the string.\n\nFirst, S produces NT99 and NT89. So S => NT99 NT89. Now, each NT needs to expand into the correct tokens.\n\nLooking at NT99: In the grammar, NT99 is defined as NT6 NT103. So NT99 => NT6 NT103. NT6 is defined as NT108, and NT103 is NT24. So NT6 => NT108, NT103 => NT24. Then, NT108 is a terminal 't108' and NT24 is 't123' but in the string, the next token is 't108'. Wait, but NT24 in the grammar has productions, like NT24 -> NT123, which in turn might be terminals. Hmm, but in the string, after NT99 comes 't108' and then 't101'. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe first part of the string is t108. So, looking for where t108 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 -> t108 is a production. Also, NT108 is a terminal? Wait, no\u2014check the grammar rules. Wait, in the given grammar, many non-terminals end up producing terminals. Let me list each rule to see if any produce 't108'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 -> t108\n- NT106 -> t108\n- NT108 is a terminal? Wait, no, NT108 isn't listed as a rule; it's likely a terminal based on the rules it's derived from. Or does it derive a terminal?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the rules end with specific terminals. For example, NT16 -> 't93', which is a terminal. So, each non-terminal eventually produces a single terminal. Therefore, each non-terminal is a single-step production to a specific terminal.\n\nWait, but the rules are chains. For example, NT68 can expand further until it reaches a terminal. Let me check NT68:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT68 -> NT45 NT71. Then, NT45 -> t98, and NT71 -> t1. So, NT68 => (t98)(t1) -> t98 t1. But in the string, it's just 't108' without anything else. So maybe NT68 is only a terminal of 't108' elsewhere.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake. The initial rules might be more straightforward. Let's check where 't108' comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT68 -> t108, so that's a direct production. Also, NT106 -> t108. So 't108' can come directly from NT68 or NT106.\n\nLooking back at the string: the first token is t108. So that could be from NT68 or NT106.\n\nAssuming it's from NT68, then the next step is NT89 \u2192 NT89. Wait, no: the entire string is the product of S, which is NT99 NT89. So the first part is NT99, which we determined is NT6 NT103. Then NT6 is t108, so that matches the first token.\n\nMoving to the next tokens: after t108 comes t101. So the next non-terminal after NT99 would be NT89, which produces NT81 and NT89? Wait, no, let's clarify.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the first non-terminal is NT99, the second is NT89. So the first part of the string is NT99, which becomes t108, as we saw.\n\nNow, after t108 (from NT99), the next token is t101. So the NT89 must produce t101. Let's check NT89's production.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT89 -> NT61 NT76. So NT89 \u2192 NT61, NT76. Now, NT61 and NT76 must produce t101 and something else.\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61 \u2192 t169 (from NT61 -> t169). Wait, no: checking the rules, NT61 appears in other productions like NT73 \u2192 NT61 NT71. Wait, perhaps I should list all the rules leading to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's start over.\n\nThe string starts with t108. From NT99, which is NT6 NT103. NT6 is t108, and NT103 is t24 (since NT103 -> NT24). So NT99 => t108 t24. But in the string, after t108 comes t101, not t24. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So NT99 produces t108, and NT89 must produce the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the entire string is the combination of NT99 and NT89. So NT99 produces t108, and NT89 must produce the rest of the tokens, right?\n\nBut wait, after t108, the next token is t101, which would be from NT89's expansion. Let me check NT89.\n\nNT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So, after t108, the production from NT99 is NT61 NT76. So, the first token is t108 (from NT99), and then NT61 and NT76 must produce t101 and something else.\n\nLooking at NT61: NT61 \u2192 t169. But the next token is t101, not t169. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps NT89 is expanding differently. Wait, NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76 \u2192 t169 and something else? Hmm, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that each non-terminal directly produces a terminal based on its rules. So, for example, any non-terminal that can produce 't108' will be replaced by that terminal.\n\nLooking at NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 \u2192 t108, NT103 \u2192 t24. So NT99 directly produces t108 t24. But in the string, after t108 comes t101, so that doesn't fit. Therefore, this suggests that maybe the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the rule. Maybe the NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 is split into NT6 and NT103, which each must be expanded further.\n\nWait, no: In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this grammar, for example, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, which is of the form BC, so it must be expanded further until the terminals are reached. So to produce t108, NT6 must expand to t108, but then NT103 would have to produce nothing else, but according to the rules, NT103 is NT24, which would then produce t24.\n\nSo NT99 would expand as follows: NT6 \u2192 t108, NT103 \u2192 t24. Therefore, the production NT99 would become t108 t24.\n\nBut in the string, after t10"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But in context-free grammars, recursive productions can lead to infinite loops unless properly handled.\n\nSimilarly, NT68 has two productions: NT68 -> NT45 NT71 and NT28 NT12. Let's see:\n\nNT68 can produce t45 t72 (if NT45 and NT72 produce specific tokens) or t28 t12. Looking back, NT28 -> 't76' and NT12 -> 't80', so the second option for NT68 would be t76 t80.\n\nBut in our string, after t165 t98, we have t71, which would correspond to NT71. So let's see:\n\nT165 corresponds to NT165? Wait, looking through the grammar, most non-terminals are three-letter abbreviations like NTXX. Checking NT165, but in the grammar provided, I don't see NT165. Instead, I see NT68 and NT89 as the ones with 't'17 tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a tree. The initial string is:\n\nt91 t101 t165 t98 t48 t0 t13 t146 t144 t2 t13 t65 t72 t156 t91 t101 t94 t71 t123 t98 t2 t174 t71 t158 t98 t105 t98 t94 t69 t69 t94 t24.\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\n1. S -> NT99 NT89 \u2192 t91 t101 (assuming NT99->t91 and NT89->t101)\n\n2. Next part: t165 t98\n\nLooking into the grammar, the non-terminals that produce 't165':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT29 -> t156 and t156, but that's two different productions for NT29 leading to 't156' and sometimes other tokens. Wait, no, actually:\n\nLooking at NT29, the two options are NT29 -> 't156' and NT29 -> 't129'. But our string after t165 is t98. So, perhaps looking for a production that can produce t165 and t98.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT107 -> 't94' and also NT107 -> something else. No. Alternatively, is there any non-terminal that produces t98? \n\nLooking at the productions, NT65 -> t157, NT65 -> t8, NT75 -> t98, so NT75 can produce t98. Similarly, NT68 -> t24 when it's the second production.\n\nWait, perhaps the next step after t91 t101 is t165 t98.\n\nSo, looking at the next part: t165 t98 must come from a non-terminal NT followed by another. Let's see if there's an NT that expands to these two tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT165 isn't present. Perhaps it's a combination. Wait, I'm looking for NT165 but that's not in the grammar; maybe NT65. NT65 can produce t157 and sometimes t8. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT91 can produce t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-603","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's given in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, it seems that S eventually leads to a series of non-terminals that break down into more non-terminals until some point where terminals start appearing.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S produces two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: `t108 t101 t139 t130 t2 t0 t162 t76 t11 t115 t100 t94 t0 t174 t121 t157 t76 t13 t146 t21 t123 t98 t0 t108 t101 t104 t2 t94 t94 t50 t69 t174 t24`.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string from the end, working backwards to see if it can be generated by the grammar. This is similar to the CYK algorithm, but maybe since it's CNF, there's a better way.\n\nAnother idea is to see if each token in the string can be matched by the productions. Since the grammar is large, it might be tedious, but let me check if I can find a path.\n\nI notice that several productions end with terminals directly. For instance, NT9 \u2192 't134', NT16 \u2192 't93', NT29 \u2192 't129', etc. So, some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it down into tokens and see if they can be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe last token is `t24`. Looking at the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 't123'. So, `t24` could be produced by NT24.\n\nBefore that: `t94`. Hmm, let's see. There's a production NT94 \u2192 't93', but that's not `t94`. Wait, maybe another path. Let me check other productions. NT94 also appears in NT95 \u2192 't130'. Wait, no. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, I see NT94 in other places, but not directly producing `t94`. Maybe I need to see if it's possible through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the entire string step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I reach the string.\n\nGiven the string's length is 39 tokens, and the grammar is quite extensive, it's a bit daunting, but let's try a simplified approach.\n\nI can consider that each production starts with S breaking down into NT99 and NT89. So, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Then, each of these non-terminals can be expanded into other non-terminals until I reach terminals.\n\nBut given the number of steps, it's better to approach this systematically. Perhaps I can model this as a tree, starting from S and seeing which non-terminals can end in the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be a concatenation of the rightmost expansions. So, maybe the string is built from the leaves up.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me see if I can find one token that might break my chain.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is `t108`. Let's see which non-terminal can produce `t108`.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT108 \u2192 't118' in one case, and a production for NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and so on. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces `t108`.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see a production NT108 \u2192 't118', but no production for NT108 directly producing `t108`. Hmmm. Alternatively, perhaps through another path.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the productions that end with a specific terminal. Let's check if `t108` can be produced by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT100 \u2192 't127', 't96', 't157'\n- NT108 \u2192 't118', 't108' via NT108 produced by NT64 \u2192 't24' and others? Wait, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, in the given production list, I see:\n\nNT100 \u2192 NT64 NT108 is one option, but in another production, NT100 appears as NT108 \u2192 't118'. Wait, perhaps I misread that. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, and I need to parse them carefully.\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT35 \u2192 multiple terminals like 't103', 't68', etc.\n- NT108 \u2192 't118'? Hmm, not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for non-terminals that can produce `t108` as their expansion. Maybe through some chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps `t108` is produced by NT64 \u2192 't24', but that doesn't directly give `t108`.\n\nWait, another possibility is that `t108` is produced by NT108 \u2192 't118', but that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with `t108`, which would have to come from a non-terminal that can produce `t108`. But looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces `t108`. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal expansion is via concatenation of smaller steps. For example, if a non-terminal A produces B C, and B can produce t108, but that's unlikely since we're looking for a single terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first `t108` is from a non-terminal that's further down the chain. Maybe not. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several non-terminals being expanded, and I need to see if the string is a possible derivation path.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach it in terms of the grammar's structure. The top symbol is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Each of these can be expanded further until I reach a terminal string.\n\nBut with a string of 39 tokens, it's challenging to do manually. Maybe there's a pattern or common sub-strings.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string must be a power of 2 minus 1 for the derivation, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string must be built from the bottom up, expanding non-terminals into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is correctly formed if it can be derived by choosing the correct non-terminals at each step.\n\nWait, given the complexity, perhaps it's better to try to see if there's any non-terminal that can produce the first token `t108`.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT108 \u2192 't118'. So `t118` is an option for NT108. But the string starts with `t108`, not `t118`. Therefore, perhaps there's a way to reach `t108` via a chain of productions.\n\nWait, let's see the production for S: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So NT99 and NT89 are part of the derivation. Then, each NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals that can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT7 NT103. So NT99 breaks down into NT7 and NT103.\n\nNT7: NT7 \u2192 't151' according to the productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's a line: NT7 \u2192 't151'. So, `t151` is produced by NT7.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is `t108`, which doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I got something wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-608","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe problem is to determine if the string provided is generated by this grammar. The string is: t108 t101 t158 t98 t21 t158 t98 t171 t134 t162 t76 t11 t97 t146 t144 t0 t162 t104 t158 t98 t8 t98 t0 t91 t101 t50 t98 t94 t63 t165 t69 t94 t24.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that terminals are strings like 't108', 't101', etc. Each production eventually leads to a terminal. So the approach is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI remember that in CNF, for a string to be generated, its length must be a power of 2. Wait, is that correct? Or is that when using a specific method. Let me think. Actually, in CNF, the left-hand side of each production is a single non-terminal, and each production can generate two symbols. So the number of steps needed to reach the string's length would relate to the depth. So the total string length should be a sum of powers of two or something?\n\nWait, no. Maybe it's more about the parse tree. Each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two, so the number of leaves in the parse tree (the string length) is equal to 2^k, where k is the number of productions applied in the derivation. So for the string length to be possible, it should be 2^k for some k. \n\nLet me check the length of the given string. I'll count the number of tokens: \n\nLet's list them: t108, t101, t158, t98, t21, t158, t98, t171, t134, t162, t76, t11, t97, t146, t144, t0, t162, t104, t158, t98, t8, t98, t0, t91, t101, t50, t98, t94, t63, t165, t69, t94, t24. That's 37 tokens. \n\n37 is not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 37 is between them. But does that automatically mean it's not possible? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in CNF, the number of symbols in the string at each step doubles. Starting from the initial symbol S, each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by multiplying by two. Or is it additive? No, because each production replaces a single symbol with two symbols, so the length doubles each time. Wait, that can't be right because each step would have to be applied to all non-terminals in parallel.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the derivation. Each production application replaces one non-terminal with two, increasing the total number of symbols by one each time. But that would mean the length increases by one each step, making it possible for any length. Hmm, I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. In CNF, each production is applied to a single non-terminal, replacing it with two symbols. This can be done in any order, but each application increases the count by one. For example, starting with S, applying S->AB would give AB, which is length 2. Then, applying A->CD gives CDB, which is length 3. Or applying B->EF gives CEFD, which is length 4. So the length can vary, not necessarily doubling each time. So the initial idea that the length must be a power of two is incorrect.\n\nSo, the length being 37 isn't ruled out. Then, why do I think it's not possible? Maybe because the string has certain terminals that don't match the grammar's production rules. Let's check the start symbol and see if it can generate such a string.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nThe top-level production is S -> NT99 NT99. So S produces two instances of NT99. Each NT99 must be a string that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT99: Wait, does any of the productions start with NT99? Looking through the rules, I see productions like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, etc., but there's no production starting with NT99. That's a problem. Because S starts with NT99, which must produce something. But if there's no production for NT99, then NT99 cannot be replaced further, so each NT99 in S would be a terminal. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see a production for NT99. So NT99 is a non-terminal that doesn't have any production rules. That would mean that S cannot be expanded further, because S -> NT99 NT99 would become two terminals, which are not replaced by anything. But in the string, after S, we have t108 and t101, which are followed by t158, t98, etc. So S would have to expand into more non-terminals. But if NT99 doesn't have any productions, that can't happen. So perhaps that's why the string is impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Maybe some of these non-terminals can derive into terminals. Let me see if any of the rules have NT99 on the right-hand side. \n\nLooking again: The productions starting with NT...:\n\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\n\nNT84 -> NT1 NT65\n\nNT73 -> NT83 NT70\n\nNT40 -> NT39 NT35\n\nNT52 -> NT28 NT70\n\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\n\nNT73 -> NT6 NT39\n\nNT64 -> NT100 NT93\n\nNT80 -> NT67 NT73\n\nNT35 -> NT68 NT103\n\nNT68 -> NT45 NT71\n\nNT106 -> NT35 NT107\n\nNT44 -> NT24 NT88\n\nNT96 -> NT33 NT36\n\nNT12 -> NT91 NT69\n\nNT40 -> NT33 NT64\n\nNT93 -> NT15 NT77\n\nNT96 -> NT1 NT108\n\nNT77 -> NT95 NT65\n\nNT23 -> NT40 NT107\n\nNT17 -> 't24'\n\nAh, I see that NT17 can produce 't24'. Similarly, NT16 is 't54', etc. So maybe NT99 can somehow reach a terminal or non-terminal that can derive into a terminal.\n\nBut looking through, I don't see NT99 being produced by any other rule. So NT99 is a symbol that cannot be replaced further, so in the string, each S would produce two copies of NT99, which would be two terminals that can't be expanded. So that means the string starting with S must have exactly two terminals. But in the given string, after S comes more symbols, so that would be problematic because S must directly produce two NT99's, which would have to be terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe NT99 can somehow produce a terminal through a series of productions. Let me see. For example, if there's a chain of productions where NT99 can derive into a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's see if any rules can lead to a terminal:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal A such that A -> a, where a is a terminal. For example, NT17 -> 't24', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 -> 't54', etc. \n\nBut for NT99, is there any rule where NT99 is on the left? I don't see any. So NT99 is a non-terminal with no production, meaning it can't derive any terminal. Therefore, S->NT99 NT99 would produce two non-terminals, each of which can't be replaced, so the entire string generated by S would have exactly two symbols. \n\nBut the given string has 37 symbols, which is much more than 2.

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a collection of productions starting from S. Each production is in the form of A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals or strings of terminal symbols. Some of the non-terminals have multiple productions, like S, NT15, NT81, and others. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t91 t101 t158 t98 t171 t41 t11 t71 t146 t23 t51 t170 t165 t98 t0 t174 t72 t23 t127 t170 t65 t94 t50 t98 t2 t162 t94 t71 t108 t101 t69 t141 t94 t22`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), it's a good candidate for a parser, and the string seems to be a sequence of terminal symbols. In CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or one non-terminal on the right-hand side. Wait, actually, no\u2014CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a single non-terminal. Each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, however, some productions like NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 have two non-terminals, which seems okay for CNF. But wait, the first production is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which has two non-terminals. So all productions are in the correct form for CNF.\n\nNow, I need to find a leftmost derivation of the string from S. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string using the grammar. But the string is quite long, so that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can reverse the process: start from S and apply the productions to generate the string, seeing if it matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the symbols in the string and see if they can be produced by the grammar. Each 't' symbol followed by a number is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals or the start symbol S. Wait, no: in the grammar, some symbols like 't91', 't101', etc., are terminals because they are followed by an 's' in the string.\n\nWait, looking again: in the grammar, some symbols like NT96 are non-terminals, and then in the productions, certain symbols are replaced by 't' followed by a number. So for example, in the grammar, NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, but in the string, I see 't107' and other 't's. So the 't's are terminal symbols, and the grammar produces sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nIn the string, for example, 't91' is a terminal, as it ends with an 's' in the string. So I need to see if the productions can generate this string.\n\nBut parsing such a long string is complex. Another approach is to note that in CNF, every terminal in the string must come from a production in the grammar. So I can check each 't' symbol in the string to see if the grammar contains the corresponding production.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar again. Some productions are like NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65. Other productions replace non-terminals with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64, and in other cases, non-terminals are replaced by 't' symbols. So for example, in the grammar, NT96 \u2192 NT105 NT71, but also NT19 \u2192 't99'. Wait, no: the NT19 production is actually in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, some productions are:\n\nNT19 -> NT74 NT46\nNT2 -> 't26'\nNT77 -> 't56'\nNT23 -> 't156'\nNT69 -> 't1'\nNT100 -> 't127'\nNT108 -> 't118'\nNT65 -> 't157'\nNT46 -> 't99'\nNT39 -> 't48'\nNT96 -> 't91'\nNT19 -> 't99'\nNT84 -> 't17'\nNT73 -> 't73'\nNT68 -> 't110'\nNT31 -> 't121'\nNT49 -> 't97'\nNT96 -> 't91'\nNT19 -> 't99'\nNT23 -> 't171'\nNT57 -> 't172'\nNT77 -> 't124'\nNT49 -> 't115'\nNT84 -> 't102'\nNT9 -> 't169'\nNT19 -> 't97'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT64 -> 't24'\nNT17 -> 't22'\nNT88 -> 't141'\nNT9 -> 't49'\nNT76 -> 't45'\nNT95 -> 't130'\nNT74 -> 't146'\nNT16 -> 't112'\nNT36 -> 't47'\nNT52 -> 't104'\nNT16 -> 't54'\nNT102 -> 't13'\nCT? Wait, no, all are 't' symbols.\n\nWait, from the grammar, some non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-627","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is pretty long, and the grammar has a lot of production rules, so I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the rules, it seems that many symbols (NT15, NT89, etc.) eventually produce terminal symbols of the form 't' followed by some number. For example, NT1 -> NT107 NT17, and both NT107 and NT17 produce 't' with some number. So, most of the grammar's rules lead to terminal symbols labeled 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t108 t101 t101 t0 t158 t130 t130 t2 t76 t13 t65 t72 t171 t108 t101 t0 t157 t98 t165 t130 t94 t2 t105 t98 t0 t8 t69 t65 t22`.\n\nLet me first note that all the components in the string are 't' followed by a number, which aligns with the production rules. So, every non-terminal in the grammar eventually expands into such a 't' symbol.\n\nNext, the string starts with 't108', which must come from some non-terminal that produces this. Let me check which NT rule generates 't108'. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT108: It doesn't exist. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT76 -> 't121', NT77 -> 't56', NT67 -> 't67' (so no t), NT66 is not a rule. Hmm, looking for NT that produces 't108':\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT108: \n- Checking the rules, NT108 isn't directly listed, but the rules have NT93 -> 't56', NT87 -> 't...', but I don't see any NT directly producing 't108'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the rules provided go up to NT108, so looking specifically:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT108: Do any of the NT rules produce 't108'? Let's see:\n\n- NT108 isn't directly a non-terminal, but looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, the only 't' symbols are for numbers up to 172. Wait, in the rules, I see NT108 as the output when NT107 is derived, but actually, NT107 is a non-terminal that expands into others.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me instead approach this by starting from the given string and trying to see if each 'tN' can be mapped back to a production rule.\n\nThe first token is 't108'. Looking at the rules, I need to find which NT, when expanded, would produce 't108'. Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the only one that directly produces a 't...' with 108 is NT108: no, wait, in the given rules, I don't see NT108 -> 't108'. Wait, perhaps it's generated through a chain. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at NT93: NT93 -> 't56', and that doesn't help. What about NT107: NT107 is a non-terminal. Let me see the rules for NT107:\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT107 ->... Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT107: I don't see an explicit production for NT107. Wait, looking at the rules again, I see some lines:\n\nWait, in the rules, there's \"NT107 -> '...\" but actually, the rules list NT107 in an expansion, but looking again, I think NT107 is a terminal here, which can't be because NT is a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking more carefully, in the rules, the production is:\n\nNT107 -> '...'? Wait, no, in the rules, the left-hand side (LHS) is always an NT (e.g., S, NT15, etc.), and the right-hand side (RHS) is a sequence of non-terminals or terminal 't's. Wait, in the given rules, the RHS is made up of other NTs or these 't..'.\n\nWait, for example, NT107's production isn't explicitly given, but looking at NT76 -> 't121', which means that NT76 can produce 't121'. So, each non-terminal on the LHS can expand into multiple symbols, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, to get 't108', I need to find a path where a non-terminal eventually expands into 't108'.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps NT26: The rules include NT26 -> 't23', so that's 't23', not 't108'. Wait, what about NT46: NT46 -> 't99'. Hmm, not 108.\n\nWait, looking for a non-terminal that can derive 't108'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, the only 't' symbols are associated with specific numbers. For 't108', which NT produces it?\n\nLooking through the rules, I think NT19 might produce t99 (NT19 -> 't99'), and NT33: No, looking for 't108'.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the productions to see if any expansion leads to 't108'. For example, NT107 expands into something that eventually leads to 't108'. But looking through the rules, I don't see NT107 being defined as an NT that produces 't108'. Wait, perhaps I misread the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I see this line: NT61 -> NT106 NT71. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe NT107's expansion includes a 't108' somewhere, but I don't see it in the rules provided.\n\nWait, another approach: I can try to derive each symbol in reverse. Starting from the string, check if each 'tN' can be matched to a production.\n\nLet me try to parse from the start.\n\nThe string is: t108 t101 t101 t0 t158 t130 t130 t2 t76 t13 t65 t72 t171 t108 t101 t0 t157 t98 t165 t130 t94 t2 t105 t98 t0 t8 t69 t65 t22\n\nFirst, 't108': need to find which NT can produce 't108'. Looking at the rules, the only 't108's are likely from NT107 or NT106 or others. Wait, looking for NT-> 't108'. From the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules provided, for example, NT106 -> NT35 NT107. Hmm, not helpful directly. Wait, NT35 -> 't43' or something? Or maybe NT106 -> 't127' (from NT108? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Each 'tN' must come from a production that can derive it. For example, 't108' must be produced by some non-terminal that has a production including 't108' in one of its expansions.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't108'. Hmm, that's concerning. Maybe the production is not direct and comes through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe NT107 produces 't108' indirectly. For example, if NT107 -> ... and during expansion, one of the symbols is a NT that eventually produces 't108'.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe 't108' comes from a production that includes 't108', but I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule for 't108' isn't in the given options, meaning the string might not be valid. But then, maybe I missed it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't generated by this grammar because 't108' can't be derived. But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the production rules again, I see:\n\nNT69 -> 't1' (from the rule NT69 -> 't1'), but that's 't1', not 108.\n\nWait, I don't see any rules that produce 't108' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-644","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given grammar generates the string `t108 t101 t165 t130 t67 t91 t21 t94 t112 t156 t24 t174 t112 t67 t167 t171 t24 t123 t98 t65 t93 t156 t112 t94 t165 t98 t8 t98 t123 t98 t0 t105 t69 t65 t22`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, they all seem to be two symbols on the left and two on the right, except some might have one terminal and one non-terminal. But in CNF, it's usually two symbols on both sides.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT99 and NT89. Each of these NT symbols can be broken down further into combinations of other NTs and terminals. For example, NT99 might go to NT6 and NT103, which then break down into more NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of ts like t108, t101, etc. I notice that many of these are repeated or connect in a way that might follow the grammar. For instance, t108 appears a couple of times, and t101 is followed by 165, which is a common sequence elsewhere.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string step by step. Each step should follow the productions until we reach the string at the bottom.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. NT99 looks like it could be NT6 and NT103, while NT89 might be NT7 and NT67. Wait, checking the production rules:\n\nNT99: NT6 and NT103 \u2192 So, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6 is a terminal that goes to t108. Then NT103 is a rule that ends up as t101. So NT99 could produce t108 t101.\n\nLooking back at the string, it starts with t108 t101. That's promising. \n\nNow, the second part is NT89 \u2192 NT7 and NT67. Wait, checking the rules: NT7 is 't151' and NT67 is 't67'. But in the string, after t101, the next is t165, which doesn't match. Hmm, that might be a problem. Did I get the production for NT89 wrong?\n\nWait, looking more carefully, NT89 might actually be NT73 and NT76. NT73 \u2192 t167, and NT76 \u2192 t121. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps I misread the production.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70, but perhaps I should follow the steps more carefully. Let me see the production for NT89: looking at the rules, I see NT89: NT76 and NT75? Or wait, perhaps I misread. Looking through the rules, let's check all the NT transitions.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see for example:\n- NT17 \u2192 t24 (so NT17 is a terminal)\n- NT7 \u2192 t151\n- NT39 \u2192 t144\n- NT89 \u2192 t60\n\nWait, that must mean that NT89 might be a production that includes a terminal. Wait, but in the given rules, let me search for where 't' starts.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, some NTs directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 t24. Others terminate with t followed by numbers, like NT7 \u2192 t151, NT9 \u2192 t41, etc.\n\nSo perhaps NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, where NT6 is t108 and NT103 is t101. So that gives t108 t101. Then the second part is NT89. Let's check the rule for NT89: It might be a direct terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT89 \u2192 t60. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89 could become t108 t101 t60. But wait, the string starts with t108 t101 t165... So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the production again. Oh, wait, perhaps NT89 can be expanded into NT7 and NT67, and then those can expand further. For example, NT7 \u2192 t151, NT67 \u2192 t67. But t151 and t67 don't appear in the string.\n\nAlternatively, NT89 might have a rule like NT73 NT76. NT73 \u2192 t167 and NT76 \u2192 t121. So that would give t167 t121. But that doesn't match the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for where the string starts with t108, which is the result of NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, so t108 t101. Then the next part is t165.\n\nSo after t108 t101, the next is t165. Let's see what t165 is. Looking at the rules, I see NT171 \u2192 t24, but that's for NT171.\n\nWait, maybe the second part of S is NT89, which might have a rule that starts with NT165... Or perhaps I should check what NT89 can generate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of another production. For example, perhaps S\u2192NT99 NT89, and NT99 is t108 t101, and NT89 might be NT73 NT68. NT73 \u2192 t167 and NT68 might have a rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT68 can be NT45 and NT71. NT45 \u2192 t98 and NT71 \u2192 t1. So that would make it t98 t1. But that doesn't fit the string.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT67: in the rules, NT67's production is NT67 \u2192 NT167 NT71. NT167 \u2192 t124 and NT71 \u2192 t1. So that would be t124 t1. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to consider other productions. Alternatively, maybe the string is derived through a different production.\n\nAnother approach: The string starts with t108 t101, which could be from S \u2192 NT99 NT89, with NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (t108 t101) and NT89 \u2192 something. If NT89 can be a terminal or more expansions, perhaps there's a way to continue.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps NT89 \u2192 t60. So then S \u2192 t108 t101 t60, but the string is longer, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production for S is different. Wait, perhaps S can split into NT99 and NT89, which then have their own expansions. But perhaps I need to look for whether the given string is a concatenation of a series of rule applications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to use a parsing approach, starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the grammar rules. This can take a lot of time, but let's try a few steps.\n\nStarting with the string: t108 t101 t165 t130 t67 t91 t21 t94 t112 t156 t24 t174 t112 t67 t167 t171 t24 t123 t98 t65 t93 t156 t112 t94 t165 t98 t8 t98 t123 t98 t0 t105 t69 t65 t22.\n\nFirst, t108: that comes from NT99. So NT99 \u2192 NT6 and NT103. Since NT6 is t108, and NT103 is t101, that matches the start.\n\nSo now, after t108 t101, we have the rest: t165 t130 t67 t91 t21 t94 t112 t156 t24 t174 t112 t67 t167 t171 t24 t123 t98"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-642","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to be in CNF because each production only has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal followed by non-terminals. Some have just terminals, like NT107 \u2192 t94, which makes sense.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terms like t108, t101, etc. Each of these terms must be derived from the grammar's terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, it should be possible to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But I'm not very familiar with CYK, so maybe I can approach it by breaking down the string step by step.\n\nLet me list out the string: t108 t101 t158 t130 t63 t156 t51 t90 t23 t96 t170 t165 t98 t151 t104 t108 t101 t50 t98 t65 t24 t118 t158 t98 t157 t98 t2 t94 t94 t67 t90 t139 t141 t94 t22.\n\nThat's 37 tokens. The grammar produces strings where each production is a combination of non-terminals leading to terminals and other non-terminals. Each non-terminal seems to eventually derive a specific terminal or a combination.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions, for example, S \u2192 NT99 NT99, which might expand to a sequence of terminals. Each NT rule expands into other NT rules or terminals. So, each NT leads to more until only terminals remain.\n\nTo determine if the string can be generated, I might need to track how each part of the string is built up from the grammar. Since it's a bit time-consuming, maybe I can look for specific terminals in the grammar to see their productions.\n\nStarting from the first token, t108. Scanning through the NTs, I see NT107 \u2192 t94. But I'm looking for t108. Wait, are there any NTs that directly produce t108? Looking through the list, I see NT106 \u2192 t105, and NT105 \u2192 t101. Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, NT108 exists? Wait, actually, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t108 except maybe a combination of non-terminals. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the grammar has terminal rules in the middle. Let me check again for t108. Looking at the grammar, I see NT106 \u2192 t105, which is one of the rules. But wait, NT105 \u2192 t101. So maybe t108 is derived from another NT that has multiple production steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree or at least try to see how the first few symbols can be derived. Let's take the first three tokens: t108, t101, t158.\n\nLooking for where t108 can appear. Let me see the NTs:\n\n- NT108 is a non-terminal, and looking at the productions, I see NT108 is mentioned a few times. For example, NT108 is part of the production NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, and NT35 might produce certain terms. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for t108 directly, perhaps it's a terminal that's derived from a certain NT. Wait, I see that NT106 can produce t105, and NT107 can produce t94. Not t108.\n\nHmm, maybe t108 is a combination of two non-terminals. For example, looking back, the production NT108 could be part of a larger chain. Maybe it's an intermediate non-terminal that leads to t108.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for patterns in the string and see if any production rule can create such a sequence.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe parse the string into segments that correspond to the grammar's non-terminals. For example, each part of the string should correspond to the right-hand side of a production.\n\nLet me try to identify possible NT sequences:\n\nThe string starts with t108 t101 t158 t130...\n\nLooking for a possible NT that can produce t108... Let me check if any production leads to t108 directly or through a chain.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any rule that directly produces t108 except perhaps through a combination of rules. For example, maybe t108 is produced by NT108, which might have a production like NT108 \u2192 NTx NTy, and then each of those NTs can produce more symbols.\n\nWait, but looking at the list, NT106 is involved in some of the productions, and NT107 is elsewhere. Let me try to find a way to combine NTs to get t108 as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each rule is in CNF. So, to derive a terminal string, all non-terminals have to expand into terminals until only terminals are left. Since the string given has mostly terminals, each part should be explicable by the grammar.\n\nMaybe I should pick a chunk of the string and see if it can be derived from a production.\n\nLet's take t108 t101 t158. Is there a production where three terminals come out together? Looking at the grammar, there are rules like S \u2192 NT99 NT99, but the individual NT rules produce one terminal at a time because the grammar is in CNF. Wait a minute\u2014the grammar is in CNF, so each production on the right-hand side is a single terminal or another non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal. But wait, in CNF, each production's RHS is two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Or both are non-terminals? Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. Terms on the right must be two non-terminals, each of which can be a terminal or a non-terminal, but each production must have exactly two on the RHS.\n\nWait, actually, in standard CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, each rule in the grammar must have two non-terminals on the right side. Wait, the given grammar seems to have more than just that. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57, which is two non-terminals. However, looking at other rules, like NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT103, which is also two non-terminals. Wait, but I notice that some rules have a terminal on the right. Like, some of the entries seem to have 't' followed by numbers, such as NT106 \u2192 t105.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the grammar is in CNF, each RHS of a production should have either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but not just a terminal and non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, wait\u2014no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. So, for example, A \u2192 a B, where a is a terminal, and B is a non-terminal. Wait, but I think in CNF, the right-hand side cannot have a mix of terminals and non-terminals except for the case where a production is A \u2192 a, which is allowed if a is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps the given grammar is not strictly in CNF because some rules have a combination of non-terminals and terminals. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the grammar. But in any case, given the grammar provided, it's more of a mix.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, all the productions seem to have two non-terminals on the RHS. For example, NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17, which is two non-terminals. NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT94, again two non-terminals. However, some entries have 't' before a number, like NT106 \u2192 t105. Hmm, that might be a terminal followed by a non-terminal, but that would not fit into CNF because in CNF, all RHS must be non-terminals. So perhaps the given grammar is not in CNF but only mostly, or maybe the user mistakenly included 't' as terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't' are terminals, and the 'NT' are non-terminals. So, for example, NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17, as before, but some other productions have a terminal followed by a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-666","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Both the grammar and the string are quite complex, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that context-free grammars are parsed using methods like recursive descent or the Cocke-Younger- Kasami (CYK) algorithm. However, given the grammar's structure and the string, maybe I can try to break the string down using the rules provided.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the string: `t108 t101 t139 t130 t2 t65 t72 t67 t98 t159 t26 t21 t139 t130 t0 t65 t71 t2 t8 t98 t65 t34 t71 t100 t110 t101 t2 t21 t65 t24 t174 t0 t105 t141 t94 t24`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the first production: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. Each NT is a non-terminal, so each must expand into the string.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45\nNT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\nNT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75\nNT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18\nNT95 \u2192 NT130 NT52\nNT130 \u2192 NT144 NT36\nNT144 \u2192 NT48 NT31\nNT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\nNT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the t tokens in the string to see if the corresponding non-terminals expand into those.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108. Let's see what production could lead to t108.\n\nLooking in the grammar, many non-terminals have rules that end with a specific t. For example:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71, but NT71 \u2192 NT80 NT42, NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73, and so on. This might be a long chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a quicker way. Let's check each token in the string and see if I can find their sources.\n\nFor example, t108 is present in multiple places:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\n- NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT45\n- NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\n- NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75\n- NT42 \u2192 NT145 NT99 (Wait, looking back, the grammar states NT42 \u2192 NT145 NT99)\n- NT145 \u2192 NT95 NT65\n- NT95 \u2192 NT130 NT52\n\nWait, but I also see NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49, and NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31.\n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAnother way is to build the parse tree starting from S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string must start with the expansion of NT99 and then NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108. Let's see what NT99 could expand to.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT99 is derived as:\n\nNT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\nNT6 \u2192 t108 (from NT6 \u2192 't108')\nNT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45\nLooking at NT24: NT24 \u2192 't123', but in the string, t123 isn't present. Wait, no, the string has t108, t101, etc., but maybe I need to look for specific t tokens.\n\nWait, looking again, NT6 is 't108' and NT103 leads to NT24 and NT45. Let's see where these go.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should consider that each production leads to specific t's. So for NT6 \u2192 't108', and NT103 needs to expand into something that can continue.\n\nLooking at NT103: NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45. Let's see what NT24 and NT45 expand to.\n\nNT24 \u2192 't123', but that's not in our string. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65, and NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me try to see if all the t's in the string correspond to the non-terminals correctly.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of t's, each corresponding to a specific production. Let me check each t in the string and see if they can come from the productions.\n\nFor example, the first t is t108. Looking at which NT can produce it. From the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't108'\nNT6 is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is NT6 expanding to t108. So that works.\n\nNext is t101. Let's see which NT would produce that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps NT101 has a production that includes t101.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly leading to t101 except via specific rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking for \"t101\" in the RHS of any production.\n\nI see NT101, but in the grammar, do any NT produce t101? Looking at the list:\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\n- NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT45\n- NT24 \u2192 't123' but wait in the string, 't24' is present.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the t's in the string and see which NTs they come from:\n\nt108 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 t108 (correct)\nt101 \u2192 which NT? Let's see if any NT's production includes t101.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT101: Not in the given productions except as a result of another NT. Looking further, perhaps NT101 is derived from NT89 and other NTs.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's try to break down the entire string step by step using the productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt108 t101 t139 t130 t2 t65 t72 t67 t98 t159 t26 t21 t139 t130 t0 t65 t71 t2 t8 t98 t65 t34 t71 t100 t110 t101 t2 t21 t65 t24 t174 t0 t105 t141 t94 t24\n\nLet me note that each 't' is a terminal, and each transition must follow the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, the first two tokens must expand from NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the first token, t108 from NT6. Does NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103? Yes, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, and NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nSo the first part is NT99 \u2192 t108 (NT6 \u2192 t108) and then NT103.\n\nLooking at NT103: NT103 \u2192 NT24 NT45.\n\nSo the next tokens after t108 should come from NT24 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, after t108 is t101, which doesn't seem to match NT24 or NT45. Hmm, maybe S is the start, so the first token is from NT99, which is t108. Then NT89 comes next.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again. The overall structure is S \u2192 NT99 NT89.

{"custom_id":"request-682","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite large with a bunch of production rules, so this could get a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that structure, as each rule starts with a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t108 t101 t158 t130 t48 t67 t167 t156 t51 t154 t158 t98 t167 t167 t51 t170 t123 t98 t0 t105 t98 t2 t157 t69 t174 t24`.\n\nHmm, the string is made up of a series of `t` words, each starting with `t` followed by a number. Looking at the grammar rules, many of these `t`-prefixed terms appear as direct productions. For instance, NT15 \u2192 t90, NT9 \u2192 t41, and so on. So each `t` term corresponds to a specific production.\n\nThe key here is the structure of the string. Each production can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string has to be generated exactly, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree needs to match the positions of `t` terms.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this systematically? Maybe I should start by constructing a parse tree that corresponds to the given string and check if it's valid according to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that match the productions. The string has 27 `t`-prefixed terms. In CNF, the number of non-terminals in the leftmost derivation should be one less than the number of productions. So a string with n `t`s would have a parse tree with n-1 productions.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't directly help. Maybe I should look for the rightmost possible productions. Alternatively, I can try to work backward, starting from the root and seeing if the string can be built up from the start symbol S.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing context-free grammars. However, implementing CYK for such a large grammar manually would be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable for this string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is a series of terminals, so each `t` must correspond to a terminal production.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, many `t`-prefixed items are terminals like NT15 \u2192 t90, so each `t` in the string must be matched by one of the rules where the right side is exactly that `t` term. For example, in the grammar, I see that NT15 can produce t90, NT9 can produce t41, NT7 can produce t151, etc.\n\nWait, no, the grammar seems to have both terminals and non-terminals on the left sides, but all the terminals start with 't' followed by a number. So each `t` in the string must match a specific production rule's right-hand side.\n\nSo, for each `tX` in the string, I need to check if there's a production A \u2192 tX, and in the parse tree, that `tX` would correspond to a leaf node. Also, the structure must be such that all the internal nodes (non-terminals) follow from the grammar.\n\nBut since the grammar is CNF, every production is either a non-terminal leading to two non-terminals or a terminal. So for a given string, the parsing must consist of a series of splits where each part is either a direct terminal or splits into two non-terminals.\n\nThis seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should try to parse step by step. Let's consider the structure of the string.\n\nThe string is: `t108 t101 t158 t130 t48 t67 t167 t156 t51 t154 t158 t98 t167 t167 t51 t170 t123 t98 t0 t105 t98 t2 t157 t69 t174 t24`\n\nThat's a long string. Let me count the number of `t` terms: 27. So according to Chomsky Normal Form, a string of length n would have a parse tree with n-1 internal nodes, which in this case would mean 26 productions leading up to the start symbol.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, the leftmost derivation of a string of length n has n-1 productions, each introducing a new non-terminal at the beginning or end. But the way the grammar is structured, perhaps each `tX` is directly connected to a single production. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to look for each `tX` and see if it can be derived from the start symbol by expanding the rules step by step. Alternatively, I can construct the parse tree by starting from the root and expanding.\n\nWait, the starting symbol is S, which has the production S \u2192 NT99 NT99. So the first step would be to split the string into two parts, each generated by NT99. Then each of those parts would split again, and so on.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this could take a while. Alternatively, perhaps each `tX` in the string corresponds directly to a specific non-terminal that can produce it in one production step. For example, if `t108` is derived directly from NT68, as per the grammar (looking at the rules, NT108 isn't directly present, but maybe it's part of NT68: NT68 \u2192 t45 NT71 or something\u2014checking the rules...)\n\nWait, let me check the grammar. Looking at the rules, for example, NT24 \u2192 t123? No, looking at the grammar, the NT107 has rules, but I don't immediately see any direct `tX` productions. Most seem to produce other non-terminals or terminals in the form of \"tXXX\".\n\nWait a second, I think all the productions except the terminals are of the form A \u2192 tX, with X varying. Or wait, no, looking at the grammar, many productions are A \u2192 tX like NT91 \u2192 t164, etc. So for example, some non-terminals directly produce these `tX` strings.\n\nBut wait, perhaps each `t` in the string is a result of the grammar's rules producing it. So, for instance, `t108` would have to be the direct production of some non-terminal NT, like NT108. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rules for NT108.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT68 has several rules, one of which is NT68 \u2192 t134. So if the string has `t134`, it can be generated by NT68. Similarly, NT90 has a rule NT90 \u2192 t15* something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each `tX` in the string corresponds to a production rule where the right-hand side is exactly `tX`. From the given grammar, for example, I see NT15 \u2192 t90, which suggests that if `t90` appears in the string, it must come from NT15.\n\nBut in our given string, I have `t167`, `t24`, `t98`, etc. So perhaps each of these corresponds to a specific non-terminal. For instance, t167 might come from NT167, but I need to check if such a rule exists in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t56\n- NT57 \u2192 t172\n- NT47 \u2192 t43\n- NT24 \u2192 t123\n- And so on.\n\nHmm, I don't see a rule that directly produces t167. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't think most `t` terms are directly generated. Most seem to produce a combination of non-terminals. Unless the `t` terms are derived through a chain of productions.\n\nSo for example, maybe `t167` is part of the right-hand side of a production, which then gets further split down.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for which `t` terms are leaves in the parse tree. In other words, which `t` terms correspond to direct productions (A \u2192 tX) in the grammar.\n\nFrom the list, let's go through the string and see which `tX` terms can be directly generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are some key `t` productions:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, they all fit into CNF because each rule has exactly two symbols on the RHS. For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. And sometimes it's a terminal, like NT7 \u2192 't24'.\n\nThe strategy to check if a string is generated by the grammar is to perform a kind of parsing, maybe using a stack-based approach. Alternatively, I can try to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with several t's, which are terminals. Since the grammar may have some terminals in the productions, I'll need to see if these t's match any production rules.\n\nLet me first list the terminals in the string and see if they match any rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several NT symbols that have been replaced with t followed by a number, which seems to be a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't24'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT28 \u2192 't76'\n- And so on.\n\nSo, the string has terms like t108, t101, t99, t67, etc., which are likely derived from the NT symbols on the RHS of the grammar rules.\n\nTo parse the string, I can start from the left and try to match the parts of the string with non-terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each part of the string must be generated by the terminals derived from the non-terminals in the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can reverse the string and keep folding the productions to match the reverse string. This might be more efficient because sometimes the string is longer, and starting from the beginning might be complicated.\n\nLet's reverse the string:\n\nOriginal: `t108 t101 t99 t67 t130 t0 t162 t76 t94 t65 t121 t97 t76 t13 t11 t157 t162 t76 t162 t91 t101 t104 t91 t101 t108 t101 t2 t159 t26 t13 t100 t2 t76 t162 t2 t158 t178`\nReversed: `t178 t158 t159 t26 t13 t100 t2 t76 t2 t162 t91 t101 t104 t91 t101 t108 t101 t76 t162 t162 t91 t94 t65 t121 t97 t76 t13 t11 t157 t162 t76 t162 t130 t0 t162 t99 t99 t101 t67 t130 t0 t162 t76 t94 t65 t121 t97 t76 t13 t11 t157 t162 t76 t162 t91 t101 t104 t91 t101 t108 t101 t2 t76 t2 t158 t159 t26 t13 t100 t2 t76 t162 t2 t158`. \n\nWait, maybe I should correct the reversing.

But maybe I should check if 't91' can be produced by any NT.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't99'? No. Let me go through each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be produced by a series of productions. For example, starting with S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string should start with 't99' and 't89' if they are terminals. Wait, looking at the string, the first two are 't91' and 't101'. Hmm, does S lead to 't91' and 't101'? That doesn't fit because S is NT99 and NT89. So maybe S is the start symbol, and the entire string is the result of two NT99 and NT89 productions?\n\nWait, no, S is a production of NT99 and NT89, so the string must be an interleaving of the strings from NT99 and NT89. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the production for S is S \u2192 NT1 NT99 NT99? Wait, no. Wait, the initial grammar is: S -> NT99 NT89. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So S \u2192 NT99 NT89, but NT99 and NT89 are further split into other non-terminals. So the string is built by expanding S into NT99 and NT89, then each of those into more non-terminals, until we reach terminals (the 't's).\n\nSo the entire string must be a combination of terminal symbols produced from expanding NT99 and NT89.\n\nNow, let's parse the string step by step. Starting from S, which is NT99 followed by NT89. So the entire string is the combination of two parts: one from NT99 and one from NT89.\n\nI'll split the string into two parts. The first is 't91 t101', 't165', 't130', 't67', 't98', 't159', 't26', 't162', 't48', 't145', 't101', 't174', 't127', 't98', 't172', 't94', 't91', 't165', 't98', 't151', 't76', 't162', 't91', 't101', 't69', 't98', 't2', 't21', 't123', 't98', 't174', 't67', 't167', 't139', 't69', 't174', 't24'. That's quite a long string.\n\nWait, maybe each 't' comes from a non-terminal that directly produces it. Let's check if each 't' in the string is a production defined in the grammar.\n\nFor example, NT16 \u2192 't93', NT29 \u2192 't36', NT29 \u2192 't156', etc. But looking at the string, 't91' is present. Is there any production rule where NT produces 't91'? Looking through the grammar rules... Hmm, I don't see any NT directly mapping to 't91'. Let me go through each NT and see.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't151' \u2192 so if NT7 can derive 't151', then 't151' could be present.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't91' as a direct result. Maybe I need to go deeper through the grammar to see if 't91' can be generated by any NT.\n\nLooking at the NT106 production: NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107. Then, NT35 can produce 't43' or 't52' or other things, but does any NT eventually lead to 't91'? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the grammar might produce all 't's as leaves, but the 't's in the string don't match any productions. Since I can't find any NT that directly maps to 't91' or other 't's in the string, this might mean that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the 't's in the string match any production. Let's list all the 't's:\n\nt91, t101, t165, t130, t67, t98, t159, t26, t162, t48, t145, t101, t174, t127, t98, t172, t94, t91, t165, t98, t151, t76, t162, t91, t101, t69, t98, t2, t21, t123, t98, t174, t67, t167, t139, t69, t174, t24.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example, NT77 \u2192 't56' (so t56 is produced). NT76 \u2192 't121'? Wait, NT57 \u2192 't172', NT52 \u2192 't171'. Hmm, I don't see any NT that produce these numbers. Wait, perhaps I should look for NTs that can produce these 't's.\n\nWait, looking at NT100 \u2192 't96' and NT100 \u2192 't127' (twice). So maybe 't127' comes from NT100, but in the string, there's 't127' once. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 \u2192 't1' or 't118' depending on the input. But again, the 't's don't match.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with 't91', so looking for NT that can derive 't91'. Looking through the NT rules, I don't see any production that directly ends with 't91'. However, some derive 't91' indirectly. For example, if an NT like NT77 \u2192 't56', but I don't see 't91' being produced by any NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again. Looking at NT9, it's not a terminal. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't151', and so on. I don't see any NT directly producing 't91', so it's impossible for 't91' to be in the string. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, I need to double-check. Maybe 't91' can be produced by some chain of NTs. For example, NT68 \u2192 't43'? Wait, no. Let me try to see if any NTs can derive 't91' through a series of productions. \n\nLooking at NT73: NT73 \u2192 't167' or 't73'. So 't73' comes from NT73, but 't167' doesn't match. However, in the string, there's 't16"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-709","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, and the grammar has a lot of production rules, so I'll need to approach this carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form have all productions either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and terminals. The given grammar seems to fit that form since all rules have two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t108 t101 t165 t130 t144 t0 t13 t100 t94 t0 t104 t158 t130 t2 t76 t13 t100 t0 t65 t72 t171 t2 t0 t8 t98 t2 t151 t100 t98 t67 t90 t158 t101 t2 t50 t69 t174 t22`.\n\nI notice that each token in the string seems to be a number that corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. The grammar has various non-terminals like S, NT15, NT89, etc., and several have productions that eventually lead to terminals starting with 't'.\n\nMy plan is to check if each production in the grammar can be expanded until we reach the given string. Since the string is made up of terminals (like t108, t101, etc.), I'll need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence.\n\nI'll start from the top-level non-terminal S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string must start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the first couple of tokens: t108 t101. I'll check the productions for NT99 and NT89.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n\nSo, the expansion would be (NT6 (NT103)) (NT44 (NT1)).\n\nWait, but in the string, it starts with t108 t101. Let me see which non-terminals lead to t108 and t101.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT96 \u2192 NT106 NT31, which includes t106 and t31, but I don't see t108 there.\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107 (t35 and t107)\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103 (t68 and t103)\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71 (t45 and t71)\n- NT45 \u2192 t2\n\nHmm, so NT68 \u2192 t134 (from the table, NT45 \u2192 t98, which was wrong earlier. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT45 is a terminal 't98', but in the given mappings, NT45 \u2192 't98' is not present. Wait, in the user's message, under NT45, it's written:\n\nNT45 -> t? Wait, looking back, the mappings are:\n\nLet me look through the given mappings for NT45, NT68, etc.\n\nFrom the user's message:\n\nNT45 -> NT106 NT31 (Wait, no, looking at the grammar lines, line by line:\n\n- NT48 -> NT106 NT31\n- NT96 -> NT33 NT36\n- NT12 -> NT91 NT69\n- NT40 -> NT33 NT64 (Wait, line 12: NT12 is another rule, not NT40.)\n\nWait, the grammar is a long list, so perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals and their productions, focusing on those that produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the expansion paths that lead to the t's given in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108, so I need to find a path where a non-terminal expands to t108. Let me scan the mappings to see which NTs end in t108.\n\nLooking at the mappings:\n\n- NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49 (t48 and t49;  t48 is mapped to 't23' perhaps? Wait, under NT48, it's mapped to 't11'? Wait, check:\n\nLine 104: NT48 -> t106, t31? No.\n\nWait, let's look through the mappings for any non-terminals that expand to t108.\n\nLooking at the user's mappings:\n\n- NT108 has a production to NT65 and NT71 (line 111: NT108 \u2192 NT65 NT71)\n- NT175: Not in the mappings provided. Wait, checking line by line:\n\nLooking for 't' terminals:\n\nFrom the mappings, here's where non-terminals expand to terminals:\n\n- NT48 -> 't11'\n- NT61 -> 't84' and 't71' (line 57: NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44, but look for where NT84 or NT44 go to t)\n- NT44 -> 't1' (line 19: NT44 \u2192 't1')\n- NT25: Not in the mappings provided. Wait, line 85: NT22 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me see specific lines:\n\nLooking down:\n\n- Line 70: NT106 \u2192 nt35 nt107\n- But looking for t108.\n\nWait, no, I'm looking for non-terminals that directly or indirectly lead to t108.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map NT108's productions:\n\nFrom the user's message, under NT108:\n\nLine 111: NT108 \u2192 NT65 NT71\n\nAre there any other NTs that expand to t108? Probably not, except via these.\n\nSo, for the string to start with t108, that non-terminal must be expanded from a production in the grammar. But in the initial step, S expands to NT99 and NT89. So, NT99 and NT89 should produce sequences that, when concatenated, result in the start of the string.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t108 t101. Let me see if NT99 can produce t108 after some expansion.\n\nLooking at NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103 (from line 14: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103; NT6 is another non-terminal)\n\nThen, NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT97 (line 152: NT17 \u2192 NT22, but wait NT6: looking back at the mappings.

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by looking at both the grammar and the string to understand what I need to do.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> t, where t is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is S. The grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89, which means S will produce two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of t's, which are terminal symbols.\n\nThe string is: t91 t101 t139 t130 t2 t134 t101 t174 t121 t115 t146 t94 t2 t76 t13 t146 t2 t162 t171 t49 t104 t108 t101 t171 t49 t91 t115 t100 t21 t123 t98 t2 t104 t0 t2 t105 t69 t174 t22.\n\nWow, that's a long string. I think each part corresponds to a production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals until we reach the terminals, which in this case are t followed by a number.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. I'll start from the beginning and see if I can match each production.\n\n1. The first part is t91. Looking at the grammar, I see NT91 -> 't169' (I think that's part of the production, but I need to check the rules again). Wait, no, the rules for NT91 aren't given directly, but looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT91 -> NT68 -> t134 (Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check specific rules.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT91 -> 't169' directly. Instead, looking at some rules, I see:\n\nNT76 -> 't178'\n\nNT65 -> 't105'\n\nNT65 -> 't8'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check for NT91 production. Looking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT91 -> 't164' (as per one rule: NT91 -> NT69 -> t133? Maybe I'm getting mixed up.)\n\nWait, no, looking for NT91 specifically, I see:\n\nNT91 -> NT69 (but I need to check the exact productions). Let me look through all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT91 -> 't164' is present, yes. So NT91 is a terminal. So t91 must come directly from NT91. So I can replace NT91 with t91.\n\nNext part: t101. Looking for NT101 rules. I don't see a production where NT101 -> something, so wait, maybe it's another terminal. How about looking for t101 in the rules? I see NT101 -> t104. Alternatively, maybe it's from another non-terminal. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT101 being defined except once: NT101 -> t104. So if I need to derive t101, that's not possible unless there's a production rule for NT101 -> t101. Since there isn't, that's a problem. Hmm, that suggests that the second symbol t101 can't be derived from any rule, meaning the string can't be generated by the grammar. But maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the rules. The provided rules are many, so perhaps I missed one where NT101 leads directly to t101. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT101: 'NT101 -> t104' (yes, that's rule 286: line 286 is NT101 -> t104). So no, there's no rule for NT101 -> t101. So t101 cannot be generated, meaning that the string can't be part of the language. That would imply 'No' as the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I'm not using the right approach. Maybe the string can be broken down in a different way. Let me try another route.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t91, which is possible as a terminal. Then t101 is the next symbol. But since there's no rule for NT101 producing t101, the string can't be generated. So that's the key point here.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the derivation. Starting from S, which produces two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can then produce two others, until we reach terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to ensure that every symbol in the string can be derived.\n\nSo t91 is derived from NT91, which is a terminal. t101: no production leads to t101. So the string is invalid, making the answer 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-726","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The CFG is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is quite long, consisting of a sequence of tokens like 't108', 't101', etc. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. That means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and can be analyzed using a method like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm just trying to determine if a string is generated by the grammar, maybe I can approach this by breaking down the string step by step, following the production rules.\n\nThe string given is: `t108 t101 t170 t67 t154 t26 t2 t76 t11 t157 t162 t76 t13 t146 t0 t104 t0 t108 t101 t94 t34 t71 t11 t97 t100 t21 t123 t98 t0 t162 t76 t13 t65 t71 t108 t101 t108 t101 t178`.\n\nEach of these tokens starts with 't', and the numbers vary. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string should be a series of terminals generated by applying the production rules, and each production step should align with the rules.\n\nI notice that the initial symbol of the grammar is S, which expands directly into NT99 NT89. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT99 NT89. This means the string should start with sequences that correspond to NT99 and NT89. Let's look at the string: the first token is t108, which is 't108'. I should check if there's a production rule that results in 't108' from either NT99 or NT89.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see that several NTs produce a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT77 \u2192 t124, and NT109 \u2192 t162 (but wait, looking back, I don't see NT109 in the rules. Hmm, the rules are all under NT, so maybe I need to check each NT to see which produce 't' tokens.\n\nFor instance, NT96 \u2192 t11, which would produce 't11'. NT67 \u2192 t67, which is a terminal, so NT67 directly produces 't67'. Similarly, NT69 \u2192 t1, but that's 't1', not 't67'.\n\nWait, I'm trying to find where 't108' could come from. Scanning through the rules, I see NT99 \u2192 t6, so 't6', not 't108'. NT108 is not listed as a terminal; instead, some NTs produce 't' followed by specific numbers. For example, NT24 \u2192 t123. So 't123' is produced by NT24. Similarly, NT108 is mentioned in a rule: NT48 \u2192 t11, which is different.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t123\nNT89 \u2192 t0, but that's 't0', not 't108'.\nLooking for where 't108' is produced: let's check all the rules.\n\nIn the rules, I spot NT48 \u2192 t11, so 't11'. But I also see NT107 \u2192 t94, which is 't94'. Not 108.\n\nLooking further, I see NT99 \u2192 t6, which is 't6'. NT64 \u2192 t24. Hmm, none of these produce 't108'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nThe rules are all listed under each NT. So, for example, NT24 is defined as t123. So NT24 \u2192 t123.\n\nBut looking for 't108', I see that in the given rules, there's NT108 \u2192 t178, but that's only if NT108 is a non-terminal, but in the rules provided, there's no definition for NT108 itself; it's only mentioned as a terminal. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT84 \u2192 t0\nNT88 \u2192 t141\nNT99 \u2192 t6\nNT93 \u2192 t56\nNT15 \u2192 t90\nNT71 \u2192 t69\nNT108 \u2192 t178\nWait, no, looking further: in the rules, I see \"NT108 -> t178\", but no NT108 definition. That might be a typo because in the list, NT108 is mentioned in NT108 \u2192 t178, but perhaps NT108 is not a non-terminal but a terminal. Or maybe it's a typo because NT108 doesn't appear as a left side of any production rule.\n\nWait, in the list of production rules, I don't see any line starting with NT108. So perhaps NT108 in the string is a terminal, which is allowed, but then the grammar would have a production that directly includes it, but since NT108 isn't a defined non-terminal, maybe it's a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps it's a non-terminal that directly expands to 't108', but since there's no production rule for NT108, that might be invalid.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, I see \"NT108 -> t178\". So that suggests that there's a production for NT108, which is not present in the list because the list doesn't have a line starting with NT108. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps NT108 is not a non-terminal and is just a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have a production for it. Hmm.\n\nSo, perhaps the production rules don't define NT108, which would mean that any occurrence of 't108' is not allowed if it requires NT108 to produce it, unless there's a rule, which there is: NT108 -> t178. But looking at the list, there's no line starting with NT108, so perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe that's correct, and the rules include a line I'm missing.\n\nWait, let's count the lines.

{"custom_id":"request-749","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. My task is to figure out whether the string `t91 t101 t165 t130 t2 t174 t72 t156 t0 t67 t108 t144 t156 t96 t90 t94 t65 t24 t118 t139 t130 t76 t80 t101 t0 t171 t169 t100 t0 t174 t72 t171 t0 t50 t98 t65 t69 t141 t65 t24` is generated by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recap what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This is important because it makes the parsing process more straightforward, especially with algorithms like CYK, but in this case, I'll approach it manually.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that the start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, S generates two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. This means the string starts with these two NTs. \n\nI'll begin by breaking down the string step by step to see if each part can be derived from these rules.\n\nThe string starts with t91. So, I need to see if t91 can be derived from S. But S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, each part of S is NT99 and NT89. Now, each of these can potentially produce t91 or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the right-hand side of the productions, I see that NT1 appears as a rule, and t24 is also present. But I'm looking for t91, so I need to see if any of the NTs can produce t91.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find NT91: NT91 \u2192 NT69 NT6. But that doesn't help directly. However, NT69 is another NT, so let's see NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT42 NT64 or NT75 NT71. Let's explore both.\n\nOption 1: NT69 \u2192 NT42 NT64\n\nNT42 may produce t139 or other terms. NT64 can produce t24 or others. Wait, t24 is a terminal, so if NT64 \u2192 t24, that could work. So, NT69 \u2192 NT42 t24. Then, NT42 \u2192 t139 or... Looking further, NT42 can also produce other things, but if it's capable of producing t139, then NT69 could become t139 t24, which doesn't help with t91.\n\nOption 2: NT69 \u2192 NT75 NT71\n\nNT75: I see NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18. NT95 is a non-terminal, as is NT18. NT18 \u2192 NT35 NT43, which are both non-terminals. Hmm, not helpful for t91.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's consider that each of the initial NT99 and NT89 can produce parts of the string. So, perhaps t91 is a terminal, so I need to find a path from either NT99 or NT89 to t91.\n\nLooking at NT99's productions: NT99 \u2192 NT99 NT17 (which is not a terminal, so likely a non-terminal path) or NT77 NT80. Let's see NT77 and NT80.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65. NT95 is a non-terminal, as is NT65. NT65 has multiple productions, one of which is NT65 \u2192 t157 or t157 being another NT. Wait, I see NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71, which are non-terminals. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should backtrack. Let me check if any of the NTs directly produce t91. Looking through the RHS of productions, I see NT28 is non-terminal, but t76 is a terminal. So perhaps NT91's productions don't directly produce t91, but let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only t91 I see is in the string. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see any production directly leading to t91. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking carefully, the NTs have rules like NT96 \u2192 NT106 NT31 or NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108, but not directly to t91.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each NT can produce a string of terminals, but I'm not seeing any rule that directly leads to t91. So, perhaps t91 cannot be generated by this grammar, meaning the string is not produced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t91 is generated through a chain of productions. For example, maybe NT91 \u2192 NT69 NT6, and NT69 \u2192 some t plus t, but I'm not sure. Let's see:\n\nWait, NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT42 NT64. Let's see NT42's rules: NT42 \u2192 NT139 (assuming t139 is a terminal), or NT42 \u2192 NT44 NT88, which would produce more NTs. This isn't leading me to t91. \n\nAlternatively, NT69 \u2192 NT75 NT71. NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18, which goes to t95 and t18, which are terminals. NT75 might produce a terminal string, but not t91.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first t is t91. So I need a production that includes t91. Let me re-examine the rules once more.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17, which is a chain leading to more NTs. I don't see any rule that ends with t91, which might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT91 is defined as NT69 NT6. So, the only way to get t91 is through a chain leading to NT91. But looking again, NT91 is always followed by NT6, so unless NT6 produces something that leads to t91, it might not be possible.\n\nWait, NT6: looking through the rules, I don't see anything about NT6 directly, but I see NT6 in several productions, like NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71, etc. Wait, is NT6 a terminal or a non-terminal? According to CNF, it's a non-terminal because it's on the left-hand side of a production, like NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65 or NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12.\n\nWait, looking again: NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65 and NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12\u2014so NT represents non-terminals, and the lowercase t's are terminals. Therefore, the first letter of the string is t91, which is a terminal. So, to generate this, one of the NTs must produce t91 directly. But looking through all the rules, the NTs don't seem to have a rule that leads to t91.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me look carefully. I see NT107 appearing many times, but not related to t91. Also, NT91's rule is NT91 \u2192 NT69 NT6, which doesn't involve t91.\n\nTherefore, since the grammar doesn't have any production that allows an NT to directly produce t91, it seems that t91 cannot be generated by this grammar. Hence, the string cannot be produced by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains `t91` at the beginning, but the grammar does not have any production rule that allows `t91` to be generated. All non-terminals lead to other non-terminals or terminals but none directly produce `t91`. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-746","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols like `t91 t101 t102 ...` and so on. The grammar is quite extensive with multiple production rules, and the string is long but seems manageable.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal symbol expands into exactly two non-terminal or terminal symbols. The standard form is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. That might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that it starts with S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the initial production is a combination of two non-terminals. The string begins with `t91`, which I need to trace back through the grammar.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is `t91`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT9 can produce 't26' (the 't' followed by a two-digit number). But I don't see an NT9 in the grammar. Wait, the given grammar only has NT15, NT89, etc., but I don't see an NT9. That's confusing because I thought NT9 was part of the options, but looking at the rules, I don't see an NT9 rule. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nScanning through the production rules, I don't see a rule for NT9. That's a problem because the string starts with `t91`, which I assume comes from a non-terminal that produces it. If there's no NT9 in the grammar, then the first step would have to be a different production, but since S starts with NT99, maybe the string starts with NT9 from another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The T9 in the grammar is a terminal symbol, like 't9'. So looking through the grammar, I find a rule for NT100 \u2192 't96', but that's not it. Wait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols prefixed with 't', like `t91`, `t101`, and so on. To solve this, I need to understand how the grammar works and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Hmm, I should double-check that. Oh right, in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So here, the start symbol is S, which produces NT99 and NT89. Each of these NT's (non-terminals) produces two other NT's until we reach a terminal symbol.\n\nBut looking at the productions, some of them are terminals with quotes, like 't24', which I assume are terminal symbols. So each production either splits into two NTs or a terminal. So the string given is a series of these 't' symbols, and I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to see if the string can be broken down into the productions. Let me note that the string is:\n\n`t91 t101 t165 t130 t144 t94 t158 t130 t63 t171 t93 t94 t174 t51 t90 t145 t101 t63 t21 t94 t47 t158 t130 t21 t123 t98 t2 t105 t98 t2 t157 t98 t2 t21 t123 t98 t94 t69 t141 t174 t24`\n\nThat's quite a long string. I'll try to look for patterns or possible splits that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string should start with t99 followed by t89. Let me check the first two elements of the string: `t91` and `t101`. Hmm, that's not t99 and t89. So maybe this string doesn't start with S's production. Alternatively, perhaps the string is derived from a different symbol.\n\nWait, but the first production for NT100 is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So let me check if the string can be broken down into that.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at each part of the string and see if they follow the productions. Let me take the string and see if it can be grouped into pairs of NTs that derive into t symbols.\n\nLet me start by looking for pairs that might form the t symbols.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t91. Looking for a production that ends in t91. Looking at the productions, NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18, which becomes 't23' (I think). Wait, but the productions for t symbols are like NTx being a terminal. Let me check each 't' symbol and see which NTs produce them.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that:\n- NT96 \u2192 't144' (Wait, looking at the productions, NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36. But there's a production NT96 \u2192 't118' in the list? Wait, let me check the provided productions.\n\nWait, the user provided the productions in a list format. I need to look for each 't' symbol and find which non-terminal produces it.\n\nFor example:\n- NT33 -> 't23' (I think that's NT33 \u2192 't23' somewhere, perhaps).\nWait, looking through the list provided, I see:\nNT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n...\nLooking for 't91' production: one of the productions is NT91 \u2192 't169'.\n\nWait, no. Let me search through all the productions for 't' symbols:\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT6 \u2192 't108'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41', 't169' (Wait, looking: NT91 \u2192 't169' because somewhere in the list I see NT100 \u2192 't94', etc.\n\nWait, let me go through each production that is a terminal:\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT75 \u2192 't23' I think?

{"custom_id":"request-771","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is a sequence of symbols like `t108`, `t101`, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Context-free grammars define the production rules for each non-terminal symbol. The given grammar starts with `S -> NT99 NT89`, so the starting symbol is S, which expands into two non-terminals, NT99 and NT89. These non-terminals further expand into other NT's and eventually into the terminals, which are the `t` followed by numbers.\n\nEach production rule is of the form NTNumber -> NTNumber NTNumber. So, each non-terminal breaks down into two other non-terminals, except when it's a terminal (ends with a 't'). These terminals are the ones that don't have any further rules; they're the leaves of the grammar tree.\n\nThe string given is: `t108 t101 t174 t24 t151 t76 t171 t49 t174 t72 t67 t154 t26 t162 t171 t127 t170 t65 t91 t101 t34 t97 t100 t0 t76 t162 t0 t91 t101 t69 t139 t130 t144 t24 t101 t123 t98 t0 t8 t69 t121`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the derivation tree has a binary structure where each non-terminal splits into two others. Each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT99 and NT89. Let's see what the first few symbols of the string are. The string starts with t108 t101.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t108. I need to see if t108 is a terminal or a non-terminal. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT108, so t108 must be a terminal. Similarly, t101 is a terminal. But the first rule for S is NT99 NT89, which suggests that the first two symbols should be related to NT99 and NT89.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look into the production rules that involve NT99 and NT89. Let's see:\n\n- NT99 -> NT6 NT103\n- NT89 -> NT44 NT1\n\nWait, so S -> NT99 NT89. So NT99 expands to NT6 NT103, and NT89 expands to NT44 NT1.\n\nLet me follow that:\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT99 NT89 \u2192 (NT6 NT103) (NT44 NT1)\n\nSo now, the string should start with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT103, followed by NT44 and NT1.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t108 t101... But according to the expansion, after S, the next symbols would involve NT6, NT103, NT44, and NT1. None of these are terminals except possibly NT6 or NT103 if they have terminal rules. Looking back, I don't see any NT rules leading to t-symbols. So, this suggests that the initial expansion may not be matching the string provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split in another way. Perhaps I need to parse the string into a sequence of symbols that can be matched by the grammar's production rules.\n\nEach production rule either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. So, every step, the symbols in the string must come from these rules or match a terminal.\n\nBut the problem is that the string is a concatenation of t-symbols, and since the grammar doesn't have any rules that produce one symbol at a time in between non-terminals, each symbol in the string must correspond directly to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut looking through the given grammar, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal directly produces a single 't' followed by a number. Each rule either breaks down into two non-terminals or (for some, like NT84 -> NT102 NT93) into two non-terminals, but none result in a terminal symbol like 't108'.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I missed some. Let me check each production rule quickly.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any that directly produce a terminal like 't103', 't108', etc. All the production rules for non-terminals result in two non-terminals, and some have 't's as part of the right-hand side.\n\nWait, for example, NT48 -> NT106 NT31, and then I can check if any of NT106 or NT31 have terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the '\u2192' rules, I see several NT's are converted to 't' followed by numbers. For instance, NT99 -> NT6 NT103, but then where does NT103 go?\n\nWait, in the rules, NT99 -> NT6 NT103. Then, looking for NT6, I see NT68 -> NT45 NT71. Hmm, not helpful. Looking elsewhere, I see:\n\nNT71 -> NT69, NT50. Not helpful.\n\nLooking for any NT that leads to a terminal, like NT68 -> NT28 NT12, which is two non-terminals. So, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs that ultimately lead to terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT24 -> NT123 (from NT123 being a terminal), as per NT123 -> 't123'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> 't126'? Wait, in the rules, looking for NT that map to 't...' symbols.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT96 -> NT105 and NT33, and NT105 -> 't105' as per one of the rules: NT105-> 't24'? Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, the rules for NT are sometimes followed by '-> 't'...' or '\u2192 NT...'.\n\nLooking for any rules where a non-terminal directly becomes a 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT44 -> 't98' (from NT96 -> 't98') but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any rule where an NT is directly replaced by a 't' symbol. Wait, for example:\n\n- NT16 -> 't112'? Wait, no. Let me check each rule:\n\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT12. No 't' there.\n- NT67 -> NT67. No.\n- NT18 -> NT35 NT43. No.\n- NT77 -> NT56. No.\n- Looking through all, I see that none of the rules produce a 't' directly. Instead, some NTs produce 't's as part of the rules, like:\n\n- NT52 -> 't24' via NT24 (I think). Wait, NT24 -> 't123' in one case, or maybe directly 't123'? Wait, looking:\n\nIn the rules, for example:\n\n- NT24 -> NT123.\n\nThen, NT123 -> 't123'. So NT24 can produce t123.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> 't126' if there's a rule, but checking: NT26 isn't an NT in the rules. Instead, other NTs like NT96 -> 't105' as per NT105 -> 't105'? Hmm, maybe I need to look for each NT and see if it can derive a 't' followed by numbers eventually.\n\nWait, in the given rules, some NTs map to 't'... for example:\n\n- NT77 -> 't56' via NT77 -> NT56 NT57. Then NT56 -> 't56', NT57 -> 't172'.\n\nWait, looking at NT77 -> NT56 NT57, NT56 is 't56', and NT57 -> 't172'. So NT77 could derive t56 t172, or perhaps t172 t56, but since order matters in the derivation tree, it's important.\n\nBut in our given string, the symbol is t172, so maybe NT77 is involved.\n\nSimilarly, NT105 is derived from some NT, perhaps leading to 't105'.\n\nBut honestly, this is getting complicated. The string is long, and each symbol must be matched correctly through the grammar's production rules.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the easiest"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-789","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a lot of production rules, each of which either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals, each in quotes: \"t91\", \"t101\", and so on.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form looks like. It has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, the Chomsky normal form allows exactly two symbols, so each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C can be non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is exactly two symbols on the right.\n\nNow, looking at the given string: it's a series of tokens like \"t91\", \"t101\", etc. Each token represents a variable or a literal. But in Chomsky normal form, the terminals are the literals, and non-terminals are the variables. But some of these \"t\" values could be terminals, but others might be non-terminals, though in the grammar provided, I don't see variables beyond S and the non-terminals like NT15, NT106, etc. All others are terminals.\n\nWait, let's clarify: in a CFG, terminals are the basic symbols, and non-terminals are variables that expand into other symbols. So, in this grammar, the non-terminals are all the NTs and S (and perhaps others? Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So S is a non-terminal. NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57. NT15 is a non-terminal. All these NTs are non-terminals. On the other hand, if a production has a terminal like 't91', that's a terminal.\n\nSo, in the given string, we have \"t\" followed by numbers, like \"t91\", etc. These are all terminals, except if the number is part of a non-terminal name, which they aren't. All the numbers are just part of the \"t\" identifiers. So, each \"t\" value, like \"t91\", \"t101\", etc., is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but no. If the grammar doesn't have any variables beyond S and the NTs, then any symbol that isn't in the NTs is a terminal. Since the string consists only of \"t\" followed by numbers, all these must be terminals, not non-terminals. So, in the grammar, the \"t\" symbols are terminals, and the NTs are non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so the problem is to see if this sequence is derivable from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nSo, my approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is suitable for a recursive descent parser, but perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a derivation that matches the string. The string has 44 tokens, which is a lot, but perhaps I can break it down.\n\nFirst, let's list the tokens in order:\n\nt91, t101, t65, t22, t171, t49, t23, t24, t165, t98, t105, t98, t65, t121, t157, t162, t104, t108, t101, t162, t174, t71, t108, t101, t69, t165, t130, t98, t69, t101, t2, t151, t100, t98, t67, t90, t158, t101, t2, t69, t141, t45.\n\nHmm, this seems quite long. Let's see if the grammar can generate such a long string. Alternatively, perhaps I can find recursive patterns or look for units that are repeated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain non-terminals have multiple productions that might suggest they can produce multiple values. For example, NT107 can produce several NTs, including NT65, which also has multiple productions. NT65 can produce NT157, NT105, and NT71. Also, NT157, NT105, etc., appear in other productions.\n\nI can also notice that some non-terminals might be producing the same strings, so perhaps the presence of recursion in certain parts of the grammar could help in generating longer strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to try to break down the string into smaller chunks that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, let's start by identifying any familiar patterns. For example, \"t91\" appears multiple times. Let's see where \"t91\" is used. Looking back at the grammar, in one of the productions, NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70. Another production: NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing it yet.\n\nWait, let me list out all the productions for clarity. Alternatively, maybe I can group parts of the string and see if they start with the initial non-terminal S, which would produce NT99 and NT89, as S \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string are \"t91\" and \"t101\". That would correspond to the two non-terminals in S's production, so maybe NT99 \u2192 ... and NT89 \u2192 ..., but I need to see if \"t91\" and \"t101\" can be derived from NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at NT99, from the grammar, I see that NT99 can produce NT6 NT103 etc., but I don't see a direct production rule that leads to \"t91\". Wait, no\u2014looking back, the grammar only has rules like NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, and perhaps NT6 is another non-terminal. Wait, let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT6 \u2192 NT91 NT69\nWait, so NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36.\n\nWait, but the string starts with \"t91\", \"t101\", \"t65\", etc. So perhaps \"t91\" is from NT171 (from production NT21 \u2192 NT171). Let me check NT171: it can produce NT77 and NT80, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t91\" could be from NT77, but looking back, NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65, and NT95 \u2192 NT130 NT... no, wait, perhaps a different route.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that since the string is very long, perhaps the parse tree is very deep, but that's not necessarily the case. It might just be a coincidence.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the leftmost symbols. The first token is \"t91\". So perhaps we can find a production that starts with \"t91\".\n\nLooking through the grammar for a production where a non-terminal starts with \"t\" followed by a number. Actually, all the NT productions have non-terminals on the right, so \"t\" symbols are terminals. Therefore, the only way a token like \"t91\" can appear is if a non-terminal (NT) has a production that includes \"t91\" as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules to see if any NT produces \"t91\". Looking through the production list:\n\nLooking at each production, I don't see any NT that has \"t91\" in the rules. For example, NT67 \u2192 ... but not \"t91\". Similarly, NT91 \u2192 ... etc. Wait, let's look carefully.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\nI notice that NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65 and others, but I don't see any production that includes \"t91\". Similarly, NT24 \u2192 t123, and others, but not \"t91\".\n\nWait, so if \"t91\" is a terminal, and no NT directly or indirectly produces \"t91\", then the grammar can't generate \"t91\" as a terminal. That would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal that isn't produced by any non-terminal.\n\nWait, but is that possible? Let me think.\n\nIn the given grammar, each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So terminals can only appear on the right side, not on the left.\n\nThus, to produce a string that includes \"t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-785","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm a bit rusty on CNF, but I remember that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all productions are either terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols starting with t108 and ending with t158. Hmm, I notice that the string has 35 symbols, which is quite a few. Each 't' followed by a number could be either a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are terminals or two non-terminals, so all the 't' symbols with numbers are terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, each is a number between, say, 10 to 198, but I'm not sure. Each of these numbers could correspond to non-terminal symbols. But to determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I probably need to parse it.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left has a production to two non-terminals on the right. So, to generate a string, each step combines two non-terminals into one on the left.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal must be matched by a production that directly produces that terminal. So, the strategy is to check if each 't' in the string is present in the right-hand side of some production, and see if there's a way to combine them using the grammar's rules.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, let me check some of the productions:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\n\nBTW, the productions connect non-terminals that produce certain terminals, so for example, NT15 is a non-terminal that can be rewritten as NT75 and NT57. But NT75 is another non-terminal that can be NT95 and NT18, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have symbols like 't108', 't101', etc. So for each symbol, I need to find a production in the grammar whose right-hand side includes that 't' as part of its rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT68 can produce 't134', 't47', and 't145'. Wait, no\u2014I see NT68's productions:\n\nNT68 -> NT45 NT71, NT134 NT43, NT145. So it can produce those three numbers as terminals. So if the string includes t134, t43, or t145, NT68 can be that non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at another non-terminal, NT107:\n\nNT107 is in several productions, like NT107 -> NT52 NT75, NT65 NT71, etc. So, we need to see if the string consists of non-terminals that can be broken down into the given NTs.\n\nBut it's a bit complex. Maybe I should think about how the string is built. Each 't' in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can directly generate that terminal. So for each terminal in the string, I need to find at least one production in the grammar where that NT is on the left and the terminal is on the right.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me see if each 't' in the string is in the right-hand side of any production:\n\nt108: Does any NT in the grammar produce t108? Looking through the productions, NT106 has a production to NT35 NT107. NT107 has more productions, but I don't see t108 directly. Alternatively, looking at NT172 or other, but maybe t108 is not directly produced by any NT. Wait, but in the grammar, there's:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT106 -> NT35 NT107\n\nNT36 -> NT47\n\nLooking for 't108' in any NT's productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT108 is produced by:\n\nNT108 -> NT6 NT103\n\nWait, wait, is that correct? Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the production list:\n\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT71, NT134 NT43, NT145.\n\nWait, in the grammar, does any NT produce t108? Let me scan through.\n\nLooking at NT6: does it have any production that includes t108? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see NT6 directly producing anything with t108. Hmm, perhaps I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through all the productions for NT6:\n\n- NT68 -> NT45 NT71\n\n- NT68 -> NT134 NT43\n\n- NT68 -> NT145\n\nBut nowhere does NT6 have a production that includes t108, so perhaps t108 is not directly produced by any NT, which could be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the string. The string starts with t108 t101 t158 t130 t94 t2 t94 t94 t67 t98 t159 t26 t171 t134 t174 t72 t144 t67 t167 t67 t73 t156 t96 t90 t124 t65 t24 t123 t98 t174 t108 t101 t121 t157 t174 t71 t91 t101 t158 t141 t94 t22.\n\nWait, 't108' appears at the start, then later again towards the end, twice.\n\nSo, for the first 't108', does any NT produce 't108' as a terminal? I think I need to check all NTs in the grammar to see if any have 't108' as a production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's check each NT that might produce 't108':\n\n- NT105: No, I don't see any production that includes t108.\n\n- NT106: NT106 -> NT35 NT107. So 't35' and 't107'.\n\nWait, but later in the grammar, is there a NT that produces t108 as a terminal? Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking at NT96: NT96 -> NT105 NT1, but 't105' and 't1'. No 't108'.\n\nNT77: NT77 -> NT95 NT65.\n\nWait, I'm looking for 't108'. Maybe the only way is if the string is built by combining certain NTs that eventually produce the 't's in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't108' is part of some NT's productions. Let me check NT108:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT108 is on the left. So, perhaps NT108 is only a terminal. But in the string, I see 't108' three times. So does NT108 produce 't108' as a terminal? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I can look for any NT that has a production where one of the symbols is t108, but as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\nWait, checking each production:\n\nLooking for any production where a terminal is 't108':\n\nI don't see any. Hmm, wait, the production NT107 -> NT52 NT75, and NT75 -> NT95 NT18, and so on. So perhaps 't108' isn't a terminal here. Therefore, the string would not be valid because 't108' is a terminal, but it's not produced by any NT.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I overlooked some production. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the entire list of productions:\n\n- NT68 has productions to NT134, NT43, NT145, but no 't108'.\n- NT106: productions to NT35 and NT107. So, 't35' and 't107' are terminals if they have productions that include them as terminals.\nWait, no, because NT35 has productions like -> NT68 NT103, so that's two non-terminals. But does any of the NTs have a production to 't108'?\n\nLooking at NT68's production -> NT43 NT145: again, two non-terminals.\n\nSo I'm starting to think that 't108' is not a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t108 t101 t139 t130 t94 t2 t151 t13 t100 t48 t63 t156 t24 t165 t130 t94 t0 t171 t49 t177 t108 t101 t69 t98 t158 t130 t0 t94 t71 t2 t8 t98 t2 t162 t162 t65 t71 t108 t101 t50 t69 t94 t24`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The given grammar is in CNF, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which might have a terminal. Looking through the productions, it seems that all non-terminals (like S, NT15, etc.) are defined in terms of other non-terminals, except for the terminals which are represented by 't' followed by numbers.\n\nEach string starts with 't', which is a terminal symbol. So, the string begins with t108, which must come from a production that starts with NT108 or S. But looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the initial step is to produce two non-terminals. Each of those could split into more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from the start, symbol by symbol, using the leftmost derivation method. Each step, I'll replace the first non-terminal with its right-hand side productions, checking if the string can be built step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nThe string is t108 t101 t139 t130 t94 t2 t151 t13 t100 t48 t63 t156 t24 t165 t130 t94 t0 t171 t49 t177 t108 t101 t69 t98 t158 t130 t0 t94 t71 t2 t8 t98 t2 t162 t162 t65 t71 t108 t101 t50 t69 t94 t24.\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT99 NT89. The first symbols should be t108 and t101. So, does NT99 produce t108 and NT89 produce t101?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT99 is derived from NT6 and NT1. NT6 is t91. NT1 is 't26'. Wait, but in the productions, NT6's only production is NT19 NT71, which leads to t99. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check NT6:\n\nLooking back, NT6 is defined by NT71 \u2192 NT70 NT42, and so on. Let me see if NT99 exists. Oh, wait, in the productions, I see NT99 is defined as NT6 NT103, and NT6 produces t91. So NT99 would produce t91 and NT103.\n\nBut in the initial string, the first symbol is t108, which would come from NT99. Let's see if NT99 can produce t108. Looking through the productions for NT99: It's defined as NT6 NT103. NT6 is t91, and NT103 leads to t101. Wait, no, that's for NT99. Let me check specific terminals for NT6 and NT103.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. NT6's productions include NT19 \u2192 't171' and NT70 \u2192 't67'. NT103 is 't101'. Wait, no: in the productions, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. But NT6's production includes NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT7, but looking deeper, I might be getting stuck. Alternatively, maybe each non-terminal directly produces a terminal as defined. For example, NT61 \u2192 't172', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see if each non-terminal directly maps to a terminal. For instance, each NT... production eventually maps to a t followed by a number, except some may produce other NTs.\n\nLet me check specific nodes:\n\nLook up NT99: It's NT6 NT103.\n\nLooking up NT6: NT6 appears in several productions. For example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT7 \u2192 't69' NT7?\n\nWait, no. Let me parse this correctly. Maybe each NT has a tree of productions leading to terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I should create a list of all NTs and their end productions to see what terminals they produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89\n\nLooking for NT99 and NT89's terminal productions.\n\nLooking for NT99: productions are NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103. Now, NT6 \u2192 NT71 NT... Wait, let me step through:\n\nNT99: production is NT6 NT103.\n\nNT6: which production is it? Looking at the grammar, NT61 is defined as NT6 NT17. Wait, but I'm looking for NT6. Hmm, maybe I need to track each NT's possible terminal outcomes.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try parsing the string step by step, assuming that each non-terminal is expanded to its RHS, matching the first symbol.\n\nThe string starts with t108. Let's see which NT produces t108.\n\nLooking through the list of NT productions, each directly maps to a terminal:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't107 nt17' ??? Wait, let's list all NTs and their terminal mappings:\n\nWait, looking for NTs that have a production where one side is a terminal like tN.\n\nFor example, NT6's productions:\n\nLooking for NTs in the grammar that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking at the 't' productions:\n\n- NT108 \u2192 't118' (as per NT108's production)\n- NT101 \u2192 't101'\n- NT139 \u2192 't139'\n- NT130 \u2192 't130' (from NT130's productions)\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, many NTs end up producing a terminal. For example, in the list, NT106 \u2192 't105', 't8', etc. Wait, looking for which NTs have a terminal as their RHS.\n\nActually, looking at the given grammar, each production for an NT ultimately has a terminal or another NT. So for example:\n\nNT108 \u2192 't118' NT107 would mean it can produce t118 followed by the expansion of NT107.\n\nBut perhaps each NT has a set of productions that can lead to a terminal. For example:\n\nNT108 can produce 't118' followed by its other productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to a specific NT. Let me map each t in the string to an NT.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Instead, perhaps it's easier to check if all the t symbols in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nWait, but each t in the string must be matched by a terminal in the grammar. For example, t108 must be generated by some NT.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\nNT108's productions include NT105 \u2192 't24' and NT107 \u2192 't94', so perhaps NT108 can produce 't118' from NT108's production.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to see if all the 't' symbols in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking through the string: t108, t101, t139, t130, t94, t2, t151, t13, t100, t48, t63, t156, t24, t165, t130, t94, t0, t171, t49, t177, t108, t101, t69, t98, t158, t130, t0, t94, t71, t2, t8, t98, t2, t162, t162, t65, t71, t108, t101, t50, t69, t94, t24.\n\nEach of these ts must correspond to some NT in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, each NT has a set of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-809","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side except for the start symbol, S. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form typically has rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see rules like S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which fit into this structure. Each rule has two non-terminals, and sometimes those non-terminals can be further expanded into terms.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens starting with t91 and ending with t0. Each token seems to correspond to a non-terminal in the grammar, except for 't' followed by a number, which are terminals. \n\nI should parse the string step by step, starting with the start symbol S. The first rule I see is S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So the string starts with t91, but in the grammar, NT99 would terminate at t91. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT99 is a non-terminal, and in the rules, NT99 is defined as something else. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT99 being a terminal. Oh wait, no\u2014it might be a terminal if it's in a production where it's alone, like NT99 \u2192 't91'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, I see NT99 \u2192 't91'. So that means when NT99 is expanded, it becomes 't91'. Similarly, S \u2192 NT99 NT89 would produce 't91' followed by whatever NT89 expands to.\n\nLooking at the next part of the string, after t91 comes t101. Let's see what NT89 is. Checking the rules, NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So NT89 is followed by both NT61 and NT76. Expanding NT61, which has a rule NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44. Then NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65, and NT1 has a rule? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT1 having a production. Wait, in the rules, NT1 isn't present, which might mean it's a terminal. But looking at the string, after t91 comes t101, t139, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet me better approach this by building a parse tree or using a recursive descent parser approach.\n\nStep 1: The string starts with t91. From the rules, NT99 \u2192 t91, so that's the first rule. So the string starts with NT99, which becomes t91. The remaining string is t101 t139 t130 t21 t165 t130 t63 t67 t108 t144 t156 t112 t21 t123 t98 t65 t93 t144 t76 t164 t51 t101 t123 t98 t65 t24 t94 t24 t123 t98 t0 t105 t98 t0 t94 t65 t67 t167 t158 t141 t94 t24.\n\nStep 2: After t91, the next part is t101. Let me check NT89. NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So the next parts must be NT61 and NT76. Expanding NT61: NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44. So next after t91 is t101 (from NT89).\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of it as a parse. The first two symbols are t91 and t101. Since S starts with NT99 and NT89, which would produce t91 followed by whatever NT89 expands to. So after t91, the next non-terminal is NT89, which expands to NT61 NT76. So the next two symbols after t91 should be the expansion of NT61 and then NT76.\n\nLooking at the string: after t91 comes t101. So t101 is the expansion of NT61. Then the next term should be the expansion of NT76.\n\nWait, but according to NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76, so after t91 (NT99), comes NT89, which becomes NT61 and NT76. So the string should have t61 followed by t76 as the next two terms after t91.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t91 is t101, which is not t61 or t76. That suggests that maybe S cannot derive the given string. Because S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which would produce t91 followed by NT89's expansion. Since NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76, and NT61 and NT76 would each produce terminals.\n\nWait, but wait: NT61 has a rule, NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44. So NT61 would expand into NT84 and NT44. NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65. NT1 \u2192 't99'? Or is it a non-terminal that's expanded further? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT1 having a production, which might indicate it's a terminal. But in the given string, after t91, the next is t101, which is a terminal. Let's check the rules to see if t101 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules: I don't see any NT rule resulting in t101 as a terminal. So perhaps t101 is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded. But in the given string, it's immediately following t91, which is the first expansion as NT99 \u2192 t91. This suggests that the second non-terminal (NT89) after t91 must expand into t101 and then something else, but in the string, after t101 comes t139.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the rules for NT89 and see what they expand into. NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So after t91, we have t61 and t76 as the next two symbols. But in the string, after t91 comes t101, which is not t61 or t76. So this discrepancy suggests that the string cannot be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check NT89 again: it's defined as NT61 and NT76. Then NT61 is further defined as NT84 and NT44. Then NT84 is defined as NT1 and NT65. If NT1 is a terminal, then in the string, after t91, the next should be NT1, but there's no t1 in the string. Alternatively, perhaps NT1 is a non-terminal that is further expanded into a terminal, like 't99', but in the string, the next is t101, which doesn't fit.\n\nI think the initial step shows that the second symbol after t91 should be t61 (from NT61), but in the string, it's t101. That suggests the string is not generated by the grammar. But I should check other possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe the NT61 rule \u2192 NT84 NT44, and NT84 can further expand. So the expansion looks like t91, then NT61 (which becomes t84 ...), but I'm getting lost in the details. Maybe it's easier to think that the initial step fails because the second term isn't t61 or t76.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to write out the parse.\n\nThe string starts with t91. The grammar has S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so NT99 is t91. Then NT89 expands to NT61 NT76. So the next terms after t91 should be the expansions of NT61 and NT76.\n\nLooking at the string: After t91, the next is t101, which would have to be either the expansion of NT61 or NT76. But according to the grammar, NT61 expands to NT84 NT44, which are non-terminals, so the next terms should be t84 and t44 or further expanded. But in the string, after t91 is t101, which isn't t84. So this suggests that the string cannot be generated.\n\nI'm pretty confident at this point that the string isn't generated by the grammar because the second symbol after t91 isn't matching the expected NT61 or NT76 expansion.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string does not match the grammar's expansion starting with t91 followed by t101, which should instead be the expansion"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-826","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is a series of tokens starting with 't108' and ending with 't0'. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, I notice some terminals ('t' followed by numbers) are present. That's a bit confusing because usually in CNF, all productions are non-terminals on the right. But maybe this grammar has been modified or it's a mix.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The grammar rules are all in CNF format, meaning each production has either two non-terminals or a single non-terminal (if it's the start symbol and terminals are allowed). But some of the production rules here have terminals on the right side. Hmm, maybe the grammar isn't pure CNF, or perhaps it's an extended version. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe string starts with 't108', which probably corresponds to the start symbol S. Looking at the production S -> NT99 NT89, so the first part of the string should correspond to NT99 and NT89. \n\nLooking into the productions, NT99 can produce NT6 NT103, and NT103 can produce NT24 NT45. Wait, but in the string, the first token is 't108', which seems unrelated. Let me check what NT99 and NT89 produce.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each 't' number corresponds to a specific production chain. I think it's better to model this as a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals. So I'll try to find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t108 t101 t158 t130 t21 t165 t130 t21 t139 t130 t48 t94 t158 t130 t2 t65 t71 t0 t105 t98 t2 t8 t98 t0 t2 t11 t71 t100 t76 t80 t101 t2 t177 t65 t67 t108 t48 t158 t98 t0 t105 t69 t94 t24.\n\nThat's quite long. Let me see if I can find how the productions might split this. Starting with NT99 and NT89.\n\nNT99 -> NT6 NT103. Let's see what NT6 does. Looking at the productions, NT61 -> NT84 NT73. Wait, maybe I should look for how each NT can derive the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look at the entire string and see if it can be split according to any of the given productions. For example, looking at the beginning: t108 t101 t158 t130 t21... \n\nWait, I remember that in CNF, each production expands into two symbols. So the first step would be to split the start symbol S into two non-terminals and see if the string starts with those. But the first token is 't108', which is a terminal, not a non-terminal. That makes me think that maybe the grammar isn't in CNF, or perhaps it's a mixture. Alternatively, perhaps the 't' terms are terminals, and the NTs are non-terminals.\n\nBut looking at the productions, some have terminals like NT99 -> NT6 NT103, which suggests that maybe the grammar isn't pure CNF because some rules have a terminal (like t17, t2, etc.) on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, in the productions, most rules have two non-terminals, except for some that have a single non-terminal, maybe as the start. But for example, NT7 -> 't21' is a rule. Oh, I see, some rules have a terminal on the right. That's allowed in CNF if the start symbol can produce a terminal. So perhaps S can produce a terminal, making the grammar suitable for handling both non-terminals and terminals during expansion.\n\nBut the string starts with 't108', which is a terminal. So maybe the grammar allows the start symbol to directly produce a terminal, or through a chain of production steps.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, and S is defined as NT99 NT89. So S is a product of two non-terminals, which must each be expanded into something. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the expansion of NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't108', which would correspond to the first non-terminal (NT99). What does NT99 produce?\n\nLooking for NT99 in the productions. Oh, looking again, I realize that no production for NT99 is present. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check:\n\nThe productions start with S -> NT99 NT89\n\nThen NT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\n\nNT84 -> NT1 NT65\n\nNT73 -> NT83 NT70\n\nNT40 -> NT39 NT35\n\nNT52 -> NT28 NT70\n\nNT89 -> NT61 NT76\n\nNT73 -> NT6 NT39\n\nNT64 -> NT100 NT93\n\nNT80 -> NT67 NT73\n\nNT35 -> NT68 NT103\n\nWait, I see now. There is a NT89 -> NT61 NT76. But also another NT73 -> NT83 NT70 and NT73 -> NT6 NT39. Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a lot of production rules, I think they got cut off, but looking carefully, the first part includes S -> NT99 NT89, NT15, etc., but I don't see NT99 in any production except the first one. Wait, perhaps I need to look through all the provided productions again.\n\nWait, the list of productions is long. Let me see:\n\nAfter S, the productions are NT15, NT81, NT84, NT73, NT40, NT93, etc., but looking through all of them, I see NT73 appears twice, perhaps. Wait, no NT99 in the productions except the initial S. That's a problem. Wait, no. Wait, S is the only production with NT99. So NT99 doesn't have any other productions except what's listed initially, which is maybe incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the context.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the provided grammar is incomplete, but the user is asking about a specific string. Alternatively, perhaps I missed that NT99 has other productions, but looking through the provided rules, I don't see it. Let me scan the provided productions:\n\nLooking at the list, I only see S -> NT99 NT89. Then looking for NT99 in the other rules, but in the provided rules, I don't see any other NT99 productions beyond that. So perhaps S can produce only one thing, which is NT99 NT89, and then those non-terminals can expand further.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the first two tokens in the string should correspond to the expansion of NT99 and NT89. However, the provided NT productions don't show any rules for NT99 beyond S itself, so perhaps the assumption here is that NT99 can only produce the start symbol, which is itself. But that doesn't make sense because that would require a recursive loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing the productions, but perhaps I shouldn't get stuck on that. Alternatively, maybe I can infer the productions by pattern. For instance, S -> NT99 NT89 is the top rule, and perhaps other rules involve NT99.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it by trying to see if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe first step is that the start symbol S must be expanded into NT99 and NT89. So the string should start with those two non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is 't108', which is a terminal. So perhaps the string starts with a production that ends in 't108', which could be a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking for 't108' in the productions as a terminal. Wait, in the productions, I see NT68 -> 't134' in one production, NT6 -> 't108' as per the production NT61 -> ... (no, wait, looking through all productions, I see NT61 -> NT84 NT73, but other parts of the grammar have NT61 -> NT74 NT52, etc., but none that directly produce 't108'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, S \u2192 NT99 NT89 is two non-terminals, and NT734 \u2192 t172 is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t108 t101 t165 t130 t0 t151 t100 t144 t94 t165 t130 t94 t2 t8 t98 t2 t34 t157 t146 t21 t139 t98 t98 t50 t101 t65 t50 t98 t2 t104 t0 t48 t134 t101 t165 t98 t105 t98 t65 t63 t165 t69 t65 t24`. Each part of the string is a terminal, so I'll need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to attempt to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Since the grammar is given in CNF, the parsing can be done using a top-down approach, such as the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing. However, since the string is quite long, I need to break it down step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking for the first few terminals and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S. The first symbol in the string is `t108`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT100 \u2192 t127, NT106 \u2192 t138, NT107 \u2192 t94, etc. Wait, but in the provided grammar, the `t` tokens are defined as productions from various non-terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 t134, NT19 \u2192 t99, and others.\n\nWait, actually, the tokens like t108, t101, etc., are terminals. So, to see if these can be generated, I need to check if they appear as right-hand sides in any production, or if they can be derived from the start.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I should list all the productions that produce terminals. Let me go through each production:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\n- NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n- NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n- NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\n- NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT39 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n- NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\n- NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n- NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92\n- NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18\n- NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\n- NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88\n- NT52 \u2192 NT70 NT52 \u2013 Wait, seems like a left recursion here. In CNF, productions with left recursion aren't allowed. Oh, but looking at the production NT52 \u2192 NT52 NT70, that's a left recursion which would cause issues. However, in CNF, sometimes left recursion is converted into a non-left recursive form using lookaheads or other methods. But in this case, it's a single production, so NT52 can only produce itself followed by NT70, which is problematic. This might be a bug, but for now, in the parsing, if NT52 is involved, it's tricky.\n\nMoving on, NT11 \u2192 NT81 NT29, NT29 has two productions: NT29 \u2192 t36, NT29 \u2192 t156, etc. So, NT29 can produce terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the entire string and see if it can be parsed by the grammar. Since it's a long string, I might need to check if each step can be derived correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for a pattern or trying to reduce the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to note that in a context-free grammar with CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, to generate the given string, each terminal must be produced by some rule, and each non-terminal must expand accordingly.\n\nMoreover, in a derivation, the number of symbols increases, so if the string is generated, it must be the result of a certain number of expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to trace the string backwards, looking for the start symbol S and seeing if the entire string can be reduced to S through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start from the end of the string and see which part can be matched by a production.\n\nThe string ends with ... t24.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT24 \u2192 t? Let's see: wait, in the productions, I don't see NT24 directly. Let's check all productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT2 is defined as NT16 NT12, which is two non-terminals, but no NT24. Wait, wait, looking again, the grammar includes:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT123, but wait, that's incorrect. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see NT24 is produced by other non-terminals, but I don't see any direct NT24. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, the list seems extensive, but looking for t24:\n\nIn the grammar, for example, NT68 \u2192 t134, NT19 \u2192 t99, etc. But perhaps the string is composed of `t24`, which is part of NT24. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT24 would be a non-terminal only if there's a production for it.\n\nWait, let me go through the productions again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the productions that result in the terminals in the string. For example, if a production has a terminal, that can help.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, let's list all the non-terminals and the terminals generated by each:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57 (both non-terminals)\n- NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23 (both)\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65 (both)\n- NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70 (both)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35 (both)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70 (both)\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76 (both)\n- NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39 (both)\n- NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93 (both)\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73 (both)\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103 (both)\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71 (both)\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107 (both)\n- NT39 \u2192 NT23 NT16 (both)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9 (both)\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31 (both)\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36 (both)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69 (both)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64 (both)\n- NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77 (both)\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108 (both)\n- NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44 (both)\n- NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92 (both)\n- NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18 (both)\n- NT35 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-846","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm facing this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The process involves a series of steps, and I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. The given grammar starts with S and applies transformations through a series of production rules. Each rule on the left allows replacement by two non-terminals on the right. CNF requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all productions seem to fit CNF, except I notice some have three terms, like NT77 \u2192 NT35 NT96 NT52. Wait, actually, looking back, no, in CNF each production should have exactly two symbols on the right side. Hmm, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, upon closer inspection, actually, in the given grammar, all productions are two symbols on the right except for some like NT77 \u2192 NT35 NT95 NT65, which has three. That might be an issue because Chomsky Normal Form requires only two symbols. Maybe this is a mistake, or perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that most are in the form of two non-terminals, but there are some that have three. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT35 NT96 NT52, that's three. Similarly, NT61 \u2192 NT7 NT92, that's two, so okay. But checking the rest, there are a few with three. That might not be CNF, which is a strict requirement, so perhaps the provided grammar isn't in CNF. But wait, maybe I made a mistake because the user said it's in CNF. Let me verify.\n\nWait, Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be exactly A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So if any production has more than two symbols on the right, it's not in CNF. Looking back, I think I may have misread, but upon checking, indeed, the grammar presented includes some productions with three non-terminals on the right, like NT77 \u2192 NT35 NT96 NT52. That would mean the grammar isn't in proper CNF, but maybe the user intended that, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me move forward. Maybe this is a mistake, or perhaps the given grammar is not in CNF, but regardless, the problem states it's given in CNF, so perhaps I should proceed as if the given grammar is correctly in CNF. Alternatively, perhaps I misread a production and they all have two non-terminals on the right except a few. Since this is critical, perhaps I should note it, but maybe I should proceed since I can't change the fact that the problem states it's in CNF.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and all productions are two symbols, except for a few. For example, NT35 \u2192 NT106 NT23 is a production, which as in some others. Let me check a few more. NT77 is produced by NT35 NT96 NT52, which has three symbols. That contradicts CNF, which requires exactly two. Therefore, I think perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar, but since it's stated that the grammar is in CNF, maybe I should proceed considering that, perhaps, all right-hand sides have two symbols. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just proceed, assuming the given grammar is in CNF, and each production is correctly two symbols. Or, perhaps, for the purposes of solving this, I can ignore any ambiguity. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the grammar is correct, but maybe I just move on.\n\nRegardless, the string to evaluate is `t108 t101 t158 t130 t48 t23 t24 t158 t130 t23 t127 t90 t130 t157 t139 t130 t156 t93 t145 t101 t123 t98 t0 t8 t98 t2 t8 t98 t158 t130 t94 t2 t151 t100 t94 t0 t67 t73 t158 t98 t0 t8 t69 t94 t24`.\n\nEach of the symbols in the string might be terminals or generated by the non-terminals via the given grammar. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the given grammar is in CNF, the standard way to parse strings is via a recursive descent parser or using the fact that the length of the string must be 2^n -1 for some n, but since the problem is about proving membership, perhaps a better approach is manual derivation or looking for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but with such a long string, that's impractical. Instead, perhaps looking for a way to break down the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for non-terminals that can produce sequences of these t symbols and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the presence of symbols that are terminals and see if the grammar can generate them. For example, looking at the terminal symbols in the string: t108, t101, t158, etc. The grammar seems to have many production rules that can produce these terminal values.\n\nEach non-terminal can produce a specific terminal, as per the rules. For example, looking at NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9 (or maybe NT21?), I think each non-terminal has a rule that eventually produces a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, many non-terminals like NT15, NT7, NT1, etc., have direct productions to a single terminal, such as NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT9, which might further produce other non-terminals, but ultimately, it's possible each non-terminal can derive a string of terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the way to proceed is to construct a derivation starting from S and seeing if we can reach the given string. Alternatively, perhaps it's feasible to find if each t symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this would be time-consuming, so perhaps a better approach is to see if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar, maybe through some pattern.\n\nLet me consider that the string is quite long and composed of many t symbols with varying indices. Let's start by looking for the presence of t symbols and see which non-terminals can generate them.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, many non-terminals have direct productions to a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't127'\n- NT61 \u2192 't127'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69'\n- NT97 \u2192 't69'\n- NT103 \u2192 't101'\n- NT11 \u2192 't17'\n- NT42 \u2192 't165'\n- NT77 \u2192 't56'\n- NT35 \u2192 't42' wait no, in the grammar, the production for NT44 is NT24 NT88, etc. Wait, let me list the rules again.\n\nWait, the given grammar is a bit complex, but looking for any production that has a terminal on the right side:\n\nLooking through each production, I see that NT50 \u2192 't110' is not present. Wait, actually, looking back, the user listed some production rules that look like NT107 \u2192 't94', NT11 \u2192 't17', etc. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking back, some rules are:\n\nNT11 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't99'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't123'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't156'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't165'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't99'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't145'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't69'\n\nWait, this can't be right.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can go directly to a terminal. But looking at the rules, I notice that the start symbol S splits into NT99 and NT89. Wait, but in CNF, in the strict sense, non-terminals should only produce non-terminals. Oh, but in the given grammar, the right-hand sides are combinations like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, etc. So okay, it's CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't91 t101 t139 ...'. So I think each 't' followed by a number represents a terminal symbol. So the idea is that each 'tN' is a terminal, and the grammar's non-terminals (NT) have to derive into sequences that are products of these terminals.\n\nThe approach I can take is to check if each non-terminal in the string can be replaced by the corresponding terminal using the given productions. Essentially, I can try to match the string step by step, replacing non-terminals as I go.\n\nLet's start with the string: t91 t101 t139 t130 t67 t167 t63 t144 t94 t174 t54 t0 t174 t71 t94 t127 t170 t94 t51 t98 t159 t56 t158 t130 t0 t104 t2 t171 t41 t11 t115 t177 t91 t101 t177 t108 t101 t63 t165 t98 t2 t157 t69 t65 t24.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89, the entire string should be derived from S, so it should be possible to break the string into two parts: the first part derived from NT99 and the second from NT89.\n\nLooking at the first 't91', I see that there's a production rule NT91 -> NT6 NT17. So 't91' would come from NT91. But wait, in the grammar, the rules don't directly map 't91' to anything. Instead, they have NT91 -> NT6 NT17, which would generate a string 't6 t17' eventually.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Each 'tX' in the string must be generated by a non-terminal. So I can try to see which non-terminals can produce each 'tX'.\n\nLet's list out all the 'tX' in the string:\n\nt91, t101, t139, t130, t67, t167, t63, t144, t94, t174, t54, t0, t174, t71, t94, t127, t170, t94, t51, t98, t159, t56, t158, t130, t0, t104, t2, t171, t41, t11, t115, t177, t91, t101, t177, t108, t101, t63, t165, t98, t2, t157, t69, t65, t24.\n\nThat's a long sequence. I need to see if each of these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nEach NT can produce two NTs, and the leaves are the 'tX's. So, each step in the derivation replaces an NT with two NTs until we get to the leaves, which are the 'tX's.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is a concatenation of 'tX's, so the grammar must generate a string where each 'tX' is a terminal, and the structure of the grammar must allow the derivation to yield this sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so the parse tree should be a binary tree, and the leaves should be the terminals. So, I can try to parse the string as if it's a leftmost derivation (or any order, since it's an ambiguous grammar) and see if the string can be built.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the minimum length of a string derived from a non-terminal is 2^k, where k is the number of productions. But this might not directly help.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal can be generated by a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, t0, t1, etc., are just terminals; the non-terminals produce sequences of these.\n\nSo, first, let me check each 'tX' in the string to see if any production rules produce them directly or through other rules.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules:\n\nI notice that some 'tX' are directly produced by some NTs:\n\n- NT1 -> 't107 NT17' \u2192 Wait, actually NT17 is a non-terminal, but wait, looking at the rules:\nWait, the rules in the grammar are a bit complex. Wait, in the provided rules, for example:\n\nNT17 -> 't171' and NT177 is another NT? Hmm, let's look:\n\nLooking at the rules, I think I need to check if any NTs can produce each 'tX'.\n\nWait, each production is of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except where a NTX is directly assigned to a terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, many of them are assigning a non-terminal to two other non-terminals, like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, and so on. But some rules have 'tN' at the end, meaning that the NT can produce that terminal directly.\n\nFor example, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't107 NT17'\n- NT31 -> 't34'\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT61 -> 't19 NT71'\n- NT64 -> 't106 NT93'\n- NT73 -> 't73' \u2192 Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, for example:\n\nNT1 -> t107 NT17 (so NT1 produces two non-terminals)\nNT31 -> t34\nSimilarly, many other rules have 'tX' at the end, meaning those NTs can directly produce 'tX's.\n\nSo for example, NT12 -> t80, so NT12 can produce 't80' directly.\n\nSimilarly, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107 \u2192 but no 't's here unless one of the NTS in the next steps produce 't's.\nWait, perhaps I should list out which NTs can produce each 'tX' and build a dependency or a mapping.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst, list all the possible NTs and their possible productions that can produce a 'tX'.\n\nLooking for 'tX' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, any NT that ends with a 'tX' directly can produce it. So let's identify all NTs that end with a 'tX':\n\n- NT1 -> t107 NT17 \u2192 So NT1 can produce 't107 t17', where NT17 is another NT?\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

{"custom_id":"request-862","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which simplifies the process because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce strings of terminals.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grammar. All the non-terminal symbols (like S, NT15, NT89, etc.) are on the left side of the rules, and each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right. The terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe given string to evaluate is:\nt108 t101 t130 t2 t11 t97 t100 t94 t0 t94 t72 t21 t174 t0 t159 t21 t165 t98 t151 t11 t157 t100 t94 t2 t104 t108 t101 t50 t98 t65 t24 t118 t67 t154 t26 t171 t134 t104 t91 t101 t121 t71 t104 t91 t101 t45.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which produces NT99 and NT89 (S -> NT99 NT89). Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded according to the rules until we reach terminals, which will form the string.\n\nLet's break down the string into parts that might correspond to the productions. The initial step is to split the string into two main parts: the first part from NT99's expansion and the second from NT89's expansion, since S splits into NT99 and NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108. Let's see what NT99 can produce. Checking the grammar, I see that NT99 is not directly a terminal. Wait, I'm checking the grammar provided, and I don't see NT99 as a non-terminal. Oh, the string starts with t108, which must come from a terminal production rule. Looking through the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals have productions that end in terminals, like NT96 -> NT105, and others could lead to terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT99 rule, but the string starts with t108, so that suggests that t108 must be a terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal in the grammar directly produces 't108'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT108 is a terminal, is it? Wait, in the grammar, do any rules have t108? Let me scan the list. Under 'NT', there's NT108 -> t118, but that's 't118', not 't108'. Hmm. So perhaps I need to find a way to generate t108.\n\nWait, looking through all the production rules, the only 't's are for numbers like t108, t101, t130, etc. So t108 is one of the terminals. I need to check if there's a production rule that can produce t108.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see NT6 is t108 (the production is NT68 -> NT67 NT73, but that leads to 't24'). Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT's:\n\nWait, checking the productions, some are terminal.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has some lines where the left-hand side is a non-terminal but the right-hand side is a terminal. For example:\n\nNT29 -> 't36'\nNT29 -> 't156'\nNT24 -> 't123'\nNT12 -> 't80'\nNT9 -> 't134'\nNT39 -> 't144'\nNT68 -> 't134'\nNT29 -> 't129'\nNT81 -> 't71'\nNT9 -> 't41'\nNT76 -> 't178'\nNT65 -> 't105'\nNT71 -> 't69'\nNT73 -> 't167'\nNT15 -> 't90'\nNT71 -> 't69'\nNT73 -> 't90'\nNT33 -> 't23'\nNT103 -> 't101'\nNT52 -> 't177'\nNT21 -> 't171'\nNT43 -> 't2'\nNT33 -> 't23'\nNT80 -> 't63'\nNT49 -> 't157'\nNT69 -> 't133'\nNT91 -> 't164'\nNT42 -> 't165'\nNT45 -> 't98'\nNT2 -> 't26'\nNT77 -> 't56'\nNT23 -> 't156'\nNT69 -> 't1'\nNT100 -> 't127'\nNT108 -> 't118'\nNT65 -> 't157'\nNT46 -> 't99'\nNT39 -> 't48'\nNT96 -> 't91'\nNT19 -> 't99'\nNT23 -> 't171'\nNT57 -> 't172'\nNT77 -> 't124'\nNT49 -> 't115'\nNT84 -> 't102'\nNT9 -> 't169'\nNT19 -> 't97'\nNT84 -> 't0'\nNT64 -> 't24'\nNT17 -> 't22'\nNT88 -> 't141'\nNT9 -> 't49'\nNT76 -> 't45'\nNT95 -> 't130'\nNT74 -> 't146'\nNT16 -> 't112'\nNT36 -> 't47'\nNT52 -> 't104'\nNT16 -> 't54'\nNT102 -> 't13'\nNT68 -> 't145'\nNT6 -> 't108'\nAh, here we go! So NT6 -> t108 is a rule. So that's how t108 is generated.\n\nWait, so in the grammar, NT6 is a non-terminal that can produce t108 (and also t24, but that's different). So the first part of the string is t108, which comes from NT6.\n\nSo S -> NT99 NT89.\n\nNow, the first expansion is S -> NT99 NT89, so the string starts with NT99's production and ends with NT89's production.\n\nBut the string starts with t108, which is from NT6. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding where the NT99 and NT89 are expanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion is NT99 and NT89, and each of them can split into other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking at the entire string and see if it can be broken down based on the grammar rules.\n\nSo the string is: t108 t101 t130 t2 t11 t97 t100 t94 t0 t94 t72 t21 t174 t0 t159 t21 t165 t98 t151 t11 t157 t100 t94 t2 t104 t108 t101 t50 t98 t65 t24 t118 t67 t154 t26 t171 t134 t104 t91 t101 t121 t71 t104 t91 t101 t45.\n\nThis is quite a long string, so let me try to split it into parts that might correspond to the grammar's production rules.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT99 NT89, so the entire string must be generated by expanding NT99 and NT89 and concatenating their expansions.\n\nSo maybe I can split the string into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT99 and the second part is the expansion of NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t108. Let's assume that comes from NT6. So NT99 must expand into a string starting with t108, but in the grammar, NT99 isn't a terminal. Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I think I need to find a way for NT99 to produce t108 or the necessary sequence leading to t108 as the first token.\n\nBut"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-868","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I'll read through the grammar rules and the string to understand what's going on.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the start symbol, it's S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT99 NT89, which means S expands into two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89.\n\nNow, looking at NT99 and NT89, I see that NT99 is defined as NT61 NT76, and NT89 is NT61 NT76 as well. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Actually, I notice that both NT99 and NT89 have similar or same definitions, but I need to track their expansions.\n\nWait, looking closer, NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76, and NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76. So both NT99 and NT89 expand into the same two non-terminals, which are NT61 and NT76. Hmm, that might be a key point.\n\nNow, looking at NT61 and NT76, their definitions are:\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\nNT76 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n\nSo NT61 expands into NT84 and NT44, and NT76 into NT67 and NT73. Substituting these, the initial S expansion is S \u2192 NT61 NT76 \u2192 (NT84 NT44) (NT67 NT73) \u2192 NT84 NT44 NT67 NT73. Wait, that's four non-terminals, but the string starts with 't91 t101 t94 t22' which is four tokens. So let me see if these NTs correspond to these tokens.\n\nLooking at the token list:\n1. t91\n2. t101\n3. t94\n4. t22\nThen followed by others.\n\nSo S expands into four parts: NT84, NT44, NT67, NT73. But the string's first four tokens are t91, t101, t94, t22. Let's see what each NT could produce.\n\nLet's backtrack. Maybe each NT eventually produces a terminal string. Let's look at each non-terminal and see their possible expansions:\n\nLet's see NT99 \u2192 NT61 NT76, and NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44. So NT99 would eventually expand into NT84 and NT44. Similarly, NT76 \u2192 NT67 NT73.\n\nLooking at NT84, the rules are:\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\nNT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\nNT107 \u2192 NT65 NT71\nWait, this seems complex. Alternatively, looking at the provided rules, maybe each NT ultimately produces specific tokens.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, perhaps we can reverse-engineer from the end, seeing if each token can be matched by a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt91, t101, t94, t22,...\n\nFirst, check t91. Looking up, NT91 is defined as NT6 NT17. So t91 could be NT91. Then, NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. Wait, no, t91 is a terminal, looking at the grammar, terminals are the ones listed as 't...', like t1, t2, etc. So t91 is a terminal, so NT91 must produce t91.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT91 is defined as NT6 NT17. So for NT91 to produce t91, both NT6 and NT17 should produce t91. Wait, but NT6 would produce t91? Let me check NT6: NT6 is defined as NT19 NT71. NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46. NT74 is a rule. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look at NT6: looking at the given rules, NT6 is defined as NT19 NT71. But NT91 is NT6 NT17. Wait, no, looking back, in the rules, NT19 is NT74 NT46, and NT71 is NT69, which is a production to t1. Wait, this might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the provided rules for NT91. Wait, in the given rules, I can see that NT17 \u2192 't24', and NT46 \u2192 't99', but I don\u2019t see NT91 producing any terminals directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules, for example, NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108. Hmm, but that's just two NTs.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I can parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the string: ['t91', 't101', 't94', 't22', ...]\n\nThe first symbol is 't91'. Looking at the grammar, 't91' comes from NT91. So NT91 must generate 't91'. Then, looking at NT91's production: NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. Wait, no, in the rules, I don't see NT91 being defined as such. Actually, I don't think NT91 is a definition but rather a terminal. Looking back, I might have misread it. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see lines like NT17 \u2192 't24', NT24 \u2192 't123', etc., but I don\u2019t see NT91 as a production. Wait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me scan more carefully.\n\nWait, in the given rules, the lines are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't123'\n\n...\n\nLooking at the list, I see lines like 'NT7 \u2192 't21'', 'NT16 \u2192 't112'', 'NT88 \u2192 't141'', etc. Wait, I don't see 't91' being produced. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules again, perhaps 't91' is defined. Let me scan:\n\nYes, here's NT91: NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. And then, NT6 is defined as NT19 NT71, and NT17 is 't24'. But then, NT91 would produce NT6 (which is NT19 NT71) and NT17 (t24), which would lead to t24 and more non-terminals.\n\nWait, this doesn't immediately produce t91. So perhaps 't91' is not generated by NT91. Maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for each token in the string and see if they can be generated by some NT.\n\nLooking at 't91' first. Let's see if any rule produces 't91'. Looking through all the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 NT19 NT71, but that's still NTs. NT17 \u2192 't24', NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17, but no direct terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's check all the rules. For example, NT91 appears to be a non-terminal because it's on the left side of a rule. The same with NTE91's rule: NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17.\n\nBut in the provided rules, the last lines have many non-terminals mapping to 't...' terminals, like NT15 \u2192 't154', NT16 \u2192 't112', NT71 \u2192 't69', etc. So perhaps some NTs produce terminals, like NT16 \u2192 't112' and NT6 \u2192 't91'?\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't145' ? Wait, let me look: No, NT68 \u2192 't145' doesn't seem to exist. Let me check again.\n\nWait, here's a list of some rules:\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n\nNT107 \u2192 NT65 NT71\n\nAnd other rules, but nowhere do I see NT6 generating a terminal like 't91'. Wait, actually, looking at the provided rules, I don't see any NT producing 't91' as a terminal. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

{"custom_id":"request-885","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which can go to two terminals or non-terminals. Let me see if that's right.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89. Each of these NT symbols is a non-terminal, right? And each production is broken down into pairs like NT15 -> NT75 NT57, and so on. And at the bottom, some of these NT symbols directly produce strings of 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT7 -> 't21' and NT16 -> 't54', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of t followed by numbers. The string starts with t108, then t101, t130, and so on, ending with t98. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the string from left to right, trying to match each part against the grammar's productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's efficient to use the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do a simpler approach here because the string is relatively short.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol S is NT99 followed by NT89. So the entire string must be derivable from NT99 producing something and NT89 producing something else. Wait, wait. No, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so S is split into NT99 and NT89. So the string should be the concatenation of a string derived from NT99 and a string derived from NT89.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t108 t101 t130 t0... So, the entire string is the result of replacing S with NT99 NT89, which gives us two parts: the first part comes from NT99, and the second from NT89.\n\nI need to check if the entire string can be derived by NT99 and NT89 each contributing their part.\n\nLooking at the terminals, let's see which non-terminals can produce which parts. Let's list all the NT symbols that go directly to 't' strings (I'll assume 't' is just a literal symbol, like in many grammar problems) or eventually lead to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT99 can produce 't103' and 't103' can produce 't6' and 't107'. Wait, but that's a long path. Alternatively, some NT symbols immediately yield certain 't...' strings.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for symbols in the grammar that produce 't' strings.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't21'\n- NT16 -> 't54'\n- NT29 -> 't36' and 't156'\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n- NT12 -> 't80'\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT39 -> 't144', 't23'\n- NT68 -> 't134'\n- NT29 -> 't129'\n- NT81 -> 't71'\n- NT9 -> 't41'\n- NT33 -> 't23', 't80'\n- NT68 -> 't145'\n- NT107 -> 't94', etc.\n\nAlso, there are other NT terms with 't' like:\n\n- NT11 -> 't17'\n- NT76 -> 't178'\n- NT42 -> 't139'\n- NT45 -> 't98'\n- NT2 -> 't26'\n- NT77 -> 't56', 't124', etc.\n\nHmm, this is quite a mix, and some 't's are long but some look direct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can approach this by trying to split the string into two parts: one generated by NT99 and one by NT89.\n\nLet's see if the entire string can be divided into two such substrings.\n\nThe first symbol is t108, so it must come from NT99. The second symbol is t101. Let me check if these can be part of NT99 and NT89, respectively.\n\nLooking at NT99's rules: I don't see a direct rule for NT99, but maybe NT99 can break down into other NTs which eventually produce 't'...s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the rules for NT99 and NT89.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT99 NT89, so S's replacements are combinations of NT99 and NT89 each replacing to a string of terminals.\n\nSo I should try to see if the entire string can be split into two parts: a part that comes from NT99 and a part that comes from NT89, in order.\n\nSo let me take the given string and see if I can split it such that the first part is generated by NT99, ending at some point, and the second part is generated by NT89.\n\nLooking at the string: t108 t101 t130 t0 t76 t11 t97 t11 t71 t177 t91 t101 t94 t71 t91 t101 t0 t159 t21 t174 t93 t67 t108 t144 t156 t24 t158 t130 t156 t54 t21 t123 t98 t158 t98 t8 t98 t0 t157 t98 t123 t98 t23 t47 t67 t90 t178.\n\nThat's 44 tokens. So first, let's try to split this into two parts: assuming that NT99 generates the first part and NT89 the second part.\n\nLet's see if the string can be divided into two parts where each part is a concatenation of 't's matching the rules.\n\nFirst, let's check the first symbol: t108. Let's see if t108 is a terminal (if 't108' is directly produced by any NT).\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT69 -> 't1', as per the grammar: NT69 -> 't134'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, checking NT69: is there an NT69 rule? Let me see the given rules.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see NT69 directly producing any 't's, but is any other NT pointing to t134 or other?\n\nWait, in the given rules, we have:\n\n- NT9 -> 't134'\n- NT76 -> 't178'\n\nWait, could NT69 produce t134? But I don't see that. So maybe NT99 can produce t108.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT99: I don't see any rule for NT99 on the left side; it's only listed as S -> NT99 NT89, but I don't see any rules for NT99 as the left side of a production. So wait, does that mean that NT99 can only be replaced by S? No, that can't be because S is the start symbol.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in the given grammar, S starts with NT99 and NT89. But the list of rules are all the non-terminals that are on the left side; perhaps I'm misreading it. But let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, no. The grammar is presented as a list of rules:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\n....\n\nOthers.\n\nSo in this context, all these NTs are non-terminals.\n\nBut when S is replaced by NT99 NT89, then NT99 must expand into a string of terminals, and likewise NT89 must also expand into a string of terminals. So to determine if the entire string can be derived, we need to see if the given string can be split into two parts: one derived from NT99 and one from NT89, with NT99's derivation matching the first part of the string and NT89's matching the second.\n\nNow, NT99, do any of its rules produce a string? Looking at the rules I see NT99 as S, so S's rule is the first, but for NT99, do any of the rules as left-hand sides produce other NT pairs? Let me look through the list.\n\nLooking at all rules, I don't see NT99 on the left side, so that would imply that NT99 cannot be broken down further. It must be a terminal, but in the given rules, it's used, but as a left side in S's production but nowhere else. Wait, that can't be right.

{"custom_id":"request-888","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the given string. The grammar consists of several production rules, each starting with a non-terminal symbol (like S, NT15, NT89, etc.) and producing two other non-terminal or terminal symbols. The string to evaluate is a sequence of production codes (tX, where X is a number), and I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the string starts with `t91 t101...` which are all these production codes. But in the grammar, the productions have the form NTxy -> NTa NTb, except some which produce terminals like 't24'. So, actually, the string is a sequence of these terminals ('t' followed by numbers), which correspond to the direct derivations in the grammar.\n\nNow, the goal is to see if each part of the string can be derived by the grammar. So, perhaps the best strategy is to try to parse the string starting from the beginning, applying the grammar rules step by step, without any lookaheads\u2014basically performing a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try to outline how this might work. The string is a series of tokens, each like 't91', 't101', etc. Each of these corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. For example, 't91 t101 t110...' might correspond to a series of steps where each 't' is an intermediate or final symbol.\n\nBut wait, looking closer at the grammar, some productions produce terminals. For example, NT1->'t107', so 't107' is a terminal. Similarly, NT17->'t22', and so on. So, each time a NT non-terminal expands, it can produce two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. So, for the grammar, the strings generated are structured such that the terminals appear in sequences that trace back to the initial symbols through the productions.\n\nSince the given string is a concatenation of terminals, each step of derivation must replace a non-terminal with a terminal and\/or another non-terminal, but always in a way that the leftmost non-terminal is replaced first.\n\nLet me try to consider the entire string:\n\n`t91 t101 t110 t72 t48 t134 t101 t65 t36 t158 t98 t151 t76 t94 t174 t171 t41 t91 t71 t171 t169 t146 t144 t98 t50 t101 t165 t98 t157 t98 t0 t151 t108 t115 t94 t72 t156 t108 t101 t104 t91 t101 t108 t101 t69 t69 t178`\n\nThat's quite a long string, over 50 tokens. Each token is a terminal, which could be either a result of a single replacement or part of a chain.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parsing problem. Each token must be the result of a non-terminal expansion, either by itself (a terminal production) or by being the first or second part of a production.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, the only non-terminal productions that produce terminals are those like NT1->'t107', NT17->'t22', etc. The rest seem to produce non-terminals. So, every time a non-terminal is replaced, it's either replaced by two non-terminals (like NT15->NT75 NT57) or by a terminal and a non-terminal (like NT7->'t21 NT9'), or both.\n\nGiven that, the entire string must be composed of a series of such terminals and non-terminals, where each non-terminal in the string is derived from a higher-level non-terminal. Since we're dealing with a leftmost derivation, we can only replace the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nBut this string is composed entirely of terminals, so each of these 't's must be either the result of a direct production (as in the grammar, NT1->'t107') or part of a chain where each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and so on, until we hit a terminal.\n\nWait, that might be a bit complex. Perhaps a better way is to recognize that in the given string, every 't' is a terminal that must correspond to a production that directly produces that token.\n\nBut since the grammar has multiple non-terminals, each with their own productions, it's necessary to see if the sequence can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of production steps. Each production adds two tokens. So, let's count the tokens:\n\nThe given string has tokens: t91, t101, t110, t72, t48, t134, t101, t65, t36, t158, t98, t151, t76, t94, t174, t171, t41, t91, t71, t171, t169, t146, t144, t98, t50, t101, t165, t98, t157, t98, t0, t151, t108, t115, t94, t72, t156, t108, t101, t104, t91, t101, t108, t101, t69, t69, t178. That's 48 tokens. That's 24 pairs of non-terminals, so the entire string must be generated through 24 derivations, starting from the initial symbol S.\n\nWait, but S is the top symbol, and in the given grammar, S starts the production:\n\nS -> NT99 NT99.\n\nSo, the initial step is replacing S with NT99 NT99, which would each then produce their own derivations. Each NT99 would then produce something, which could be terminals or non-terminals, and so on.\n\nNow, the entire string must be a single derivation path starting from S and ending in a string of terminals. Since the string is all terminals, each non-terminal in it must have been eventually replaced by a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut considering that the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, except for when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So, each non-terminal must, step by step, expand into terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, productions are of the form A->BC or A->a. So, when a non-terminal A is replaced by two non-terminals, each of those can themselves be replaced, and so on. So, the entire string is a sequence of all the terminals generated through such replacements.\n\nGiven that the string has 48 tokens, perhaps the derivation has 24 steps, each replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, but I'm not sure since some replacements might replace a non-terminal with a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the process of reducing the string back to the initial symbol S, using the productions in reverse.\n\nLet me try a top-down approach. The initial symbol is S, which produces NT99 NT99. So, the string should be a concatenation of the derivations of two instances of NT99. Now, each NT99 must expand into some string of terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT99: I don't actually see any productions for NT99 in the given grammar. So that's confusing. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT15, NT89, etc., but not NT99. So, if the initial production is S->NT99 NT99, but there are no productions for NT99, then this would not be possible. Therefore, the given string cannot be generated because it starts with S->NT99 NT99, and there's no way for NT99 to generate any terminals. All NT99's must expand into nothing else, which would require NT99 to be a start symbol with no productions, which isn't the case here. So, that suggests that the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The initial S is replaced by NT99 NT99. Since S is now gone, and we have two NT99 non-terminals. If there are no productions for NT99, then each of those NT99 would"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-907","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string that I need to check whether it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is quite extensive, with multiple non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, each of which corresponds to a symbol in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in CNF, meaning each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and right-hand sides, or a single non-terminal producing two non-terminals. This structure makes it easier to parse using a CYK algorithm, but since I'm just checking for derivations, I can try a bottom-up approach or see if each token can be built step by step.\n\nThe string provided is long and consists of various tokens like t91, t101, t121, etc. I observe that several of these tokens are present in the productions. For instance, t91 appears as a terminal in some productions, such as NT75 \u2192 t98 t18, but looking at the string, t91 is also present. Hmm, wait, no, the string includes t91: looking back, the string is \"t91 t101 t154 t21 t139 t130 t0 t104 t0 t0 t76 t171 t41 t94 t72 t21 t65 t91 t101 t121 t157 t146 t0 t177 t0 t94 t67 t130 t94 t0 t159 t26 t151 t146 t98 t69 t101 t0 t158 t98 t91 t63 t121\".\n\nI notice that t91 appears multiple times, so I need to figure out how it could be generated. Looking at the grammar, for production NT7, it's NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9. But wait, looking back, the actual grammar rules: I should systematically list all the productions to see which ones produce t91. Checking the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134'\n- NT39 \u2192 't144'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134'\n- NT29 \u2192 't129'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41'\n- NT76 \u2192 't178'\n- NT65 \u2192 't105'\n- NT65 \u2192 't8' \u2014 this might be a typo? Wait, the production NT65: in the given grammar, I see a rule NT65 \u2192 't105', another as NT65 \u2192 't8'? That can't be right because each non-terminal can only have one production. Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT65 appears twice:\n\nNT65 -> NT49 NT88, NT65 -> 't8'\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Each production must be strictly defined. Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nAfter scanning, I see multiple entries for NT65:\n\nWait, the grammar provided is a list of lines, perhaps with possible typographical errors. Let me list out some lines:\n\n- NT96 -> NT33 NT36\n- NT12 -> NT91 NT69\n- NT40 -> NT33 NT64\n- NT93 -> NT15 NT77\n- NT96 -> NT1 NT108\n- NT61 -> NT84 NT44\n- NT106 -> NT35 NT107\n- NT35 -> NT68 NT103\n- NT44 -> NT24 NT88\n- NT52 -> NT70 NT52\n- NT84 -> NT68 NT11\n- NT91 -> NT6 NT17\n- NT75 -> NT95 NT18\n- NT19 -> NT74 NT46\n- NT75 -> NT98 NT18 \u2014 Wait, that can't be right because NT75 can't have two different productions in CNF. Similarly, other rules might have issues.\n\nWait, perhaps some rules are supposed to produce terminals but were mistyped. For example, looking for where t is used:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156'\n- NT29 \u2192 't129'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134'\n- NT39 \u2192 't144'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134'\n- NT29 \u2192 't129'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT9 \u2192 't41'\n- NT76 \u2192 't178'\n- NT65 \u2192 't105'\n- NT65 \u2192 't8' \u2014 This seems incorrect. Probably, one of these two should be another production, but in CNF, each non-terminal has exactly one production leading to two others or a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps the intended productions are:\n\nNT65 -> t105\n\nAnother line:\n\nNT65 -> t8\n\nBut that can't be both. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT65 is defined as:\n\nNT65 -> NT49 NT88\n\nand somewhere else NT65 -> 't8'\n\nThis seems contradictory. Maybe in the provided grammar, it's a mistake, and perhaps one of these is supposed to be a terminal. Alternatively, I need to check more carefully.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of analysis, I can assume that some of these might produce terminals that appear in the string. Looking at the string, I see t91, t101, t154, etc. Let's focus on t91.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the rule NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. But in the string, I have t91 somewhere. So how is t91 derived? It would require that NT91 is expanded into 't91'. Looking through the grammar, I can check if any non-terminal directly produces 't91'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't91' as a terminal. Scanning each line, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156', 't129'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134', 't41'\n- NT39 \u2192 't144', 't129'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134', 't110'\n- NT29 \u2192 't81'\n- NT81 \u2192 't71'\n- NT9 \u2192 't169'\n- NT19 \u2192 't99', 't97'\n- NT84 \u2192 't17', and in another rule, 't0'\n- NT64 \u2192 't24'\n- NT17 \u2192 't22'\n- NT88 \u2192 't141'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT76 \u2192 't178'\n- NT65 \u2192 't105', 't8'\n- NT71 \u2192 't69', 't50'\n- NT70 \u2192 't162', 't73'\n- NT73 \u2192 't156', 't70', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread NT91: Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see ND91 is a non-terminal, and the production is NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17. So it's derived from non-terminals NT6 and NT17.\n\nLooking for NT6: in the grammar, lines like:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the definition for NT6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT16: let's see:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't112'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n\n- NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18\n\n- NT107 \u2192 NT7 NT92\n\nSo perhaps NT6 isn't directly defined.

{"custom_id":"request-911","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's in the language generated by this grammar. Hmm, the grammar uses symbols like S, NT15, NT89, etc., and the string is a sequence of tokens like \"t91\", \"t101\", etc.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is either two terminals or two non-terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal, except that in this case, I see some terminals like 't24', 't26', etc. Wait, in the production rules, I notice some rules like NT17 \u2192 't24' and others, which seem to have terminals as right-hand sides. That's a bit confusing because in Chomsky normal form, all productions should be between non-terminals, but some here have a mix. Maybe the grammar isn't exact CNF, or perhaps it's a slightly different form. Well, the user said it's in Chomsky normal form, so I have to go with that.\n\nNow, the string to check is a series of tokens, all of which are 't' followed by a number. Looking at the string: `t91 t101 t139 t130 t0 t177 t0 t151 t146 t23 t96 t98 t172 t56 t139 t130 t144 t2 t76 t13 t104 t108 t101 t139 t130 t21 t94 t93 t145 t101 t139 t130 t2 t177 t2 t105 t98 t0 t105 t98 t2 t157 t98 t0 t50 t69 t65 t24`. \n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of tokens created by applying the grammar's productions step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. Each production in the grammar either combines two non-terminals or produces a single terminal. So, to check if the string is derivable, I need to see if it can be built up by expanding the non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol, S. The production for S is NT99 NT89, so S expands into two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89.\n\nFrom the grammar, we can see that NT99 and NT89 are non-terminals that can eventually produce terminals. For example, NT99 \u2192 NT6 and NT103, which further breaks down into NT71 and NT103, and so on. Similarly, NT89 \u2192 NT44 and NT1, which eventually leads to 't24' or other terminals.\n\nBut directly expanding this might take a long time, and since the string is quite long, it's impractical to do manually. Instead, maybe I can look for certain terminals that are at the end of the string and see if there are corresponding production rules that can generate them.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't91'. Let me check if there's a production for NT91. From the given rules, I see NT91 \u2192 't164'. So, 't91' corresponds to the terminal t164, which is acceptable.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, I see NT91 \u2192 't164'. So, in the string, if there's 't91', that would need to come from NT91. But wait, in the given rules, the production is NT91 \u2192 't164', which is a single production. Hmm, that can't be right because in Chomsky normal form, each production must be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the right-hand side must be a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nBut looking at the given rules, I notice for example NT91 \u2192 't164', which is a single terminal. So, that's acceptable. So, in that case, 't91' would correspond to NT91's production, which produces 't164'. So, 't91' is correct as it comes directly from the production NT91 \u2192 't164'.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, I don't see NT91. Let me look again. Yes, in the rules, I see \"NT91 \u2192 't164'\". So, okay, 't91' is correct.\n\nNext, the second token is 't101'. Looking for a production that can produce 't101'. In the rules, I see NT101 \u2192 't130'. So, NT101 directly produces 't130'. So, 't101' must come from NT101 \u2192 't130'. So, that's acceptable.\n\nThird token: 't139'. Checking for 't139'. In the rules, NT139 \u2192 't145'. So, NT139 produces 't145'. So, 't139' must come from NT139 \u2192 't145'. So, that's correct.\n\nFourth token: 't130'. NT130 is in the rules? Looking through the rules, yes, NT130 \u2192 't48'. So, 't130' comes from NT130 \u2192 't48'. Acceptable.\n\nNext, 't0'. Is there a production for NT0? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT0. Wait, perhaps it's a terminal symbol. So 't0' would just be a terminal, which is allowed. So, that's fine.\n\nContinuing this way, for each token, I need to check if it corresponds to a terminal production from some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe this is taking too long. Alternatively, maybe I can find the start symbol and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the entire string must be a leftmost derivation where each non-terminal breaks down into smaller parts until we reach terminals.\n\nBut manually checking this for a string of 47 tokens would be quite tedious. Maybe I can look for specific patterns.\n\nWait, another approach is to build a parse tree for the given string and see if it parses according to the grammar. But without the actual parse tree, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the tokens that can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT99 NT89. So, the string starts with the expansions of NT99 and NT89.\n\nFrom the rules, NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103, and NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1. Then NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88, and NT1 \u2192 't24'. NT24 \u2192 't123', so NT89 would eventually become 't24'.\n\nWait, but let me think step by step.\n\nLet's build the string by expanding S:\n\nS \u2192 NT99 NT89.\n\nExpand NT99: NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103.\n\nExpand NT6: NT6 \u2192 't91'.\n\nExpand NT103: NT103 \u2192 NT52 NT107.\n\nExpand NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70.\n\nExpand NT28: NT28 \u2192 't76'.\n\nExpand NT70: NT70 \u2192 't67'.\n\nSo, NT52 \u2192 't76' 't67'.\n\nSo, NT103 \u2192 't76' 't67' NT107.\n\nNow, expand NT107: NT107 \u2192 't177' 't2' (from NT107 \u2192 't177 NT2')? Wait, looking at the rules: I see NT107 \u2192 't177' 't16'. Wait, looking at the rules, it's \"NT107 \u2192 't177'\"? Wait, let me check the given rules carefully.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\nNT107 \u2192 't65', etc. Wait, actually, I see lines like:\n\"NT61 \u2192 't55'\", etc.\n\nWait, let me look for NT107. Looking through the rules, I see \"NT107 \u2192 't94' \" and \"NT107 \u2192 't177'\". Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n\"NT107 \u2192 't177'\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT61 \u2192 't55' NT64\"\n\nHmm, so in the grammar, NT107 can produce 't177' directly.

The grammar has a mix of non-terminals and terminals, which will appear in the string as well.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols, many of which are t followed by a number, like t91, t101, etc. These t... are probably terminals generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the productions (rules) and look for any non-terminals that must appear in the string if it's generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT99 NT89\n- NT15 \u2192 NT75 NT57\n- NT81 \u2192 NT55 NT23\n- NT84 \u2192 NT1 NT65\n- NT73 \u2192 NT83 NT70\n- NT40 \u2192 NT39 NT35\n- NT52 \u2192 NT28 NT70\n- NT89 \u2192 NT61 NT76\n- NT73 \u2192 NT6 NT39\n- NT64 \u2192 NT100 NT93\n- NT80 \u2192 NT67 NT73\n- NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT103\n- NT68 \u2192 NT45 NT71\n- NT106 \u2192 NT35 NT107\n- NT39 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n- NT7 \u2192 NT21 NT9\n- NT48 \u2192 NT106 NT31\n- NT96 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n- NT12 \u2192 NT91 NT69\n- NT40 \u2192 NT33 NT64\n- NT93 \u2192 NT15 NT77\n- NT96 \u2192 NT1 NT108\n- NT61 \u2192 NT84 NT44\n- NT106 \u2192 NT7 NT92\n- NT92 \u2192 NT74 NT18\n- NT35 \u2192 NT40 NT105\n- NT44 \u2192 NT24 NT88\n- NT52 \u2192 NT70 NT52\n- NT84 \u2192 NT68 NT11\n- NT91 \u2192 NT6 NT17\n- NT33 \u2192 NT80 NT23\n- NT83 \u2192 NT15 NT2\n- NT54 \u2192 NT42 NT75\n- NT11 \u2192 NT81 NT29\n- NT92 \u2192 NT52 NT99\n- NT61 \u2192 NT19 NT71\n- NT65 \u2192 NT106 NT71\n- NT71 \u2192 NT80 NT42\n- NT19 \u2192 NT74 NT46\n- NT75 \u2192 NT95 NT18\n- NT18 \u2192 NT35 NT43\n- NT61 \u2192 NT93 NT80\n- NT24 \u2192 NT54 NT65\n- NT1 \u2192 NT107 NT17\n- NT31 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n- NT99 \u2192 NT6 NT103\n- NT89 \u2192 NT44 NT1\n- NT52 \u2192 NT107 NT81\n- NT35 \u2192 NT43 NT52\n- NT77 \u2192 NT95 NT65\n- NT70 \u2192 NT102 NT92\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT12\n- NT105 \u2192 NT24 NT45\n- NT102 \u2192 NT48 NT49\n- NT77 \u2192 NT35 NT96\n- NT23 \u2192 NT40 NT107\n- NT17 \u2192 't24'\n- NT16 \u2192 't93'\n- NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't15'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134'\n- NT39 \u2192 't144'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134'\n- NT29 \u2192 't129' (though also defined as NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't15')\nWait, this seems confusing. NT29 can be either 't156' or 't15' or 't29'? Or maybe some of these are typo? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice some possible inconsistencies or ambiguities. For example, in the initial list, I see NT29 \u2192 't156' and NT29 \u2192 't15', but another line says NT29 \u2192 't129'. That might be an error. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't156'\n- NT29 \u2192 't15'\n- NT24 \u2192 't123'\n- NT12 \u2192 't80'\n- NT9 \u2192 't134'\n- NT39 \u2192 't144'\n- NT68 \u2192 't134'\n- NT29 \u2192 't129'\n\nSo, NT29 is defined three times: as 't156', 't15', and 't129'. That can't be correct. Maybe it's a typo. Similarly, NT29 was defined twice as 't156' and 't15', then again as 't129'. That needs to be clarified. Perhaps it's supposed to be that NT29 can produce any of those, or maybe one is incorrect.\n\nFor now, assuming that NT29 \u2192 't156' and 't15' are acceptable, but another rule may have an error. Maybe the third rule is a typo, perhaps meant to be NT29 \u2192 't129', but in any case, I'll proceed, making note of the possible ambiguity.\n\nNext, I'll look at the string. The string starts with t91, t101, t170, etc. I need to see if each symbol in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first few tokens: t91, t101, t170, t67, t130, t24, t101, t2, etc.\n\nI recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either generates a terminal or two non-terminals. So, the derivation would involve applying these rules step by step.\n\nLet's try to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to track the origin of each symbol in the string. Each time a non-terminal is used, it should expand into another non-terminal and then a terminal, or it should itself be a terminal.\n\nBut since this string has many terminals, I need to see if their production paths are covered by the grammar.\n\nWait, the string includes terms like t91, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce t91.\n\nLooking back, NT91 \u2192 't169' according to one of the rules. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't169'\n\nYes, that's one of the rules. So NT91 expands to 't169', a terminal.\n\nIn the string, the second token is t101. Looking for which non-terminals produce 't101'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT101? Hmm, wait, in the given rules, the non-terminals that produce a 't' are some of the nt89, nt96, nt24, etc., but not directly seeing 't101'. Wait, in the provided rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't101'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait the string has 't101', but looking at the rules provided, perhaps I missed any rule that produces 't101'.\n\nLooking through the provided rules again.\n\n- NT89 \u2192 't60'\n- NT106 \u2192 't118'\n- NT81 \u2192 't8'\nWait, the NT15 \u2192 etc., but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't101'. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps NT101 isn't present in the rules, so I can think that the string contains 't101' but there's no non-terminal in our grammar that can produce it. That would mean the string can't be derived from the grammar, hence the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but I have to be careful. Maybe the rules allow 't101' through a chain somewhere. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, all the terminals are generated by non-terminals like NT24 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string I'm checking is: `t91 t101 t165 t130 t48 t110 t101 t165 t98 t63 t48 t134 t101 t94 t96 t170 t165 t130 t0 t162 t177 t2 t105 t98 t94 t69 t98 t2 t151 t146 t21 t65 t112 t21 t158 t130 t76 t80 t101 t0 t157 t98 t123 t98 t0 t50 t141 t174 t24`.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. In this grammar, the top symbol is 'S', and I need to see if through a series of derivations using these productions, the string can be formed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the productions either generate two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production ends with a terminal eventually, so the grammar generates strings of terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I can try to parse it step by step, checking each production and seeing if it can lead to the string. Alternatively, I can look for specific paths in the derivation tree that match the string.\n\nBut with such a long string, trying to do it manually might be tricky. Maybe I can look for patterns or known derivations. Alternatively, since the answer must be either 'Yes' or 'No', I can think of properties of the grammar that might affect the string.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in a CNF grammar, the number of steps to derive a string of length n is n-1. Here, the string has 72 tokens (each tX is a token). So the derivation would require 71 steps. Since the grammar seems to allow for a lot of branching, this isn't impossible, but it's not straightforward.\n\nPerhaps I can start by checking if all the terminal symbols in the string can be produced by the grammar. Looking at the productions, I see that for example, 't91' corresponds to the production NT100 \u2192 t61, wait, actually, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t21\n\nNT16 \u2192 t112\n\nNT29 \u2192 t156\n\nNT28 \u2192 t76\n\nNT100 \u2192 t127 (but wait, in the grammar, it's 'NT100 -> t127'? Or is that another symbol?)\n\nWait, looking carefully, the productions seem to sometimes have a mix of NT and t. Let me list some of the productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t107 t17\n- NT48 \u2192 t11\n- NT29 \u2192 t156, t129\n- NT35 \u2192 t68, t105, etc.\n- NT24 \u2192 t54, t65, etc.\n- NT91 \u2192 t164\n- NT102 \u2192 t48, t49\n- NT105 \u2192 t24, t45\n- NT68 \u2192 t145\n- NT76 \u2192 t45\n- NT65 \u2192 t157, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a table of all productions that produce a terminal. Let me list all the 'terminals' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nt1, t2, t57, t17, t24, t34, t100, t68, t14, t27, t81, t36, t92, t99, t52, t15, t146, t76, t67, t16, t112, t74, t54, t98, t139, t157, t77, t101, t42, t165, t70, t90, t133, t43, t96, t69, t108, t147, t94, t3, t171, t102, t116, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps not necessary to list all, but to note that each production ends with a terminal. So the string given must only consist of these terminal symbols. Looking at the string provided, all tokens are tX where X is a number. So perhaps each tX must correspond to some production.\n\nBut I'm not sure if all tX correspond to a production, but the grammar is given, and the string is composed of such terminals, perhaps each is produced by some NT. For example:\n\nLet me take a few terms:\n\nt91 \u2192 NT100 \u2192 t63 (from NT100 \u2192 t63)\n\nt101 \u2192 NT102 \u2192 t48 (from NT102 \u2192 t48)\n\nt165 \u2192 NT146 \u2192 t170 (from NT146? Wait, looking at the grammar, I need to check each production for the given tX.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, the productions are all in the form NTx \u2192 NTy Tz or Terminals. For example:\n\nS -> NT99 NT89\n\nNT15 -> NT75 NT57\n\nNT81 -> NT55 NT23\n\nAnd so on, with some productions ending in a terminal. For example:\n\nLooking for each t in the string:\n\nt91: Looking for a production that gives t91. Looking through the given productions, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t80, t145 (from NT68 -> NT45 NT71)\n\nBut I don't see a production for t91 directly. Wait, let's re-examine the given productions:\n\nLooking for t91, t101, etc.\n\nLooking at the given productions, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> t107 t17\n- NT24 -> t123\n- NT102 -> t48 t49\n- NT91 -> t164\n\nSo t91 is derived from NT91 \u2192 t164. Similarly, t101 must be derived from NT101, but wait, looking at the grammar, there's no NT101. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT101 is present. Let me check:\n\nIn the productions, I see:\n\nNT146 \u2192 t100 t51\n\nNT174 \u2192 t24\n\nNT98 \u2192 t69 t98 t2 (no, wait, no, looking again):\n\nWait, the given productions have for example:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t21 NT24\n\nAnd so on. Let me check for NT101:\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT107 t17\n- NT12 \u2192 NT91 t69\n- NT40 \u2192 NA, but looking specifically, NT40 \u2192 t21 (no, looking at the grammar, NT40 \u2192 t21? Let me check.\n\nWait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking for NT101: I don't see NT101 in the given productions. The user's provided grammar does not include NT101. That might be a problem because, in the string, we have t101, which would require some production for NT101.\n\nWait, checking the grammar: S -> NT99 NT89, and NT99 goes to NT6 NT103, and NT103 goes to NT24 t47 (from NT103 -> NT24 t47). So how is t101 being generated? Maybe I'm missing a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the given productions, I don't see any NT101. So in the grammar as given, there's no production that would generate NT101, which suggests that t101 is unreachable, which would mean that the string contains a symbol that can't be derived, making the entire string ungenerable by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, in the string, we have t101, so unless NT101 exists, it's impossible. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the list again, the productions are:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 t21\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t95 t65\n\nBut there's no NT101.

{"custom_id":"request-944","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It starts with S -> NT99 NT89, so the starting symbol is S which produces two non-terminals: NT99 and NT89. Each of these non-terminals then seems to break down further into other non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers like 't1', 't2', etc. Some of these non-terminals are terminal symbols though, like 't24' which directly correspond to specific numbers.\n\nMy goal is to check if the given string can be derived from this grammar. The string is: `t108 t101 t165 t130 t2 t13 t174 t71 t91 t101 t177 t2 t171 t41 t100 t2 t76 t171 t169 t100 t67 t108 t48 t67 t90 t171 t127 t90 t130 t105 t94 t24 t158 t98 t8 t98 t2 t34 t115 t100 t2 t104 t2 t2 t67 t90 t139 t141 t94 t24`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so the rest of the non-terminals need to be expanded into these.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a non-terminal to a single terminal. This structure suggests that each step of the derivation can be thought of as expanding non-terminals into pairs, potentially leading to a sequence of terminals when fully expanded.\n\nLet me try to analyze the string and see if it can be a result of this grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't108'. Looking at the grammar, several non-terminals like NT96, NT75, NT68, and others lead directly to 't108' or other terminals. Wait, no, actually, several non-terminals produce 't1' through 't178', as seen in the rules.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT52 -> NT24 NT75, and NT24 -> NT54 NT65, NT43 -> NT2 NT, etc. But looking for where terminals like 't108' appear.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some NT rules directly produce a 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\n- NT52 -> t158\n\nWait, no, checking all the rules, I see a few that produce a single 't' with a number. For example, NT77 -> NT65 NT71, and others. But are there any NT rules that directly produce a single 't'?\n\nLooking again, for example:\n\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n\nYes, NT17 directly becomes 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, I see:\n\n- NT49 -> 't115'\n\n- NT70 -> 't171'\n\nWait, let me make a list of which NT non-terminals directly produce a single 't' symbol:\n\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n\n- NT49 -> 't115'\n\n- NT15 -> 't154'\n\nWait, no, NT15's rule is NT15 -> 't90'\n\nWait, actually:\n\nNT17 -> 't24'\n\nNT42 -> 't158'\n\nNT21 -> 't171'\n\nNT43 -> 't2'\n\nNT77 -> 't56'\n\nWait, but this might not be correct because in the given grammar, some of the non-terminals have rules that end with a terminal directly. For example, NT96 -> NT105 NT1, but that might produce two terminals. Wait, no, I need to check each production.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT107 -> 't94'\n\nWait, no, according to the list:\n\nNT107-> NT35 NT107, which expands further. But looking for any NT rules that produce a single 't' as a terminal directly.\n\nLooking through the entire list, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nWait, let me scan through the entire list:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT24 -> 't123'\n\n- NT43 -> 't2'\n\n- NT28 -> 't76'\n\nWait, but those aren't directly in the rules as a single terminal. Wait, no, for instance, NT43 is 't2' because:\n\nLooking:\n\nNT43: From the list, search for NT43.\n\nWait, checking the list:\n\nLooking for NT43: Is there a rule that starts with NT43?\n\nAh, in the initial list, I see:\n\nWait, the list ends with NT11 -> 't17', and other rules have two non-terminals. Wait, now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is a list of all the productions. So each line is a production.\n\nLooking, for example:\n\n- NT17 -> 't24'\n\nYes, there's a production for NT17 directly producing 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, looking through all lines:\n\n- NT49 -> 't115'\n\n- NT15 -> 't90'\n\nWait, wait:\n\nLooking for any NT rule that directly produces a single 't' terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT17 -> 't24'\n\nYes.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT43 -> 't2' \n\nWait, that's not correct because looking for the production:\n\nWait, no, the lines are:\n\nLooking for NT42: Is there a production of NT42 that produces a single 't'?\n\nLooking:\n\nNT42 doesn't have a production; instead, many rules have two non-terminals. So NT42 doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list all the NT rules and see which ones directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production line:\n\n1. S -> NT99 NT89 (two non-terminals)\n2. NT15 -> NT21 NT91\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-946","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is a set of productions, each starting with a non-terminal and expanding into other non-terminals or terminals. The string given consists of a series of t-prefixed terms like 't91', 't101', etc. From the context, it seems that the grammar's rules map non-terminals to combinations of other non-terminals and terminals. However, looking more closely, I notice that many of the productions end with '-> 't...', meaning that some of these non-terminals produce terminal tokens (like 't103', 't11', etc.) rather than non-terminals. For example, NT96 -> NT105 -> NT33 NT36. Wait, actually, the productions are in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or one terminal. But in the provided grammar, most of the productions on the left are NT and the right side is two NTs. So, some of the NTs must be terminals, represented by the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo, the task is to derive the given string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the only way a string can be derived is as a sequence of terminals, each appearing as a unit at some point in the derivation.\n\nThe given string is: `t91 t101 t158 t130 t0 t76 t11 t115 t11 t97 t76 t151 t177 t91 t101 t151 t91 t71 t146 t63 t171 t127 t154 t56 t139 t130 t63 t23 t24 t174 t51 t170 t123 t98 t0 t105 t98 t0 t91 t101 t174 t72 t156 t91 t101 t0 t157 t69 t174 t24`.\n\nLet me break this down. Since all these are 't' followed by numbers, it suggests that the string is composed of terminal symbols, each being a 'tX', where X is a number.\n\nFirst, I need to construct the parse tree for this string or at least find an applicable derivation.\n\nBut given that there are 33 't's, the number of products must line up with the Chomsky derivation rules. From the grammar, each production can either expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a non-terminal into a terminal (if any).\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, all the rules are in the form of Non-Terminal -> NT something. For example, S->NT99 NT89, NT15->NT75 NT57, etc. So none of the NTs directly produce a terminal. Except, for example, NT7 -> 't21' is explicitly given as a production, so NT7 can produce t21 as a terminal. Similarly, other NTs might produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the leaf productions (terminations) are the ones where NT is mapped to a 't' followed by a number. For example:\n- NT7 -> t21\n- NT16 -> t112\n- NT17 -> t22\n- NT29 -> t156\n- NT103 -> t101\n- NT177 -> t177? No, wait, looking back, maybe I misread. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking for NT -> tX:\nYes, I see some, like NT43 -> t2, NT55 -> t72, NT68 -> t145, etc. But it's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, more systematically:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT7 -> t21 (terminal)\nNT16 -> t112 (terminal)\nNT17 -> t22 (terminal)\nNT29 -> t156 (terminal)\nNT29 -> t156\nAnd a couple others:\nNT52 -> t177\nNT77 -> t56\nNT76 -> t45\nNT74 -> t146\nNT71 -> t69\nNT70 -> t162\nNT75 -> t98\nNT88 -> t69\nNT46 -> t99\nNT39 -> t48\nNT96 -> t91\nNT42 -> t139\nNT69 -> t1\nNT76 -> t121\nNT46 -> t105\nNT28 -> t76\nNT67 -> t67\nNT91 -> t9\nNT31 -> t121\nNT49 -> t97\nNT55 -> t72\nNT107 -> t65\n\nLooking at these, certain NTs directly produce terminals by mapping to a single 'tN'. For example, NT7 -> t21, so any derivation that reaches NT7 can produce 't21' as a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT16 is t112, etc. So, these are the bottom symbols in the grammar.\n\nNow, the string to derive is a series of these t-terms. So the idea is that each 'tX' in the string must be generated by the grammar. The question then becomes: can the grammar derive a string where each token is one of the t-terms listed above?\n\nBut wait, in the production rules, we can have either two NTs or a terminal. So, each step in the derivation can produce one terminal, but in the case of two NTs, the string is built from the expansions of these.\n\nWait, that's incorrect. In Chomsky normal form, each production leads to either two NTs or a terminal. The process builds the entire string by expanding NTs into other non-terminals until terminals are produced. Therefore, the entire string must be a sequence of terminals built by expanding non-terminals step by step, combining via their rules.\n\nSo, the string is a leftmost derivation. Therefore, every 'tX' must be a terminal that is generated by a production rule, i.e., an NT directly producing tX.\n\nLooking at the given string, every token is a 'tX' with some X. Now, let's check if each 'tX' corresponds to a production where that NT is mapped to tX.\n\nLooking through each token:\n\n1. t91: Is there a production for NT91? Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT91 -> tX, so no.\n\nThat's a problem because if 't91' appears, there must be a production NT91 -> t91. But checking the grammar, I don't see such a production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the productions under NT91:\n\nNo, I don't see any NT91 -> 't...' in the grammar. So 't91' cannot be generated by the given grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be produced by this grammar.\n\nBut before I conclude, let me cross-verify this.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some of the productions include NT107 -> t94, which means NT107 produces 't94'. Or NT91 -> t9 something else?\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> t21\n- NT16 -> t112\n- NT17 -> t22\n- NT29 -> t156\n- NT52 -> t177 (Wait: NT52 has two rules? Let me check.)\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT52 has two rules:\n\nNT52 -> NT39 NT35\n\nand\n\nNT52 -> NT107 NT81\n\nSo, this seems to contradict the Chomsky normal form, which should have each production being either two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, some rules for NT52 produce two NTs, which is correct. But looking at whether any NT52 can produce a terminal, I don't see any NT52 -> tX in the grammar. Therefore, perhaps the rules are not correctly in CNF.\n\nWait, no, actually some productions may have terminals, as per the grammar provided. Let's check again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nFor example: NT43 -> t2, so that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT96 -> t91\n\nWait, yeah, it's present. So, NT68 -> t134?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT68 -> t134 in some cases and another production, perhaps a different one, does it?\n\nWait, looking for all NTs that have a t in their production. So, let's list all NTs that produce a tX:\n\n- NT7 -> t21\n- NT29 -> t156 in two cases? No, the first is NT29 -> NT45 NT103, and then"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
