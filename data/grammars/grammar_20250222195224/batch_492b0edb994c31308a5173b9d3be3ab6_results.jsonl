{"custom_id":"request-2","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t535\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It looks like all the non-terminals (like S, NT9, NT226, etc.) are defined in terms of other non-terminals, and eventually, some non-terminals are replaced with terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). So it's a CFG in CNF, which is helpful because that means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThe target string is \"t535\". My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions until I get to the string of terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. That's two non-terminals on each side. But the input string is only a single 't' followed by 535. So for me to end up with just 't535', I need to see if one of the non-terminals on either side of S can be derived into nothing, leaving the other side to produce \"t535\".\n\nWait, let me think. S is producing NT487 and NT993. So the string I get will be the concatenation of what NT487 generates and what NT993 generates. Since the input string is \"t535\", which is only one terminal, I must consider that one of the non-terminals might derive into \"t535\" and the other might derive into an empty string? But wait, in this context, I don't have a rule for an empty string because all productions have at least a terminal on the right side. So it's more about how the non-terminals are broken down.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each non-terminal is either replaced by two other non-terminals or some are replaced by terminals. For example, NT487 has two productions: one to NT103 and NT486, another to NT933 and NT389. Similarly, NT933 might produce something.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up which non-terminals directly produce 't's. Let me scan through the productions:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n- NT588 \u2192 NT195 NT588 (Wait, that seems like a loop, maybe a mistake. Oh, no, it's correct. So 588 can only go to 195 and 588 again? Or maybe it's a typo, I think it's supposed to be NT588 \u2192 NT195 NT588, but that would allow infinite loops. Hmm, but in practice, maybe 588 doesn't produce anything useful beyond that.)\n\nAlso, look at NT990 \u2192 NT367 NT591, and NT367 \u2192 NT30, which produces nothing\u2014wait, no, looking at it, NT367 \u2192 NT30, which must be a terminal since NT30 is replaced by 't555' according to the rules.\n\nWait, hold on: NT367 is supposed to produce 't30'. Because in the productions, NT367 \u2192 NT30. So is 't30' a terminal? Because NT30 is a non-terminal, but wait, no, looking again, the productions for NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951. But wait, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT226 \u2192 't98'? Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example: NT946 \u2192 't131'. So, NT946 directly produces the terminal string t131. Similarly, NT588 \u2192 't37', NT256 \u2192 't98', etc.\n\nSo, NT226 has two productions: one is NT226 \u2192 NT446 NT226 (wait, that seems like a recursive rule that would just loop), but wait, no, looking back, let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, wait, in the productions given:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n- NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\n- NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\n- NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\n- NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\n- NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\n- NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n- NT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n- NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT591 \u2192 't804'\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n- NT588 \u2192 't37'\n- NT946 \u2192 't131'\n- NT195 \u2192 't278'\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT60 \u2192 't573'\n- NT347 \u2192 't593'\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\n- NT409 \u2192 't555'\n- NT368 \u2192 't237'\n- NT399 \u2192 't372'\n- NT673 \u2192 't848'\n- NT217 \u2192 't592' (Wait, this is the same NT217 as before?)\n- NT951 \u2192 't14'\n- NT486 \u2192 't363'\n- NT894 \u2192 't892'\n- NT993 \u2192 't444'\n- NT588 \u2192 't535' (Ah!

Wait, in the given grammar, under NT588: It's written as \"NT588 -> 't37'\". No, wait. Let me go through each line correctly.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLines starting with NT588: \"NT588 -> 't37'\" So NT588 directly produces 't37'.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I look at NT588 \u2192 't37', that's a terminal, but sometimes in these grammars, a non-terminal that has a production to itself would create an infinite loop, but in this case, since NT588 can produce a terminal, it's a good production.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait, looking at NT588: The line is \"NT588 -> 't37'\". So NT588 can produce 't37' (a terminal), but that's it? Or is it that NT588 can also produce another non-terminal? Let me check the lines again.

Then, each non-terminal (like NT487, NT993, etc.) seems to break down into two other non-terminals until they reach terminals, which are the letters like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSince the string we're checking is \"t237\", that's a terminal symbol.

So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. Scanning through the rules, I don't see any production rule where one of the non-terminals directly becomes 't237'.

Maybe a non-terminal that can be split into parts that contribute to 't237'? Or perhaps 't237' is part of a larger non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if any production leads to 't237' as a part of a larger string that then gets processed.

Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, take NT487 -> NT103 NT486.\n\nNow, NT103: Let's see its production.\n\nLooking for NT103 in the grammar:\n\n- NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\nSo NT103 -> NT673 NT964.\n\nNow, NT673: Looking for NT673 in the productions.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT673 -> 't848'\n\nSo NT673 directly becomes \"t848\".\n\nSo from NT103, we get NT673 NT964.\n\nNow, NT964: Let's find its production.\n\nLooking for NT964:\n\n- NT964 -> 't555'\n\nSo NT964 becomes \"t555\".\n\nSo the expansion of NT487 -> NT103 NT486 would become:\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964, which becomes \"t848\" \"t555\".\n\nSo the first part, NT487, would produce \"t848 t555\" if this path is taken.\n\nBut we need to end up with \"t804 t467\". So this path leads us to tokens \"t848\" and \"t555\", which don't match our desired tokens. So maybe this path isn't useful. Let's switch to the other option.\n\nTake NT487 -> NT933 NT389.\n\nNow, NT933: Let's look at the production.\n\nLooking for NT933:\n\n- NT933 -> NT217.\n\nSo NT933 directly becomes NT217, which we know expands to \"t467\".\n\nThen, NT389: Let's see, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT389 -> NT569 NT756.\n\nSo NT389 -> NT569 NT756.\n\nNow, NT569 and NT756 need to be expanded.\n\nNT569: Looking for NT569 in the productions.\n\n- NT569 -> NT195 NT588.\n\nSo NT569 -> NT195 NT588.\n\nNT195: Let's see, NT195 -> 't278' directly.\n\nNT588: Looking for NT588's production.\n\n- NT588 -> 't37'.\n\nSo NT569 becomes NT195 NT588, which is \"t278\" \"t37\".\n\nNow, NT756: Let's see where that goes.\n\nLooking for NT756:\n\n- NT756 -> NT256 NT833.\n\nSo NT756 -> NT256 NT833.\n\nNT256: Let's see, NT256's production.\n\n- NT256 -> NT60 NT446.\n\nSo NT256 -> NT60 NT446.\n\nNT60: Looking for NT60.\n\nIn production:\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t777 t466\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a standard form for context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. This means that to generate the string, we'll have to expand S into NT487 and NT993. \n\nNow, looking at the non-terminals, I see that NT487 and NT993 are non-terminals that eventually resolve into terminal strings. So, each of these should eventually produce some terminal symbols. \n\nStarting with NT487: its production rules are:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nThen, I'll check what NT103 and NT933 produce. \n\nFor NT103: its production is NT673 NT964. Both NT673 and NT964 have terminal strings:\n- NT673 \u2192 't673'\n- NT964 \u2192 't964'. So, expanding NT103 gives 't673 t964'. \n\nFor NT486: according to the rules, NT486 \u2192 't363'. So, NT487 can be expanded in two ways:\n1. NT487 \u2192 (t673 t964) (t363)\n2. NT487 \u2192 (t933) (t389)\n\nWait, I need to check what NT933 and NT389 produce. NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT368, and NT368 is a terminal 't372'. NT217 also has a production that eventually becomes a terminal. Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking back, NT368 \u2192 't372'. But wait, in the given rules, NT368 is written as NT368 in one rule and as another NT368 in another rule? Wait no, let's check again. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT368 \u2192 't363' in another rule, no. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n- NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT591 \u2192 't804'\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT368\n- NT368 \u2192 't372'\n- NT588 \u2192 't535'\n- NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT368 (same as above)\n- NT673 \u2192 't673'\n- NT964 \u2192 't964'\n\nSo, for NT487, if we take the first production, it becomes NT103 (which is t673 t964) and NT486 (which is t363). So, when expanded, NT487 would produce t673 t964 t363. Wait, but in the given string, the first part is t777, which is not part of this expansion. So maybe the other expansion of NT487 is where we go?\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. Now, let's see what NT933 and NT389 produce.\n\nNT933 \u2192 NT217 NT368. NT217 is a non-terminal that eventually expands to a terminal. Looking at the rules, NT217 \u2192 't592' and NT368 \u2192 't372'. So NT933 expands to 't592' 't372' (wait, no, NT933's production is NT217 NT368, so when NT933 is fully expanded, it's t592 followed by t372. So NT933 \u2192 t592 t372.\n\nThen, NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756. Let's check NT569 and NT756. \n\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588. NT195 \u2192 't278', NT588 \u2192 't535'. So NT569 \u2192 t278 t535.\n\nNT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833. NT256 \u2192 NT60 NT446. NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226. \n\nWait, let me break that down:\n\nNT256 \u2192 NT60 (which is a terminal 't637') and NT446 (which is NT636 NT226). NT636 \u2192 't777', so that gives t777. Then NT226 \u2192 nt399 and nt368.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by starting from S and trying to see if the string can be generated.\n\nThe string is 't777 t466'. \n\nBut looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the generated string is the concatenation of what NT487 and NT993 expand to.\n\nSo, the total string will be the expansion of NT487 followed by NT993, each expanded to their terminal strings.\n\nSo, if the string is 't777 t466', each part must be the expansion of NT487 and NT993 respectively, or vice versa. Wait, no: the order is fixed because S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the expansion will be NT487's expansion + NT993's expansion.\n\nSo, one possibility is that the string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT487 and the expansion of NT993. So, the string should be two parts: part1 from NT487 and part2 from NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487's possible expansions:\n\nOption 1: NT103 NT486 \u2192 which expands to t673 t964 (from NT103) and t363 (from NT486). So, combined, it's t673 t964 t363.\n\nOption 2: NT933 NT389 \u2192 which expands to t592 t372 (from NT933) and from NT389, which is NT569 NT756. Let's expand NT389:\n\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756. NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588 \u2192 t278 t535. NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833.\n\nNT256 \u2192 NT60 (t637) and NT446. NT446 \u2192 NT636 (t777) and NT226. So, NT256 expands to t637 t777 and then NT226. Wait, let me retrace:\n\nWait, NT446 \u2192 NT636 (t777) and NT226 \u2192 NT399 and NT368. So, NT446 \u2192 t777 followed by NT226, which when fully expanded, would be the expansion of NT226.\n\nWhat's NT226? NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368. Both are non-terminals.\n\nNT399 \u2192 NT673 (t673) and NT368 (t372). Wait, no: NT399 \u2192 NT372? No, let me check:\n\nWait, according to the rules:\n\n- NT399 \u2192 NT372.\n\nWait, no, the rules I see are:\n\nLooking back through the given rules:\n\nWait, for NT399: I see NT399 is mentioned in a few rules. For example, in NT446 \u2192 NT636 (t777) and NT226, which is further expanded into NT399 and NT368.\n\nWait, no, in the rules provided, I don't see NT399.

{"custom_id":"request-21","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t592 t98 t14\" is generated by a given context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each non-terminal (NT) produces two terminals or two non-terminals. So, all the '->' symbols in the grammar should have two parts on the right side. Looking through the grammar provided, it seems to fit that structure, with each rule ending in either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t592 t98 t14\". This is three tokens, each representing a terminal in the grammar. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. \n\nIn a CNF grammar, to generate a string, each production step appends exactly two symbols (either terminals or NTs). Since our string has three symbols, it might take two production steps: the first to produce two symbols, and the second to produce the third. Or, perhaps, each symbol is directly derived from a production step, but wait, in CNF, every rule produces exactly two symbols, so the total number of symbols in the string must be a power of two minus one. Let's see: starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols. So, starting with S, step 1: 2, step 2:4, step3:8, etc. But wait, our string has 3 symbols, which isn't a power of two plus one. Hmm, that suggests a problem.\n\nWait, no, because the initial string would be when S is a terminal, but in this grammar, S seems to generate NTs. Let me check: S -> NT487 NT993. So, S directly produces two NTs: 487 and 993. So, any string derived from S must be a combination of the right-hand sides of these NTs and their further productions.\n\nSo, the given string is \"t592 t98 t14\". Splitting into tokens: [t592, t98, t14]. Each token is a terminal, but in the grammar, they are single characters followed by numbers. Wait, no, looking back: actually, in the grammar, some rules expand to a single terminal, e.g., NT951 -> 't466'. So, each terminal in the string corresponds to a rule that produces it.\n\nSo, let's see: \n\n- t592 is produced by NT951 -> 't466'? Wait, no, let me check the grammar. Looking for NTs that produce 't592'. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT367 -> 't30'\n\nOther 't's are:\n\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT60 -> 't637' and 't573'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT591 -> 't689'\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT964 -> 't640'\n- NT990 -> 't817'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\nWait, trying to match 't592', is there any NT that leads to it? Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't592' as a terminal. The closest is NT951->t466, NT60->t637 or t573, but nothing for t592. So, perhaps the string 't592 t98 t14' can't be generated because 't592' is not a terminal but perhaps an intermediate that's not defined.\n\nWait, but that might not be right. Let me double-check. Did I maybe look through all NTs to find any rule that produce 't592'? It doesn't seem so. So, if the grammar doesn't have a production rule that directly expands to 't592', then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding what the grammar is. Each rule is either two NTs or a terminal, right? So, to get 't592', there must be an NT that produces it. But in the list of productions, I can't find any such. So, 't592' is not a terminal in this grammar, meaning the string has a symbol that the grammar can't produce. So, that would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Maybe I missed a rule.

{"custom_id":"request-28","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t37 t640 t14\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT9, NT226, etc.) that produce other non-terminals until they reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. The start symbol is S, and according to the production rules, S directly produces NT487 and NT993. So, the string must be a sequence of the two expansions of these two non-terminals, each generating a series of terminals.\n\nThe string we're checking is \"t37 t640 t14\". Since S produces two non-terminals, the string should consist of two parts separated by a space, each corresponding to the expansion of one of these two non-terminals. So, the first part would be \"t37\" and the second part would be \"t640 t14\".\n\nLet me first check the structure: the string has exactly three parts after splitting by spaces, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no\u2014the string is \"t37 t640 t14\", which is three tokens separated by two spaces. Hmm, but according to the grammar, each production for S produces exactly two non-terminals. So, each non-terminal in the productions eventually expands into a sequence of terminals. So, when the entire string is derived, it should have two sequences of terminals. Therefore, in the string, the two sequences should be separated by a space, but the total should be two tokens. Wait, no, each production for the non-terminals may produce multiple tokens.\n\nWait, let me look at the productions to see what each non-terminal expands into. For example, S -> NT487 NT993. So, the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT487 and NT993. So, the string would be the concatenation of the two parts, each part being the result of expanding NT487 and NT993 respectively.\n\nSo, looking at the string \"t37 t640 t14\", that's three tokens. That would require that one of the non-terminals expands into two tokens and the other into one, or both into two tokens. But let me check the productions of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, starting from S:\n\n- S -> NT487 NT993\n\nEach of these two non-terminals, NT487 and NT993, must expand into some sequence of terminals. So, the concatenated string will be the concatenation of the expansions of NT487 and NT993.\n\nNow, looking at NT487:\n\nNT487 has two productions: \n\n1. NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nEach of these will produce two non-terminals, each of which will expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 is a production to itself, right? Wait no, looking back, the grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nAnd elsewhere, there's NT993 -> 't444'\n\nWait, yes! I missed that. So, NT993 directly expands to 't444', which is a terminal string. That's important. So, the right-hand side of S is NT487 and NT993, which in turn expand as per their own productions.\n\nSo, the string we're evaluating is \"t37 t640 t14\". Let's split this into the expansion of NT487 and NT993. Since NT993 expands directly to a single terminal 't444', then NT487 must expand into the remaining part, which is \"t37 t640\". Wait, but \"t37 t640 t14\" is three tokens. If NT487's expansion is \"t37 t640\" and NT993 is \"t14\", that would make sense because the total expansion would be \"t37 t640 t14\". Alternatively, maybe NT487 expands into \"t37\" and \"t640 t14\" but that's unlikely because the productions for NT487 are both binary, meaning they produce two non-terminals each, which then expand into more.\n\nWait, let's look at NT487's productions again:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\n\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSo, each of these routes leads NT487 to produce two non-terminals. Let's follow the production NT487 -> NT103 NT486.\n\nNow, NT103's production is:\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\nSo, NT103 expands into NT673 and NT964. Each of these:\n\nNT673 has a production -> 't848'\n\nNT964 has a production -> 't640'\n\nSo, NT103's expansion is \"t848 t640\", because NT673 is 't848' and NT964 is 't640', so concatenating them gives \"t848 t640\".\n\nNow, looking at NT486's production: NT486 -> 't363', which is a terminal. So, the expansion of NT487 via NT103 NT486 would be \"t848 t640 t363\".\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the other production of NT487: NT933 NT389.\n\nNT933 -> 't217'\n\nNT389 has two productions:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\n\nNT389 -> NT588\n\nWait, no: looking back, NT389 has two productions:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\n\nNT389 -> NT588\n\nWait, because in the grammar, the rule is:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\n\nand \n\nNT389 -> NT588\n\nSo, let's follow both.\n\nFirst, let's take the NT389 -> NT569 NT756 path.\n\nNT569 -> 't588'\n\nWait, no: the productions for NT569 is:\n\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\n\nSo, NT569 expands into NT195 and NT588. Each of these produces terminals.\n\nNT195 -> 't278'\n\nNT588 -> 't37'\n\nSo, NT569 -> 't278 t37'\n\nNext, NT756: \n\nNT756 -> 't131'\n\nSo, combining NT569 and NT756: \"t278 t37 t131\"\n\nNow, if we follow the other production of NT389: NT389 -> NT588\n\nNT588 -> 't37'\n\nSo, in this case, NT389's expansion is 't37'\n\nPutting it all together, NT487's expansion through NT933 NT389 would give us:\n\nNT933 -> 't217'\n\nSo, combining both paths for NT487:\n\nEither \"t848 t640 t363\" or \"t217 t37\".\n\nWait, no: because NT487 is split into NT103 (which is expanded to \"t848 t640\") and NT486 (which is \"t363\"). Alternatively, if we choose the other production, NT487 is NT933 (which expands to \"t217\") and NT389, which can be expanded as either \"t278 t37 t131\" or \"t37\"\n\nWait, so the expansion of NT487 has two options:\n\n1. (NT103 NT486) which is \"t848 t640 t363\"\n2. (NT933 NT389) which branches into two possible expansions:\n   a. \"t217 t278 t37 t131\"\n   b. \"t217 t37\"\n\nSo, the possible expansions of NT487 are:\n\n- \"t848 t640 t363\"\n\n- \"t217 t278 t37 t131\"\n\n- \"t217 t37\"\n\nNow, the string we are evaluating is \"t37 t640 t14\". Let me break that down. If S is NT487 NT993, and NT993 is 't444', then the entire string must be NT48"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t278 t777 t535 t689` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and try to understand each part.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar, each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left, and the right-hand side has two non-terminals or terminals. But looking at the given grammar, I notice some rules have a mix of NT and terminals. Wait, that doesn't seem right because in CNF, the right-hand side should only consist of non-terminals. Oh, maybe those are typos or I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking closely, some rules have 't' followed by numbers, like `NT946 -> 't131'`, which actually looks like a terminal since 't' is part of the string we're trying to generate. So in this grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. That's okay because in Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals can produce terminal strings, but more commonly, they produce other non-terminals. So that's acceptable.\n\nNow, the string we have is `t278 t777 t535 t689`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, according to the first rule: S -> NT487 NT993. So S can only produce two non-terminals, NT487 and NT993, concatenated. But the string starts with t278, which is a terminal. So, if the first production from S is NT487 NT993, then to get a terminal, I must have some rule that produces t278 directly. Looking through the productions, I see NT85 -> NT185 NT347 and NT389 -> NT569 NT756, and so on. Oh, wait, looking at the rules, there's NT226 -> NT399 NT368. Hmm, that doesn't help. Wait, maybe looking for terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice NT389 -> NT569 NT756, and NT756 -> NT256 NT833. Wait, but some rules end with 't' followed by a number, like NT697 -> NT378, which is actually producing 't697'? Wait no, because in the production NT697 -> NT378, that's two non-terminals. Oh, but looking at another production: NT697 -> NT378 is incorrect; no, wait, NT697 is actually having a rule like NT697 -> NT378. But wait, let me list all the rules to find where 't' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT946 -> 't131': so NT946 produces 't131'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT964 -> 't640'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\nWait, that's more terminals. So the non-terminals that produce terminal strings are: NT946, NT588, NT933, NT697, NT964, NT367, etc., but let's check each rule where a terminal appears as a result.\n\nFor example, NT697 -> NT378, but NT378 isn't a terminal because in the provided rules, NT378 isn't defined. Wait, no, looking again, there's a rule NT673 -> 't848', so NT673 can produce 't848'. So NT673 is one that does.\n\nSo perhaps the string `t278 t777 t535 t689` is built from sequences where the non-terminals eventually produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' is part of a production. Let's try to parse this string by building a parse tree.\n\nStart with S, which splits into NT487 and NT993. So the string generated from S would be something like (from NT487) followed by (from NT993).\n\nBut since the string starts with t278, which is a terminal, let's see which non-terminal produces it.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT147 -> 't367' is a terminal, as well as NT951 -> 't466', NT990 -> 't817', etc. Wait, but in the string, the first term is t278. Let's check the rules to see if any non-terminal produces t278.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I only see NT147 -> 't367' and similar. Wait, is there a rule for NT226? Yes, looking at the rules:\n\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\n\nBut NT399 is a non-terminal, so it won't directly produce a terminal. Let's backtrack.\n\nWait, maybe I should work from the string backwards, trying to split each part into possible non-terminals.\n\nThe string is t278 t777 t535 t689. So four terminals. Each must be produced by some non-terminal rule.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\nt278: Does any non-terminal produce 278? Let's check the rules. Looking at the productions starting with 't', as in 't573' (NT60 -> 't573'), 't37' (NT588 -> 't37'), 't637' (NT60 -> 't637'), 't777' (which would come from which non-terminal? Looking for rules ending with 't777').\n\nWait, perhaps each step involves figuring out which non-terminals can produce the given terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree.\n\nLet me consider how to get 't278 t777 t535 t689' from S. Starting with S -> NT487 NT993.\n\nSo, after producing NT487, I get 't278' because looking at NT487, the rules that produce 't' are probably NT487 -> NT103 NT486 or another path that eventually produces t278.\n\nWait, let me look at the rules again. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should make a list of each non-terminal that can produce a terminal, and then check which terminals are in the string.\n\nTerminals in the string are t278, t777, t535, t689.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT673 -> 't848' \u2192 Not helpful.\n- NT697 -> 't378' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT588 -> 't37' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT946 -> 't131' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT951 -> 't466' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT367 -> 't30' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT217 -> 't467' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT990 -> 't817' \u2192 Not in the string.\n- NT389 -> 't569' 't756' \u2192 No, wait, NT389's production is NT569 NT756.\n- Looking for 't278': Where is this produced?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't immediately see any non-terminal producing 't278'. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' is a result of a longer derivation. For example, t278 might be produced by NT278 in one step, but that's not in the grammar. Or perhaps multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe 't278' is the result of a non-derivation. For example, if a non-terminal produces a string that starts with 't278', then that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps NT951 -> 't466' \u2192 Maybe 't466' can further split into other terminals. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find any non-terminals that can produce each of the terminals in the string.\n\nt278: looking at the rules, does any NT produce 't278'? From the list of rules, it's unclear. None of the rules produce 't278' directly. Hmm. So maybe the 't278' comes from a longer derivation.

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means. I think CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal symbol. So all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow this structure because each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and each RHS is either two non-terminals or, in some cases, a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t535 t372 t30 t593`. I notice that all elements are terminals, so I don't have to worry about non-terminals in this case. My job is to check if this string can be obtained by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the top symbols in the grammar. The start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string should start with NT487 and then NT993. However, the string given is four tokens: t535, t372, t30, t593. So S is supposed to produce two non-terminals, but the string is four terminals. That might mean that each of these non-terminals expands into two terminals each, leading to four in total.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT487 and NT993. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n- NT993 \u2192 NT591 NT368\n\nWait a minute, NT993 seems to expand into two tokens, which are NT591 and NT368. But NT368 is another non-terminal, which in turn expands into 't30'. So NT993 \u2192 NT591 't30'. But NT993 is a single non-terminal, so this expansion is a combination of a non-terminal and a terminal. However, in CNF, productions can only replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's allowed.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production must have the RHS as either one terminal or two non-terminals, but in this case, NT993 expands to NT591 and NT368, which are both non-terminals. So that's acceptable because each is replaced by two non-terminals, or one could be a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the grammar has NT993 \u2192 NT591 NT368, which is two non-terminals. So that's okay. So when we process S, it's S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which we need to see if these can produce the four terminals.\n\nSo let's consider each non-terminal in the string. The string is t535 t372 t30 t593. So first, I need to see how t535 and t372 come from NT487 or NT993.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by working backwards, using a parse tree approach. Let's see.\n\nThe string is t535 t372 t30 t593. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step must replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps I can try to find which non-terminals generate these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- t535: I see that NT588 \u2192 t535\n- t372: NT933 \u2192 NT359 NT389, but wait, let me see NT933 in the grammar. Wait, NT933 isn't present. Let me check. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for which NT produce t372.\n\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\n- NT933 \u2192 NT351 NT409? Or is that another NT.

Is that correct? Or maybe that's a typo. Let me check the original grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT951 -> 't466'\nNT217 -> 't467'\nNT409 -> 't555'\nNT368 -> 't237'\nNT399 -> 't372'\nNT673 -> 't848'\nNT217 -> 't592'\nNT951 -> 't14'\n\nHmm, so NT951 appears twice, which would create ambiguity. That could complicate things. Perhaps that's a mistake, or maybe it's intentional, but I'm not sure. This might require some attention. Alternatively, perhaps one of the productions is redundant or perhaps it's a typo. For now, I'll proceed, keeping in mind that NT951 can expand to 't466' or 't14' or something else, though in the provided list, it's 't466' and 't14'.

{"custom_id":"request-45","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t804 t444 t37 t98 t14`, and the grammar includes a bunch of non-terminals and terminals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar is structured that way, which might help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT487 and NT993. Both of these seem to be intermediate non-terminals. The string starts with `t804`, `t444`, etc., which are likely terminals. So the first step is to see if the string can be generated by S.\n\nLet me break down each production rule to see which terminals appear where. Starting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the entire string must start with what NT487 and NT993 produce.\n\nLooking at NT487's productions: \u2192 NT103 NT486 or \u2192 NT933 NT389. Both of these are still non-terminals. Wait, but in the string, the first token is `t804`. So I need to see if any of NT103, NT486, NT933, or NT389 can derive `t804`.\n\nLooking at NT486: its production is \u2192 't363', so that's a terminal. But `t804` isn't that. Checking the rest, NT103: does it derive `t848`? Looking at NT673, which is part of a production of NT217 or NT367. Wait, let me check the terminal productions:\n\nNT894 \u2192 't892' \u2705\nNT951 \u2192 't466' and also 't14' \u2705\nNT487 has two options, but neither directly produce `t804`. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in NT636's production: NT636 \u2192 't777' and also 't446' is part of NT256, which isn't relevant here. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching it wrong. Let me list all the terminal productions to see their corresponding tokens.\n\nTerminal productions in the grammar:\n\n- NT588 \u2192 't37' \u2705\n- NT946 \u2192 't131'\n- NT195 \u2192 't278'\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT347 \u2192 't593'\n- NT951 \u2192 't466' and 't14'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' and 't592'\n- NT486 \u2192 't363'\n- NT894 \u2192 't892'\n- NT993 \u2192 't444'\n\nLooking at the string: `t804 t444 t37 t98 t14`.\n\nSo the first token is `t804`. I need to find a non-terminal that can derive `t804`. Checking the terminals, none of the NTs directly have `t804`. That's a problem. So unless some non-terminal can combine to produce `t804`, which I don't see happening here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a way for a non-terminal to combine to produce `t804`. Let me look back at the grammar production rules.\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that can derive `t804`. None of the NTs directly do, so unless there's a path through the productions that leads to `t804`, but I don't see any. For example, NT588 is `t37`, which is in the string, so that's good. But `t804` isn't present as a terminal from any NT.\n\nWait, the only NT that produces `t804` is... let me check all NTs. I see NT389 \u2192 't689', NT588 \u2192 't37', NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573', NT756, etc. No, nothing directly gives `t804`. So that suggests that `t804` isn't in the language, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps one of the non-terminals can derive a sequence that starts with `t804`. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me double-check the NTs.\n\nLooking at NT530: it can produce `t60` and `t446`. Wait, no, NT530's productions are \u2192 NT60 NT446 and \u2192 NT60 NT530, which seems redundant. But NT60 can produce 't637' and 't573', none of which is `t804`.\n\nSimilarly, NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT530, and NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347, etc. But none of these seem to generate `t804` as a first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me see NT588: it's `t37`. NT993 is 't444'. So in the string, the second token is 't444', which matches NT993, so that's okay. The third token is 't37', which would need NT588 or any NT that can derive 't37', which is NT60's productions: 't637' or 't573'\u2014not 't37', right?\n\nWait, no, looking at the NT60 production: NT60 \u2192 't637' or 't573'. But earlier I thought NT256 \u2192 't98' and NT347 \u2192 't593'; NT588 is the only one producing 't37'. So the third token is 't37', which would require that some NT produces 't37', but from the list, only NT60 could produce 't637' or 't573', and NT588 produces 't37'.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the NT588: yes, NT588 \u2192 't37'. So in the grammar, where is NT588 used? Let's see: NT588 appears in NT946, which is part of NT195: NT195 \u2192 NT60 \u2192 't637' or 't573', or NT588 \u2192 't37'. Wait, no, NT195's production is: \u2192 NT60 NT588.\n\nWait, no: looking at NT951, which can produce 't466' or 't14'. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the NTs. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at NT951: NT951 \u2192 NT10 NT217 or \u2192 NT990 NT367. And NT990 \u2192 NT399 NT368, etc. This is getting complicated. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, the string is `t804 t444 t37 t98 t14`. Let me analyze each symbol:\n\n1. `t804` \u2192 needs a NT that can produce it.\n2. `t444` \u2192 NT993.\n3. `t37` \u2192 NT588.\n4. `t98` \u2192 NT256.\n5. `t14` \u2192 NT951's `t14` production.\n\nBut `t804` isn't a terminal in any NT's production, right? So unless I missed a NT that can produce `t804`, the string can't be generated because it starts with `t804`, which isn't present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking again, do any NTs produce `t804`? I don't see any. The only NTs producing 't's are NT588 ('t37'), NT946 ('t131'), NT195 ('t278'), NT256 ('t98'), etc. But none produce 't804'.\n\nSo unless `t804` can be generated indirectly through some combination, which I don't see happening, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-46","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the grammar provided generates the string `t848 t593 t378 t372 t444`. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, except for the start symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar to understand how the terminals appear. The start symbol is S, which has the production S -> NT487 NT993. So the string derived from S will consist of two parts: NT487 and NT993, followed by the strings from each of these NTs.\n\nLooking at NT487, its production is either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. The string we're testing starts with `t848 t593`, so I should check where `t848` comes from. Checking the rules, I see NT487 -> 't848' in the terminal production, so `t848` comes directly from NT487.\n\nNow, looking at the first NT487: NT487 -> NT933 NT389. So from NT487, we derive NT933 and NT389. NT933 has a production: NT933 -> NT217 NT697. Let's look at NT217: NT217 -> 't592'. So NT933 would derive `t592` from NT217. Then, NT697 -> 't378' because NT697 -> 't378'.\n\nSo for the first part, NT487 deriving `t848 t592 t378` would be the sequence if it takes the path through NT933 and NT697. But in the string, after `t848` comes `t593`, not `t592`. So that's a mismatch. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT487 has two productions: one leads to NT933 NT389, and the other is NT103 NT486. Since the string starts with `t848`, which is from NT487 -> 't848', so the path must be NT487 -> NT933 NT389. Therefore, the first part is NT933 and NT389.\n\nNow, NT389 has two productions: one leads to NT569 NT756, which then can go to NT256 NT833, etc. Alternatively, NT389 -> 't689'. Oh, so wait, there are two paths for NT389: one that produces `t689` directly, and another that goes via NT569 and NT756.\n\nBut in our string, after `t848` comes `t593`. That suggests that perhaps NT389 is producing `t593`, but I need to check the rules.\n\nWait, NT389 has two productions:\n1. NT389 -> NT569 NT756\n2. NT389 -> 't689'\n\nBut in the string, after `t848` comes `t593`. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I've misassigned.\n\nWait, the string is `t848 t593 t378 t372 t444`.\n\nLet me trace through the possible derivation. Starting from S:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\nNT487 -> ?\nNT993 -> ?\n\nSo let's take the left side first: NT487. NT487 can produce 't848' directly or go via NT933 NT389. Let's see which one gives us the correct sequence.\n\nOption 1: NT487 -> 't848' and then NT993.\n\nSo from S, we get `t848` from NT487 and then see what NT993 produces.\n\nLooking at NT993: what are its productions? I don't see it listed in the grammar. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back, the NT rules are:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 | NT933 NT389\nNT487 -> 't848'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some in the NT993.

Oh, no, looking again, NT530 has two production rules:\n\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\n\nNT530 -> 't573'\n\nWait, in NT530's case, it can produce 't573' directly.\n\nSo, in NT993, is there a production? Wait, I don't see NT993 in the list. Wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, the grammar includes S, which is the start symbol. The other rules are as listed. I don't see an NT993 in the production list, which is a problem because the string starts with NT993.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me reread the grammar provided. The initial list includes:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nThen, the list proceeds with other NT rules, but I don't see NT993 having any productions. For example, NT487 has two, but NT993 is only in the start. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, actually, the user's grammar at the top includes S -> NT487 NT993. Then the list starts with NT9 -> ... etc. But I'm looking through the list, and I don't see any production for NT993.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. The start symbol here is S.\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string starts with NT487 and NT993. Let me look at the replacements for these non-terminals.\n\nStarting with NT487: looking at the productions, NT487 can become either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Let's consider both options.\n\nCase 1: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNow look at NT103: it produces NT673 NT964. Both NT673 and NT964 are further non-terminals. Let's check their productions.\n\nNT673: \u2192 't848' (a terminal). So the first part would be 't848'.\n\nNT964: \u2192 't555' (another terminal). So the first two non-terminals would produce 't848 t555'.\n\nBack to NT487: so that branch would give us 't848 t555'.\n\nWait, but the target string starts with 't30', which is much earlier. Maybe I should check the other production for NT487.\n\nCase 2: NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nNT933 \u2192 NT217 (I think). NT217 produces 't467' (from NT217 \u2192 't467'). So that's a terminal.\n\nNT389 can be either NT569 NT756 or some terminal. Let's see: looking at NT389's productions, yes, NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756. Hmm, but that's not a terminal yet.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a more direct path. Looking at NT389's other production: is there a direct terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT389's productions: yes, I see NT389 \u2192 't689'. So in this case, NT389 can become 't689' directly.\n\nSo combining these, NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389 would produce 't467 t689' (since NT933 \u2192 't467' and NT389 \u2192 't689').\n\nWait, but the target string starts with 't30', not 't467', so maybe this path isn't correct. Hmm, perhaps I should consider another initial production.\n\nWait, initially, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string would start with both NT487 and NT993 producing something, then their parts would be joined.\n\nLooking at NT993: let's see its productions. I don't see one in the provided grammar; let me check. Wait, in the productions, there's NT588 \u2192 't37' and other NTs have various productions, but I don't see NT993. Wait, that's a problem because NT993 is the product of S, so unless it has a production, it can't produce anything. Did I miss that?\n\nWait, no, looking back at the productions: the only NT993 is in S's production. Let's see if NT993 has any further productions. Going through the list, I don't see NT993 in any right-hand side except as S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So that means S produces NT487 and NT993. But if NT993 doesn't have any productions, then the string would end at NT993, which is a non-terminal (since it's a non-terminal). But the string continues, so that's a problem. Wait, that complicates things.\n\nWait, the string is `t30 t37 t372 t372 t593 t363`. It's six tokens. Since S starts as NT487 NT993, and let's assume NT993 is a non-terminal. For the entire string to be produced by S, both NT487 and NT993 must produce a string of terminals whose concatenation equals the target. But if NT993 can't derive into anything, it can't produce any terminal string, so the string can't be generated. But that can't be right because the problem didn't mention anything about that, which suggests I might have made a mistake in thinking.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again. Looking for NT993 in the productions: yes, S \u2192 NT487 NT993 and that's it. So NT993 isn't further broken down. That implies that NT993 is a leaf node, but in our target string, after some productions, we need to have NT993 somewhere. But our string ends with 't363', which is a terminal, but NT993 can't produce a terminal, so how can the string include NT993?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake. If S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and both NT487 and NT993 must produce a terminal string, so the target must include both. But looking at the target string, it's six tokens, but if NT993 doesn't produce anything, the string can't be formed, because S \u2192 NT487 NT993 would result in two terminal sequences concatenated, making a total length that's a sum of their lengths. But wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the target string: `t30 t37 t372 t372 t593 t363`. There are six tokens, each a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT487 NT993 isn't in the production, but I think that's the given S, so I can't change that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and both NT487 and NT993 have to produce a terminal string. But if NT993 can't derive into any terminal, then S can't produce a terminal string, so the problem would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a typo in the question, but assuming it's correct, then perhaps the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering NT993. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production list: \n\nYes, S \u2192 NT487 NT993 is the start. Now, do NT487 and NT993 both have productions that lead to terminal strings?\n\nLooking at NT487: It can go to NT103 NT486. NT103 \u2192 't848' (terminal). NT486 \u2192 't363' (terminal). So NT487 can produce 't848 t363'.\n\nNow, for NT993: Does NT993 have any productions? Looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT993 as a left-hand side except in S's production. So NT993 is a non-terminal with nowhere to go. That means it can't produce any terminal string, so the overall production S \u2192 NT487 NT993 can't generate a terminal string. Therefore, the string given is `t30...`, and since S can't produce any terminal, 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I have the grammar wrong. Let me double-check. Perhaps I missed a production for NT993. Scanning through the list:\n\nLooking for \"NT993\" in the lhs of any production:\n\nYes, there's S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and that's it. So NT993 doesn't have any further productions beyond itself in S, but it's a non-terminal that can't produce anything except itself, which would lead to an infinite loop and no terminal production.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string can't be generated because S can't produce any terminal string.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That would be a problem because in a typical grammar, each non-terminal must have productions that resolve to terminals, but here, NT993 is only on the top level without any further expansion.

Let's see where each of these goes:\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT486 \u2192 t363\n- NT933 \u2192 NT217\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n\nSo from NT487, possible sequences could be t363, t689, or the breakdown via NT103.\n\nSimilarly, NT487 appears twice in the string, t592 twice. Hmm, but wait, looking at the NT591 production, it's NT367 and NT591, but the actual terminal is 't592'. So maybe NT591 is 't592'?\n\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT591: According to the list, NT591 \u2192 't804'? No, wait. Wait, the productions are:\n\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\nNT367 \u2192 t673 NT964\nWait, no, looking back: The full list is:\n\nHmm, checking the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nFor NT591: The productions are not listed, but looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking for NT591: Oh wait, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\nNT367 \u2192 t673 NT964\nBut wait, for NT591: Not in the main productions, but I see:\n\nWait, let me check the entire list given:\n\nThe productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\nNT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\nNT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\nNT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\nNT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\nNT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nNT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\nNT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\nNT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\nNT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\nNT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\nNT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT591 \u2192 't804'\nWait, no, looking correctly:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nHere are the NT productions:\n\nBTW, the user provided the productions as:\n\nThe NT productions go from each NT to other NTs or terminals (the strings with 't' and numbers are terminals). So I need to check each production if it's a terminal or a combination.\n\nFor example, NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591. But do NT367 or NT591 have further productions?\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT367 \u2192 t673 NT964? Wait, looking again, no. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through each NT and their productions:\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\nNT487 has two options, both involving NT103 and others.\n\nNT993 \u2192 Not sure, maybe? Wait, looking for NT993:\n\nWait, the productions given are:\n\nLooking through:\n\nIt seems NT993 only appears as the right-hand side of S. Maybe NT993 doesn't produce anything else. Let's see, in the given NT productions:\n\nNT993 is on the RHS of S, but does NT993 have a production? Let me check.\n\nIn the provided list, I don't see any productions for NT993 except in S. So perhaps NT993 can't be derived further and is a terminal. Wait, that would be a problem because if NT993 is a terminal, but in the string, after S, we have NT487 and NT993, which would be followed by another NT487. But the string only has a single 't's, so that might cause an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check where each NT leads.\n\nLet me think about the starting symbol S: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string starts with NT487 and NT993. Each NT can be expanded into a sequence of terminal and\/or non-terminals.\n\nSo the first token after expansion should be NT487 and NT993. Then, each of these can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t592 t592 ... So the first symbols are 't592' and 't592'. So for the string to be generated, these must be the first symbols after expanding NT487 and NT993.\n\nBut wait, NT487 can produce certain terminals. Let's look at NT487's productions:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nOR\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nEach of these involve NTs that may themselves produce more.\n\nSo let's consider the first possibility: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n\nNT673 \u2192 t673 NT964\n\nWait, looking at NT673: No, in the list, I don't see NT673, but let me check. Actually, looking through the productions, do any NT produce t673? Or is it a terminal?\n\nWait, in the given productions, all NTs either produce other NTs or terminals (t followed by numbers). So if an NT only produces terminals, that's the end.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's list all the NT productions and their replacements:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n- NT487 has two paths.\n\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT486 \u2192 t363 (since 't363' is written as a single token, assuming 't' followed by the rest as a terminal)\n- NT933 \u2192 NT217\n- NT389 \u2192 t689\n\nWait, actually, 'NT933' \u2192 't217'? No, looking at the list, I think I get confused because some NTs have productions that replace to a terminal or another NT.\n\nWait, looking at the productions again:\n\nLooking for each NT:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, or NT933 NT389 (two options)\nNT486 \u2192 t363 (directly produces a terminal)\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT933 \u2192 NT217\nNT389 \u2192 t689 (since \"\u2192 NT389\" and then \"\u2192 t689\" is a possible production, but I think I'm mixing up; let me look again.\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-70","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t689 t444 t555 t555 t278 t817 t689` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (ChNF) has production rules where each non-terminal on the left side produces exactly two non-terminals on the right. Terminal symbols can't appear on the left, so each production starts with a non-terminal. The start symbol is S, which in the grammar is S -> NT487 NT993. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each NT has its own productions. Some of these NTs eventually lead to terminal strings like 'tXYZ'. So the strategy is probably to parse the string from the leaves up to the root, using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string has seven tokens: t689, t444, t555, t555, t278, t817, t689. Since the grammar starts with S -> NT487 NT993, the string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts: the first three and the last four tokens. Wait, no, since S splits into NT487 and NT993, but their derivations could be of varying lengths. Alternatively, maybe I should look directly for possible derivations from NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487: the productions it can make are:\n- NT103 NT486\n- NT933 NT389\n\nSimilarly, NT993 has production:\n- NT597 -> Wait, no, looking back, the grammar shows NT993 as S -> NT487 NT993, and looking at NT993, I think it's actually part of the starting symbol.\n\nWait, let me correct that. In the grammar, S -> NT487 NT993, so the two non-terminals are NT487 and NT993. \n\nI need to see if there's a way that NT487 can derive t689 and NT993 can derive t689, but that seems off because that would make the string have two t689s at the ends. But looking at the current split, perhaps it's better to assign the first part to NT487 and the latter part to NT993.\n\nWait, the string is `t689 t444 t555 t555 t278 t817 t689`. Let me number them as positions 1 to 7.\n\nFirst, NT487's production leads to two non-terminals, so each of those would produce some sequence of terminals. Let's see what NT487 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT487's productions:\n1. NT103 NT486\n2. NT933 NT389\n\nFor each of these, I can see where they lead.\n\nTaking path 1: NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n\nNT103's production is only one option: NT673 NT964. So NT103 -> NT673 NT964.\n\nNT673's production is NT848. But looking into NT848, I don't see it in the grammar; maybe it's a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, NT848 isn't listed as a production, but perhaps it's a terminal. So NT848 -> t848? Similarly, NT964 is NT964 -> t964.\n\nSo NT103 -> t848 t964.\n\nThen, NT486's production is NT409. Let's see, NT409 can produce several things, but looking at the given grammar, NT409 -> NT555. \n\nWait, looking back, NT486's production is NT409: NT486 -> NT409.\n\nBut NT409's production is NT990 NT555. NT409 -> NT990 NT555.\n\nWait, I might be getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the string, the middle parts are t555, t555, t278, t817. Maybe those come from a production that repeats certain non-terminals leading to t555.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but since I'm not familiar with that, maybe I should try to see if the non-terminals can derive sequences that match the terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t689, which suggests that either NT487 or NT993 must derive t689. Looking at the grammar, let's see the possible paths.\n\nLooking at NT697 -> NT351 NT409, and NT351 -> NT10 NT217. NT10 can go to NT147 NT951. NT147 -> NT367 NT591. NT367 -> NT30, which is a terminal. But that's only leading to t777 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at NT399: NT399 -> NT673 NT368. NT673 -> t848, NT368 -> t237. So NT399 would be t848 t237, but that doesn't match anything in the string.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT530: NT530 -> NT60 NT446. Let\u2019s see where these lead. NT60 has two productions: NT147 and NT951. For example, take NT147: NT367 NT591. NT367 goes to t368 (from NT368), and NT591 has a production to 't'592.\n\nWait, this might get too convoluted. Maybe I should focus on the first token t689 and see how it can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, any NT that can produce a rule ending in t689. Looking through the grammar, I don't see an immediate rule that ends with t689.\n\nWait, but looking at NT697 -> NT351 NT409. NT351 -> NT10 NT217, NT10 -> NT147 NT951. NT147 -> NT367 NT591. NT367 -> NT30 (t777?), NT591 -> t592. So that might not hit t689.\n\nAlternatively, NT217 is NT217 -> t467? Because in the grammar, NT217 -> t467. So perhaps NT217 produces t467.\n\nWait, then if NT217 is derived from some NT path, maybe that leads to t467.\n\nLooking back at the string, there's a t444 as the second token.\n\nLooking at NT664? No, wait, NT664 isn't in the grammar.\n\nWait, let's list all the possible non-terminals that can lead to t689.\n\nLooking for any rule ending with 't689'. From the grammar, I see entries like:\n\n- NT339 -> t217 (NT399 -> NT673 NT368; wait, no, 399 is NT399 -> t848 t237, so no t689 there.\n\nWait, is there any NT that can directly produce t689? It seems not. So the only way t689 can appear is if a non-terminal produces a sequence that eventually results in t689.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminals: \n\n- t689 is produced by NT951 (look at NT951 -> t689)\n- t444 is produced by NT555 (NT555 -> t444)\n- t998? Wait, no, from looking through the last lines.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal in the string and see if I can find a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\n1. t689: So the non-terminal must produce t689. From the grammar, looking for NTs that can produce t689. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT951 -> t689. So if a non-terminal can derive nt951, then t689 is produced.\n\n2. t444: Looking for NTs that produce t444. In the grammar, NT555 -> t444, as in line 'NT555 -> t444'.\n\n3. t555: Looking for NTs that produce t555.

I'm supposed to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar provided has a list of production rules, and the string I need to evaluate is \"t237 t467 t535 t637 t363 t640 t637 t30\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. So in this grammar, most of the rules end with terminals or produce two non-terminals. That's helpful because it means the derivation can be step-by-step straightforward, without any complex rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice each token is separated by a space, which probably means they're the result of terminal productions. So each segment like \"t237\" is a terminal symbol. \n\nI think the approach here is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, so I need to see how S can lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the production rules, S -> NT487 NT993. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT487 and NT993.

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t593 t98 t278 t278 t592 t98 t378 t593`, and I need to check if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure. Since these are unambiguous grammars, each step should lead in a clear way to the string without ambiguity.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of several terminals: t593, t98, t278, t278, t592, t98, t378, and t593. My goal is to reconstruct the derivation steps starting from the start symbol S and ending with the exact string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT487 NT993. So S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Let me write that down as the first step.\n\nNow, I need to expand NT487 and NT993 into their respective terminals. Let's look at NT487. In the grammar, NT487 has two productions: NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389. I need to choose which one to use. Since the string starts with t593, I should check which expansion leads to that.\n\nLooking at NT486, in the grammar it's a terminal 't363', which isn't what we want yet. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path. What about NT933? Let's see, NT933 is another non-terminal. Checking its productions: NT697 NT389 and maybe others, but in the grammar, NT933 -> NT217 NT389. No, wait, looking at the grammar, NT933's productions are actually NT217 NT389 and possibly others, but in the given rules, it's only NT217 and NT389. Wait, the grammar shows NT933 has two rules? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, let me list the productions under NT933: It's actually NT933 -> NT217 NT389. That's the only production. So to get t593, I must have a path where NT487 expands to something that leads to t593.\n\nLooking back, NT487 can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Since NT486 is t363, which isn't t593, perhaps the other option is better. So NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT389. Looking at NT217, the productions are NT467 and NT592. We have t592 in the string, which is good. So NT217 \u2192 NT592.\n\nNow, the first part of the string so far is T593 (from NT487), T933's expansion is NT217 NT389, which becomes t592 (from NT217) and then NT389.\n\nWait, let me reconstruct step by step.\n\n- Start with S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nFor NT487:\n\n- Expand to NT933 NT389.\n\nNow NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT389.\n\nNT217 \u2192 NT592 (since one of its productions is NT592).\n\nNT389 has a production to 't689' \u2192 t689.\n\nSo expanding NT487 so far gives us t592 t689.\n\nWait, this doesn't match the string's first two terms which are t593 and t98. So, maybe this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing NT933 for NT487. Maybe I should instead consider another path.\n\nLet me retrace. NT487 can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. NT103 is NT673 NT964, which when expanded would give t673 and t964, neither of which are t593. So that path seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389 is correct, but then how do we get t593?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong expansions. Let me check the other parts.\n\nLooking at NT993, the production is NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591. And NT367 \u2192 NT673 NT964. NT964 \u2192 t640, and NT673 \u2192 t848. Hmm, perhaps NT993 can be expanded into t848 t640, which isn't in our string. Alternatively, NT367's other option: NT367 \u2192 NT591, which ends with t555. So no, perhaps that path leads to t640 or t555, which don't match our string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see: the string starts with t593 and t98. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t593 and t98.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t593 comes from NT399, which is NT673 NT964, but that would give t673 t964. Wait, but looking at the productions, NT673 is t848, but wait, no: in the grammar, NT673 \u2192 t848. So if NT399 expands to NT673 NT964, that would be t848 t964, which isn't matching t593.\n\nWait, did I miss any productions?\n\nLooking back: NT399 is under NT673's productions? No, actually, NT673 is a terminal 't848'. So, perhaps NT399 isn't a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, let me find all rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals are:\n\n'NT487' and others aren't terminals, they're non-terminals. The terminals are things like t593, t98, etc. Let me list all terminal symbols:\n\nt593, t98, t278, t278, t592, t98, t378, t593.\n\nSo these are all terminals. So any production that ends in a terminal is a leaf.\n\nSo, the terminals in the grammar are all these t numbers, so any non-terminal that directly produces a terminal is part of the bottom of the parse tree.\n\nLooking at non-terminals, let me list all of them and their possible expansions.\n\nEach rule where the non-terminal is on the left and the right-hand side is a production.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nThen NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nBut some of these non-terminals produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through each rule, for each non-terminal, if the right-hand side has a terminal, then that non-terminal can produce that terminal.\n\nSo:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT486 \u2192 't363' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT98 \u2192 't98'\n- Wait, no: wait, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT446 \u2192 't946', NT588 \u2192 't37', etc.\n\nWait, the user provided the full grammar with all the production rules. So let me check which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 (but NT103 is also a non-terminal)\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217 (both non-terminals)\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\n- NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n- NT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-83","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string `t640 t593 t98 t689 t640 t535 t777 t363 t592` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT487 NT993. So, the string must be a result of expanding S into NT487 NT993, and then further expanding these non-terminals until we get terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers).\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, which means each non-terminal in the string must have eventually been expanded into these terms. \n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into its components:\n\nt640, t593, t98, t689, t640, t535, t777, t363, t592.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar. \n\nThe first step in any expansion is S, so S must produce NT487 NT993. So the first two symbols should correspond to the expansions of NT487 and NT993. Let's check the start of the string: t640 t593... Wait, according to the grammar, NT487 can expand into different terms:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT487:\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSo, NT487 can't directly produce 't640', because 't640' is t777 in the grammar. Wait, checking NT777. Wait, no. Let me look for the terminals produced by NT487. \n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT487, the right-hand sides are:\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nNow, looking at the productions for NT486. NT486 is a non-terminal. In the grammar, NT486 is transformed into 't363', which is one of the terminals in the string. So, for example, if NT486 -> 't363', then NT487 could produce 't363' if one of its expansions goes that way. But in the string, the first 't640' doesn't match any of the terminals directly. So perhaps NT487 isn't part of the beginning. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the string. Let me check: the string is `t640 t593 t98 t689 t640 t535 t777 t363 t592`. Let me note that the first three terms are t640, t593, t98. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce these?\n\nLooking at NT487, which is the first in the expansion, it seems that NT487 can't directly produce t640 because its terminals are 't363' and 't98' perhaps. Wait, wait, let me check each step thoroughly.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the grammar to see which non-terminals expand into which:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\nSo, the terminals from NT487 via expansion are 103 and 486. Looking at the options, 486 is 't363' and 933 is ... wait, what's NT933's production? Let's check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking up the NT rules, perhaps I should list each non-terminal and their possible expansions to know which terminals they can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work backward from the string. Let's try to parse the string by matching from the rightmost symbols and see if we can reduce them to symbols that can be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps a top-down approach would be better. Let's start from S and expand S into NT487 NT993, then each of these non-terminals can be expanded into their respective terms.\n\nWait, but S produces NT487 NT993, so the string starts with NT487 NT993. So the first two symbols in the string would be the results of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two are t640 and t593. So, does NT487 expand into 't640' and NT993 expand into 't593'? Or perhaps it's the other way around.\n\nLooking for NT993 in the grammar, it has a production: NT993 -> any terms? Let me check. Oh, looking at the grammar end, is there an NT993 production? Wait, yes, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking back, among the NT rules, I see NT993 -> 't444', perhaps? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, the user provided this part:\n\nNT993 -> 't444'\n\nSo NT993 can produce 't444'. So if the second symbol in the string is t593, that would have to come from NT993. But 't593' is not 't444', so perhaps that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I need to check if NT993 can produce t593 somehow, but looking at the grammar, I don't see that. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the starting point. Let me re-examine the entire string. The string has nine terms: t640, t593, t98, t689, t640, t535, t777, t363, t592.\n\nWait, so the string is a sequence of these eight 't's. But the grammar's initial expansion is S -> NT487 NT993. So when we start expanding, the first step is S -> NT487 NT993. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to expand into a terminal, but in this case, both are non-terminals. So the first step would be to expand S into NT487 NT993, and then each of NT487 and NT993 can be further expanded until they become terminals.\n\nWait, but the string has nine terms, which would mean that each non-terminal after the first expansion needs to produce multiple terminals. For example, each production step from each non-terminal to another would add more symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals generate more than two terminals, but in context-free grammars in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so each step either expands a symbol or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me first try to write down the production steps.\n\nStart with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nNow, NT487 and NT993 are both non-terminals, so they'll need to be expanded further. Let's see what NT487 and NT993 can produce.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n\nOR\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo NT487 can be replaced by NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT993's production:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, does NT993 have any production? I count:\n\nWait, looking through the given list:\n\nThe end part shows:\n\nNT993 is listed as one of the NT's, and in the rules, I don't see NT993 on the left side of any production. Wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, the provided rules are:\n\n... a long list of NT productions ...\n\nLooking specifically, the end includes:\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nNT256 -> 't98'\n\nNT60 -> 't573'\n\nWait, but NT993 is not listed on the left side of any production. So NT993 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. That can't be correct, because if S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT993 is a terminal, that means the initial step would result in NT487 followed by 't444', because according to the rules, NT993 \u2192 't444'.\n\nSo S initially expands to NT487 NT993 \u2192 (NT487) 't444'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first part is 't640 t593', so that's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t217 t592 t637 t444 t689 t592 t466 t777 t689`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the top-level symbol is S, which directly produces NT487 NT993. So, the left-hand side of S is a single non-terminal, and it produces a combination of two other non-terminals. Since this is a CFG, each production must eventually lead to terminal symbols only.\n\nLooking at the productions, many of them are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, which means each non-terminal on the left continues to produce pairs of non-terminals on the right. Some of these non-terminals, though, eventually produce a single terminal symbol. For example, NT946 -> 't131', which is a terminal. So, the idea is to follow the derivation from S down, expanding non-terminals step by step until we reach all terminals.\n\nThe string has nine terms: t217, t592, t637, t444, t689, t592, t466, t777, t689. So, the string has nine tokens, which suggests that there are eight splits in the derivation since each split adds one more element.\n\nStarting with S, the first step is S -> NT487 NT993. So, S splits into two non-terminals. Each of these will eventually produce parts of the string.\n\nLet's look at NT487 and NT993:\n\nNT487 can go to either:\n- NT103 NT486 or\n- NT933 NT389.\n\nNT993 can go to either:\n- NT147 NT951 or\n- NT217 NT993?

Wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT351 -> NT10 NT217, and NT990 -> NT817, but for NT993, I think it might be NT990 as one of the options? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT351 -> NT10 NT217, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT993 -> anything directly. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT951 -> 't466' and NT990 -> 't817', but NT993 isn't listed. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me correct.\n\nFor NT226, the production is NT226-> NT399 NT368. So, two options: NT85 NT569 or NT399 NT368.\n\nContinuing, NT530 -> NT60 NT446.\n\nSo, S starts as NT487 NT993.\n\nLet me consider the possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the string, the leftmost symbol is t217. So, we need to see if t217 can come from a derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t217 is a terminal and appears in NT673 -> 't848', but wait, t217 is a terminal that appears in NT217->'t...'? Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT351 -> NT10 NT217, but NT217 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no: in NT351's production, it's NT10 and NT217, but looking further, I see NT217's production:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar lines, the production for NT217 is:\n\nNT217-> 't467' or?\n\nWait, the line is \"NT226 -> NT399 NT368\", which is a production to two non-terminals.\n\nBut looking further, in NT226, but in NT217, I don't see a direct production. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT990 -> NT817? No, looking:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the terminal productions to see.\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt217, t592, t637, t444, t689, t592, t466, t777, t689.\n\nThese are the terminal tokens in the string. Each must correspond to a non-terminal in the grammar that produces this terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps each terminal is the result of a non-terminal that can only produce that terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\n- NT588 -> 't535'\n\n- NT933 ->... wait, NT933 is used in NT487, but looking for where the terminals appear:\n\nAh, seeing this, I don't see all the terminals as direct productions. Wait, maybe some non-terminals produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps we can map each terminal to its corresponding rule.\n\nLooking for t777:\n\n- NT777? No, wait in the grammar, production NT636 -> 't777'\n\nSo, NT636 can produce t777. Therefore, t777 comes from NT636.\n\nNow, in the string, t777 is at position 8 (end of string). So, the last element is t777. So, it must come from NT636.\n\nLooking back, which non-terminal's production includes NT636?\n\nLooking at the grammar lines: NT636 -> 't777'\n\nWait, no, the line is NT636->'t777'. So, NT636 produces t777, which is a direct terminal.\n\nThen, earlier in the string, we have t444. Looking for which non-terminal can produce 't444'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT446 -> 't363' and 't636' (since NT446-> NT636 NT226, but wait, actually"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t804 t637 t892 t804 t237 t593 t30 t467 t689 t593`. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT487 and NT993. \n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t804 and t637. Now, checking the grammar, I see that NT487 has two productions: NT103 produces t486 and NT933 produces t217. NT636 is another production under NT487, which maps to 't777', matching t637. So, the first two tokens are valid from NT487.\n\nNext, looking at the third token, t892. Checking the grammar, NT993 is derived from NT993 \u2192 't444', which corresponds to t892? Wait, no, wait. Wait, NT993 is a terminal. Actually, in the grammar, NT993 is a rule that directly produces 't444'. So, t892 would need to come from somewhere else. Wait, no. Let me check again. The string is t804 t637 t892... Oh, wait, t892 is the third token. So, after NT487 (which produces t804 and t637), the next part is NT993. But in the grammar, NT993 is a terminal 't444', not 't892'. Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. Looking at NT993: in the given rules, I see NT993 \u2192 't444'. So, 't892' is not derived from NT993. That suggests that either I'm misunderstanding the expansion, or perhaps the string is longer than expected. \n\nBut let's think step by step. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string must start with NT487 and NT993. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n- NT487 has two options: it can be NT103 (which becomes t486) and NT933 (which becomes t217), or it can expand to 't486' and 't933'. Alternatively, wait, no, looking at NT487's rules: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. Wait, no, looking more closely, in the grammar, each production is split into two non-terminals. So NT487's rules are:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way it's written is NT487 -> NT103 NT486 and NT487 -> NT933 NT389. So, each production splits into two non-terminals. But in the tree, each non-terminal must be expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe initial string:\n\nt804 t637 t892 t804 t237 t593 t30 t467 t689 t593\n\nSo, it's 10 tokens. Let's think about how the grammar would expand.\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT487 and NT993.\n\nFirst part: NT487.\n\nLooking at the NT487 rules, it can produce:\n\nEither NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Each of these would then need to be expanded further.\n\nWait, but each production is of two non-terminals, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until you reach terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S, the first step is to expand to NT487 NT993. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet me think about how the string is formed.\n\nPerhaps it's better to write out the possible expansion.\n\nThe string starts with t804 and t637. Let's check what could expand to t804 and t637.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT636 -> 't777' which is t637 (since 777 is 637? Wait, no, the string has t637. But the grammar has 't777' under NT636. Wait, in the grammar, NT636 \u2192 't777', which would be 't777', but in the string, we have 't637' which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT636 \u2192 't777'\n\nYes, so that's 't777' as a terminal. So the string has 't637' which is not this. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find where 't637' comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT103 \u2192 't486' and NT673 \u2192 't848', etc. Wait, no 't637' is not present. So, perhaps that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule. Let me check the NT487 rules again.\n\nNT487 can be:\n\n\u2192 NT103 NT486\n\n\u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nSo, each production under NT487 is a pair of non-terminals. Then, each of those non-terminals needs to be expanded further until you reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string t804 t637... is formed from NT487 splitting into NT103 NT486, where NT103 becomes 't804' and NT486 becomes 't637'.\n\nSo, let's check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT103: in the grammar, NT103 \u2192 't673' and 't964'? Wait, no. Let me check NT103's rules. Wait, the rules are:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n\nAnd NT673 \u2192 't848'\n\nWait, no, NT673 \u2192 't848', and NT964 \u2192 't640'. So, NT103 expands to NT673 NT964, which in turn become t848 and t640. So that would produce t848 t640, not t804 t637.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because t804 is not in NT103's descendants.\n\nWait, did I look at the wrong NT for t804. Let me find all the production rules leading to t804.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT399 \u2192 't372'\n\nWait, no. The rules for NT399 are: \u2192 NT389 NT372. Hmm, no, let me check again:\n\nThe rules given:\n\nLooking for 't804' as a terminal:\n\nNT399 \u2192 NT389 NT372\n\nNT389 \u2192 't569'\n\nNT372 \u2192 't372?

I need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT487 can produce 't363' or 't964'\n- NT9 can produce 't673' or 't951' via NT9 -> NT389 NT569, but looking at the string, we don't have 't673' or 't951'.\n- NT37 looks like a terminal 't37' which isn't in the grammar; wait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT37 being a non-terminal\u2014it's just 't37'.\n- Similarly, other tokens are 't14', 't372', 't131', etc., which are terminals unless they are produced by non-terminals.\n\nWait, hold on, the string has 't37', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. Wait, but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce 't...' such as NT487 -> 't363' or 't964'. Let me cross-reference each token in the string with the grammar.\n\nLet me go token by token:\n\n1. `t14`: From the grammar, NT147 -> 't804' and NT60 (from NT185?) wait, actually, looking at the productions, NT951 -> 't466' and NT147 -> 't804'. Wait, but in the string, it's `t14`. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that produces 't14' is NT147, but NT147 is not directly linked to 't14'. Wait, wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production NT147 -> 't804'. So `t14` doesn't appear directly as a terminal from any non-terminal here. So that's a problem because the string has `t14`, which isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar\u2014so if the string contains a `t14`, it's impossible since the grammar doesn't have such a production. But in the string, it's present.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the productions. The given grammar has:\n\n- NT147 -> 't804'\n- Also, looking further, I see NT10 -> NT147 NT951, but that doesn't produce 't10'\u2014it's 't147' and 't951'. So 't14' isn't produced anywhere. So if the string contains `t14`, it's not possible unless perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, looking again, I see in the productions:\n\n- NT217 -> 't467' and 't592' via NT217 -> NT467 NT592 (I might have confused that, but looking at the list, NT217 is not directly a terminal\u2014it produces 't467' and 't592')?\n\nWait, no, in the productions, NT217 is defined as producing 't467' and 't592'. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the productions, NT217 -> 't467' and 't592' is actually part of NT409 -> 't555' is another, but let me check each NT:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT217 -> 't467' and 't592'? Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT217 appears in NT409 and NT964? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me systematically look for each 't' token in the string and see if it's produced by any non-terminal.\n\nThe string is: t14 t37 t592 t372 t131 t378 t689 t278 t278 t237\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. t14: Check if any NT produces 't14'. Looking through the given grammar, I don't see any NT production that results in 't14'. The closest is NT147 -> 't804', which is 't804', not 't14'. So that's a red flag. The string starts with t14, which the grammar can't produce. If that's the case, the entire string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss it. Let me go through all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nLooking at NT487 -> 't363' or 't964'\n\nNT9 -> 't...? Wait, no, looking through:\n\nLooking for any NT that produces 't14'. The given productions don't have any NT that produces 't14'. So the string has 't14' which can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Perhaps the non-terminals can produce these via multiple steps. For example, is there a way any of these 't' tokens might be part of a larger derivation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, but given that the string contains 't14', and the grammar doesn't have any production that produces 't14' as a terminal, it can't be generated.\n\nBut let me go through the entire string just to be thorough. Maybe other parts are okay except for this one issue.\n\nt37: Is there any NT that produces 't37'? Looking at the productions, NT60 -> 't637', which is 't637', not 't37'. Similarly, no NT is directly producing 't37'. So that's another problem. Wait, but in the string, it's 't37' not 't637', so that's a problem because 't37' isn't in the grammar.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought the string might not be valid because of 't14', but now 't37' is another issue. Wait, but did I misread the string?\n\nWait, the string is `t14 t37 t592 t372 t131 t378 t689 t278 t278 t237`. All of these are terminals, but looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce these except for 't363', 't964', 't389', etc., but I don't see 't14' as any direct production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express each 't' token and see if it's present in the list of terminals from the grammar.\n\nTerminals from the grammar:\n- 't14' (from NT147 -> 't804')\u2014no, that's a production for NT147.\n- 't363' (from NT487)\n- 't964' (from NT487)\n- 't673' (from NT389)\n- 't951' (from NT389)\n- 't467' (from NT217)\n- 't592' (from NT217)\n- 't389' (from NT530)\n- 't569' (from NT530)\n- 't131' (from NT933)\n- 't378' (from NT697)\n- 't689' (from NT697)\n- 't278' (from NT256 via NT60 and NT446, but looking at NT256: NT256 -> 't98' or 't446', wait, is that correct? Let me check NT256:\n\nIn the grammar: NT256 -> NT446 NT946\n\nAnd looking at NT446: NT446 -> 't637' or 't933'?\n\nWait, no, looking at NT446:\n\n grammar: NT446 -> '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check. My goal is to determine if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to see how non-terminals can expand. The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, expands to NT487 and NT993. So the string should start with these two non-terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first part is `t804 t363 t98 t37 t573 t640 ...`. Since the string starts with `t804`, I need to check if `t804` is the expansion of NT487 or NT993.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT487 has two productions: one to NT103 and NT486, and another to NT933 and NT389. So NT487 would expand to two non-terminals. Similarly, NT993's rules aren't provided, but if it expands to 't444', then the first token `t804` might not be from NT993 unless I'm missing something. Wait, actually, looking back, in the list, I see that NT487 has a rule that directly expands to 't363'? No, wait: Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, NT487 actually has two rules: one is NT103 and NT486, and another is NT933 and NT389. There's another NT487 that expands to NT933 and NT389. So I'm looking at the string `t804`... So maybe `t804` is the result of a rule in another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to look for where 't804' appears as a direct expansion. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT351 has a rule that expands to NT10 and NT217, but that leads to 't673' and 't592'. No, wait: checking all the rules, I see that NT351's rule is NT10 NT217. Then looking further, NT10 expands to NT147 and NT951, and NT951 expands to 't466' and 't14' perhaps? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nActually, in the provided rules, I see that NT351 has a rule that expands to NT10 and NT217. Then looking at NT10, it has a rule expanding to NT147 and NT951. Then NT147 expands to NT367 and NT591. But NT591 is a terminal, 't30'. Hmm, that's getting too deep. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the derivation step by step. The string starts with `t804`, which corresponds to which rule? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT487 has multiple rules, but none directly leading to 't804'. However, I notice that in the rules, there's an NT389 that expands to 't689' and 't389' also appears in other places. Wait, no, actually, looking at the rules, I see that NT933 has a rule expanding to 't217', so 't217' is part of that. But the first token is 't804', which is part of NT487's first rule. Wait, no, actually, in the rules, NT487 has a rule to 't486'? No, earlier, NT487 has rules to NT103 and NT486, and another to NT933 and NT389. But wait, looking at the rules provided, I see that for example, NT351 is 'NT10 NT217', but NT351 isn't directly related to NT487.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider how the string can be split into parts that match the non-terminals. The string is: t804 t363 t98 t37 t573 t640 t573 t848 t593 t98 t592. That's 11 tokens.\n\nLet's see. Starting with t804. Looking at the rules, which non-terminals can produce 't804'? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT226 can expand to 't60' or 't446' or 't399', no, wait: Let's check each rule.\n\nWait, NT351 expands to NT10 and NT217. So to get 't804', I think it's part of the expansion from NT487 or another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe 't804' is part of the expansion from NT351.\n\nWait, wait: looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT226 -> NT85 and NT569\n\n- NT85 -> NT185 and NT347\n\n- NT185 -> NT990 and NT697\n\n- NT347 -> NT569 and NT756\n\n- NT756 -> NT256 and NT833\n\n- NT256 -> NT446 and NT946\n\n- NT946 -> NT132 and NT something? Wait, no, NT946 -> NT256 and NT833.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about which non-terminals end up with 't804' as part of their expansion.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT487 has a rule that starts with NT103 and NT486, another rule to NT933 and NT389.\n\nWait, but in the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly expanding to 't804'. However, some rules end up expanding into several terminals. For example, NT487's first part is NT103 and NT486. So let's check NT103:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT103's rule is to NT673 and NT964. Then NT673 is 't848' and NT964 is 't640'. So NT103 expands to 't848' and 't640'. So if a non-terminal like NT103 is in the string, it would generate 't848' followed by 't640'.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 has a rule to NT147 and NT951. NT147 expands to NT367 and NT591. Then NT367 is 't30' and NT591 is 't30'. Wait, not 't804'. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for 't804', I notice that in the rules, NT487's first part is NT103 and NT486. So if a string starts with 't804', perhaps it's generated from NT487, which is the first part of S. So the entire string must derive from S->NT487 NT993, and each of these non-terminals must produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT487's rules, the first rule is to NT103 and NT486. Let's see:\n\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n\nSo the string after S would be the concatenation of NT487's expansion and NT993's expansion.\n\nSince the first token is 't804', which is part of the expansion of NT103 and NT486.\n\nWait, no, because NT103 expands to 't848' and 't640' as per the rule NT103-> NT673 NT964, which are terminals.\n\nSo in S, the first non-terminal is NT487, which generates to NT103 and NT486.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNT487's first rule is NT103 and NT486. So from NT487, the first expansion would be two parts: the first part is NT103 and the second is NT486.\n\nNT103 expands to NT673 and NT964: which are 't848' and 't640' as terminals.\n\nSimilarly, the NT486 in the rule for NT487 would expand, but looking at the rules, no rule for NT486 except maybe being a terminal. Wait, in the rules, I see NT487 expands to NT103 and NT486. But does NT486 have a rule"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right. The start symbol is S, and the productions go from S to NT487 and NT993.

{"custom_id":"request-123","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t278 t372 t637 t37 t592 t640 t804 t592 t892 t593 t98 t467`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. The grammar provided seems to fit this structure, as all rules are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or something similar.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if there's a way to derive this sequence from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either takes a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. This suggests that the derivation will involve breaking down each non-terminal according to the rules until all symbols are terminals.\n\nI should start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. According to the given grammar, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, to expand S, both NT487 and NT993 must be expanded into terminals. \n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n   - So, the string starts with NT487 and ends with NT993.\n\n2. Now, I need to see how NT487 and NT993 can be expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar production rules:\n\nNT487 appears in several places. Checking the productions for NT487:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSimilarly, NT993:\n- NT993 isn't directly shown here, but I notice that in the initial grammar, the first line is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Wait, that seems like a possible typo because later NT993 isn't defined. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking again, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and the rules follow. So perhaps NT993 isn't defined beyond that. That's odd because if S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT993 isn't defined further, it can't produce any terminal. But in the string, it ends with t98 and t467, which are terminals. So that suggests that my initial thought might be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, the first S produces NT487 NT993. Let me check if NT993 is further defined. Scanning through the rules, I see NT487, NT993, NT389, etc. But I don't see NT993 producing anything. Wait, let me scan all the rules again quickly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nNo other rules for NT993. That might be a problem because if S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT993 can't produce anything, then S can't generate any terminal strings, but our input string has several terminals. So this suggests a mistake either in my understanding or the grammar provided.\n\nWait, perhaps NT993 is supposed to be defined as a terminal somewhere. Let me check all the non-terminals in the rules and see if they're ever terminals.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\nNT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\nNT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\nNT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\nNT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nNT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\nNT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\nNT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\nNT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\nNT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\nNT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT591 \u2192 't804'\nNT636 \u2192 't777'\nNT389 \u2192 't689'\nNT588 \u2192 't37'\nNT946 \u2192 't131'\nNT195 \u2192 't278'\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\nNT256 \u2192 't98'\nNT60 \u2192 't573' \u2192 Wait, this is a problem because NT60 is defined twice. Once as NT60 \u2192 't637' and another as \u2192 't573'. So this is a conflict. That seems incorrect because a non-terminal should have a unique production.\n\nWait, looking closer, I see NT60 \u2192 't637' and also NT60 \u2192 't573' in the rules. That's a problem because it's not a proper function; a non-terminal should map to one set of productions. So this might mean the grammar is invalid or I might have misread the rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, let me check all the NT60 rules. Here's the list:\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\nand also:\nNT60 -> 't573'\n\nThat's a problem because it's two different productions for the same non-terminal. That would mean the grammar is ill-formed because a non-terminal cannot have two different productions. So this suggests that either there's a typo or I'm misreading the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules are presented in a list, but I can see that under NT60, there are two lines:\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nand\n\nNT60 -> 't573'\n\nSo, that's a definite problem. It would mean that the grammar cannot be used properly because a non-terminal is mapped to two different terminals. That would make the grammar invalid in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nBut proceeding under the assumption that maybe one of them is correct and the other is a typo, perhaps the correct one is 't637' because it's listed first but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second one was intended to be a different production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is miswritten, and instead of a terminal, it's another non-terminal that resolves to a terminal elsewhere. But with the current data, this is ambiguous.\n\nThis could complicate things because if S \u2192 NT487 NT993, but NT993 can't produce anything, the start symbol can't derive any terminal string, which contradicts the given string of terminals. However, our string consists of multiple terminals, so that would indicate that S must be able to derive a sequence of terminals, meaning that the initial production must correctly lead to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the start symbol again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. If NT993 cannot produce any terminal, then the string provided, which is entirely terminals, cannot be generated by this grammar. But the string has 12 terms, so let's see if each part can be broken down correctly.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I misread the grammar and NT993 is defined further. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT993, so that production must terminate, but since it's a terminal, maybe it's a typo and should be NT993 \u2192 't...' or something. But since it's not defined, I think it's invalid.\n\nBut assuming that the NT993 is a typo and it should be another non-terminal that does have a production. Alternatively, perhaps the first rule for S is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the first rule for S is supposed to be S \u2192 NT487 NT993, but NT993 is defined as something else elsewhere. But in the given rules, I only see S and NT487 and NT993. So, perhaps the string given cannot be derived from S because NT993 is not"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-122","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is \"t444 t444 t237 t378 t131 t817 t372 t278 t131 t363 t637 t637\". \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. CNF is useful because we can apply the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need to use that here. Alternatively, I can try to derive the string step by step by matching the productions.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar, becomes NT487 NT993. So the first step is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Now, each of these non-terminals (NT487 and NT993) can be expanded further, and so on, until we reach the terminals, which are the 't's followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at NT487, according to the grammar, it can produce either t363 or t933. Wait, no\u2014looking back, NT487 has two options: \u2192 NT103 NT486 and \u2192 NT933 NT389. Oh, right, so NT487 can split into two paths. \n\nLet me try creating a parse tree starting from S. \n\n1. Start with S: S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n2. Now, look at NT487 and NT993. Let's expand them:\n   - NT487 can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n   - NT993 can be NT445 or NT something\u2014I check the grammar and see that NT993 only appears in S as being derived from S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so maybe NT993 is a terminal already? Wait, no, I need to look at NT993's productions. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT993 having any productions beyond what's in S. Wait, actually, NT993 in S is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so perhaps NT993 can produce other non-terminals or terminals? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT933 and NT997, but not NT993. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. The provided grammar doesn't explicitly define NT993 as a non-terminal with a production. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe grammar has S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT993 isn't further defined. So does that mean NT993 is a terminal symbol? If it is, then S starts with NT487, which then splits, and NT993 is just a terminal, maybe 't993'? But when I look through the rules, I see that NT993 is not a terminal; NT997 is a terminal, but not NT993.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me look again. The initial string is \"t444 t444 t237 t378 t131 t817 t372 t278 t131 t363 t637 t637\". So the string starts with t444 t444, which seems to correspond to the S \u2192 NT487 NT993, where each NT487 and NT993 might produce t444 each.\n\nWait, but does NT487 produce t444? Looking at the productions, NT487 can be NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Neither of which are terminals, except when I check deeper. Let me look at the productions of NT486: looking through the rules, I see NT486 \u2192 't363' and NT486 also has a production to NT367 NT637. Similarly, NT103 is a terminal because it appears in a production that just outputs a 't'\u2014NT103 \u2192 't673' and NT103 \u2192 't964'. Wait, no, wait: NT103 has productions to NT673 NT964 or 't673' and 't964' as terminals? Wait, no\u2014the productions for NT103 are:\n\nLooking at the rules:\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\nNT103 -> 't673'\nNT103 -> 't964'\n\nOh, okay, so NT103 can produce the terminal 't673', 't964', or be broken down further into NT673 and NT964.\n\nSo going back, if S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and we need the first part to produce t444. Let's see if NT487 can produce 't444'. Looking at NT487's productions:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nNeither of these directly produce 't444', but maybe when expanded further, they can. Let's take NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486.\n\nNow, NT103 can produce 't673' or 't964' directly. And NT486 can produce 't363' or split into NT367 and NT637, where NT367 is a terminal 't367'? Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT486: NT486 \u2192 't363' or NT367 NT637.\n\nSimilarly, NT367 is a terminal 't367' or other productions.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t444, but in NT487's expansion, we're not getting t444. Instead, we're getting t673 or t964, or t363, etc. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the starting NT487 doesn't produce t444 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let's see the overall structure. The string starts with two t444s. So perhaps the grammar must produce at least two instances of 't444' at some point.\n\nLooking at NT487, can it produce t444? Let me check all the rules where NT487 is involved:\n\nNT487 has two productions:\n1. NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo unless one of these productions can lead to 't444', NT487 won't generate t444.\n\nLooking at NT103, it can produce 't673' or 't964', which are different from t444.\n\nLooking at NT933: let's see its productions. I don't see NT933 in the rules except as the target of NT487's production. Wait, perhaps I should look further. Let me check all rules for NT933.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT933 having any other productions besides being used in NT487. So perhaps NT933 doesn't produce t444.\n\nWhat about NT389? Let me check NT389's productions:\n\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756.\n\nThen NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588, and NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\nNT195 \u2192 't278'\n\nNT588 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT256 \u2192 't98' or NT446 NT946.\n\nDTWAT, none of these produce t444.\n\nSo, it seems that none of the paths from NT487 in the starting production directly produce t444. Therefore, the initial expansion of S as NT487 NT993 cannot produce t444, because NT487 doesn't produce t444.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT993 does produce t444. Does the grammar have any rules for NT993? Looking at the production rules, S starts with NT487 NT993, but I don't see any production for NT993 besides being used in S.\n\nSo, if NT993 must be a terminal, perhaps 't993', but that doesn't match the string, which has 't444'.\n\nWait, let me double-check if there's a production for NT993. Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any production that starts with NT993.

{"custom_id":"request-136","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. The given grammar seems to fit this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe input string is: `t466 t14 t217 t573 t98 t535 t98 t817 t378 t131 t444 t535 t640`. It looks like it's a sequence of terminals, each starting with 't'. \n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation must follow a certain structure. Each step in the derivation will expand a non-terminal into two other non-terminals, until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, it might be easier to try to parse the string from the start, working backward or forward, to see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the entire string. It starts with t466. Let's see which production rules produce t466. Looking at the productions, I see that NT60 -> 't637' and NT217 -> 't467'. Wait, t467 is different from t466, so maybe t466 comes from a different production.\n\nLooking again: NT60 -> 't637' is for t637, which is not helpful. Hmm. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t466. Scanning all right-hand sides, I don't see any production for a terminal other than t466, t14, etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, some non-terminals produce t's, but I'm probably misreading. Let me look carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT588 -> 't37' (t37)\nNT946 -> 't131'\nNT964 -> 't640'\nNT990 -> 't817'\nNT367 -> 't30' (I think, but might be elsewhere)\nNT530 -> 't60' -> wait, NT530 produces 't60', but 't60' is another terminal.\n\nWait, in the string, the terms are t466, t14, t217, t573, t98, etc. So I need to see if each of these terminals can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- 't466' is produced by NT933, looking at the productions, yes: NT933 -> 't466'. Because NT933 is one of the non-terminals, and it directly produces 't466'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- t14 is produced by NT487? Wait, looking at the productions: I see NT487 has two rules: nt487->nt103 nt486 and nt487->nt933 nt389. No, those are non-terminals. Wait, in the productions, does any NT produce 't14'? Yes: looking through, the productions, I see NT990 -> 't817'; wait, let me search systematically.\n\nWait, from the list:\n\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\n...\nLooking through all the right-hand sides for 't':\n\n- NT933 -> 't466' \u2705\n- NT951 -> 't464' (no, it's 't466' earlier maybe)\n- NT697 -> 't378' \u2705\n- NT195-> 't278' \u2705\n- NT367-> 't30' \u2705\n- NT409-> 't555' \u274c\n- NT951-> 't14' \u2705 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check.)\n\nLooking back at the provided productions:\n\nLooking for 't14', I see: \n\nIt's there: NT951 -> 't466' is not. Wait, actually, wait:\n\nLooking at NT951: two productions? Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions for NT951: Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- 'NT990 -> 't817''\n- 'NT991... Hmm, let's check:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, searching for terminals:\n\n- NT530 -> 't60'\n\nLooking for all occurrences of 't' as a terminal:\n\n- NT933 -> 't466'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT217-> 't467'\n- NT217 (another one) -> 't592'\n- NT951 -> 't14'\n- NT409 -> 't555'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT351-> 't10' (wait, no: NT351-> NT10 NT217. But looking for 't10', no. Wait, 't10' is not directly produced, but let's see.\n\nLooking for 't14': It's produced by NT951, because in the productions, NT951 -> NT147 NT951 and also NT951 -> 't466'? Wait, no, wait. Looking back:\n\nWait, in the provided productions, I see:\n\n- NT147 -> NT367 NT591\n- NT226 -> NT399 NT368\n- NT530 -> NT60 NT446\n- NT10 -> NT147 NT951\n- NT833 -> NT9 NT894\n- NT569 -> NT195 NT588\n- NT446 -> NT636 NT226\n- NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n- NT591 -> 't555'\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT389 -> 't689'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT60 -> 't637'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT60 -> 't573'\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n- NT951 -> 't466', I think.\n\nWait, that last part: looking through the productions, I see that NT951 -> 't466'? Or is it NT951 -> 't14'?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nThe only 't' terminal seems to be 't14' in one production. Let me check the full list again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nLooking for any productions where a non-terminal directly goes to a 't':\n\n- NT487 has two productions to non-terminals.\n\n- NT933 has one production: NT933 -> 't466'\n\n- NT951 has one production: NT951 -> 't14'\n\n- NT697 has one production: NT697 -> 't378'\n\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n\n- NT591 -> 't555'\n\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n\n- NT389 -> 't689'\n\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n\n- NT60 -> 't637'\n\n- NT256 also has another production to NT446, which then goes to NT636 and NT226, which gives 't777' and so on.\n\nWait, so the only terminals in the grammar are:\n\nt466, t14, t278, t555, t378, t37, t131, t98, t777, t593, t466, t951, etc. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nBut in the given string, the terms are t466, t14, t217, t573, t98, t535, t98, t817, t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-135","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t37 t30 t640 t573 t98 t555 t30 t592 t98 t98 t637 t640 t777` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing potentially easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production is S -> NT487 NT993. That means the string must start with NT487 and then NT993. NT487 and NT993 are both non-terminals, so I need to see their productions.\n\nLet's look at NT487. It has two productions:\n1. NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nAnd NT993 produces NT256 NT833.\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT103 NT486 and then NT256 NT833, or NT933 NT389 and then NT256 NT833.\n\nNow, looking at the input string, it starts with t37. Wait, let me check the grammar. Hmm, in the grammar, the symbols like NT487 have productions that eventually lead to terminals. So I need to see the terminal symbols in the string and match them to the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. The string is a sequence of t followed by three-digit numbers, like t37, t30, etc. So each of these must correspond to the terminal symbols produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminal symbols from the grammar:\n- t37\n- t30\n- t640\n- t573\n- t98\n- t555\n- t777\n- t637\n- t592\n- t640 (again)\n- t98 (again)\n- t637 (again)\n- t777 (again)\n- t363\n- t894\n- t993\n- t588\n- t933\n- t389\n- t697\n- t964\n- t990\n- t367\n\nWait, the input string has t37, t30, t640, t573, t98, t555, t30, t592, t98, t98, t637, t640, t777. Let me see which of these are present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are:\n- t37\n- t30\n- t640\n- t573\n- t98\n- t555\n- t777\n- t637\n- t592\n- t98\n- t637\n- t777\n- t363\n- t894\n- t993\n- t588\n- t933\n- t389\n- t697\n- t964\n- t990\n- t367\n\nSo, the input string is composed of terminals mostly in this set. Now I need to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n`t37 t30 t640 t573 t98 t555 t30 t592 t98 t98 t637 t640 t777`\n\nLet me write down each token in order:\n1. t37\n2. t30\n3. t640\n4. t573\n5. t98\n6. t555\n7. t30\n8. t592\n9. t98\n10. t98\n11. t637\n12. t640\n13. t777\n\nNow, let's try to break down the string into the grammar's structure.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT487 NT993.\n\nSo the first symbol is NT487, which produces either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLet's check what NT103 produces. NT103 -> NT673 NT964.\n\nNT673 -> t848\nNT964 -> t640\n\nSo NT103 becomes t848 t640.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t37, not t848. So perhaps NT487 is using the other production: NT933 NT389.\n\nNT933 -> NT389 NT588. Wait, no, looking back, NT933 produces NT389 NT588. Wait, in the grammar, NT933 is NT389 NT588? Let me check.\n\nWait, grammar shows:\n- NT933 -> NT389 NT588\n\nSo NT933 is followed by NT389 and NT588.\n\nBut NT389 is a production that becomes 't689', and NT588 is 't37'.\n\nWait, but wait, the input string starts with t37, so if NT933 is part of the production, then perhaps NT933 is followed by NT389 and then NT588. But that would mean after t37 comes t689, which isn't the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's try again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the start is S->NT487 NT993. So the sequence starts with either (NT103 NT486) or (NT933 NT389). So the first two symbols after S would be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nBut in the input, the first symbol is t37. NT487's two options are:\n\n1. NT103 NT486: which would lead to NT103 -> NT673 NT964.\n\nSo NT103 breaks down into t848 t640.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t37. So that doesn't match. So perhaps S is using the other production, which is NT933 NT389.\n\nBut then NT933 -> NT389 NT588. So the next tokens would be NT389 followed by NT588. Let's see.\n\nNT389 is a production that becomes 't689'.\n\nNT588 becomes 't37'.\n\nSo if S uses the production NT933 NT389, then the first tokens after S would be NT933, then NT389, then NT588. But in the string, the first token is t37, which would have to be NT933's terminal. But NT933 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal that splits into NT389 and NT588. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding this.\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT933 is a non-terminal, which must produce NT389 and NT588. So the string after t37 would have to be NT389 and NT588, which are t689 and t37. But the string starts with t37, which would have to be the result of NT588, not NT933. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the first symbols. Let's slow down.\n\nThe string is t37 t30 t640 t573 t98 t555 t30 t592 t98 t98 t637 t640 t777.\n\nLet me think about the production steps.\n\nFirst, S produces NT487 and NT993. So the first two symbols must correspond to NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487, its productions are:\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSo each of these non-terminals must produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet's take the first case: NT487 -> NT103 NT486.\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964.\n\nNT673 -> t848\n\nNT964 -> t640\n\nSo NT103 -> t848 t640.\n\nBut the string starts with t37, not t848.

I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't217'. From the rules, 't217' is produced by NT217, which has two rules: NT217 -> 't467' or 't592'. So either way, it can produce 't217', but also could produce other t's. Wait, actually, in the string, 't217' appears as the first and later again. So I think that might not be a problem. Wait, no, the rule for NT217 is to produce either 't467' or 't592', but in the string, it's 't217' so that might be a problem. Wait, wait, looking back, the rules for NT217 are:\n\nNT217 -> 't467' or 't592'. So 't217' is not a production of NT217. That seems odd. So the string starts with 't217', but according to the grammar, NT217 can only produce 't467' or 't592'. Hmm, that might be an issue. So if the string starts with 't217', but NT217 can't produce 't217', that might mean it's impossible. So perhaps the answer is No. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rules. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nLooking at NT217's rules: It's pointing to 't467' and 't592'. So 't217' is not a production. Therefore, the first token 't217' can't be produced by any non-terminal. That must mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which non-terminal is producing 't217'. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, NT217 has two rules: NT217-> t467 and NT217-> t592. So neither of those produce 't217', only 't467' and 't592'. So the first token 't217' can't be produced by any non-terminal, which means the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in understanding NT217's rules.

Wait, looking back, the rule for NT217 is:\n\nNT217 -> NT367 NT591\n\nWait, but according to the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT217 -> NT367 NT591\n\nAnd NT591 -> 't804' as per the rules:\n\n- NT591 -> 't804'\n\nSo then, how do we get 't592' from NT217? Wait, let me check the correct rules again. Oh, wait, no, because the given grammar rules may have multiple options, but in the initial list provided, I don't see 't592' being an alternative.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-159","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has non-terminals like S, NT9, NT226, etc., and some of these non-terminals are connected to terminals, which are the letters and numbers in the string.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the structure of the grammar better. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that most of the right-hand sides are two non-terminals except for a few which have a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which is a combination of two non-terminals, while NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530 also a combination, but some like NT487 can produce a terminal (t363) or another combination.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is `t14 t848 t689 t535 t640 t278 t817 t467 t363 t363 t892 t372 t535 t217`. It's a sequence of 14 tokens, all terminals. So each of these must be generated by some production rule in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to break down the string step by step. Let's see if we can start from the start symbol S and derive the string or work backward from the string to see if it can be reached by the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT487 NT993. So the first two symbols must come from NT487 and NT993. Let's check the string: the first four tokens are t14 and t848. Wait, no, the string is t14, then t848, which would come from NT487, which can produce t14 (if that's one of its productions). Let me check the NT487 productions.\n\nLooking at NT487, it has two productions: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. Neither of these directly produce a terminal, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, under NT487, there are options: the first production is NT103 and NT486, and the second is NT933 and NT389. None of these seem to produce a terminal, because NT103 \u2192 ... but wait, looking back, I see that some of the non-terminals do produce terminals. For example, NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446, and NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573'? Wait, no, looking more carefully, the NT530 production is NT60 NT446, where NT60 \u2192 't637' is one of the options. Wait, but in the initial grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some lines like NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573'? Let me try to recall: let's list some rules.\n\nLooking back, here are the relevant parts:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\n\nNT147 \u2192 't367'\n\nSo NT10 can produce 't367' and 't466'.\n\nSimilarly, NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446, and both NT60 and NT446 can produce terminals: NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573'; NT446 \u2192 NT636 and 't226', but wait, looking at NT446: it's written as NT636 being 't777' and NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226, but that's a production. Wait, actually, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n...\nNT60 \u2192 't637' and another entry:\nWait, wait, no, looking again, the lines given include:\n\nLine 5: NT60 \u2192 't637'\n\nLine 7: NT256 \u2192 NT98 (since NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT256 would be a production, but no, wait, the given grammar lines are:\n\nLooking back, the grammar lines are:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\nNT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\nNT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\nNT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\nNT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\nNT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nNT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\nNT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\nNT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\nNT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\nNT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\nNT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT591 \u2192 't848'\nNT636 \u2192 't777'\nNT389 \u2192 't689'\nNT588 \u2192 't37'\nNT946 \u2192 't131'\nNT195 \u2192 't278'\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\nNT256 \u2192 't98'\nNT60 \u2192 't573'\nNT347 \u2192 't593'\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\nNT217 \u2192 't467'\nNT409 \u2192 't555'\nNT368 \u2192 't237'\nNT399 \u2192 't372'\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\nNT217 \u2192 't592'\nNT951 \u2192 't14'\nNT486 \u2192 't363'\nNT894 \u2192 't892'\nNT993 \u2192 't444'\nNT588 \u2192 't535'\nNT933 \u2192 't217'\nNT697 \u2192 't378'\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\nNT990 \u2192 't817'\nNT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo, looking at NT487: It can produce NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389. Neither of these non-terminals produce a terminal, so to get t14, t848, etc., those must come from other productions that generate terminals.\n\nLet me process the given string token by token, starting from the first, which is t14.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t14 is produced by NT10 \u2192 't367' or 't466'? Wait, looking back, NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951. From earlier, NT147 \u2192 't367' and NT951 \u2192 't466'. So, NT10 can produce 't367' and 't466'. Oh wait, but in the string, the first token is t14. Wait, so perhaps that's a problem because none of the direct productions of S or NT487 or NT993 directly produce 't14' as a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the first two tokens must be the results of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487: It's either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. If it can't directly produce a terminal, perhaps it has to generate more symbols. So NT487 is a non-terminal that goes through another production. For example, NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, which again don't produce terminals. So, perhaps deeper productions are needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal on the left. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S -> NT487 NT993. So any string generated by this grammar must start with NT487 and then NT993, right? Looking at the string, it starts with 't98', which is a terminal. But the first production is NT487 \u2192 something. Wait, let me check the productions for NT487.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT487 has two options: it can become NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Both are non-terminals. So whatever comes after the first NT487 must come from these options. \n\nLooking at the string: t98 t217 ... Let's see, t98 matches NT946 because in the grammar, NT946 \u2192 't946'. So if NT487 \u2192 NT946, then we have t98 there. But looking at the NT487 options, one of them is NT946 \u2192 't946', which is exactly t98. So that fits. So the first part is t98 from NT487.\n\nNext, after NT487, we have NT993. Looking at NT993, let's see what it can produce. In the grammar, NT993 appears in the production S -> NT487 NT993, which is the starting point. But looking at the productions, do any of the non-terminals produce NT993? Hmm, checking the grammar, I don't see any productions for NT993 except as part of S. Wait, wait, maybe I misread it. Oh, wait, the NT993 is in the initial S production, but looking further, I don't see any other productions for NT993. So is NT993 a terminal?

S starts with NT487 and NT993. So if NT993 produces anything, but in the given grammar, NT993 is only present in S but doesn't have its own production. So does that mean NT993 is a terminal? Or perhaps I missed it. Let me check: the initial S production is S -> NT487 NT993, so from S, we generate NT487 NT993. Now, we need to see what NT993 can become. But looking through all the productions, I don't see NT993 being defined as any combination, except perhaps in S. So perhaps NT993 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string we're evaluating, after the first t98, the next token is t217. So let's see, t217 comes from NT217 \u2192 't217' or maybe another production? Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT217 has a production to 't467' and another to 't592'. Wait, wait, actually, looking back, I think I made a mistake. In the grammar, NT217 is only in S as part of S, but in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT147 -> NT367 NT591\n\n- NT226 -> NT399 NT368\n\n- NT530 -> NT60 NT446\n\n- NT10 -> NT147 NT951\n\n- NT833 -> NT9 NT894\n\n- NT569 -> NT195 NT588\n\n- NT446 -> NT636 NT226\n\n- NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\n- NT591 -> 't804'\n\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n\n- NT389 -> 't689'\n\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n\n- NT60 -> 't637' and 't573'\n\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n\n- NT951 -> 't466' and 't14'\n\n- NT217 -> 't467' and 't592'\n\n- NT409 -> 't555'\n\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n\n- NT673 -> 't848'\n\n- NT399 -> Also, NT399 is in NT226's production: NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368, so NT399 \u2192 't372'\n\nWait, but the initial string is t98 t217 t98 t555 t640 t689 t363 t466 t592 t278 t535 t37 t592 t573 t640.\n\nWait, let's walk through the string step by step.\n\n1. The first part is t98, which comes from NT487 \u2192 't98' (NT487 \u2192 NT946 \u2192 't946' is one way, but in the given grammar, NT946 is present and it's a terminal. Wait, but in the initial production, S is NT487 NT993, so after NT487 is processed, we have NT993, which would need to produce a value. But from the grammar, NT993 is only present in S, so maybe it's a terminal. But according to the productions, NT993 isn't defined as anything else except being part of S.

{"custom_id":"request-164","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and then break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier using methods like the CYK algorithm, but perhaps I can construct the parse tree manually since the string isn't too long.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT487 NT993. So, the string should start with the two NTs that expand into these terminals. Let me look at the string: it starts with t535, t892, t444, etc.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT487 and NT993:\n- NT487 can be NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n- NT993 can be NT591 NT367 or others, but the string starts with t993, which is given as t993 -> 't444'. So, NT993 directly gives t444.\n\nWait, but the first part of the string is t535 t892 t444. So after S, the first NT is NT487, which might produce t535 and another term. Let me check NT487's productions.\n\nLooking at NT487's rules: one of them is NT103 NT486, and another is NT933 NT389. The initial part of the string has t535, so let me see if any NT leads to t535.\n\nWait, in the terminals, I see NT588 -> t535. So, maybe looking for NT588. But the start symbol starts with NT487, then NT993. So the string should be expansions of these two.\n\nWait, the string is: t535, t892, t444, t689, t278, t378, t372, t37, t363, t131, t237, t555, t14, t14, t804.\n\nI need to see if t535 is the first symbol. Since S expands to NT487 NT993, the first two symbols come from NT487 and NT993. NT993 directly gives t444, so the third symbol should be t444. Looking at the string, the third symbol is t444, which matches.\n\nSo starting with S: NT487 produces the first and fourth symbols. Wait, no, the expansion is NT487 and NT993. So after S, it's NT487 and NT993, generating the first two symbols. Wait, that can't be right because S is the start symbol, so the entire string is the expansion of S. So S produces NT487 followed by NT993, which are both non-terminals. Each of these will expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are binary, so each step expands one non-terminal into two, until all are terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, the start symbol S is NT487 NT993, meaning the initial production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the first part of the string is expansions of NT487 and NT993.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t535, which is a terminal. So let's look at NT487's possible derivations.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT487 can be NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Let's check if any of these can produce t535.\n\nWait, NT487's rules: NT103 and NT486. Checking terminal outputs:\n\n- NT486 \u2192 't363'\n- NT103 \u2192 't673' and 't964' (from NT103's productions: NT673 NT964)\n\nWait, but NT103 is a non-terminal. To get t535, I need to see if any NT leads to t535.\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\n- NT588 \u2192 't535'\n- Also, NT446 \u2192 't98', but not relevant here.\n\nSo, to get t535, we must have NT588. So perhaps the expansion of NT487 leads to NT588 at some point.\n\nBut wait, how does NT487 lead to NT588? Let me trace the possible expansions.\n\nNT487 can go to NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nIf it goes to NT103 NT486, then:\n\nNT103 can produce 't673' or 't964'. Neither is t535. So that path wouldn't help.\n\nAlternatively, if NT487 goes to NT933 NT389, then:\n\nNT933 and NT389.\n\nLooking at NT933's rules:\n\nNT933 \u2192 NT217 NT372. Wait, looking at the NT933 production: I think I may have made a mistake. Wait, in the grammar, NT933 is \u2192 NT217 NT372? Or perhaps it's another combo.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT933, let's see: from the provided rules, I don't see NT933 listed as a production, so perhaps I'm remembering that wrong. Wait no, looking again, I see:\n\nNT933 -> NT217 NT372\n\nWait, no, looking through the provided rules, I think the correct one is NT933 \u2192 ... Hmm, maybe I forgot.

{"custom_id":"request-174","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production rule on the left-hand side (LHS) side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. That's important because it affects how the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Each of these NT's eventually breaks down into terminals or other NT's that produce terminals. Some of the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't30', 't892', etc. Others are three-digit numbers, like NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530. So, each step in the grammar either combines two non-terminals or eventually terminates with a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t30 t892 t689 t777 t535 t535 t30 t237 t37 t237 t363 t237 t98 t640 t640 t555.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules. \n\nStarting with S, which is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT487 and NT993. Let's see what those produce.\n\nLooking at NT487\u2019s productions:\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo, from NT487, we can get either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Similarly, NT993 needs to be analyzed. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT993 appears in two production rules:\nNT993 \u2192 NT569 NT756\nBut I don't see NT993 being on the RHS of any other rules. So, NT993 must derive into NT569 NT756.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The production rules are listed, and I don't see NT993 on the LHS except once. So, NT993 only appears as the LHS of one rule, but since it's in the right-hand side, it's derived from NT569 and NT756. Hmm, but actually, looking at the grammar, I see that NT993 is on the RHS, but as the LHS, it's only in one rule, which is nt993 \u2192 nt569 nt756. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the user provided a list of production rules, and in that list, NT993 is a terminal or not? Let me look through the list. I see NT993 only appears on the RHS in the production S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So S is the start symbol, which must produce NT487 and NT993. But NT487 and NT993 are non-terminals. So from S, we must have NT487 \u2192 something and NT993 \u2192 something.\n\nBut wait, looking at the production rules, NT993 is used in the production S \u2192 NT487 NT993, but is there any rule for NT993 on the left side? It seems not. So that can't be right because NT993 would have nowhere to go except maybe as a terminal, but in the grammar, NT993 is written as a separate entity on the RHS of S. Hmm, perhaps I misread the rules.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar provided:\n\nThe grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\n\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\n\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\n\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\n\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\n\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\n\nNT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n\nNT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\n\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n\nNT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\n\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n\nNT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n\nNT591 \u2192 't804'\n\nNT636 \u2192 't777'\n\nNT389 \u2192 't689'\n\nNT588 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT946 \u2192 't131'\n\nNT195 \u2192 't278'\n\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\n\nNT256 \u2192 't98'\n\nNT60 \u2192 't573'\n\nNT347 \u2192 't593'\n\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\n\nNT217 \u2192 't467'\n\nNT409 \u2192 't555'\n\nNT368 \u2192 't237'\n\nNT399 \u2192 't372'\n\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\n\nNT217 \u2192 't592'\n\nWait, hold on, that last line for NT217 says \"NT217 -> t592\". That seems odd because in CNF, the RHS should consist of either two non-terminals or a terminal. But here, NT217 is a non-terminal, and it's producing a terminal 't592'. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut in the original problem, the string has several 't' terms. But then I notice that in the given grammar, some of the NT's produce terminals, and others produce other NT's. So, the goal is to see if the string can be broken down into these terminals.\n\nNow, the string is: t30 t892 t689 t777 t535 t535 t30 t237 t37 t237 t363 t237 t98 t640 t640 t555.\n\nLet me note that NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446, and NT60 can produce either t637 or t573 (as per rules, wait, looking at NT60: in the rules, NT60 is on both sides with different productions. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some lines have NT60 on both sides. For example:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\n\nand\n\nNT60 \u2192 't573'\n\nIs that correct? Because NT60 as a non-terminal would produce either 't637' or 't573', which are both terminals. So, that makes NT60 a terminal? Or does that mean it's a mistake?\n\nWait, that can't be. Because in a CFG, a non-terminal must produce symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. But having two productions that result in the same terminal is okay, but it's redundant. But having a non-terminal produce a terminal and another non-terminal or another terminal may complicate things.\n\nWait, but looking back, I see that the given production for NT60 is:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\nNT60 \u2192 't573'\n\nSo, that implies that NT60 can produce any of these terminals, and since both produce different terminals, it's possible for NT60 to choose either one. So, in the string, whenever there's a 't637' or 't573', that would be generated by NT60.\n\nBut wait, in the string we have 't30', which isn't in the terminals listed. Looking at the grammar, the only NT producing 't30' isn't directly shown. Wait, where is 't30'? Let me check the production rules. Hmm, looking through the grammar, I don't see 't30' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string includes 't30' which isn't present in any of the given terminal productions.

Wait, no. NT636 \u2192 't777', yes. So, if `t640` is part of the string, which it is, but I don't see any NT generating `t640`. Let me check all production rules:\n\nLooking at NT756: NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833. Let me see where `t640` could come from. None of the non-terminals seem to produce `t640`.

This is a problem because each token in the string must come from a production, either directly or through intermediate steps.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in looking? Let me list all the possible t tokens and see which NT they come from:\n\n- `t593` \u2192 NT389\n- `t640` \u2192 Not found, no NT directly produces `t640`\n- `t689` \u2192 NT389 or NT964\n- `t804` \u2192 NT951 (second option)\n- `t848` \u2192 NT60 (second option)\n- `t592` \u2192 NT147 or NT217\n- `t637` \u2192 NT60 (first option)\n- `t467` \u2192 NT673\n- `t848` \u2192 NT60 (second option)\n\nWait, but the string has `t640`, which is not accounted for. That means the string includes a token that doesn't come from any NT production. Let me double-check the grammar to see if any NT produces `t640`. Looking through the list:\n\nNT147 \u2192 't848' or 't30'\nNT226 \u2192 `t399` or `t368` \u2192 `t372` or `t237`\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 or 't446?\nWait, NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446, which are both non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nSo, the string I have is: `t378 t535 t535 t378 t363 t237 t14 t237 t444 t593 t217 t363 t555 t444 t278 t573 t378`.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that some symbols like NTx are non-terminals and 't' followed by numbers are terminals. The string consists entirely of terminal symbols, so my job is to see if the start symbol S can derive this string.\n\nLet me look for the productions that end in 't's because that's where the string elements are. \n\nFor example, NT487 can produce NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Both of these end in 't's: NT486 is 't363' and NT389 is 't378'. Similarly, NT487 itself can produce those.\n\nAlso, looking at NT697, it goes to NT351 NT409, which is 't37' and 't444' respectively. That's a mix of 't's, but important.\n\nI'm going to sketch out the possible chain of productions starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol S is NT487 NT993. Both NT487 and NT993 need to produce the first elements of the string, which are 't378' and 't535'. \n\nLooking at NT487, it can produce NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Let's see what those produce. NT486 is 't363', which is in the string. NT933 can produce NT217 NT389 (which are 't444' and 't378'), or NT697 NT636. If I choose NT697, it can go to NT351 NT409, which are 't37' and 't444'. So let's see:\n\nNT486 is 't363', which is the 5th element in the string. NT933 would be the 4th element, which is 't378'. Wait, the string is in order: \n\n1: t378, 2: t535, 3:t535, 4: t378, 5:t363, 6:t237, 7:t14, 8:t237, 9:t444, 10:t593, 11:t217, 12:t363, 13:t555, 14:t444, 15:t278, 16:t573, 17:t378.\n\nSo NT487 producing NT933 NT389 would mean the 4th element is 't378' (from NT389), which is correct. The 5th element is 't363' which is from NT486.\n\nNow, NT993: looking at the productions, NT993 can go to NT147 NT951, NT195 NT588, etc. \n\nLooking at NT951: it's 't466', which isn't in the string. But wait, NT951 can also go to NT217 NT467, but 467 isn't in the string. Alternatively, NT993 might produce 't535'. Let's check its productions.\n\nWait, looking at NT993, I don't see it being directly a terminal. It must produce something. So NT993's productions are:\n\nNT993 -> NT591 't466'?\n\nWait, actually the grammar is structured such that NTxxx sometimes have t followed by numbers, and sometimes have other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the productions that end in 't' and see how they fit into the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, noticing that the string has several 't363's and 't378's and 't237's, and 't444's.\n\nLooking at NT60: it can produce 't637' or 't573'. 't573' is in the string as element 16: 't573' which corresponds to 16th position. So perhaps NT60 is somewhere in the derivation.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t378 t535 t535 t378 t363 t237 t14 t237 t444 t593 t217 t363 t555 t444 t278 t573 t378.\n\n1: t378\n2: t535\n3: t535\n4: t378\n5: t363\n6: t237\n7: t14\n8: t237\n9: t444\n10: t593\n11: t217\n12: t363\n13: t555\n14: t444\n15: t278\n16: t573\n17: t378\n\nNow, the start symbol is S = NT487 NT993.\n\nWe need to derive the entire string, so:\n\nFirst production: S -> NT487 NT993.\n\nSo the first symbols would be the first elements of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487's productions, which can go to NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nIf NT486 is 't363' (element 5), then that would fit if NT487 produces NT933 NT389. So let's say S starts with NT933 NT389.\n\nSo the first element of NT487's production is t378 (element 1 is 't378'), which would correspond to NT389 -> 't378'.\n\nWait, but NT389 can produce 't378' as per the rules: NT389 -> NT569 NT756 or NT569 NT756 -> 't697' and 't351'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see where each 't' in the string can come from.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that some NTs produce terminal symbols:\n\nFor example, NT60 can produce 't637' or 't573'. NT337 isn't present, but perhaps I should list all NTs that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, here's a list of NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT486 -> 't363'\n\nNT569 -> 't697'\n\nNT756 -> 't446' (Wait, no, NT756's production is 't256' and 't833'?)\n\nWait, wait, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT487: produce 't363' or 't378'\n\nWait, no, the NTx are on the left, and on the right, sometimes they are 't...' or other NTs.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n\nAnd NT486 is a terminal ('t363')\n\nSo in the production, for example, NT487 can produce 't363' after NT933.\n\nSimilarly, NT389 -> NT569 NT756 or NT569 NT756 (same?), wait let's see:\n\nWait, the production for NT389 is: NT389 -> NT569 NT756, but I don't see 't..' from NT569 and NT756. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking back: \n\nLooking at NT569's productions:\n\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\n\nNT195 -> 't278'\n\nWait, NT569 -> NT195 NT588, both NT, so it doesn't produce a 't'.

{"custom_id":"request-198","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to check one string, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string `t466 t237 t237 t30 t689 t363 t817 t592 t640 t573 t372 t555 t466 t98 t378 t777 t640` can be generated by the given grammar. I notice that the string consists of a sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers. Each 't' is followed by a three-digit number, so maybe each 't' represents a step in the derivation where the number is part of the left-hand side or right-hand side of the productions.\n\nLet me list out the production rules first to understand how they can generate these 't' strings. The non-terminals are NT followed by some number, like NT226, NT487, etc. Each of these non-terminals can be expanded into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the start string must derive from NT487 and NT993 in some order. Let's see what NT487 and NT993 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT487's productions:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo each NT487 can branch into two paths. Similarly, NT993's production is a terminal: NT993 \u2192 't444'.\n\nSo, for the entire string to be generated, the part after NT993 must be 't444'. Let's check if the last token is 't640', but wait, the string ends with 't640', which is part of 't990' I think. Wait, let me re-examine the string. The string is:\n\nt466 t237 t237 t30 t689 t363 t817 t592 t640 t573 t372 t555 t466 t98 t378 t777 t640.\n\nWait, the very last token is 't640' but in the grammar, the production for S includes S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the end should be generated by NT993, which produces 't444'. But the last token is 't640', which is a terminal. Let's see where 't640' comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't640' appears as a production. It's in the production for NT777: NT777 \u2192 't640'. Also, NT993 is 't444', so unless S's second part is something else.\n\nWait, I think I need to carefully map each 't' to the corresponding production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 't' is a part of a longer production chain. Since the string has 17 tokens, each possibly corresponding to a step in the derivation, let's see if there's a way to map this.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check if each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t466\n- t237\n- t30\n- t689\n- t363\n- t817\n- t592\n- t640\n- t573\n- t372\n- t555\n- t466\n- t98\n- t378\n- t777\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, each non-terminal might expand into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nBut the string is a series of 't's followed by numbers. Each of these could be a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo, for example, 't466' in the string could correspond to the 't466' terminal in the grammar, but looking at the productions, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly expands to 't466' except maybe via NT60 \u2192 't637', but 't466' isn't listed as a direct terminal. Wait, wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT588 -> 't37', NT446 -> 't363', NT933 -> 't217', NT697 -> 't378', NT60 -> 't637', etc. Hmm, I don't see direct generations for 't466', but let me check again.\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let me go through the rules one by one:\n\n- S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n- NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\n- NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT530\n- NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\n- NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\n- NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\n- NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n- NT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n- NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT591 \u2192 't804'\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n- NT588 \u2192 't37'\n- NT946 \u2192 't131'\n- NT195 \u2192 't278'\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT60 \u2192 't573'\n- NT347 \u2192 't593'\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\n- NT409 \u2192 't555'\n- NT368 \u2192 't237'\n- NT399 \u2192 't372'\n- NT673 \u2192 't848'\n- NT217 \u2192 't592'\n- NT951 \u2192 't14'\n- NT486 \u2192 't363'\n- NT894 \u2192 't892'\n- NT993 \u2192 't444'\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' token corresponds to a production that generates that terminal. For example, NT993 \u2192 't444', so that would be the end part of the derivation. So in the string, after generating S \u2192 NT487 NT993, the NT993 part must generate t444, but in the string, the last part is t640, which isn't t444. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, the string ends with 't640', but according to the grammar, the only production ending with 't640' is NT777 \u2192 't640'.

So, I should check if the string starts with the productions of NT487 and NT993.

Oh, I see, the NT993 is actually NT487 NT546, but I don't have that production in the given rules. Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n- NT546 isn't a production I see. Oh, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me look again. Oh, no, in the grammar provided, there's no NT993 production except perhaps I missed it. Wait, the start symbol is S -> NT487 NT993, but looking through the rules, I don't see NT993 being defined. So that's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be NT493 or another terminal. Alternatively, perhaps NT993 is part of another rule, but I don't see it. \n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the NT productions. Let me list them:\n\nNT487: can produce NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389\nNT487 also appears as a terminal in NT486, which is 't363', so maybe that's a terminal?\nWait, no, NT487 is a non-terminal. So, the string starts with 't640', which might be derived from some NT. Let's find which NTs produce 't640'. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT444 -> 't535'\n- NT98 -> 't98'\n- NT446 -> 't98' as well, since NT446 -> NT636 NT226, which in turn goes to 't777' and NT226. Wait, that might not be directly relevant. \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by parsing the string and seeing if each terminal matches a single production step, tracing back to the start symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary tree, so each terminal must be the result of a series of steps where each step breaks down a non-terminal into two parts until they hit terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string is: `t640 t131 t592 t777 t30 t372 t689 t555 t217 t777 t817 t217 t466 t573 t444 t535 t98 t98`.\n\nI'll start from the left.\n\n1. The first symbol is 't640'. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce 't640'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT444 -> 't535'\n- NT98 -> 't98'\n\nWait, I don't see 't640' directly. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe NT636 is 't777', so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think recursively. Let's see if any of the NTs can produce 't640' directly. Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't640'. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, in the rules, NT446 -> NT636 NT226, and NT636 -> 't777', and NT226 -> NT399 NT368, and so on. But that leads to multiple steps. But in the string, 't640' appears first. So perhaps 't640' must come from some NT.\n\nWait, but in the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't640'. That might mean that the string isn't in the language, because 't640' isn't present as a terminal in any of the productions. Unless, perhaps, I made a mistake in reading the rules.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the rules. Terminals are any part that isn't a non-terminal. So in the rules, the right-hand sides have some NTs and some 'tX' strings. So the terminals are 't640', 't131', 't592', 't777', 't30', 't372', 't689', 't555', 't217', 't466', 't573', 't444', 't535', 't98', 't363', 't894', 't992', 't444', 't535', etc. Wait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, the terminals are:\n\n- 't640' (NT636 -> 't777')\n- 't131' (NT131 is not a production, wait, looking for 't' followed by numbers: \nWait, in the rules:\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT444 -> 't535'\n- NT98 -> 't98'\n- NT446 -> 't98' (since it goes to NT636 and NT226, and then NT636 -> 't777', but maybe via other steps)\n- Wait, but where is 't640' in the productions? It seems I might have made a mistake because in the initial grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't640'. So that might mean the string isn't generated by this grammar, hence the answer is 'No'. But wait, perhaps I should check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, do any of them produce 't640'? Let's see:\n\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT444 -> 't535'\n- NT98 -> 't98'\n- Other rules produce combinations of NTs which translate into multiple 't's.\n\nSince there's no NT that directly produces 't640', then 't640' doesn't appear in any of the productions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no: Let's take the string and see each token and match it to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t467, t592, t555, t37, t372, t640, t278, t372, t278, t278, t278, t217, t372, t804, t592, t637, t535, t593.\n\nStarting with S-> NT487 NT993. So NT487 and NT993 must both derive into a terminal string.\n\nLooking at NT487: the productions are:\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSo both these paths lead to more non-terminals. Let's follow each.\n\nFirst, NT487 -> NT103 NT486.\n\nNT103: it has a production NT103 -> 't673' (from NT673 -> 't673'), right? Because looking at NT673's production: NT673 -> 't673'. So t673 is generated from NT673.\n\nNT486: has production NT486 -> 't363' (from NT894 -> 't892', wait, no: looking at NT486 it's 't363'. NT486 -> 't363'.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT486 -> 't363'. Yes.\n\nSo the entire NT487 -> NT103 NT486 would first become t673 and t363. But in the string, after t467 comes t592, which is significantly higher. So perhaps this path isn't leading correctly.\n\nAlternatively, let's take the other production for NT487: NT487 -> NT933 NT389.\n\nNT933: Let's see its production. Looking at the grammar, NT933 isn't directly listed, but perhaps it can derive into something. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT933, it seems it's not directly present, but let's check if any non-terminal can produce it. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's look for NT933 \u2192 which in the grammar's LHS. Wait, looking back, the grammar includes NT993 as the original, but does it have any production for NT933?\n\nWait, the grammar as given includes NT993 as the terminal, but looking at all the LHS, it's NT993 is in the first production S\u2192NT487NT993. But looking through the non-terminals, I don't see NT933. So maybe NT933 is not a non-terminal, but perhaps it's a terminal. But in the string, t933 is not present, but we have t217, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the list again:\n\nLooking at the grammar's LHS, I see NT933 is not present as a production. So NT933 is a terminal? But in the string, do we have any t933? No. So that's confusing. So perhaps this path is not feasible.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nI don't see NT933 in the LHS of any production except perhaps in the case where a non-terminal can produce it. Wait, NT389 is an option in another production, let's see.\n\nWait, maybe NT933 is a non-terminal that can produce a 't' plus a digit. Let's look. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT933 -> 't689'? No, perhaps. Let me check. No, checking each production, I don't see NT933 as a leading non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the production for NT951 is 't466', and NT217 is 't467'. So if NT487 uses NT933, which may lead to 't689', but in the string, that's not present. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the right path.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me approach it differently. I'll try to parse the string using the grammar step by step.\n\nThe string is: t467 t592 t555 t37 t372 t640 t278 t372 t278 t278 t278 t217 t372 t804 t592 t637 t535 t593.\n\nWe start with S: S->NT487 NT993. So we need NT487 and NT993 to both derive into a string of terminals that match the string.\n\nLet's see what NT487 and NT993 can produce.\n\nFirst, NT487 has two productions:\n\n1. NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nWe need to see if either of these can generate a part of the string starting with t467.\n\nLooking at option 1: NT487 -> NT103 NT486.\n\nNT103: From the grammar, NT103 -> 't673'.\n\nNT486: From the grammar, NT486 -> 't363'.\n\nSo this production would give 't673 t363', which doesn't match the string. The string starts with t467, so this path is not matching.\n\nNext, option 2: NT487 -> NT933 NT389.\n\nWe don't have a production for NT933, so either:\n\na) NT933 is a terminal, but in the string, there's no t933, or\nb) Maybe NT933 can produce t933, but that's not in the list of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar includes some other non-terminals that can generate t933, but from the given grammar, I don't see that. So maybe NT933 is a terminal, but in the string, t933 is not present.\n\nSo, this path (using NT933) doesn't seem to produce t467 because NT60 and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF requires every production rule to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT487 NT993. Each of these non-terminals then produces other combinations until they reach terminals. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived by starting from S and applying these production rules.\n\nThe string provided starts with `t444` and ends with `593`. Let me look through the grammar to see how these terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the grammar:\n\n- NT487 can produce t363 (via NT487 \u2192 NT486) and also NT486 \u2192 t363, but wait, let me check.

So the first step is to produce NT487 and NT993. Let's break down NT487 and NT993.\n\nNT487 has two production rules: \n1. NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSimilarly, NT993 \u2192 NT588 NT988? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT993 produces NT444 NT389 because NT993 is defined as NT444 NT389? Wait, no, looking back: The grammar is in the provided context, so let me check in the production rules. Oh, wait, the user included the grammar, so let's check the production for NT993. Looking through the list, I see NT993 is defined as? Wait, I think the user's grammar might have a typo because in the list, the production rules are all in the form of NTxyz -> NTa NTb. But wait, looking at the user's message:\n\nProduction rules start with S->NT487 NT993, then NT9->..., etc. So, for example, NT993 isn't directly defined in the rules given. Wait, perhaps I need to look carefully.\n\nWait, in the list, the first production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Then NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530, etc. So it seems that NT993 is a non-terminal, but in the production list, I don't see NT993 appears on the left side except for S. So I think the grammar has only the rules listed, so perhaps NT993 is a non-terminal that only appears in S's rule, and no other rules. That would be unusual, but perhaps the user made a mistake, or it's intended.\n\nWait, but if NT993 doesn't produce anything else, then it's just a non-terminal that S uses but doesn't expand. That can't be right. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production for NT993 is NT944 NT389 or something like that. Wait, let me check the user's message again.

Let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT487: no t's\n- NT389 -> NT569 NT756\n- NT697 -> NT351 NT409\n- NT10 -> NT147 NT951\n- NT833 -> NT9 NT894\n- NT569 -> NT195 NT588\n- NT147 -> NT367 NT591\n- NT591 -> 't804'\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT588 -> 't37' and 't535'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT60 -> 't637' and 't573'\n- NT217 -> 't467'\n- NT409 -> 't555'\n- NT368 -> 't237'\n- NT399 is in two places but only in NT226, which is non-terminal, so perhaps not relevant here.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t573 t777 t592 t467 t592 t777 t689 t131 t131 t30 t637 t592 t777 t278 t848 t555 t637 t467 t30.\n\nWait, upon closer look, the string starts with t573, which is produced by NT60. So, the initial step would be to see that the start symbol S produces NT9 (since S->NT9 NT487). So, perhaps the derivation starts with S -> NT9 NT487.\n\nNow, evaluating the string step by step:\n\n1. The first token is t573. That comes from NT60 -> 't573' or 't637'. Wait, no, looking back, NT60 has two rules: one is 't637' and another is 't573'. So, the first symbol t573 can come from either of these.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is t777, which from NT636 -> 't777'. So, the second symbol should come from NT636.\n\nSo, let's tentatively assign S->NT636 NT487? Wait, no, the grammar is S->NT9 NT487. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the full string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step, breaking it down into symbols that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of symbols: t573, t777, t592, t467, t592, t777, t689, t131, t131, t30, t637, t592, t777, t278, t848, t555, t637, t467, t30.\n\nWait, I think I may have copied the string incorrectly earlier, but the user provided it as: t573 t777 t592 t467 t592 t777 t689 t131 t131 t30 t637 t592 t777 t278 t848 t555 t637 t467 t30.\n\nFirst, the first symbol t573 is produced by NT60, which can be t573 or t637. Since the string starts with t573, that would require NT60 -> 't573'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT60 has:\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nand\n\nNT60 -> 't573'.\n\nWait, no, looking back, in the grammar provided, the rules for NT60 are:\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nand\n\nNT60 -> 't573'\n\nWait, in the original grammar, under NT60, there are two productions:\n\n- NT60 -> 't637'\n\nand\n\n- NT60 -> 't573'\n\nYes, that's correct. So, t573 can be produced by NT60 in two ways.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t573. So, the first step would be that the leftmost symbol is t573, which comes from NT60.

{"custom_id":"request-249","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or a non-terminal on the left. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, which produces NT487 and NT993. So, the string must start with these. Looking at the string, the first token is t573, which corresponds to NT60 -> 't637'. But wait, looking at S's production, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the first part after S is NT487, which can be either \"t103 t486\" or \"t933 t389\". \n\nWait, the string starts with t573, which isn't a direct terminal from NT487 or NT993. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the strings again.\n\nThe string is: t573 t892 t98 t640 t14 t14 t98 t689 t37 t593 t573 t98 t535 t573 t363 t98 t637 t555 t372 t237.\n\nWait, the starting non-terminals are S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the first two symbols in the string should come from NT487 and NT993. But looking at the string, it starts with t573 followed by t892. From the grammar, let's see what produces t573 and t892.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' (so t637 is generated by NT60)\n- NT487 has two options: produce t103 t486 or t933 t389\n- NT993 has one production: NT588 \u2192 't37' and NT530 \u2192 't60'\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT993 is a non-terminal, and in the start production, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the first two non-terminals in the string are NT487 and NT993. Each of these needs to produce two terminals.\n\nLet me break it down. Each non-terminal expansion is a step where we resolve a non-terminal into two other non-terminals until we get to the terminals. So the string must be a series of terminals generated from fully expanding the left and right sides of S.\n\nLet's see the start: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string should be the concatenation of NT487's expansion and NT993's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT487's production: it can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLet's evaluate both possibilities:\n\n1. NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n   - NT103 \u2192 t673 t964\n   - NT486 \u2192 t363\n\nSo from NT487, this would produce t673 t964 t363.\n\nBut the start of the string is t573 t892, which doesn't match this.\n\n2. NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n   - NT933 \u2192 NT217\n   - NT389 \u2192 t689\n\nSo NT933 \u2192 NT217. NT217's production is either t467 or t592? Wait, looking back, in the grammar:\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT217, the production is:\n- NT217 \u2192 t467 or NT592.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see multiple rules. Let me list all productions for clarity.\n\nWait, the grammar given is a list of production rules. Let me parse them systematically.\n\nProductions from NT217:\n- Looking at the list, I see NT409 \u2192 t555, NT60 \u2192 't637', etc. Looking for NT217, I see:\n\n- The production for NT217 is written as: NT217 -> t467, and elsewhere: NT217 -> t592.\n\nYes, so NT217 can be either t467 or t592.\n\nSo, back to NT933 \u2192 NT217, which can produce either t467 or t592.\n\nSo, the first part from NT487 when expanding to NT933 and NT389 would be:\n\nNT933 \u2192 NT217 \u2192 either t467 or t592.\n\nThen, NT389 \u2192 t689.\n\nSo the full expansion from NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389 is NT933's expansion (t467 or t592) followed by t689.\n\nPutting it together: from NT487, we have either:\n\nOption 1: t673 t964 t363\n\nOption 2: (from NT933) t467 or t592 \u2192 followed by t689.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first two tokens are t573 and t892. Neither of these appear in the above expansions. So neither option for NT487 gives us t573 or t892 as the first token.\n\nWait a minute, this suggests that the string might not start with the correct expansion from S. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps I need to consider the entire string and work backwards using a CYK-like parsing approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is actually generated from a different expansion. Maybe the NT487 is expanding into something else?\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the NT487 isn't directly producing t573 t892, but perhaps more steps are involved. Let me think: each non-terminal can be expanded multiple times. So maybe after expanding NT487 to NT933 NT389, and then expanding one of those, perhaps further down the line.\n\nBut given that the NT productions only go down to single terminals, each non-terminal expands into two others until we get to terminals. So for example, after S \u2192 NT487 NT993, each subsequent expansion would take a non-terminal and expand it into two others, until all non-terminals are gone.\n\nSo the starting point is S, and the entire string must be a complete expansion of S.\n\nGiven that, the entire string length is 20 tokens. Let's see the number of steps required to expand S.\n\nS is at the top, so the first expansion splits S into two non-terminals: NT487 and NT993. These two must be expanded into four non-terminals, which then split again into eight, and so on until all are terminals. The length of the string is 20, which must be 2^n, but 20 isn't a power of two. Wait, this doesn't make sense because each split doubles the number of symbols. So starting from 1, after one split: 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. But the string is only 20 tokens, which isn't a power of two. This suggests there's a mistake because the grammar is in CNF, which requires the string length to be a power of two.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Let me double-check. The CYK algorithm works for CNF grammars where the string length is a power of two because each expansion step doubles the length.\n\nLooking at the string: 20 tokens. 2^4 is 16 and 2^5 is 32. 20 is between 16 and 32, so it's not a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm this because sometimes the terminals in some nodes could lead to overlapping or different counts. But in CNF, each production is exactly two symbols, so starting from S: 1 symbol, then each expansion step increases the count in a way that the number of symbols is 2^n. So the string must have a length of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., but 20 isn't in this sequence. Therefore, it's impossible.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nThe given string has 20 tokens, which is not a power of two. In a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of tokens in the generated string must be a power of two because each production step doubles the number of symbols. Since 20 is not a power of two, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and S production is S -> NT487 NT993. So the start string should begin with NT487 followed by NT993. Let's check the string: it starts with t363 t817... Hmm, wait, NT487 and NT993 are non-terminals, so each of those should be expanded into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some of the NTs have productions that expand into two NTs or into a terminal. For example, NT487 can produce NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389, and each of those, when expanded, might resolve into terminals. \n\nThe given string is: t363 t817 t555 t689 t98 t848 t217 t217 t372 t804 t640 t535 t817 t363 t237 t98 t278 t848 t467 t444.\n\nI notice that the first few tokens are t363, t817, t555, etc. I need to see if these can be derived from the NTs in the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which expands to NT487 NT993. So after the first expansion, the string starts with t363 (from NT487) and then t817 (from NT993). Let me check the grammar for NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking up NT487: It can produce NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Both of these when expanded would lead to terminals because, for example, NT103 -> t673 t964, but wait, I'm going to double-check the rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT487 -> NT103 NT486, and NT103 -> t673 NT964, but wait, no, actually, looking closely:\n\nWait, the grammar says NT103 -> NT673 NT964. And NT673 is in the rules as NT673 -> t848. So NT103 -> t848 t964? Wait, no, because in the grammar, NT673 is defined as -> t848. So wait, NT103 is NT673 NT964, and NT673 -> t848, and then what about NT964? Looking through the rules, I see NT964 -> t640. So NT103 expands to t848 t640.\n\nWait, but in the string, t363 comes first, which is from NT487's expansion. Let me retrace:\n\nNT487 can go to NT103 NT486. NT486, in the rules, is NT486 -> t467. So NT487 -> NT103 t467.\n\nThen NT103 -> t848 NT964, and NT964 -> t640. So NT103 becomes t848 t640. Therefore, NT487 expands to t848 t640 t467. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t363. That doesn't match. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I got the initial expansion wrong. Starting with S -> NT487 NT993, and assuming each NT expands into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t363. So perhaps NT487 eventually produces t363. Let me check. NT487's rule is either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nIf I pick NT487 -> NT933 NT389, then what's NT933 and NT389.\n\nNT933 -> t217 NT389. And then NT389 can be either NT569 NT756 or other. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this as a parsing problem. I'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar, starting from S and seeing if all tokens can be consumed.\n\nLet's list the tokens: t363, t817, t555, t689, t98, t848, t217, t217, t372, t804, t640, t535, t817, t363, t237, t98, t278, t848, t467, t444.\n\nI think it's helpful to represent the string as a list and process it step by step, choosing possible productions for each NT until the entire string is processed.\n\nStarting with S -> NT487 NT993. So the first two tokens must come from NT487 and NT993 respectively.\n\nFirst token: t363 (from NT487). So let's see what NT487 can expand to.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT487 has two productions:\n\n1. NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nLet me check which one produces t363.\n\nLooking at NT103: NT103 -> NT673 NT964.\n\nNT673 -> t848.\n\nNT964 -> t640.\n\nSo NT103 expands to t848 t640.\n\nThen, NT486 -> t467.\n\nSo NT487 (first production) would expand to t848 t640 t467.\n\nBut the first token is t363, which isn't in that expansion.\n\nNow, let's look at the second production for NT487: NT487 -> NT933 NT389.\n\nLooking at NT933: NT933 -> NT217 NT389.\n\nNT217 -> t467.\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756.\n\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588.\n\nNT195 -> t278, NT588 -> t37.\n\nSo NT389 expands to t278 t37.\n\nPutting it all together, NT933 -> t467 t278 t37.\n\nWait, no, wait, let me retrace.\n\nActually, NT933 -> NT217 NT389.\n\nNT217 is NT217 -> t467.\n\nNT389 can be either NT569 NT756 or other options, but looking at the rules, NT389's only production is NT569 NT756.\n\nWait, no: looking back, the provided grammar has NT389 -> NT569 NT756, and NT591 -> 't689' and NT389 is defined as -> NT569 NT756.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nThe given grammar includes:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756.\n\nSo NT389 produces two NTs. NT569 is NT569 -> NT195 NT588.\n\nNT195 -> t278, NT588 -> t37.\n\nSo NT569 becomes t278 t37.\n\nAnd NT756 -> NT256 NT833.\n\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT756: NT756 -> NT256 NT833.\n\nThen, NT256 -> NT446 NT946.\n\nNT446 -> NT636 NT226.\n\nNT636 -> 't777'.\n\nNT946 -> 't131'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first tokens are 363, 817, which don't match t777 or t131. So perhaps I'm on the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT993 is producing the second token, t817.\n\nSo let's look at NT993. NT993 is derived from the production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-264","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, where do I start? Let me jot down the grammar rules and the string to evaluate.\n\nThe string is: t131 t892 t535 t467 t593 t640 t640 t848 t217 t237 t217 t535 t689 t37 t131 t573 t217 t892 t593 t535 t593\n\nFirst, let's see the grammar structure. It seems to consist of productions that split non-terminals into two other non-terminals until they reach terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of these productions.\n\nStarting with S, the initial production is S -> NT487 NT993. Both of these are non-terminals, so I need each to be expanded into terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT487, from the rules, NT487 can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's try NT487 -> NT103 NT486. Now, NT103 can be NT673 NT964. So, NT673 and NT964. Checking the string, we have t673 and t964... Looking at the string: does t673 appear? Let me scan the string... Yes, at positions 7: t848 (index 6), then t217 (7), t237 (8), t217 (9), t535 (10), t689 (11), t37 (12), t131 (13), t573 (14), t217 (15), t892 (16), t593 (17), t535 (18), t593 (19). Hmm, I don't see t673 or t964 in the string. So maybe this path is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, for NT487, perhaps it's better to choose the other option: NT487 -> NT933 NT389. So NT933 and NT389. Then, NT933 can be NT217 NT697, and NT389 can be NT569 NT756.\n\nWait, this might not help. Let's try breaking it down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's start from the given string and see if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t's and numbers. Each non-terminal in the grammar eventually expands into a string of t's and numbers. So each step in the grammar's derivation can produce a part of the string.\n\nLet me try to find the sequence of non-terminals that could produce the given string when expanded.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens. The initial production has S splitting into two non-terminals, each of which is another step. Each step will split until we reach leaves (terminals). So perhaps the string length in terms of nodes can help. S produces two non-terminals, each of which can produce two more, and so on. The total number of nodes should be 2^{n} where n is the number of steps. The string has 20 tokens, which is even, but perhaps it's too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parse the string bottom-up or top-down.\n\nTop-down approach would start with S and see if we can derive the string step by step. Since the string is a sequence of terms, perhaps we can see how each term in the string is generated by the non-terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: let's see which non-terminals expand into which parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT195 -> 't278', NT60 -> 't637', NT256 -> 't98', etc. The string has various t's followed by numbers, but all are uppercase letters or digits, so each sequence corresponds to a specific production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string by grouping into non-terminals. The string is:\n\nt131 t892 t535 t467 t593 t640 t640 t848 t217 t237 t217 t535 t689 t37 t131 t573 t217 t892 t593 t535 t593\n\nBut this is just a flat list; each element is a terminal. So each non-terminal's expansion is a flat list of terminal symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal in the string to a non-terminal's production.\n\nLet me see each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t131 comes from NT351 -> NT10 NT217, then NT10 -> NT147 NT951, NT147 -> NT367 NT591, NT367 -> NT30, which is t673? Wait, NT367 ends with t367. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar as given is:\n\nWait, let me list the productions and their terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\n\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\n\nNT147 -> NT367 NT591\n\nNT367 -> NT30 (which is t673, as per NT367 -> t673 NT217)\n\nNT30: Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT367 -> t673. So NT367 produces t673 followed by NT217.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a t673 at position ... Let me check the string:\n\nLooking at the string, I see t673 appears in NT399: No wait, the string has t673 at the 7th token? Wait, the string is:\n\nIndex 0: t131\n\n1: t892\n\n2: t535\n\n3: t467\n\n4: t593\n\n5: t640\n\n6: t640\n\n7: t848\n\n8: t217\n\n9: t237\n\n10: t217\n\n11: t535\n\n12: t689\n\n13: t37\n\n14: t131\n\n15: t573\n\n16: t217\n\n17: t892\n\n18: t593\n\n19: t535\n\n20: t593 wait, the string is 21 tokens.\n\nWait, the string as given is:\n\nt131 t892 t535 t467 t593 t640 t640 t848 t217 t237 t217 t535 t689 t37 t131 t573 t217 t892 t593 t535 t593\n\nSo, 21 tokens.\n\nEach non-terminal expansion will produce a certain number of tokens. Let me check each non-terminal's production to see what terminals they generate.\n\nLooking at NT147: it produces NT367 and NT591, which in turn:\n\nNT367 -> t673 (from 367 -> t673 NT217) followed by NT217.\n\nNT217 -> t467 (from NT217 -> t467).\n\nSo NT147 -> t673 t467.\n\nWait, but NT147 also splits into NT367 and NT591. So NT147 expands into t673 t467.\n\nWait, let's get more precise.\n\nEach NT's production consists of exactly two non-terminals, as it's in Chomsky normal form. So each NT is replaced by two non-terminals, each of which eventually becomes a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, to get the string, we need to have a derivation where the top-down approach results in the given list of terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to take the string and try to map each part to a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nLet me look at the first part of the string: t131... It could be part of NT990 -> 't817', but not t131 directly. Let me check NT990 in the grammar: NT990 -> NT467 NT444? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each line represents"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-263","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal. The string to evaluate is \"t363 t378 t30 t378 t689 t30 t467 t848 t14 t378 t804 t378 t466 t573 t535 t637 t817 t640 t217 t848 t593\". \n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of atoms like \"t363\", \"t378\", etc. Each of these seems to be a terminal symbol, so I need to trace these back through the grammar to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT487 NT993. So, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. That means the string should start with the symbols from NT487 and NT993. Looking at the string, it starts with t363, so I need to see if t363 can be derived from NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet's look at NT487. From the grammar, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. So, the possible ways to get t363 (assuming 486 is a terminal, but I need to check) but wait, the grammar shows \"t486\" as a terminal, not \"t363\", so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Looking carefully, under NT487, the productions are:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nFrom these, NT486 is a terminal because in the grammar, it's written as \"t486\". Similarly, NT486 \u2192 \"t363\" according to the production NT486 \u2192 \"t363\". So, NT486 can derive \"t363\", and NT933 and NT389 need to produce more.\n\nWait, so for NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389, we'd have to see if both NT933 and NT389 can produce \"t363\". But looking at the grammar, NT389 \u2192 \"t689\" (from NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756 \u2192 \"t689\"), which is a different terminal. So maybe that path won't lead to \"t363\".\n\nOn the other hand, NT487 can also derive NT103 NT486. NT103 \u2192 \"t673\" (from NT103 \u2192 \"t673\") and NT486 \u2192 \"t363\". So, if we take NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, which would produce \"t673 t363\". But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Each production is a left-hand side (LHS) that produces a right-hand side (RHS). So, when we do S \u2192 NT487 NT993, each of these NTs will produce their own sequence.\n\nSo, NT487 will produce something, and NT993 will produce something else, and together they form the string.\n\nLooking at NT993, which is a non-terminal. The grammar shows NT993 \u2192 \"t444\". So, NT993 directly produces \"t444\".\n\nNow, so the string starts with t363, which should come from NT487's production, and the second part has t378, which I need to figure out where that comes from.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the entire string as a sequence of symbols and see if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check each token and see if it can be derived correctly, working from the top down.\n\nLet me list all the tokens: t363, t378, t30, t378, t689, t30, t467, t848, t14, t378, t804, t378, t466, t573, t535, t637, t817, t640, t217, t848, t593.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be the result of expanding S.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT487 NT993, let's see:\n\n- S generates NT487 and NT993.\n\nSo, the first two symbols would ideally come from NT487 and NT993. But in the string, the first symbol is t363. So, we need to see if t363 is the result of NT487.\n\nFrom NT487, as I saw, there are two possibilities: NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\n- NT486 \u2192 \"t363\"\n\nSo, the production NT487 \u2192 NT486 NT103 would produce \"t363\" followed by the expansion of NT103.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t363, the next symbol is t378. So, the second token is t378, which should come from NT993.\n\nWait, but NT993 directly produces \"t444\". So, unless the second token is \"t444\", it can't come from NT993. But in the string, the second token is t378, so that wouldn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is generated. Each step in the grammar generates a left- or right- context. Since the grammar is CNF, each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, and terminals are final.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string as a sequence of symbols that need to be derived from S.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree from the string, using the grammar. Let's see.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt363 t378 t30 t378 t689 t30 t467 t848 t14 t378 t804 t378 t466 t573 t535 t637 t817 t640 t217 t848 t593.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\n2. Then, NT993 must directly produce \"t444\" because it only has that production. So, the last symbol in the string is t593, which I think is from NT993. But let me check.\n\nWait, NT993 only has one production, which is \"t444\". So, the last symbol in the string should be \"t444\". But it's t593, which doesn't match. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. I'm getting confused because the productions for NTs might have longer sequences.\n\nWait, no, the grammar shows NT993 \u2192 \"t444\". So, NT993 can only produce \"t444\". So, if the string ends with t593, which isn't \"t444\", that would mean the last symbol is not produced by NT993. So, maybe the conclusion is that the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT993 has:\nNT993 \u2192 \"t444\"\n\nNo other options. So, every string generated by the grammar ending with NT993 will have that terminal as the last symbol. So, the last token in the string provided is t593, which doesn't match \"t444\". That would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the non-terminals can produce sequences that include terminals in the middle. For example, the NTs could produce multiple symbols, some non-terminals and some terminals, which could be a problem.\n\nLooking again at S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nWe know that NT487 can produce:\n\n- Option 1: NT103 NT486 \u2192 which then may produce \"t673\" (from NT103's production) and \""}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, in the string, if there are any of these terminal symbols, they must match a production rule like that.\n\nThe string provided is: t131 t131 t592 t237 t892 t573 t555 t467 t777 t555 t637 t30 t131 t37 t14 t804 t131 t98 t217 t637 t278 t466.\n\nLet me list all the symbols in order: t131, t131, t592, t237, t892, t573, t555, t467, t777, t555, t637, t30, t131, t37, t14, t804, t131, t98, t217, t637, t278, t466.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminal symbols (like t14, t30, t37, t573, t592, t637, t697 is not here, but others are), and others are non-terminals because they have arrows pointing to other symbols.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals can only produce terminals, like NT487 -> t363, so t363 is a terminal. Similarly, NT636 -> t777, so t777 is a terminal.\n\nSo, when trying to parse the string, each part must be either a direct terminal production or a combination derived from non-terminals.\n\nThe string has t14 at position 14. Looking at the grammar, I see NT147 -> NT367 NT591. Then NT367 -> t673 and NT591 -> t30. So, the production for NT147 is t673 t30. But wait, t673 is another terminal: looking at the grammar, NT217 -> t592 and NT673 -> t848, perhaps? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let me see the rules for NT147: NT147 -> NT367 NT591. Then, NT367 -> t673, and NT591 -> t30. So t14 is part of the string, but according to the grammar, t14 is part of the NT147 production, which becomes t673 t30. But the string has t14, not t673 t30. So that's a problem because t14 is a non-terminal that can't directly produce t14 t something. Wait, no: looking at the string, I see t14 as part of the string. Wait, wait, the string is: the part with t14 is towards the end: ... t37 t14 t804 ... So the substring is ..., t37, t14, t804.\n\nBut according to the grammar, t14 is part of NT147, which is the production NT147 -> t848? Or is that NT217? Let me check: NT217 is defined as NT217 -> t592, and it appears that NT147's production is NT367 NT591, which are t673 and t30.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing NT147 and NT217. Let me see: the string includes t14. Is t14 a terminal or a non-terminal? Since in the string, t14 is a symbol, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces t14 except NT147: NT147 -> t673 t30. So t14 cannot directly be part of the string unless it's a production that directly produces t14, which doesn't exist.\n\nSo, perhaps the presence of t14 in the string indicates a problem because t14 is only produced via NT147, which produces t673 t30. Therefore, the string contains a t14 where the grammar doesn't directly allow that, unless there's a way to get t14 from higher up, but it seems direct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t14. So t14 must be a derived symbol from a non-terminal. So in the string, any occurrence of t14 implies that such a symbol was derived from some combination of non-terminals that ultimately lead to t14. But since in the grammar there is no production that directly yields t14, this would mean that the string is invalid because t14 can't appear unless it's part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's double-check: the string is \"... t37 t14 t804 ...\". So, t14 is between t37 and t804. So the substring is t37, t14, t804. So, to produce t14, we'd need to have a production rule where t14 is one of the productions. Looking back, I don't see any rule that directly yields t14 as a terminal.\n\nSo this suggests that t14 cannot be part of the string unless it's part of a longer production, but in the given string, it's a single t14, which implies that it's a terminal, which it's not. Therefore, the presence of t14 might indicate that either the string is not generated by the grammar, or I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the string. Let me check the string again: t131 t131 t592 t237 t892 t573 t555 t467 t777 t555 t637 t30 t131 t37 t14 t804 t131 t98 t217 t637 t278 t466.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread t37 and t14 as part of the same symbol? No, each symbol is separated, so t37 and t14 are separate. So in the string, the 13th token is t37, 14th is t14, and 15th is t804.\n\nSo, according to the grammar, t37 is a terminal? Let me check: in the grammar, NT374 is undefined because I don't see any production with NT374. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, the NT389 -> t569 t756, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look through the list:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, do any produce t37? For example, NT588 -> t37. Yes, there is NT588 -> t37. So t37 can be a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, t14 is a problematic symbol because in the grammar, I don't see any production that results in t14 as a terminal. So t14 cannot be directly part of the string unless it is produced by some non-terminal, which in this grammar, doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nWait, but perhaps t14 is part of a longer production that eventually derives into t14 as a terminal. For example, some non-terminal may produce t14 as part of a longer sequence. But since the grammar only allows two symbols at a time, each production is two non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, S -> NT487 NT993, which is two non-terminals. Then NT487 has two productions, one leading to t363, the other to t933 t389. Wait, t389 is another terminal that may be produced by NT389 which has NT569 and NT756, which produce t689 and t37, respectively.\n\nWait, so let me follow a possible derivation to see if t14 can appear.\n\nSuppose I start with S -> NT487 NT993. Then NT487 can split into either t363 or t933 NT389.

{"custom_id":"request-276","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That simplifies things because each production only produces two symbols at a time, which aligns with the way derivations work in CNF.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and the string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if these terminals can be generated starting from S using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial productions from S are:\nS -> NT487 NT993\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\nAnd so on, with each non-terminal eventually breaking down into terminal symbols through a series of productions.\n\nThe provided string is: t777 t237 t689 t237 t98 t777 t777 t637 t131 t37 t573 t804 t363 t777 t555 t363 t535 t777 t467 t892 t30 t98\n\nThat's 21 elements, each being a terminal symbol. Each element in the string corresponds to a single terminal symbol, so I need to see if each can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that many non-terminals directly produce a terminal symbol. For example:\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT446 -> 't636' which is another terminal\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- And so on.\n\nSo each non-terminal that ends up producing a terminal directly corresponds to a production like NTx -> 'ty'. But some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, meaning they need to be expanded further.\n\nSince the string is a series of terminals, I need to see if each terminal can be reached through a series of productions starting from S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar tree. The start symbol S expands into NT487 and NT993. Each of those might need to produce terminal symbols or further non-terminals.\n\nLet me check what NT487 and NT993 produce. From the grammar, NT487 -> NT103 NT486 and NT487 -> NT933 NT389. Neither of these are terminal symbols, so they must be expanded further.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 is not present in the grammar as a terminal, so it must be expanded. Wait, checking the grammar again, I'm looking for any NT that directly produces a terminal. Let me scan through the NTs.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT946 is the only one that directly produces a terminal, but in the string, t131 is one of the terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nPerhaps a better method is to construct the parse tree for the given string. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each step will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminal symbols. Starting from the string, I can try to see if it can reduce back to S.\n\nBut that might be complicated because the string is long. Alternatively, I can try to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the first part: t777. What NT does that come from? Let's check the grammar. Looking at the rules, NT636 -> 't777', and NT256 -> 't98', for example.\n\nSo, looking at the string starting with t777. That must come from NT636. So, we can split the string into 't777' and the rest. Then, the remaining string needs to be derived from NT636. But wait, in the grammar, NT636 is actually not present, because looking back, the grammar doesn't have NT636 directly. Wait, let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I have:\n\nNT636 -> 't777'\n\nAnd also, I see other productions where NT60 -> 't637'.\n\nLooking again, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT363 -> 't637'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT964 -> 't640'\n- NT990 -> 't817'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\nSo, perhaps I can see how each terminal in the string can be derived.\n\nLet me list each terminal in the string and see if I can find a path.\n\nt777: comes from NT636.\nt237: not in the production list, so maybe from NT363? Wait, NT363 -> 't637', which isn't t237. Alternatively, perhaps t237 comes from another NT. Wait, looking through the grammar, is there an NT that directly produces 't237'? It doesn't look like it. So maybe 't237' is part of a larger non-terminal production.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent this as a parsing tree, starting from the string and seeing if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nBut that might take a while, given the string length.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to try to see if the string can be derived step by step starting from S.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. S -> NT487 NT993\n   So, the first two symbols in the string must be derived from NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string: t777 t237 t689 t237 t98 ...\n\nSo, t777 is the first symbol, which comes from NT636, as per the grammar. Wait, but the initial expansion is NT487, so perhaps the first t777 comes from NT487.\n\nBut wait, in the initial grammar, NT487 can produce either NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389. Neither are terminals, so they must be further expanded.\n\nSo, the derivation would need to go NT487 -> something that eventually produces t777, but that's not straightforward because NT487's productions go into other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too complex, and the initial steps don't align because the initial productions don't directly lead to 't777'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, but others go on to produce more non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to think of it as each step in the derivation produces a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, no, because in a typical leftmost derivation, you expand the leftmost non-terminal each time, so you build up the string from the start symbol.\n\nGiven that, let's attempt to start the derivation:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nNow, NT487 needs to be expanded. Let's look at NT487's productions:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n\nNeither of these are terminals, so we have to expand further.\n\nTake NT103: NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\nAgain, non-terminals. Each of these needs to expand until they produce terminals.\n\nNT673 -> 't848', and NT964 -> 't640'\n\nSo, NT103 -> 't848' 't640'\n\nSimilarly, for NT487 -> NT103 NT486:\n\nWe have 't848' from NT103 and then NT486 needs to expand.\n\nLooking at NT486, the grammar doesn't show it being a terminal. So, check the productions. Wait, no, NT486 isn't present in the grammar except where it's used elsewhere. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the non-terminals seem to include up to NT993, and among their productions, but perhaps NT486 is not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar in the problem is not complete, or the way it's presented, NT486 only appears on the right-hand side of NT60 and others. Wait, in the given grammar, I see that NT487 -> NT103 NT486, but I don't see NT486 directly producing a terminal."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-289","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some start symbols and non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT487 and NT993. Wait, that seems a bit odd. NT487 and NT993 must be non-terminals themselves, each of which can produce two other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI notice some non-terminals that end directly with terminals, like NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, which further break down into NT951 \u2192 't466'. So these are leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of t-words: t278 t592 t817 t555 t892 t535 t689 t592 t37 t804 t131 t466 t372 t637 t817 t817 t640 t689 t637 t593 t278 t848 t466.\n\nEach 't' is followed by a number, and I assume each 't' is a terminal symbol, representing a token. So the string is 23 tokens long.\n\nNow, let's see the grammar. Starting from S, it splits into NT487 and NT993. Each of these non-terminals branches further until we hit terminals.\n\nLooking at NT10, which produces t637 and NT951, which then is t466. Wait, but in the string, we have t637 and then t466. That matches: t637 and t466.\n\nSimilarly, NT367 \u2192 t30. Wait, is 367 a terminal in the string? Let me check. The string has t37, t593, etc., but t367 isn't directly present. Wait, no, looking at the grammar: NT367 \u2192 t30. Hmm, the string doesn't have t30. So maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, but the grammar says NT367 can only produce t30. So if the string has t367, it should only appear in that context. But in the string, there's t367? Wait, let me count. Oh, wait, looking at the string, the 17th token is t593, but that's not 367. The 20th token is t367 coming from NT367. Wait, does the string include t367? Let me check the order again.\n\nWait, the string is: t278 t592 t817 t555 t892 t535 t689 t592 t37 t804 t131 t466 t372 t637 t817 t817 t640 t689 t637 t593 t278 t848 t466.\n\nI don't see a t367 in there. Wait, no, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count the tokens from 1 to 23:\n\n1. t278\n\n2. t592\n\n3. t817\n\n4. t555\n\n5. t892\n\n6. t535\n\n7. t689\n\n8. t592\n\n9. t37\n\n10. t804\n\n11. t131\n\n12. t466\n\n13. t372\n\n14. t637\n\n15. t817\n\n16. t817\n\n17. t640\n\n18. t689\n\n19. t637\n\n20. t593\n\n21. t278\n\n22. t848\n\n23. t466\n\nWait, so t367 isn't in the string. But in the grammar, NT367 produces t30, which isn't present. But does every non-terminal in S's production have to be expanded all the way to terminals?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. Let's see if the given string can be generated by the grammar by trying to find possible expansions.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT487 -> NT486, NT487 (wait, no: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Wait, no, actually:\n\nLooking back: The first production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So S splits into NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet's analyze NT487 and NT993:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 may have productions, but looking at the grammar, let's see if I can find where NT993 comes in. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see a rule for NT993. Hmm, that raises a red flag.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal is on the left side of \u2190, and all others are on the right. So for example:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT487 NT993. But the grammar doesn't define NT993 at all. That's a problem. Unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, checking the grammar again:\n\nThe first rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nBut in the list of rules, I don't see NT993 as a non-terminal on the left. Only up to NT992 maybe. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see NT993 as a left-hand side. So this is a problem because the start symbol S is supposed to produce NT487 and NT993, but if NT993 isn't defined in the grammar, that production is invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be right.

{"custom_id":"request-300","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string to evaluate is `t363 t592 t637 t98 t804 t573 t817 t30 t804 t372 t535 t378 t689 t535 t689 t848 t98 t378 t278 t466 t372 t14 t777 t555`. \n\nSince the string consists of a series of 't's followed by numbers, these seem to be terminals. The task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is the starting symbol, and it produces NT487 and NT993. So, the string must start with 't363 t...' because looking at the productions, NT487 produces 't363' and NT993 produces 't98 t444'. Wait, no, NT993's production in the grammar is given as NT993 -> N...? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT487 NT993. So the first expansion of S would be NT487 and NT993. Let's look at each of these.\n\nNT487 has two productions: it can become NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389. Looking at these, both NT103 and NT933 eventually lead to terminals.\n\nFrom the string, the first token is 't363'. So which NT leads to 't363'? Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at NT486: it produces 't363'. So if NT487 goes to NT486, that would produce 't363'. Similarly, NT933 goes to NT964 and NT98, but 't98' is another token. Wait, let's see: NT933 -> NT964 NT98, and NT964 is 't848', but in the string, after 't363' comes 't592'.\n\nWait, the first token is 't363', so NT487 must go to the production that includes 't363'. So NT487 can be NT103 NT486, which would become 't673 t848'? Or NT933 NT389, which is 't964 t98'. Wait, but the string starts with 't363', which isn't 't964' or 't98'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by parsing the string step by step. Let's think about each symbol in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\n1. The first symbol is 't363'. Looking at the grammar, the only way to get 't363' is through NT486, because NT636 is 't777'. Wait, no, looking again, NT636 is 't777', so that's for NT636. So 't363' comes from NT486, which is part of NT487's production. So NT487 can produce 't363' if it goes to NT486.\n\n2. Next is 't592'. Let's see where 't592' comes from. Looking through the productions, NT591 is 't591' which produces 't30' and 't817'. Wait, NT591 is part of NT217. But the string has 't592' after 't363'. Hmm. Alternatively, is there a non-terminal that directly produces 't592'? Hmm, I don't see that. Maybe I need to see which NT leads to 't592'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, NT591 is 't591', which is part of NT217, which becomes 't467 t592' (looking at NT217 -> NT467 NT592). Wait, NT217 is part of NT487, right? Because S first splits into NT487 and NT993.\n\nWait, NT217 is 't467 t592', meaning if NT217 is derived from NT487, then 't467 t592' would appear. But in the string, after 't363', it's 't592', so maybe 't363' comes from NT486, and 't592' comes from NT368, which leads to 't592'. Wait, NT368 is 't368' which produces 't237 t640', or in one production, NT368 -> 't592'?\n\nWait, looking at NT368, I see it produces 't237' and 't640' on one side, but another production is NT368 -> 't848'. Wait, no, let me check the grammar again:\n\nNo, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT368 -> 't237' or 't640'\n\nWait, no, actually, for NT368, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT368 -> 't237' or 't640'. So it can't directly produce 't592'. Hmm.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to try to build a parse tree incrementally.\n\nLet me try to see how the first few tokens can be generated.\n\nThe string starts with 't363 t592 t637 t98 t804...'\n\nFirst token 't363' comes from NT486 (since NT486 -> 't363'). So NT487 can produce NT486 and something else.\n\nWait, NT487's productions are:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 \n\nor\n\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSince 't363' is the first token, it's from NT486, so NT487 must take the second option, NT933 NT389. But then that would mean after NT487, we get NT933 and NT389, which produce 't964' and 't98' respectively. But the first token in the string is 't363', not 't964', so that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. If NT487 takes the production NT103 NT486, then NT486 becomes 't363', which would be the first token.

{"custom_id":"request-302","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right. So, it's structured in a way that makes parsing easier, maybe like that of an LR parser.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t98 t363 t30 t363 t535 t14 t278 t14 t777 t555 t466 t466 t30 t467 t237 t37 t237 t593 t467 t593 t573 t535 t689 t817`.\n\nFirst, I'll map out the non-terminals and terminals here. The non-terminals in the grammar are S, NT9, NT60, NT226, NT256, NT756, NT185, NT487, NT351, NT85, NT389, NT697, NT147, NT226, NT530, NT10, NT833, NT569, NT446, NT103, NT591, NT636, NT389, NT588, NT946, NT195, NT60, NT256, NT60, NT347, NT951, NT217, NT409, NT368, NT399, NT673, NT217, NT951, NT486, NT894, NT993, NT588, NT933, NT697, NT964, NT990, NT367. Wait, that's a lot. But actually, the terminal symbols are all the t followed by numbers, like t98, t363, etc. So, in our string, every word is a terminal symbol. So, our task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's a binary grammar, meaning each production rule has exactly two non-terminals. So, all productions are either A->BC or A->a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I can perform a top-down parsing or maybe check the Leftmost Derivation. Alternatively, since the grammar is small, I can attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S, following the grammar rules.\n\nLet's start by looking at the initial production: S->NT487 NT993.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into two parts: NT487 and NT993. Then, each part can be checked against the productions of NT487 and NT993, respectively.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT487 has productions:\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nAnd NT993 -> t98 t573.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar rules again. The user provided the entire grammar, so I can look up the definitions.\n\nNT487 has two productions: NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389. Neither of these produce terminals, so we need to see if these can eventually produce t98 or t573.\n\nWait, wait, but the string starts with t98, so maybe NT993 is producing t98 t573, but looking back, the start symbol is S, so the start production is S -> NT487 NT993. Then, the first NT487 should generate a part that leads to the first t98.\n\nBut wait, the first part of the string is t98 t363 t30... So, the NT487 should derive t98 t573, which is at the beginning of the string. But in the string, the first two tokens are t98 and t363. Hmm, that's a problem. Because NT993 is supposed to derive t98 t573, but in the string, after t98, it's t363, not t573. So, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the start production:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nSo, NT487 will generate a certain part, and NT993 will generate another part, concatenated together.\n\nNow, in the string, the first two tokens are t98 and t363. So, perhaps NT993 generates t98, followed by NT487 generating t363 t30, and so on. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this systematically. Let's try to see if each part of the string can be broken down by the grammar.\n\nFirst, the overall structure is S producing NT487 and NT993. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT487 produces and what NT993 produces.\n\nSo, let's split the string into what might be the two parts from NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt98 t363 t30 t363 t535 t14 t278 t14 t777 t555 t466 t466 t30 t467 t237 t37 t237 t593 t467 t593 t573 t535 t689 t817\n\nWait, but the initial production is S->NT487 NT993. So, the string should be split as [NT487 derivation] concatenated with [NT993 derivation].\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with t98. Let's look up what NT993 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT993 has only one production: NT993 -> t98 t573.\n\nSo, NT993 must derive t98 followed by t573. Therefore, in the string, the part that comes from NT993 should start with t98 t573, but looking at the string, it starts with t98 followed by t363. That's a conflict because the second symbol should be t573, not t363. So, this suggests that the string is invalid, unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I mislooked the grammar. Let me check again. The grammar has NT487 producing NT933 NT389, and NT933 can produce t98 t351 or t569 NT367, wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking through the rules, for NT487, the productions are:\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nAnd NT933 can produce two things:\n- NT933 -> NT569 NT756\n- NT933 -> t217\n\nWait, correct?\n\nWait, NT933's productions as per the given grammar are:\n\nNT933 -> NT569 NT756\nNT933 -> t217\n\nSo, NT933 can produce either 't217' or the non-terminals NT569 and NT756.\n\nSimilarly, NT389 has two productions:\n- NT389 -> NT569 NT756\n- NT389 -> t389\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe user's grammar includes:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nSo, NT389 can produce either NT569 NT756 or t389.\n\nSo, going back, S produces NT487 and NT993. NT993 produces t98 t573. So, in the string, after the token from NT993 (t98), it should be followed by t573.\n\nBut in the given string, after t98 comes t363, which suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, or I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check NT993's productions again.\n\nFrom the user's grammar, NT993 is defined as:\n\nNT993 -> t98 t573.\n\nSo, exactly that. No other production for NT993.\n\nSo, in the string, after t98, the next token must be t573, not t36"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-318","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several non-terminals and their productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the top-level production is S -> NT487 NT993. That means the derivation starts with S and splits into two parts: NT487 and NT993. So the string should start with whatever these produce.\n\nLooking at NT487, it has two productions: it can become NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Similarly, NT993 has productions as well. I'll need to explore the possible derivations until the non-terminals resolve to terminals.\n\nNow, the given string is:\nt363 t278 t237 t131 t637 t444 t278 t217 t217 t555 t804 t535 t363 t467 t555 t637 t592 t372 t573 t892 t637 t573 t278 t30 t804.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t363. Let me check if any of the non-terminals directly produce t363. Looking through the productions, I see NT486 -> 't363'. So t363 could come from NT486. Let's see which productions lead to NT486. NT487 -> NT103 NT486, okay, so if NT487 is used, then one of its paths would be NT103 NT486.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, so each production has exactly two non-terminals except for the terminals. So the derivation for NT487 could be, for example, NT487 -> NT103 NT486, and then NT103 could produce something else.\n\nBut let's think step by step. Starting from S, which is NT487 NT993. So the string starts with whatever NT487 and NT993 produce. The first symbol is t363, which comes from NT486, which is part of NT487. So S -> NT487 NT993 can possibly start with NT487 producing NT103 NT486, and thus t363 comes from NT486, which is from NT487, which is part of S.\n\nSo the first part is t363, which is correct. Now, moving on. After t363, the next symbols are t278, t237, t131, etc. Let's see if these can be produced by the remaining part of the derivation.\n\nLet me outline the possible steps:\n\n1. S -> NT487 NT993\n   - NT487 can go to NT103 NT486, which gives t363.\n   - Then, NT993 has its own productions. From the grammar, NT993 seems to have a production NT990 NT993, but I might have to look it up. Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nChecking the rules, NT993 is not directly a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't993', but NT990 -> 't817', so t993 must come from another production. Hmm, maybe NT993 is part of a longer production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, the initial S is S -> NT487 NT993, which both are non-terminals. So the derivations will expand each of them until they become terminals.\n\nLet me also note that 't894' is a production for NT894.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t363, which is from NT486. Let's see, so S starts as NT487 NT993. So the first step is S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nThen, NT487 can go to NT103 NT486, which then becomes t363. So the first symbol is t363.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t278, which comes from NT278. Wait, looking at the productions, NT278 might be part of another non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let me list out all the productions to understand which ones produce which terminals.\n\nNT487 has two options: NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nNT486: 't363'.\n\nNT103 has a production: NT673 NT964.\n\nNT673: 't848'.\n\nNT964: 't640'.\n\nSo if NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, then NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, giving t848 t640, but our string has t278 after t363. Hmm, that's a problem because t278 would have to come from another production.\n\nWait, maybe NT487 takes the other path: NT933 NT389.\n\nNT933: looking at the productions, NT933 can produce NT351 NT409.\n\nNT351: 't10' and 't217' according to the productions.\n\nLooking at NT10: NT147 NT951.\n\nNT147: 't467'.\n\nNT951: 't466'? Wait, looking at the productions, NT951 has NT147 NT951, which may not be helpful. Alternatively, NT951 can produce 't44'? Wait, no, I'm looking for NT951. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT951 has two productions: NT147 NT951 and 't466'? Or does it produce t466? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\nNT103: NT673 NT964 \u2192 t848 t640.\n\nNT933: NT351 NT409.\n\nNT351: 't10' \u2192 but wait, how?

Because the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols.\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT351 -> NT10 NT217: yes.\n\n- Any others?

Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure is useful for parsing algorithms, but I'm not sure if that helps here. Maybe I should focus on the structure of the given grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's a series of productions starting from S and breaking down into various non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't131', 't804', etc. I notice that some of these non-terminals in the grammar are terminals. For example, NT10 becomes 't147', but wait, let me check: actually, looking at the grammar, NT10 -> NT147 NT951 and then NT147 -> 't804' and NT951 -> 't466'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. So, for the string to be in the language, each 't' must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the terminal productions in the grammar provided:\n\n- NT10 -> 't637'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT60 -> 't637' (Wait, but NT60 also has another production NT60 -> 't573', so actually, NT60 can produce either 't637' or 't573'.)\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT217 -> 't592' and also another production, but wait in the grammar, NT217 appears twice. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see NT217 has two productions:\nNT217 -> NT467\nAnd then later, another NT217 -> 't592'. Wait, no, no, wait. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT217 -> NT467\nAnd then\nNT217 -> 't592'\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, the NT217 is only once. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nNT217 -> NT467 is in the grammar. Is there another production for NT217? Yes, in the last lines, there's:\n\nNT217 -> 't592'\n\nSo NT217 can produce either NT467 or 't592'. Similarly, there's NT367 -> 't30'.\n\nOther terminals are:\n\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT85 -> 't185 NT347'... Wait no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have multiple entries. Let me list them again.\n\nThe grammar productions are:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\n\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\n\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\n\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\n\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\n\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\n\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\n\nNT147 -> NT367 NT591\n\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\n\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\n\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\n\nNT833 -> NT9 NT894\n\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\n\nNT446 -> NT636 NT226\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\nNT591 -> 't804'\n\nNT636 -> 't777'\n\nNT389 -> 't689'\n\nNT588 -> 't37'\n\nNT946 -> 't131'\n\nNT195 -> 't278'\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nNT256 -> 't98'\n\nNT60 -> 't573'\n\nNT347 -> 't593'\n\nNT951 -> 't466'\n\nNT217 -> 't592'\n\nNT486 -> 't363'\n\nNT894 -> 't892'\n\nNT993 -> 't444'\n\nNT588 -> 't535'\n\nNT933 -> 't217'\n\nNT697 -> 't378'\n\nNT964 -> 't640'\n\nNT990 -> 't817'\n\nNT367 -> 't30'\n\nSo each non-terminal on the left has a production on the right. Some non-terminals are terminals, which are given in the productions where they produce a 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo the string to evaluate is: t131 t804 t14 t131 t817 t278 t363 t777 t363 t466 t378 t30 t30 t217 t14 t372 t444 t363 t592 t363 t535 t804 t593 t848 t817.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that produces 't14' is in the string. Let me check: NT147 is a non-terminal that produces 't804', but 't14' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't14'. Because in the given grammar, 't14' isn't listed as a production of any non-terminal. \n\nSo, in the string, we have 't14', which is not part of any terminal production in the grammar. That means the string must have a 't14' that isn't allowed by the grammar, making the entire string not derivable from the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check each production:\n\nLooking at all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT217 -> 't592'\n- NT487 -> 't363'\n- NT894 -> 't892'\n- NT993 -> 't444'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT60 -> 't637' and 't573'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT217 -> 't592'\n- NT486 -> 't363'\n- NT894 -> 't892'\n- NT993 -> 't444'\n- NT588 -> 't535'\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT964 -> 't640'\n- NT990 -> 't817'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\nSo none of the non-terminals produce 't14'. Therefore, the presence of 't14' in the string makes it impossible for that string to be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo the string is: t131 t804 t14 t131 t817 t278 t363 t777 t363 t466 t378 t30 t30 t217 t14 t372 t444 t363 t592 t363 t535 t804 t593 t848 t817.\n\nSince 't14' is not present in any of the terminal productions, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-323","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, which I assume are terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure to understand how the symbols (non-terminals and terminals) combine. Each production rule starts with a non-terminal on the left side, followed by two other non-terminals on the right, except for the terminal symbols, which are written as 't...'.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately expands to NT487 NT993. So the string must start with these two non-terminals or their expansions. Looking at the string, it starts with 't817 t98...', so I need to see if these can be derived from NT487 and NT993.\n\nNext, I'll examine the rules for NT487 and NT993. NT487 has two options: it can split into NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. NT993 has one rule: it becomes NT147 NT951. So I'll follow the chain starting from S.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. S -> NT487 NT993\n   - NT487 has two options.\n   - NT993 -> NT147 NT951.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals will split into their own options until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nLet me try one path first. Suppose NT487 splits into NT933 NT389. Then NT933 and NT389 need to expand into terminals. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT933 -> NT217 NT569 (wait, NT933 actually looks like it might have other rules. Wait, checking the grammar correctly. Let me look again. Oh, wait, the user provided a long part, so I should make sure I'm reading each rule correctly.\n\nLooking at NT933: The given rules don't directly show NT933, but I see NT389 -> NT569 NT756. Wait, sorry, maybe I misread. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- NT389 has a rule: NT389 -> NT569 NT756 and another: NT389 -> NT... Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, NT389's production is: NT389 -> NT569 NT756. Hmm, but then looking further, NT756 -> NT256 NT833, and NT256 -> NT446 NT946, and so on. So I need to track the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. The string starts with 't817 t98...', so perhaps each 't' is a terminal, and the number indicates the terminal symbol. So 't817' is a terminal, as is 't98', etc.\n\nTo see if S can generate the string, I'll try to parse it step by step using the grammar.\n\n1. S -> NT487 NT993\n   - So the first two symbols should be expansions of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terms are 't817 t98'. So 't817' is from NT487, and 't98' is from NT993.\n\nCheck if NT487 can derive 't817' or 't933' (from the two options of NT487: -> NT103 NT486 or -> NT933 NT389).\n\nLooking at NT487's options: NT487 can expand into NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nIf the first terminal is 't817', which of these options leads to that. The options are:\n\n- NT103: leads to 't673' and 't964' (since NT103 -> NT673 NT964 which are terminals). So NT103 would produce 't673 t964', which doesn't match 't817'.\n\n- NT933: Now, looking at NT933. In the grammar, I don't see NT933 being a non-terminal because, in the provided list, I see NT351, NT185, etc., but not NT933. Wait, am I missing it?\n\nWait, in the grammar list provided, I see NT389 has a production, but not NT933. Let me check again. The user provided grammar rules starting from S and various NTs. The rules given include NT351, NT85, NT389, but I need to confirm if NT933 is defined.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT389: NT389 -> NT569 NT756 and -> NT... Oh, wait, that might not be it. Wait, the rules in the user's input are:\n\nNT389: -> NT569 NT756.\n\nLooking again, I think I might have an error. Let me list them properly from the user's input to make sure I don't miss any.\n\nLooking at the rules provided:\n\n- NT9 -> NT60 NT530\n- NT226 -> NT85 NT530\n- NT256 -> NT446 NT946\n- NT756 -> NT256 NT833\n- NT185 -> NT990 NT697\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n- NT351 -> NT10 NT217\n- NT85 -> NT185 NT347\n- NT389 -> NT569 NT756\n- NT697 -> NT351 NT409\n- NT147 -> NT367 NT591\n- NT226 -> NT399 NT368\n- NT530 -> NT60 NT446\n- NT10 -> NT147 NT951\n- NT833 -> NT9 NT894\n- NT569 -> NT195 NT588\n- NT446 -> NT636 NT226\n- NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n- NT591 -> 't804'\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT389 -> 't689'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT60 -> 't637'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT60 -> 't573'\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT217 -> 't467'\n- NT409 -> 't555'\n- NT368 -> 't237'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT673 -> 't848'\n- NT217 -> 't592' (Wait, is this a separate rule?

Let me list out the terminals in the string:\n\nt689, t467, t444, t30, t467, t378, t444, t467, t637, t592, t466, t278, t372, t217, t535, t637, t573, t372, t444, t372, t444, t804, t217, t804, t804, t98.\n\nNow, I'll map each terminal to the corresponding non-terminal based on the grammar. For example, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 't689' (since NT487 has two productions: one into 't689' and another into 't486')\n- NT85 \u2192 't185' and other symbols\n- Need to check each non-terminal to see which terminals they produce.\n\nI'll create a mapping for each non-terminal to its possible terminals:\n\nNT487:\n- NT487 \u2192 't689' (yes)\n- NT487 \u2192 't486' \n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT487's productions are:\n\u2192 NT103 NT486\n\u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nBut for NT487 \u2192 't689' is a terminal production. So when NT487 is derived, it can be 't689' or further split into NT103 and NT486.\n\nSimilarly, NT389 has two productions:\n\u2192 't689' wait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT351: NT10 NT217\nOther non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT389: its productions are:\n\u2192 NT569 NT756\n\u2192 't689'? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT389 has a production:\n\nNT389 \u2192 't689' is not the case. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT103 \u2192 't673' and 't964'\nNT389 has the productions:\n\u2192 NT569 NT756\n\u2192 't689' ?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nStarting with the first symbol in the string: t689.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t689? Looking through the productions:\n\nI see that NT389 has a production:\nNT389 \u2192 't689' \n\nAlso, NT487 can produce 't689' as one of its alternatives.\n\nSo, t689 can come from NT389 or NT487. Let me consider this.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the production for NT487 is either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. But the other option from NT487 is to produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no. The productions for NT487 are:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nBut in the grammar, I think NT487 has a direct terminal production. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, looking at NT487: it does have 't689' as a production?\n\nNo, looking back, the grammar is as follows:\n\nNT487: \n-> NT103 NT486\n-> NT933 NT389\n\nWait, but in the user's message, the grammar is:\n\n...\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n...\n\nWait, no 't689' production for NT487.\n\nBut then, looking at NT389:\n\nThe productions are:\n\nNT389 -> 't689'? Let me check the grammar.\n\nThe user provided grammar:\n\nNT389:\n-> NT569 NT756\n-> 't689'\n\nNo, actually, I think I might have misinterpreted earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar provided by the user includes:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT389 is defined with two rules: one that produces a pair of non-terminals, and another that produces 't689'? Let me check the exact lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT389 -> 't689'\n\nYes, so NT389 can be 't689' or split into NT569 and NT756.\n\nSimilarly, NT487 doesn't have 't689' as a production, so t689 must come from NT389.\n\nSo the first symbol t689 is from NT389.\n\nSo the derivation starts as:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\nNT487 \u2192 ? Well, no, S is split into NT487 and NT993. But wait, in the string, the first symbols are t689, t467, etc. So maybe the initial rule is used, but perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be decomposed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be parsed from the bottom up, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be reduced according to the reverse of the grammar.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nStarting with the string:\n\nt689 t467 t444 t30 t467 t378 t444 t467 t637 t592 t466 t278 t372 t217 t535 t637 t573 t372 t444 t372 t444 t804 t217 t804 t804 t98.\n\nI need to group symbols into the rules of the grammar. Since it's CNF, every rule results in exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo the idea is to find pairs of symbols that match either a two-terminal production or a two-nonterminal production.\n\nLet's look for two-terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the string, each 't' is followed by a number, which is a terminal. But in the grammar, all terminals are like 'tXXX', but let's note that each 't' is part of a longer symbol: 't689' is one, 't467' another, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the 't's are concatenated with numbers, so each 'tXXX' represents a single terminal.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of 26 terminals: each 'tXXX' is a terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps each pair in the reduction must consist of two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nLet's attempt to find the top-level structure. The start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So S expands into two non-terminals. Therefore, in the string, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT487 and NT993.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be divided into two parts, each derived from NT487 and NT99"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-339","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, CNF usually has the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where A is a terminal. Wait, let me check the grammar provided. Looking at the rules, I see that some have two non-terminals on the right, like S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which fits CNF since each production is length two. But I also see some rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal, like NT367 \u2192 't30', which should be allowed in CNF. So the grammar seems to be correctly in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t817 t555 t278 t37 t467 t640 t637 t848 t363 t98 t555 t640 t378 t535 t217 t30 t217 t817 t444 t817 t817 t217 t378 t98 t804 t131 t573`.\n\nI need to parse this string using the given grammar. Since it's CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm, but maybe a simpler way is to see if the string can be split into the sequence of terminal symbols that correspond to the parse steps.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level production: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string should start with NT487 followed by NT993. However, the given string starts with t817. Wait, that's a terminal. Let me check the productions for NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487: It has two rules, one of which is NT487 \u2192 't363' and another \u2192 't98'. Similarly, NT993 has two rules: \u2192 't444' and \u2192 't804'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT487 NT993 would generate sequences that start with t363, t98, followed by t444, t804. But wait, in the string, the first token is t817, which doesn't match any of the immediate productions. That seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me make sure. The string starts with t817. Looking at the productions, t817 can only come from NT990 \u2192 t817. But how does NT990 get generated? Let's trace back.\n\nLet me see what NT990's production is. Looking through the rules, I see NT990 \u2192 t817. That's direct. So to generate t817, you need NT990. Now, how is NT990 derived? Let's see the productions for NT990. Looking through, I don't see any further rules, so it's a terminal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let's check all the NT rules.\n\nWait, for NT990, in the list of productions, I don't see a production like NT990 \u2192 something else. Wait, checking the list again. Oh, I think I made a mistake.

I don't see 't817' being generated from NT487 or NT993 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the given string again. The first token is 't817', which I thought might come from NT487, but according to the productions, NT487 leads to 't363' or 't933 NT389'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see the entire string again.\n\nWait, actually, the string is split into tokens, so each 't' followed by a number is a terminal.

The start symbol S is NT487 NT993, so the initial production is two parts: NT487 and NT993. Now, each of these non-terminals can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT487, the productions are:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo from NT487, I can get either 't363' (NT486) or need to further expand if it's a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 is in the productions:\nNT993 \u2192 NT85 NT347\n\nSo from NT993, it produces NT85 and NT347.\n\nLooking at NT85, it produces NT185 NT347.\n\nWait, this might get complicated because I need to track both branches and see if they can produce the required terminals. Maybe building the parse tree step by step would help. Let's try.\n\nThe initial string starts with t817 t689. Let's see what S produces: NT487 and NT993. So we can split the string into two parts, each starting with t817 and t689 respectively, and then check if each part can be derived from the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nSo, first part: t817 (from NT487) and second part: t689 (from NT993). Wait, but according to the productions, NT487 only produces other non-terminals or terminals, so 't817' must come from the expansion of NT487. Let me check what NT487 can produce.\n\nLooking back, NT487's first option is NT103 NT486. Now, NT486 is in the productions, and from NT486, it produces 't363'. So if NT487 expands to NT486, then the terminal would be 't363', but in the string, after the initial t817, the next is t689. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm wrong in thinking it's NT487 starting with t817. Let me check if there's any NT that produces t817.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't817'. Hmm, that's a problem. That would mean that the first token 't817' can't come from any of the non-terminals in the grammar. So that might mean the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Let me list all the NT productions and see if any of them can produce t817.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT367 \u2192 NT30 (which is 't30')\n- NT591 \u2192 't278'\n- NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\n- NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467 NT592\n- NT990 \u2192 NT817 NT372\n- NT467 \u2192 NT689 NT464 (wait, no: looking back, the user input shows NT467 \u2192 't30', but in the grammar list, it's NT467 \u2192 't30'.

Let me re-examine the entire grammar.\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\nNT10: NT147 NT951\nNT10: NT147 NG968 -> Wait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for NT10:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\n\nAlso:\n\nNT951 -> 't466' (from the list)\n\nSimilarly, NT217 has two options:\n\nNT217 -> NT467 NT592\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing 't817' in any NT productions. So if the string starts with t817, it must come from some NT expansion, but I don't see any NT that can produce it. This suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014 am I misreading the grammar? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions, the terminals (t followed by a number) are for the right-hand sides. Looking for 't817', I see it appears in the production:\n\nNT990 \u2192 NT817 NT372\n\nSo, NT990 can produce 't817' as part of its expansion. But to get NT990, which part of the grammar does it come from? Let me see which non-terminals can produce NT990.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the start symbol S is NT487 NT993, and other parts are built from various NTs.\n\nDoes any NT other than S have 993? NT993's production is NT85 NT347, and NT85 is NT185 NT347, and so on. But I don't see NT990 being a direct child except in the production of NT990 itself. So, perhaps to get 't817', I need to find a way to get to NT990.\n\nWait, but is there a way to derive NT990 from S or any other starting point?

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t378 t555 t14 t817 t14 t592 t777 t892 t640 t466 t444 t640 t372 t37 t131 t30 t535 t689 t592 t98 t217 t689 t37 t640 t467 t689 t217 t363`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The string consists of terminal symbols, which are parts like 't378', 't555', etc. Each of these must have been derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a lot of NT rules that expand into two other NTs, each of which further expand until they become terminals. For instance, 'NT993' becomes 't444' in one rule, and that's it. So each terminal in the string must be produced by some NT.\n\nThe string starts with 't378'. Checking the grammar, I see that NT373 might be involved since 't373' is a terminal (I think I saw 'NT373 -> 't373'), but wait, looking again, the grammar has NT367 -> 't363', NT399 -> 't372', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to track back how each terminal is reached.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar, step by step. The initial symbol is S, so S must derive the entire string through a series of expansions.\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string should start with NT487 and NT993 expanding. Let's see what these produce. From the grammar:\n\nNT487 has two options: NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389. Similarly, NT993 is another terminal, 't444', so the string starts with something like 't444' or a combination from NT487.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't378 t555 t14...'. Wait, the string starts with 't378', which is a terminal; so perhaps NT487 \u2192 't378' through some path, but looking, I don't see NT487 directly producing a terminal. Instead, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. So let's check those:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, both of which are non-terminals until NT673 is 't673' and NT964 is 't964'. Wait, the string has 't673' later. Let me go through step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t378\n2. t555\n3. t14\n4. t817\n5. t14\n6. t592\n7. t777\n8. t892\n9. t640\n10. t466\n11. t444\n12. t640\n13. t372\n14. t37\n15. t131\n16. t30\n17. t535\n18. t689\n19. t592\n20. t98\n21. t217\n22. t689\n23. t37\n24. t640\n25. t467\n26. t689\n27. t217\n28. t363\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the first part is NT487 generating some terms, then NT993 generating 't444'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is 't378'. So does any rule produce 't378'? Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't378'. So perhaps that's not the first step.\n\nWait, maybe the string is constructed by all NTs expanding until the terminals are at the beginning.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to see how each terminal can be produced.\n\nAlternatively, note that the grammar is a CFG with only right-hand sides of two non-terminals, except for some cases where a terminal is produced. So the derivation must end in a sequence of terminals obtained by fully expanding the non-terminals into terminals.\n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT487 NT993, the string starts with 't378', which would require NT487 to produce 't378', but in the grammar, NT487 only produces two non-terminals. So maybe that's a dead end, meaning the string starts with a non-terminal. So perhaps NT487 must expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the start symbol S isn't directly expanding in the first step. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with a non-terminal that eventually expands into the given terminals. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is such that each terminal is directly reachable from some non-terminal, so we can step through the string as follows, checking if each terminal can be produced from the preceding non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to map each non-terminal to possible terminals.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't673': NT673 \u2192 't673' (rule: NT636 \u2192 NT673 NT964). Wait, no, the grammar rule is NT636 \u2192 NT964 \u2192 't964' and NT636 \u2192 't777'? Wait, I need to check the rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT636 \u2192 NT964 | 't777', because the rule is NT636 \u2192 't777'.\n\nWait, actually, no: looking through the rules, I see NT636 has two options: NT964 and 't777'. So NT636 directly can produce 't777' or go to NT964.\n\nSo if NT636 can produce 't777', and somewhere in the string, there's a 't777' which is the 7th term. Let me check the string index: 't777' is index 7, so position 7.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT487 NT993. NT993 \u2192 't444', as per the rule NT993 \u2192 't444' or maybe another rule? Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules: the production for NT993 is listed as 't444', so yes, it's a terminal. So the first part of the string after S would be the expansion of NT487, then 't444'. But in the string, the first term is 't378', which suggests that the expansion of NT487 in the string starts with 't378', which isn't a direct production, meaning maybe NT487 must expand further into non-terminals that eventually produce 't378'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal only produces two options for NTs, none of which produce a terminal directly except for NT993 \u2192 't444' and other rules. Wait, let me go through all NTs to see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT993 \u2192 't444'\n- NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' and 't592'\n- NT487 \u2192 both options produce NTs, no term here\n- NT487 again \u2192 same\n- NT147 \u2192 't363'\n- NT530 \u2192 NT60 and NT446\n- NT60 \u2192 't637', 't573', etc.\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT588 \u2192 't535'\n- NT933 \u2192 't217'\n- NT697 \u2192 't378', 't640', etc.\nWait, looking for where each NT directly leads to a terminal.\n\nCheck each NT:\n\n- NT993: yes, 't444'\n- NT636: yes, 't777'\n- NT217: yes, 't467', 't592'\n- NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-353","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are a bit complex, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It looks like each non-terminal symbol on the left side of the arrow can produce exactly two non-terminal symbols, except for a few that produce terminal symbols or combinations. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT487 and NT993. That means to derive any string, starting from S, I'll expand NT487 and NT993.\n\nNext, the string provided is: t444 t535 t640 t466 t593 t593 t131 t555 t278 t466 t593 t98 t278 t640 t372 t592 t467 t363 t592 t363 t278 t131 t535 t573 t892 t817 t848.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a three-digit number is a terminal symbol, while the NTs are non-terminals. My task is to check if this string can be derived by expanding the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the terminals produced by NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT487 is defined as a production that can go to NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Similarly, NT993 may have a production rule (I think it's defined, but the provided grammar didn't show it. Wait, no, in the grammar, I see NT993 is not present; let me check again. Oh, actually, the list provided doesn't include NT993 beyond S, but I think each NT in the list comes from the grammar. Wait, perhaps the NT993 is part of the start and has a production. Hmm, the initial rules don't show NT993's production, so maybe that's why it's defined in S. But the provided grammar doesn't have a rule for NT993 except for S. So, perhaps I misread. Let me look again. Oh, sorry, the rules are all the non-terminals except S, which is defined by NT487 and NT993. So perhaps NT993 is a terminal? But according to the string, I see 't993' as part of the string, so maybe it was derived from something. Wait, no, the rules don't include NT993, so perhaps it's a terminal symbol. But in the string, 't993' isn't present, wait: Hmm, the string is given, so I shouldn't assume. Let me check the string again. Oh, wait, I see 't444', 't535', etc., but I don't see 't993' in the string. Hmm, maybe NT993 leads to 't993', but perhaps the grammar is such that the S expansion leads to the string provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the method of checking whether the string can be built by the grammar, considering the number of symbols and their derivation.\n\nEach step of the grammar expansion doubles the number of symbols because each non-terminal is split into two. But the provided string has 27 symbols (each 't' plus three digits is one symbol, and the breakdown is as such: t444, t535, t640, ..., t848). Wait, let's count the number of symbols: the string given is a sequence of 27 'tXXX' terms.\n\nBut since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol S will, after n productions, result in 2^n symbols. But in our case, the string has 27 symbols, which is an odd number. Since 2^n is always even except for n=0, which would be 1, this is impossible. Therefore, the number of symbols cannot be 27. Because each expansion step replaces one symbol with two, the number of symbols must be 2^k where k is the number of expansion steps applied to the initial symbol.\n\nWait, wait, the initial S produces two symbols, so after one expansion, we have two. If each of those is expanded, we get four, and so on. So the number of symbols is a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^4 is 16. But our string is 27 symbols, which is neither. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because the number of symbols must be a power of two, but 27 is not.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The string has 27 symbols, and each time you expand a non-terminal, you replace one symbol with two. So starting with one symbol, S, and each expansion increases the number of symbols by one. So the total number after k expansions is 1 + k. Wait, that can't be right because each expansion replaces one symbol with two, so the count increases by one each time. But 27 is 1 + 26 expansions? Hmm, but the structure of the grammar (all productions are two symbols, except possibly terminal symbols) might affect this. Wait, perhaps the number of symbols is 2^k, as each step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nFor example: S (1 NT) \u2192 2 NTs (2), then each of those could become 4 NTs, etc. So the total number of symbols at various steps would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. So 27 isn't a power of two, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the string is not generated by this grammar because the number of symbols is not a power of two.

The string to check is `t363 t278 t444 t131 t555 t555 t817 t217 t37 t444 t37 t848 t637 t467 t689 t372 t535 t535 t37 t217 t640 t817 t892 t637 t555 t467 t217 t637 t593`. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the starting symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when it's the start symbol producing two terminals. Wait, actually, no, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC (where A, B, C are non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (where a is a terminal). So each production produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and another non-terminal? Or maybe each production can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal?\n\nWait, no, CNF requires that all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each production can produce a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, each production seems to replace a non-terminal (like S, NT9, etc.) with exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But actually, looking closer, each production is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So, it's two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That suggests that the grammar is in CNF, as each production is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals. So maybe the start symbol eventually will derive into a string of terminals by applying these productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, each production is NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So each non-terminal (NT) expands into two non-terminals. That suggests that the grammar is in a form where each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, because each NT is replaced by two NTs, which themselves will be replaced, etc., until all the way down to the base cases where NTx \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So the grammar is structured in a way that each production reduces a single NT into two NTs, which then get replaced until finally, some NTs produce terminals directly.\n\nSo, for the string to be in the language, every terminal symbol in the string must have a corresponding path through the grammar. That is, for each 't' symbol in the string, it must be derivable from some NT, and the arrangement of these 't's must form a parse tree that respects the grammar's productions.\n\nSince the grammar is large, it's not practical to manually parse the string step by step. But perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down according to the chain of productions. Each step in the derivation would involve replacing a non-terminal with two others until the entire string is terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is binary and the starting symbol S is NT9 (S \u2192 NT993 NT287, wait, S is defined as NT993 NT226?), no. Wait, grammar line: S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Wait, no, looking at the structure, S is split into two NTs: NT487 and NT993. So, S is replaced by these two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me look: first line, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So S is replaced by two NTs: NT487 and NT993. So the derivation will start by S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Then each of those NTs will have to produce their own children, and so on.\n\nSo, the string starts with t363, which must come from some NT's production chain. Similarly, each segment of the string must correspond to a series of derivations of NTs into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce a terminal: for example, NT487 \u2192 t363, as per the production NT487 \u2192 t363. Similarly, NT60 \u2192 t637, NT256 \u2192 t98, NT487 \u2192 t363, etc. So, each NT can produce a terminal, or two NTs, which can in turn produce more terminals.\n\nSo, the process might be to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by a chain of NT productions. But it's more than that\u2014the entire string must be the concatenation of the results of all those productions.\n\nGiven the string's length is 40 symbols (including spaces, wait, no, the string is `t363 t278 t444 t131 ...`), but actually, I think each space is just a separator, so the string is a series of 30 't's with numbers. So, each token in the string must be the result of some NT's production.\n\nSo, let me look at the first symbol: t363. Checking the grammar, NT487 \u2192 t363. So, either the first NT is NT487. Then, after NT487 is derived into t363, the next NT in the string would be t278. So, what NT produces t278? Looking through the grammar, NT389 \u2192 t278. So, to get t278, the NT must be NT389, which comes from either NT487 (because in the production, NT487 has two options: one that produces t363 and another that produces t933 ... wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT487 has two productions:\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo, either producing NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389. Now, NT486 \u2192 t363. So one option is that NT487 \u2192 t363 NT486 (but wait, the production is NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, not producing a terminal. Or, wait no: looking at the grammar rules, NT487's productions are both in the form NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389, but in the given grammar, it's:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSo, to get a terminal from NT487, it must take one of those two routes, but those both produce non-terminals, not terminals. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t363, which is from NT487. But according to the grammar, NT487 can't directly produce a terminal. So perhaps that's a problem.\n\nWait, that's a critical point. Let me check NT487. The two productions are:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nNeither of those produce a terminal directly. So the only way for t363 to appear is if NT103 or NT933 produces a terminal. So let's check those.\n\nNT103's production:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nand\nNT103 \u2192 NT593 NT...\n\nWait, in the grammar, line NT103 is:\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\nNT103 -> NT593\n\nWait, no, looking again: the line is NT103 -> NT673 NT964\nand another? No, only that. Wait, no. Looking back, the grammar for NT103 is: NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964 and NT103 \u2192 NT593.\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT103: is it present?\n\nAh, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\nand no other production except NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964 and perhaps a production for NT103 \u2192 't something'? Wait, the given grammar, for NT103, is only the production NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964 and another line is NT367 \u2192 NT30.

{"custom_id":"request-362","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S:\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\nSo S must be split into NT487 and NT993, each of which will be generated in the derivation.\n\nNow, I'll start by seeing how NT487 and NT993 can be expanded. Let's look at each:\n\nNT487 can be:\n- NT103 NT486\n- NT933 NT389\n\nNT993 is:\n- NT256 NT833\n\nSo, the entire string must be a combination of the sequences derived from these NTs.\n\nThe given string is split into tokens by spaces, so it's a list of tokens that must appear in order, generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll note that each production leads to a specific sequence of terminals. For example, NT367 \u2192 t30, meaning that whenever NT367 is derived, it will produce the terminal 't30'.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can represent it as a sequence and check if each step can be derived from the grammar rules.\n\nLet me write down the string as a list of tokens for clarity:\n1. t592\n2. t555\n3. t131\n4. t535\n5. t777\n6. t689\n7. t535\n8. t37\n9. t804\n10. t278\n11. t217\n12. t592\n13. t593\n14. t372\n15. t37\n16. t131\n17. t777\n18. t30\n19. t817\n20. t555\n21. t237\n22. t892\n23. t848\n24. t640\n25. t804\n26. t37\n27. t892\n28. t535\n29. t372\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to match the string by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\nSo, the string starts with NT487, which can branch into NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLooking at the string's first token: t592. Wait, looking at the rules, what non-terminals expand to 't592'? Let me check each production rule for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 t592 (Yes, production 22)\n- NT367 \u2192 t30 (Yes, production 37)\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591 (production 14)\n- NT367 \u2192 t30 (so, if NT367 can somehow come from other paths, but NT367 only leads to t30. Hmm.)\n\nWait, let's check which non-terminals lead to t592. Looking through the rule list:\n\nNT217 \u2192 t592. So, NT217 is the one that gives t592.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t593, t37, etc.\n\nt555: Looking for a rule that expands to t555.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573' in different productions? Wait, some rules have 't637' and others 't573'. For example, NT60 has two rules: NT60 \u2192 't637' (production 16) and NT60 \u2192 't573' (production 21). So for NT60, you can choose between generating 't637' or 't573'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have multiple terminal options.\n\nSo, let's start building a parse tree step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nSo the first two symbols must be derived from NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t592 and t555.\n\nSo, NT487 must expand to t592 and NT993 must expand to t555.\n\nLooking for ways:\n\n- NT487 can expand to NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nIf NT487 is to produce t592, which is generated only by NT217 \u2192 t592. So NT487 must expand to NT217 NTx where x leads to something that eventually produces t555.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each NT487's rule produces two NTs, not terminals. So, actually, the grammar is such that each step replaces a non-terminal with two NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, when you expand NT487, you get two NTs, e.g., NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486. So, each time you expand a non-terminal, it's replaced by two new non-terminals, until you get to a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, some productions have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT60 \u2192 't637' (so that production is A \u2192 a). So that means you can replace NT60 with the terminal 't637'.\n\nSo, when generating the string, you have to start with S and replace non-terminals with other symbols, eventually reaching terminals.\n\nSo, the parsing approach would be: starting with S, replace the non-terminals step by step to see if we can end up with the given string.\n\nBut this might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the possible terminals that each NT can generate.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to create a table that maps each NT to the possible terminals it can produce, considering its productions.\n\nSo, for each NT, list all the possible terminal symbols it can produce through a series of derivations.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT487 can produce:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nNow, each of these NTs may have their own expansions. So, to find the terminals that NT487 can produce, we need to consider all possible combinations of NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better way is to consider the given string and see if it can be split into segments that match the possible expansions of each NT.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t592. Looking at the rules, t592 is generated by NT217 \u2192 t592 (production 22). So, someone must have derived NT217 as the first symbol. But wait, NT217 is on the right-hand side of NT147's production: NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591, and NT367 \u2192 t30. So, NT147 will produce two symbols: t30 and NT591, which perhaps can be further expanded.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t592, which is produced directly from NT217 \u2192 t592. So, perhaps NT487 is NT217, which is one of its expansions.\n\nWait, let me see: NT217 is a non-terminal, and looking at its rules, NT217 \u2192 t592. So, NT217 can produce t592 directly. So, if the start symbol S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and if one of those is NT217, which directly produces t592, then that's part of the derivation.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 expands to some NTs, which eventually produce t555.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT993: it's NT256 NT833.\n\nSo, NT256 \u2192 't98' (production 24) and NT833 \u2192 't892' (production 22, wait, no: looking back, NT833 \u2192 't892'?"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. Context-free grammars consist of a set of production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into sequences of terminals and non-terminals. The given grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most rules on the left side, like S -> NT487 NT993, break down each NT symbol into two other NT symbols. For example, NT487 can go to either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Each of these seems to further expand until eventually they reach terminal symbols, like 't848', 't466', etc.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I think I should try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules.\n\nLet's start by noting the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT487 NT993. So, the string should start with the expansions of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string: `t848 t466 t467 t372 t817 t555 t14 t689 t378 t573 t98 t892 t237 t535 t14 t237 t14 t237 t237 t363 t30 t592 t378 t555 t555 t444 t640 t278 t593 t637`.\n\nBreaking this into pairs according to the rules:\n\n1. The first symbol is t848. Let's see which NT rule produces t848. Looking at the rules, I see NT636 -> 't777' and NT446 -> 't636'. Wait, but NT446 can only go to t636, not t848. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check all NT rules that end with t848.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I spot NT894 -> 't892' and NT367 -> 't30'. Wait, no. I think I need to check each NT symbol that directly produces a t with a high number. Wait, looking back, I see NT894 -> 't892' and NT993 -> 't444'. But the string starts with t848, so maybe I need to check which NT rule leads to t848.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me map each terminal to its possible NT symbols. For example, t848 is directly derived from NT636 because NT636 -> 't777' isn't correct. Wait no, looking again, I see NT636 -> 't636'. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me list them again:\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT636 \u2192 't636'\n\nNT446 \u2192 't636'\n\nNT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, that doesn't produce t848. Maybe I misread a rule.\n\nWait, actually, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nWait, and:\n\nNT33's... actually, maybe I'm looking for a NT that directly produces t848. But I don't see an NT rule that directly produces t848. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe it's derived through multiple steps. For example, NT636 -> 't636' but that's only for NT636. Alternatively, NT894 -> 't892', which also doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT636 \u2192 't636' (line 14)\n\nNT446 \u2192 't636' (line 18)\n\nNT367 \u2192 't30' (line 32)\n\nWait, that's the only NTs that produce terminals. So none of the NTs directly produce t848. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake. Let me see. Oh, maybe one of the rules produces 't848'. Wait, looking at line 10, NT10 -> NT147 NT951, but that doesn't produce t848.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all possible NTs that produce terminals and their corresponding t's:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' (line 20)\n- NT573 \u2192 't573' (line 20)\n- NT486 \u2192 't363' (line 24)\n- NT894 \u2192 't892' (line 25)\n- NT951 \u2192 't466' (line 27)\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' (line 29)\n- NT951 \u2192 't14' (line 30)\n- Wait, line 30: NT951 \u2192 't466' and another rule? Let me check line 30: NT951 \u2192 't466' and NT217 \u2192 't467' (line 29).\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing lines.

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take my time to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, I know that the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, and it directly produces NT487 NT993. So any string generated by this grammar must start with these two non-terminals, and each of them must eventually derive to a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me jot down the key points:\n- The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by some numbers: `t640 t689 t593 t467 t98 t444 t444 t467 t637 t535 t363 t237 t131 t37 t378 t131 t217 t892 t467 t848 t37 t689 t637 t30 t30 t535 t592 t637 t363 t131`.\n\n- Each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a single terminal. Since we're dealing with a string of terminals, every non-terminal in the derivation must eventually produce terminals via these productions.\n\nI should break down the process by starting from the start symbol S and see how it can derive down to the given string.\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nSo the string must start with NT487 and NT993 derived from it. Let me look at NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487, the productions are:\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nAnd NT993 is:\nNT993 \u2192 NT85 NT964\n\nLet me pick one production for NT487. Let's say I take NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486.\n\nNow, looking at NT103:\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n\nWait, NT103 can derive to NT673 and NT964.\n\nLooking at NT673:\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\n\nAnd NT964:\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\n\nSo NT673 produces 't848', and NT964 produces 't640'. So from NT103, we get 't848 t640'.\n\nNow, looking at NT486:\nNT486 \u2192 't363'\n\nSo from NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, the string part becomes 't848 t640 t363'.\n\nNext, looking at NT993 \u2192 NT85 NT964:\n\nNT85:\nNT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n\nNT185:\nNT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n\nNT990:\nNT990 \u2192 NT367 NT951\n\nLet's pick NT990 \u2192 NT367 NT951.\n\nNT367:\nNT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT951:\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\n\nWait, that would give us 't30 t466'.\n\nBut NT990 could also split into other productions. Let me check other options.\n\nAlternatively, NT990 \u2192 NT367 NT951. Another path, I see NT951 can produce 't14', but wait, looking back, in the NT951 production, there's actually two options:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\nNT951 \u2192 NT466 (Wait, that's a typo? No, probably 't466' from earlier productions. Wait, let me check the provided grammar carefully.\n\nWait, looking at NT951, in the productions, I see:\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\n\nYes, so NT951 \u2192 't466'. So if I choose NT990 \u2192 NT367 NT951, then it's 't30 t466'.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the actual grammar:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\nNT486 \u2192 't363'\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964 \u2192 't848 t640'\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 \u2192 't848 t640 t363'\n\nNow, back to NT993 \u2192 NT85 NT964.\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n\nNT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n\nNT990 \u2192 NT367 NT951\n\nThen NT367 is 't30' and NT951 \u2192 't466' as per the production NT951 \u2192 't466'.\n\nSo NT990 gives 't30 t466'.\n\nTherefore, NT185 \u2192 't30 t466'\n\nThen NT85 \u2192 't30 t466 t640'\n\nWait, no. Because NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347, and each of these non-terminals is replaced by their productions.\n\nSo NT185 \u2192 't30 t466' and NT347, let me check.\n\nWait, NT347 is another non-terminal. In the grammar, I see:\n\nNT347 \u2192 't593'\n\nYes, looking at the productions:\n\nNT347 \u2192 't593'\n\nSo, NT185 \u2192 't30' (from NT367) 't466' (from NT951). So 't30 t466'.\n\nTherefore, NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347 \u2192 't30 t466' 't593' \u2192 't30 t466 t593'.\n\nSo the entire NT993 derivation is:\n\nNT993 \u2192 NT85 NT964 \u2192 't30 t466 t593' 't640' \u2192 't30 t466 t593 t640'.\n\nWait, that's one way. But let me consider all possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, NT85 could go through other productions if available, but from the provided grammar, NT85 only has one production: NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347. So that's the only way.\n\nSo combining with the earlier part from NT487, the string so far is:\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT487 NT993 \u2192 't848 t640 t363' 't30 t466 t593 t640'\n\nSo the initial part is 't848 t640 t363 t30 t466 t593 t640'.\n\nHmm, but the given string starts with 't640 t689 t593...', which is different.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial assumption may be incorrect because the given string starts with 't640', while according to this path, it starts with 't848 t640...'.\n\nThis indicates a discrepancy. Either my derivation is wrong, or the initial choice of production for NT487 is incorrect.\n\nLet me try another production for NT487.\n\nInstead of NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, let's try NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT487 NT993 \u2192 NT933 NT389 NT993.\n\nNow, NT933 and NT389.\n\nLooking at NT933:\nNT933 \u2192 NT217 NT952? Wait, no. Let's check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT226 \u2192 NT367 NT217\n\nNT217 \u2192 't467' (from 't467' or looking back, is that the case?)\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit long, so let me verify each non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT933: the productions are not listed. Wait, did I miss some?\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, after NT127 comes NT131, etc. Wait, the grammar listed seems to cover up to NT60 and some others.

{"custom_id":"request-387","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or to a terminal string. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the initial production. The start symbol is S, which produces NT487 and NT993. So, the string starts with 't217 t640 t640 t30'... Hmm, wait, the string doesn't start with 't217 t640'. It starts with 't217 t640 t640 t30', but wait, let me check. The string is: `t217 t640 t640 t30 t592 t640 t640 t593 t237 t892 t892 t278 t848 t278 t30 t466 t217 t777 t131 t217 t444 t237 t217 t573 t640 t467 t278 t640 t848 t573 t37`. \n\nWait, the first part is 't217 t640 t640 t30'. The production rules might lead to that. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at NT487, it has two productions: NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389. NT103 is derived from NT673 NT964. NT673 is a terminal 't848', and NT964 is a terminal 't640'. So, NT487 can produce 't848 t640'. Wait, but in the string, after t217 t640, we have t640 followed by t30. Hmm, that seems off because applying the production for NT487 (which is part of S) would produce two symbols, like t848 t640, but the string has another t640. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial step is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Then each NT... should be expanded. Let me break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t-commands. Let me list them: \n\n1: t217\n\n2: t640\n\n3: t640\n\n4: t30\n\n5: t592\n\n6: t640\n\n7: t640\n\n8: t593\n\n9: t237\n\n10: t892\n\n11: t892\n\n12: t278\n\n13: t848\n\n14: t278\n\n15: t30\n\n16: t466\n\n17: t217\n\n18: t777\n\n19: t131\n\n20: t217\n\n21: t444\n\n22: t237\n\n23: t217\n\n24: t573\n\n25: t640\n\n26: t467\n\n27: t278\n\n28: t640\n\n29: t848\n\n30: t573\n\n31: t37.\n\nWait, that's 31 tokens. Since the initial S is two non-terminals, the derivation would produce a tree where the root is S, with two children, each of which is a subtree. Each non-terminal in the productions leads to two symbols, so the number of leaves in the parse tree should be even, but the string has 31, which is odd. That might already be a problem because if the grammar produces a string by applying rules that each add two symbols starting from S, the total number should be even. Wait, but each production could produce terminals, which can be multiple in a single production? Wait, in CNF, each production is only two non-terminals except for the terminal productions, but all the other rules when expanded would produce two symbols. But in this grammar, some non-terminals lead directly to terminals, like NT60 \u2192 't637', so maybe the leaves can be single terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reconstruct the parse. Let me list the parse steps.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nNT487 can expand to either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLet's assume the leftmost production is used. NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486.\n\nNow, NT103 is a non-terminal. Its production is NT673 NT964. Both are terminals, as NT673 \u2192 't848' and NT964 \u2192 't640'.\n\nSo, NT103 expands to t848 t640.\n\nThen, NT486. Looking at NT486, its production is 't363'. Wait, NT486 is a terminal? Or does it produce a single terminal symbol, 't363'.\n\nWait, the production for NT486 is 't363', which is a single terminal. So the NT487 production would expand to t848 t640 t363.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t217, there's t640, then again t640, then t30. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't generated by this grammar because when combining the expansions, the counts don't add up, or there's a mismatch in the terminals generated. But maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string to see if it can be built using the given productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe first symbol is t217. Looking at which NT can produce t217 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules: t217 is produced by NT217 \u2192 t467. But t467 is another terminal produced by NT467, which isn't present as a terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nNT217 is not a terminal; it has a production to NT368 NT591, both non-terminals. NT368 \u2192 't237' and NT591 \u2192 't466'. So NT368 is terminal t237, and NT591 is terminal t466. Thus, NT217 expands to t237 t466.\n\nBut wait, t217 is itself a non-terminal because it's not on the right-hand side of any production as a terminal. Instead, it appears on the left-hand side of NT217's production. So, in the string, t217 would be produced by expanding some non-terminal that eventually reduces to t217. But looking at the productions, it seems that NT217 \u2192 NT368 NT591.\n\nSo, in the string, a 't217' must come from expanding something that leads to t217. However, in this grammar, NT217 only leads to 't237 t466', not directly to t217. So, to get 't217' as a symbol, there must be a non-terminal that produces 't217' directly, but I don't see any such production. The productions only show that NT217 produces 't237 t466', not 't217'.\n\nTherefore, the string has a 't217' which cannot be produced directly through any non-terminal in this grammar. So, this would likely mean that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's look through all the production rules to see if any NT directly produce 't217'. Scrolling through the rules:\n\nLooking for 't217' in the right-hand sides. Yes, I see NT409 \u2192 't555', but not 't217'. Also, NT573 \u2192 't573', which is a terminal, but that's 't573', not 217. Checking NT990 \u2192 't817'; NT278 \u2192 't278'; NT367 \u2192 't30'; NT892 \u2192 't892'; NT592 \u2192 't592'; NT530 \u2192 't60'; etc.\n\nWait, is there any NT that leads directly to 't217'? Let me check again. The rules don't mention 't217' as a direct production, only as part of other non-terminals. So 't217' must be part of a larger expansion,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-385","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have rules that are either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the given grammar. Let me look through the production rules. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Then, NT9 and NT226, among others, have productions that split into two non-terminals. Some of the non-terminals produce terminals, like NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and so on. \n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long: `t817 t237 t131 t535 t30 t892 t278 t30 t555 t217 t689 t593 t892 t573 t892 t237 t467 t892 t467 t467 t378 t573 t535 t14 t573 t689 t777 t466 t444 t689 t777`.\n\nI should break this down by checking each part of the string against the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production leads to non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals. So, I'll look for the sequence of terminals and see if each corresponds to valid right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nStarting with the first symbol in the string, 't817'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT990 \u2192 t817. But I need to trace back how NT990 is derived. Let's see, NT990 \u2192 NT85 NT347. So, NT85 must produce t817? Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I missed it. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, NT990 is defined as NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347, but actually, looking back, I think I might have miscalculated. NT990 \u2192 t817. So how does NT990 get to t817? It's a terminal, so the production is directly from NT990 \u2192 t817. So that's the first two symbols: 't817 t237 t131...'\n\nNext, 't237'. Looking at the rules, NT399 \u2192 t372, but that's not it. Wait, NT399 \u2192 NT368 NT399. Hmm, no. Let me check NT237: Is there an NT with t237? Yes, NT487 \u2192 t237? Wait, no, NT487 is split into NT103 and NT486, and one of those might produce t237. Wait, looking back, I see NT237 is under NT368: NT368 \u2192 t237. So NT368 \u2192 't237'. Also, NT368 \u2192 NT103 NT964. Wait, let me see more precisely.\n\nFrom the given rules, I see NT368 \u2192 t237 and also NT368 \u2192 NT103 NT964. So 't237' could be from NT368. But how do we get NT368 in the string?\n\nThe second symbol is 't237', so maybe it's the second production from NT993 or another non-terminal. Hmm, perhaps 't237' comes from NT368 \u2192 t237.\n\nWait, let me consider that the entire string is a sequence of expansions from the start symbol S. So S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Then each of those non-terminals expands further.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487's production: It can go to NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Let me check if any of these have terminals. NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT389, and NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756. Hmm, but I'm looking for 't237' as the third symbol in the string.\n\nWait, wait, let's break down the string step by step.\n\n1. 't817' comes from NT990 \u2192 't817'. So S must expand to include NT990 somewhere. But S starts with NT487 and NT993. So how do we get NT990 into the derivation? I need to see if NT990 can be derived from NT487 or NT993.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486. NT486 is t363. So NT487's expansion leads to non-terminals, but 't817' can't directly come from NT487 because it leads to t363 eventually. Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, NT993's productions: From the given rules, I don't see NT993 having a direct terminal. Let me check: NT993 isn't listed as a production, so perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, looking back, the start is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So NT993's production must be something else. Let me check the rules again. Oh wait, the rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, but I don't see NT993 expanding further here. Did I miss it? Or is NT993 a non-terminal that only appears as a left-hand side?\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe NT993 is part of the production chain but doesn't have a right-hand side specified in the given rules. That would mean NT993 is a non-terminal without any expansion, which would be a problem because we need to derive terminals. So perhaps I missed a rule for NT993. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the rules, the rule for NT993 isn't explicitly present. So perhaps that's an issue. But maybe I miscounted the rules. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from S, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Then, in the rules, I see NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389, etc. There's no rule for NT993; that must be an oversight. Because in the given rules, the only non-terminals are those present on the left-hand sides, which are S, NT487, NT993, etc. But S's expansion includes NT993, but if NT993 isn't defined any further, then it can't derive into terminals. So that might be a problem. But wait, maybe NT993 does have a production. Let me scan all the rules.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT487, NT9, NT226, NT256, NT756, NT185, NT487, NT351, NT85, NT389, NT697, NT147, NT226, NT530, NT10, NT833, NT569, NT446, NT103, NT591, NT636, NT389, NT588, NT946, NT195, NT60, NT256, NT60, NT347, NT951, NT217, NT409, NT368, NT399, NT367, NT673, NT217, NT951, etc.\n\nI see 'S \u2192 NT487 NT993' but no rule for NT993. Therefore, NT993 is a non-terminal without any production, which would mean it can't derive any strings of terminals. So S can't derive any terminal string because one of its expansions is NT993, which can't produce terminals. But the given string has many terminals, so that suggests something is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the rules. Let me check again. Oh, maybe I miscounted. The rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and that's it. So NT993 is a non-terminal without any production, which is a problem because then S can't expand into anything except NT487 and NT993, neither of which can produce terminals since NT993 can't derive anything. But that's impossible since S is supposed to produce the given string.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a typo in the question, or I misread the rules. Let me look again. Oh, no: the rules include S \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-391","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help me parse the string correctly.\n\nThe given grammar starts with the start symbol S. Looking at the first production, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string must start with NT487 and NT993. Wait, but the string I'm given is a series of tokens starting with t237, t237, etc. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I need to see if each of these ts correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NT symbols produce terminals. For example, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and also NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. But I also see that NT486 becomes 't363', NT389 becomes 't689', so those are terminals. But in the string, I have 't237' repeated. Wait, does the grammar produce 't237'? Let me check if any NT symbols produce 't237'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT368 \u2192 't237'. So, the production for NT368 is t237. Now, where is NT368 defined? Looking back, I see NT368 \u2192 NT673 NT964, and NT673 is 't848' and NT964 is 't640'. So, NT368 \u2192 t848 t640. That means that the string cannot directly have t237 unless it's part of a larger NT symbol.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I have 't237 t237 ...' which suggests that 't237' appears multiple times. But looking at the grammar, 't237' comes from NT368. So, unless I have a way to get two t237s in a row, that might not be possible. Alternatively, let me see if any production can produce two t237s.\n\nLooking at NT368's production: it only produces t848 t640, so that's two terminals. So, from NT368, I get a single unit of two terminals. So, if the string has multiple t237s, maybe each t237 is from a different NT production. Wait, but NT368 can only produce t848 t640. So, maybe I need to go deeper in the parse tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me approach this methodically. First, I'll parse the string into tokens: the string is \"t237 t237 t535 t378 t640 t637 t848 t637 t444 t573 t131 t592 t848 t30 t30 t637 t640 t777 t637 t817 t892 t777 t689 t217 t555 t637 t37 t592 t777 t131 t14 t98\". So, let's list these tokens: t237, t237, t535, t378, t640, t637, t848, t637, t444, t573, t131, t592, t848, t30, t30, t637, t640, t777, t637, t817, t892, t777, t689, t217, t555, t637, t37, t592, t777, t131, t14, t98.\n\nNow, starting from the start symbol S, which produces NT487 NT993. So, the entire string must be generated by S. Let's see if each of these tokens can be matched to the productions.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t237, which is a terminal. Let me look for where 't237' is produced. It's produced by NT368. So, in the parse tree, we would have NT368 \u2192 t237 t637, because looking at the grammar, NT368's production is either NT673 NT964 or 't848 t640'. Wait, no, the NT368 production is actually NT673 NT964, but NT673 is 't848' and NT964 is 't640'. So, NT368 only produces 't848 t640', not t237. So, how can the string have 't237'? Because 't237' is a terminal, it must come directly from an NT production that's defined as that terminal.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, I see that NT368 has a production NT673 NT964, which is 't848 t640', and another production? Wait, no, in the grammar, each line is a production for the NT symbol on the left. So, for example:\n\nNT368 -> NT673 NT964\nOr, is there another production for NT368? Wait, looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nAh, I see now: the grammar is written as a list of productions. For example:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each NT symbol has multiple productions. So, looking for 't237'\u2014I need to see if any NT production produces t237.\n\nLooking at all the lines, I see that NT368 is defined as:\n\nNT368 -> NT673 NT964\nBut also, there's a NT368 -> NT673 NT... wait, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nNT368 -> NT673 NT964\nNT368 is only defined once. So, the only way to get t237 is if some NT symbol's production includes t237. Let me check through all the NT symbols:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\nNT487 has two productions, one of which is to NT933 NT389. But NT486 and NT389 are terminals? Wait, checking NT486: is it a terminal or a non-terminal? Wait, in the grammar, only those NT symbols are followed by either more NT symbols or a terminal. For example, NT933 \u2192 NT217, and NT217 is further defined. But in other places, like NT486: is it a non-terminal or terminal? Looking at the production lines, for example, NT486 is used in ND873's production. For example:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT487's productions are NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389.\n- So, NT486 is part of a production, meaning it's a non-terminal. Similarly, NT389 is also a non-terminal, as it's part of another production.\n\nWait, but looking for terminals in the grammar:\n\nI see lines like:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT256 \u2192 't573'\n- NT85 \u2192 't185' (Wait, no, NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347, and NT185 \u2192 NT990... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the grammar's productions are such that each line is of the form NTxxx -> something.

Hmm. Let me start by understanding the structure of the problem. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string to check is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts as NT487 NT993. So the string must start with these two parts. Wait, the grammar says S \u2192 NT487 NT993, but looking at the string, the first token is t637, which is actually the production for NT60 \u2192 't637'. But S starts with NT487 and NT993, so I need to see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out the productions for each non-terminal to see how they expand. Let me go through each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n- NT993 \u2192 Not directly given? Wait, in the grammar, looking for NT993, I see it's in the productions. Wait no, NT993 is in the string but let me check. Looking through all productions, I see NT993 \u2192 't444', so NT993 is a terminal. So S \u2192 NT487 NT993 would mean that S must expand into NT487 followed by NT993, both of which are non-terminals except for NT993, which expands to t444.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT487 t444. So the string must start with NT487, and then t444. Looking at the string, the first token is t637. Wait, that's confusing because NT487 isn't a terminal. Let me check: NT487 has productions \u2192 NT103 NT486 or \u2192 NT933 NT389. So NT487 is a non-terminal and needs to be expanded into two parts. Therefore, the first token in the string should be part of the expansion of either NT487 or NT993.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t637. Looking at the productions, t637 is the result of NT60 \u2192 t637. How does that tie in? Wait, maybe I should look for how the string can be split into the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work backwards. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each part of the string must correspond to the leaves of the parse tree. So each terminal token in the string corresponds to a production that directly produces a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt637 t593 t14 t14 t372 t217 t444 t535 t466 t573 t237 t640 t892 t14 t278 t363 t444 t378 t640 t372 t467 t817 t892 t444 t372 t555 t640 t640 t573 t30 t14\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let me see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, mapping each terminal to its non-terminal:\n\n- t637: NT60 \u2192 t637\n- t593: Looking through the list, no. Wait, NT399 produces t372. Wait, wait. Let me make a list:\n\nLooking through all the productions that end with terminals:\n\n- NT588 \u2192 t37\n- NT399 \u2192 t372\n- NT946 \u2192 t131\n- NT195 \u2192 t278\n- NT60 \u2192 t637\n- NT256 \u2192 t98\n- NT951 \u2192 t466\n- NT217 \u2192 t467\n- NT409 \u2192 t555\n- NT368 \u2192 t237\n- NT399 \u2192 t372\n- NT673 \u2192 t848\n- NT217 \u2192 t592? Wait, check all:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note which non-terminals produce each terminal. Let me list each terminal:\n\nt637: NT60 \u2192 t637\n\nt593: Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t593. Wait, maybe I missed it. NT256 \u2192 t98, NT347 \u2192 t593? Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nYes, NT347 \u2192 't593'\n\nSo t593 comes from NT347.\n\nt14: Which non-terminal? Looking through the productions, NT151 produces t14. Wait, no. Wait, looking for t14 in the productions. I see NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833, which are non-terminals. Wait, maybe it's in NT226 or others. Wait, looking through all productions:\n\nWait, none directly produce t14 except perhaps in the expansion of another NT. Alternatively, maybe it's produced by an NT that I haven't considered. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's check:\n\nIn the given grammar, which non-terminals produce 't14':\n\nLooking through all productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 't14'. Hmm. So that's a problem because the string has t14, but none of the NTs directly produce it. So perhaps t14 is from NT226? Wait, NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569. Neither are t14. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me check each production again. Maybe it's NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217, which leads to other expansions, but does that produce t14? Let me see: NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, which then produce t804 and other things, but I don't see a t14. Alternatively, maybe it's NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591, which again, no t14. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong, maybe t14 is produced by NT14. Wait, in the grammar provided, is there a production for NT14 that produces t14? Wait, I don't see any NT with a terminal of t14. Hmm, this could be a problem because the string contains t14, but based on the given grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t14.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar since the grammar lacks a production for t14. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me go through the productions again to check if any NT produces t14. Let me list all the productions again:\n\nLooking through each production, none of the NTs directly produce t14. Therefore, any string containing 't14' as a terminal cannot be generated by this grammar, unless it's derived through an NT that can expand to 't14', which it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the given string contains 't14', which is not a terminal production in the grammar.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because I can parse the string using a recursive descent approach or a CYK algorithm, but maybe a simpler way is to use the fact that each production rule is a binary split, so each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t372 t131 t14 t555 t892 t892 t131 t363 t363 t363 t817 t14 t592 t237 t555 t817 t444 t237 t592 t30 t848 t637 t637 t593 t278 t637 t593 t131 t637 t217 t892 t131 t467`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with terminals, so I'll have to trace back the non-terminals that could derive to these terminals.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT951 -> t466, but in the string, I have t592. So t592 must come from somewhere. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT951 -> t466, but where does t592 come from?

Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me list all relevant rules:\n\nNT367 -> t30\n\nNT237 -> ... Hmm, let me search for 't592'. Looking through all production rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces t592. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at the rules, it seems that NT237 is a non-terminal that can be split into two parts, but in the rules, I don't see a production for NT237 that leads to 't592'. Similarly, I'm seeing that t592 isn't directly produced by any rule, but perhaps it's part of another chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Hmm, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT368 -> t237\n\nNT256 -> t98\n\nBut I don't see any rule that directly produces t592. Wait, maybe t592 is produced by a non-terminal that I'm not seeing.

Similarly, NT588 has two rules: NT588 -> 't37' and NT588 -> 't535'. This means that whenever we have NT60 or NT588, there's a choice in the grammar. We'll have to consider both possibilities when parsing.\n\nHowever, given that the string must match exactly, we can only use one of these options at a time, so the decision tree can become complex.\n\nNow, back to the string: looking for the first token, which is 't372'. That's from NT399.\n\nSo the first production would be NT399 -> t372.

So NT103 must produce t673 followed by NT964's derivation.\n\nWait, but in our string, after t372 comes t131, then t14. Wait, that doesn't align with NT103's production.\n\nWait, this suggests that maybe the string can't be generated because after t372, the next part would be the split of NT399 into NT103 and NT486.

The string starts with 't848'. Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT640 -> 't573'? Wait, no, NT640 isn't listed. Wait, maybe I should list all the NT productions that end in 't' terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT486 -> 't363'\n- NT894 -> 't892'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT673 -> 't848' (Wait, no, NT672 -> 't848'? Wait, NT673 is present as NT673 -> 't848'. So NT673 produces 't848'.\n\nSo 't848' must come from NT673. Let me note that: in the string, the first token is 't848', which corresponds to NT673.\n\nNow, looking at where NT673 appears in the grammar. I don't see NT673 directly. Wait, the productions are:\n\nLet me scan the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT673: I see NT636 -> 't777', NT487 appears multiple times. Wait, I don't see NT673 explicitly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nAh, wait, the initial productions: S->NT487 NT993. Then NT487 has two productions: NT487 -> NT103 NT486 and NT487 -> NT933 NT389. Also, NT673 is a terminal in another production: NT673 -> 't848'. Wait, is NT673 a non-terminal or a terminal? No, in this case, NT673 is a non-terminal that can be expanded, but has a production to a terminal 't848'.\n\nWait, checking the productions: yes, I see NT673 -> 't848'. So, NT673 produces 't848'. So in the string, when we have 't848', it must be derived from NT673.\n\nNow, how does NT673 get expanded? Looking through all rules, I don't see NT673 on the left side of any production except as a terminal. That means NT673 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Wait, no, that can't be because in the first rule, S->NT487 NT993. So S is a non-terminal, and NT487 NT993 must be non-terminals. So I must have misinterpreted NT673. Wait, no, NT673 is a non-terminal only if it appears on the left side of some production. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking through all the productions, does any have NT673 as the left-hand side? Looking through each line:\n\n- S -> NT487 NT993\n\nThen NT9:\n- NT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nNT487:\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nNT226:\n- NT226 -> NT85 NT530\n\nAnd so on. I don't see NT673 on the left side of any production. Therefore, NT673 is a terminal. That makes sense because it's only appearing as a terminal in the production NT673 -> 't848'.\n\nSo, the first 't848' comes from NT673, which is a terminal. So in the parse tree, the first symbol is NT673, which expands to 't848'.\n\nNow, looking at NT673, it's only a terminal, so it can't have any further children in the parse tree. That means that in the string, the next symbols after 't848' must be the next symbols from the immediate left-hand side of the production that includes NT673. But in this grammar, NT673 isn't on the left of any production except itself. So what's on the left of NT673?\n\nWait, the left side of NT673 isn't present, so that means that the only place NT673 appears is as a terminal, meaning that it's a leaf node in the parse tree. Therefore, in the string, each occurrence of 't848' must be directly followed by the next production. But this is tricky because the overall start symbol S is producing two non-terminals, so the string should have a structure that mirrors the parse tree from S down to the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the overall structure. The start symbol is S, which splits into two non-terminals: NT487 and NT993. So the string should have a structure where these two non-terminals lead to the overall string, and the terminals in between come from their respective expansions.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see a lot of 't's followed by numbers. I need to see if the entire string can be derived from S -> NT487 NT993.\n\nLet me outline the steps. The entire string starts with 't848', which, according to the production NT673 -> 't848', so 't848' is the result of NT673. But NT673 isn't a non-terminal, so in the parse tree, NT673 is a leaf, producing just that terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the parse tree, S produces NT487 and NT993. So the initial symbols are NT487 and NT993. Each of those could be expanded into other non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't848'. So let's see what produces 't848'. As per the grammar, NT673 -> 't848'. So the expansion for that part must be NT673.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the only place NT673 appears is as a terminal, meaning that it must be a child of the production that includes it on the left. Since it's not present on the left of any production (except itself, which is not allowed), that suggests that NT673 is a terminal symbol, and thus can only appear in the string as a terminal. Therefore, in the string, every occurrence of 't848' must be derived directly from NT673.\n\nWait, but that's not possible in the grammar unless NT673 is a non-terminal that can only produce 't848' on the left of a production where it's the only child. But in this case, the grammar doesn't have NT673 on the left of any production except as a terminal, which isn't allowed. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the entire string must be built by expanding S into two parts, left and right. So the overall string will have two branches: one from NT487 and one from NT993. Each of these branches produces a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, which then expand further.\n\nSo the string I have is a sequence of 27 tokens, starting with 't848' and ending with 't467'. Wait, the last token is 't467', which isn't in the provided terminals. Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed that.\n\nWait, the string is: `t848 t804 t217 t30 t98 t592 t217 t466 t444 t892 t804 t817 t37 t30 t278 t689 t98 t637"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-411","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's part of the language it generates. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which is structured with productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the two-terminals where the string ends. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces: \"t573\", \"t555\", ... up to \"t467\", \"t804\", etc.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a bunch of NT productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols 'tX'. Each NT seems to split into two other NTs, which in turn may either split further or terminate when they reach a 'tX'. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, so each step in the derivation should produce two symbols.\n\nThe given string starts with \"t573\". Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals like NT60 produce 't637' and 't573'. Wait, NT60 \u2192 't637' | 't573'. So, 't573' must come from NT60. So the string starts with NT60 expanded to 't573'.\n\nNext, the string has \"t555\". Let me check what produces 't555'. Looking through the grammar, NT256 \u2192 't98' | 't573', and NT545 isn't present. Wait, actually, checking NT256: NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946, but none of those directly produce 't555'. Hmm, maybe another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I should look for something that directly produces 't555'. Looking through, I see NT588 \u2192 't37' and other options, but no direct 't555'. Alternatively, maybe the string isn't directly matching a terminal but is part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait a moment, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since each production in the grammar leads to terminals, perhaps the string is built by expanding the non-terminals step by step until all are replaced by terminals. The length of the string should be equal to the number of steps multiplied by the number of symbols per production.\n\nWait, the initial grammar has S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Each production in the grammar is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So S expands to two NTs. Each of those NTs will then expand, each time producing two more NTs, until we reach the leaves which are terminals.\n\nSo the string's length should be a power of two, because each expansion step doubles the number of symbols. But the given string has 43 tokens (count them: the string is 43 tokens separated by spaces). Wait, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 43 isn't a power of two, so maybe the string isn't compatible with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows for more flexibility, but Chomsky normal form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals. So the number of symbols should be a power of two because each expansion step doubles the number.\n\nLet me recount the string: \"t573 t555 t593 t535 t131 t535 t278 t98 t592 t217 t278 t592 t689 t555 t592 t131 t37 t689 t592 t777 t555 t593 t217 t444 t30 t372 t640 t467 t804 t237 t592 t30 t237 t14\". That's 39 tokens. Wait, wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count:\n\nt573 (1), t555 (2), t593 (3), t535 (4), t131 (5), t535 (6), t278 (7), t98 (8), t592 (9), t217 (10), t278 (11), t592 (12), t689 (13), t555 (14), t592 (15), t131 (16), t37 (17), t689 (18), t592 (19), t777 (20), t555 (21), t593 (22), t217 (23), t444 (24), t30 (25), t372 (26), t640 (27), t467 (28), t804 (29), t237 (30), t592 (31), t30 (32), t237 (33), t14 (34). Wait, that's 34 tokens. But that's not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 32 symbols would be after 5 expansions. But my count suggests it's shorter than that.\n\nWait, actually, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, each of those is a single step. Each NTx may expand further. So the initial expansion for S gives two NTs, then each of those could expand, but the number of symbols doubles each time. So S (level 0) \u2192 2 NTs (level 1). Each NT at level 1 expands to two NTs, so level 2 has 4 symbols. Each further expansion increases the count by a factor of 2. So total symbols after k expansions would be 2^(k+1).\n\nThe string has 34 symbols, which is neither 32 (2^5) nor 64 (2^6). So unless the grammar allows for some optimizations or non-terminals that produce a terminal in one step, this might be a problem. Wait, looking at the grammar, some NTs expand directly into a single terminal. For example, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, but NT486 \u2192 't363' and NT103 \u2192 't673' NT964, which themselves expand, but in the end, some NTs directly produce terminals. However, the expansions can vary in how many steps they take. So the total number of symbols generated could be anything, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of symbols is compatible with the grammar because each NT could have a different expansion depth. For example, NT487 might expand into several non-terminals before eventually producing terminals, while others might produce terminals sooner. So, the total number of symbols could vary, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The string is a series of terminals. Since the grammar is a context-free grammar, the string must be a correct leftmost or rightmost derivation. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal. Given that the grammar is in CNF, each step combines two non-terminals into one, so the parse tree would be a binary tree of height log2(n), but the number of symbols would be 34. Wait, 34 isn't a power of two, so maybe the grammar isn't being used in a standard way. Hmm, this might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals grows exponentially. However, when a non-terminal is a terminal, it doesn't contribute to further expansion. So the number of symbols can vary depending on which non-terminals produce which. So for example, S expands to two non-terminals, which could, on the next step, each expand to two, making four, and so on. But certain non-terminals could directly produce a terminal, so the number of symbols would decrease as their expansions are done.\n\nSo in the case where NTs lead directly to terminals, their expansion stops there. So perhaps the total number of symbols can be any number, not just powers of two. But wait, let me count again. The string has 34 symbols. That could be possible if some non-terminals are replaced by a terminal after a certain number of steps, but the total count doesn't have to be a power of two.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, except for the start symbol S, which initially leads to two NT487 symbols.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the given string: \n\n`t804 t98 t593 t14 t817 t848 t363 t593 t804 t535 t777 t466 t217 t593 t777 t237 t535 t378 t237 t466 t363 t535 t372 t637 t689 t131 t817 t37 t372 t817 t777 t444 t592 t444`.\n\nI notice that each symbol (like t804, t98, etc.) corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. My task is to parse the string into the structure defined by these rules.\n\nEach non-terminal (like S, NT487, NT9, etc.) expands into exactly two terminals or another non-terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the parsing should only yield two symbols per non-terminal.\n\nI'll start by checking the top-level application of the start symbol S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string should begin with the left-hand side (LHS) of S, which is NT487 and NT993. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t804, which matches the production NT487 \u2192 t804. So that's good.\n\nNext, what's NT993? In the grammar, I don't see a production for NT993 directly, but checking, wait, yes, NT993's production is in the string\u2014it's 't444'. So, the string starts correctly with NT487 \u2192 t804 and NT993 \u2192 t444.\n\nNow, after t804, the next token is t98. Looking for how S expands, after NT487 comes NT993. So, the next part should be the expansion of NT993. NT993 \u2192 t444. But the next token is t98. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of parse trees. Let me attempt to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with 't804', which is NT487. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\n2. Now, after NT487 (t804), we have to expand NT993. Looking at the grammar, NT993 isn't a non-terminal; the non-terminals end at letters like NT. So, NT993 must be a terminal. Wait, that can't be right because in the grammar, all non-terminals produce either two terminals or another non-terminal. So, perhaps I misread the grammar. NT993 might be an error, but actually, maybe it's a symbol like NT...993, but in the production, it's written as NT993 \u2192 t444. So, yes, NT993 is a terminal.\n\nSo, S \u2192 t804 (NT487) and NT993 \u2192 t444.\n\nNow, the next token after t804 is t98. But according to S's production, the first part is NT487 (t804), and the second part is NT993 (t444). But the next token after t804 is t98, which isn't t444. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I misassign something?\n\nWait, maybe I should look again at the grammar. The S rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the expansion is two parts: the left side is NT487, which is t804, and the right side is NT993, which is t444. So, the initial part of the string should be t804 t444. But the given string is t804 t98 t593 t14..., so after t804, the next token is t98, which doesn't match t444. That suggests that perhaps the string is not generated by S starting with NT487 NT993.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me double-check. The start symbol is S, and S produces NT487 NT993. So, the starting sequence must be t804 (NT487) followed by t444 (NT993). But the string starts with t804 followed by t98, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the NT993 production. Let me check again:\n\nIn the grammar, NT993 is a terminal and produces t444. So, NT993 \u2192 t444. Therefore, S \u2192 t804 t444. But the string starts with t804 t98, so that's a mismatch. That would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar, which would answer with 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way. Perhaps the grammar allows S to produce another form, but in this case, the only production for S is NT487 NT993, which are terminals t804 and t444, respectively.\n\nSo the first two symbols of the string must be t804 and t444. But the given string has t804 followed by t98. That's a discrepancy.

{"custom_id":"request-426","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string to check against it. I need to figure out if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.\n\nFirst, what's Chomsky normal form? I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the grammar and makes it easier to perform certain analyses, like converting it to a pushdown automaton or using specific parsing techniques.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each production seems to only have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which fits the definition of CNF. So, that's a good start.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t817 t98 t98 t689 t378 t98 t363 t637 t804 t777 t637 t892 t777 t573 t98 t30 t640 t37 t637 t131 t817 t640 t848 t640 t777 t444 t466 t466 t363 t777 t278 t466 t555 t378 t444`\n\nThis string is a sequence of symbols, all of which look like terminals since they start with 't'. So, the grammar must generate this sequence by expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nThe first thing I should do is see what the start symbol is. From the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT487 NT993. So, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. This means the string under S must start with one of the symbols derived from NT487, followed by one from NT993.\n\nLet me break down the string into two parts based on S's production:\n\nThe string is split into two parts:\n\n1. `t817 t98 t98 t689 t378 t98 t363 t637 t804` (this should come from NT487)\n2. `t777 t637 t892 t777 t573 t98 t30 t640 t37 t637 t131 t817 t640 t848 t640 t777 t444 t466 t466 t363 t777 t278 t466 t555 t378 t444` (this should come from NT993)\n\nSo, I need to check if each part corresponds to the derivations of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet's start with NT487. The production rules for NT487 can be found in the grammar. Looking through them, NT487 can be either:\n\n- NT103 NT486\n- NT933 NT389\n\nAdditionally, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce the terminals. For example, NT486 \u2192 't363', and others like NT103, NT933, NT389 each have their own productions.\n\nSo, to get t817 as the first symbol in NT487's part, I need to see if NT487 can produce t817. Looking at NT487's rules, the first production is NT103 NT486. So, if NT487 can derive into that, let's track the expansion.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol under NT487 is t817. Hmm, looking at the possible productions of NT487, the direct terminals are from its own rules. Wait, in the grammar, NT487 can only produce NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. There's no production for NT487 directly generating a terminal; it only takes two non-terminals each time. So, how can the first symbol be t817?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. NT487 is a non-terminal that must expand into two non-terminals, which then further expand into terminals or other non-terminals. But the first symbol in the string is t817, which is a terminal. So, starting from S \u2192 NT487 NT993, the first expansions would result in t... but how?\n\nNo, wait. The entire string is the result of expanding S, so perhaps each NT487 and NT993 in the initial S expansion must themselves derive into sequences of terminals.\n\nSo, let's handle each part separately.\n\nFirst part: NT487 deriving into `t817 t98 t98 t689 t378 t98 t363 t637 t804`\n\nBut looking at NT487's productions, it's NT103 NT486. Let's see what NT103 produces.\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, and NT673 \u2192 't848', and NT964 \u2192 't640'. So, NT103 can produce t848 t640.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t817. That's not possible unless NT487 can somehow produce it directly, but looking at the rules, NT487 doesn't directly produce any terminals because its rules produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the first symbol in the first part is t817, but NT487's rule doesn't allow it to produce a terminal directly. So, if NT487's first step is to produce NT103 NT486, then NT103 must produce something. Let's see:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\n\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\n\nSo, the expansion of NT103 is t848 t640. Then NT486 could be another non-terminal. Wait, in NT486's rules, it's 't363'.\n\nWait, so let me look at NT486.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT486 \u2192 't363'.\n\nSo, putting it together, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 \u2192 (t848 t640) (t363) \u2192 t848 t640 t363.\n\nBut the first part of the string under NT487 is supposed to start with t817, which isn't the case if NT487 starts with t848. So, this can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I misread NT487's rules. Let me look again.\n\nThe grammar says:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo, no production for NT487 that directly produces a terminal. So, if the string starts with t817 under NT487, it's impossible because NT487 can't directly produce t817.\n\nThis suggests that the entire string might not be possible because the first symbol comes from NT487, which can't generate a terminal at that point.\n\nBut wait, maybe NT487 can derive into something that includes a terminal at higher levels. So, maybe the initial expansion of NT487 is NT103 NT486, which then each expand into a sequence of symbols.\n\nLet me try to expand NT103 step by step.\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\n\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\n\nSo, NT103 \u2192 t848 t640\n\nThen NT486 \u2192 't363'\n\nSo, the expansion of NT487 is t848 t640 t363.\n\nBut the string under NT487 starts with t817, which is not among these symbols. So this seems incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in NT487's expansion because in the grammar, perhaps the first symbol is t817 as part of another expansion path.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The string is composed of two parts: one from NT487 and one from NT993. The first part starts with t817, which must come from NT487. However, looking at NT487's rules, it doesn't directly produce t817; it produces non-terminals that eventually produce t848, t640, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check if any of the NT486 or NT487 produce t817 in their expansions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is: t892 t817 t131 t372 t804 t372 t37 t378 t444 t378 t892 t278 t372 t30 t777 t467 t444 t848 t37 t98 t217 t37 t535 t237 t372 t640 t278 t444 t892 t573 t378 t817 t14 t848 t573. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which production is S -> NT487 NT993. \n\nEach non-terminal (like NT487, NT993, etc.) seems to have a production that breaks down into two more non-terminals or eventually into terminals (like 't804', 't777', etc.). The terminals here are the last occurrences before they appear as strings in the string we're testing.\n\nSo the approach is to see if the given string can be derived from the grammar using the provided production rules. Each step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), and ultimately, all non-terminals should be eliminated, leaving behind only terminal symbols.\n\nThe string is a single sequence of terminals separated by spaces, so I'll remove the spaces to make it easier to work with: t892 t817 t131 t372 t804 t372 t37 t378 t444 t378 t892 t278 t372 t30 t777 t467 t444 t848 t37 t98 t217 t37 t535 t237 t372 t640 t278 t444 t892 t573 t378 t817 t14 t848 t573.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level production: S -> NT487 NT993. So in any derivation starting with S, it must split into two non-terminals: NT487 and NT993. Each of these must then derive into sequences that eventually produce the string.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I need to see how each non-terminal like NT487 and NT993 are defined. Looking at NT487's production: NT487 can produce either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Similarly, NT993 has NT951 NT14. Wait, no, looking back, actually, NT993 is listed but I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar, it's S -> NT487 NT993. Then looking for NT487 and NT993 production rules. Let me find them.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT487 has two productions: NT487 -> NT103 NT486 and NT487 -> NT933 NT389. NT993's productions are not directly listed, but looking through, I see NT993 isn't directly a non-terminal but perhaps another notation. Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, looking through the list:\n\nWait, I see NT993 doesn't appear as a head in any production except perhaps it's S's production. Hmm, perhaps S is the only production with 2 non-terminals, so all others derive into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT487 NT993. Then looking for NT487 and NT993's production rules. I see NT487 has two rules, but NT993's rule isn't listed directly. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan through the productions again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT195 -> 't278', but NT993 isn't listed as a production head. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps NT993 is a non-terminal in the grammar. Let me check if NT993 appears anywhere else, maybe as part of another production.\n\nWait, S -> NT487 NT993. So NT993 must have a production rule, but maybe it's missing in the list provided? Or perhaps it's a typo. Wait, in the grammar, after S, the next lines are other NT rules, but I don't see NT993 as a head. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps NT993 is just 't993' or something else. But looking through, I see NT993 isn't present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.

Looking at the given grammar, it seems to consist of several non-terminals (like S, NT9, NT226, etc.) and terminals which are the 't' followed by numbers. Each production rule either breaks a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT487. So the string must start with whatever NT9 and NT487 produce. Checking the string, it starts with 't466 t593 t573...'. Let's see, NT9 produces NT60 and NT530, so to generate the first part, we'll need to see how NT60 and NT530 can produce the initial tokens.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' which is a terminal, so that's straightforward. The first token is 't466', but wait, NT60 produces 't637'. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is generated.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of tokens generated by the productions. Each non-terminal production contributes to the string, but in a way that might require expanding other non-terminals first.\n\nLet me list all the production rules and terminals for clarity. \n\nFor example:\n- S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n- NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\n- NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\n- NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\n- NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\n- NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n- NT487 (another entry) \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT226 has another rule: NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\n- NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n- NT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n- NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT591 \u2192 't848'\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n- NT588 \u2192 't37'\n- NT946 \u2192 't131'\n- NT195 \u2192 't278'\n- NT60 (appears twice) \u2192 't637' and 't573'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT347 \u2192 't593'\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' and also NT217 \u2192 NT467? Wait, looking again, yes, NT217 has two productions: NT217 \u2192 't467' and NT217 \u2192 NT467. So it can either produce a terminal or another non-terminal which might produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let me check NT217's rules. Oh, in the grammar, I see NT217 has two rules:\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\n\nSo that's crucial. NT217 can either be a terminal (t467) or produce another non-terminal NT467. Wait, but looking at the next rule for NT217, it also allows another production. But wait, in the grammar, it says:\n\nNT217 -> NT467\n\nWait no, actually, in the given grammar, I see NT217's rules are:\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\nWait, did I miss that? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar has:\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT368 -> 't237'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\nWait, actually, looking at NT217, I think the user may have made a mistake in input. Wait, no, looking correctly:\n\nThe user's grammar is:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\nNT147 -> NT367 NT591\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\nNT833 -> NT9 NT894\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\nNT446 -> NT636 NT226\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\nNT591 -> 't848'\nNT636 -> 't777'\nNT389 -> 't689'\nNT588 -> 't37'\nNT946 -> 't131'\nNT195 -> 't278'\nNT60 -> 't637'\nNT256 -> 't98'\nNT347 -> 't593'\nNT951 -> 't466'\nNT217 -> NT467\nNT217 -> 't467'\n...others.\n\nWait, no, in the initial user's grammar, I think I might have miscounted. Let me recheck the original grammar:\n\nThe user provided:\n\n- NT217 -> NT467\n- NT217 -> 't467'\n\nIs that correct? Because in the initial list, I see:\n\nHere are the production rules for NT217:\n\nNT217 \u2192 NT467\n\nWait, looking back, I think the user only provided a subset, but probably made a copy error. Hmm, actually, upon re-examining the initial user message, the grammar seems to have:\n\nNT217 -> NT467\nBut I'm not seeing another rule for NT217 as a terminal. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the user's grammar is a bit confusing, but let's proceed. So assuming that NT217 has two rules: one producing a terminal and another producing a non-terminal, then NT217 can be 't467' or a non-terminal.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't466 t593 t573 t372 t848 t378 t637 t217 t378 t892 t466 t37 t637 t804 t592 t30 t637 t640 t378 t592 t37 t777 t444 t593 t848 t363 t98 t817 t467 t817 t14 t278 t217 t777 t378 t573'.\n\nSo the first token is 't466'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't466'. Looking at the rules, NT951 \u2192 't466'. So to get 't466', the non-terminal must be NT951, which must come from somewhere.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-434","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several rules, and the string is a series of tokens like 't98', 't804', etc. My task is to determine whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar rules step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow this structure because all the rules either produce two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which is A \u2192 BC, and then there are rules like NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530, which is also A \u2192 BC, and some rules like NT60 \u2192 't637', which is A \u2192 a.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t98 t804 t555 t372 t131 t640 t555 t30 t363 t14 t37 t30 t217 t378 t535 t37 t467 t804 t592 t637 t573 t892 t278 t98 t640 t592 t573 t637 t237 t555 t444 t593 t804 t573 t237 t555`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of 36 tokens, all of which are either single letters followed by a number like 't98', 't804', etc., or some like 't278', 't367', 't555'. Each of these tokens corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. To check if the string is in the language, I need to see if I can derive it starting from S and expanding according to the grammar rules.\n\nSince this can get quite complex because the string is relatively long, I might consider looking for possible reductions or parts of the string that can be generated by certain rules. Alternatively, maybe I can reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: 't98', 't804', 't555', 't372', 't131', etc. I can check which rules correspond to these terminals.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So S is split into NT487 and NT993. Let's see what each of these NTs can produce.\n\nNT487 appears in the rules as:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSimilarly, NT993 is directly a terminal or can it? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT993 being used in any non-terminal rules. The last rule is NT993 \u2192 't444'. So NT993 can derive the terminal 't444'. That would mean in the string, if the last part is 't444', it must come from NT993.\n\nBut wait, looking at the last part of the string: ...t555 t444 t593 t804 t573 t237 t555. The very end is 't555 t444', which would mean that the current NT993 is 't444', so before that, there's 't555'. Let me check if NT993 is only 't444' or if there's another rule. From the grammar, NT993 only appears in one rule: NT993 \u2192 't444'. So that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps the string ends with 't444', which comes from NT993. Moving backward, the token before that is 't555'. So the token before 't555 t444' would come from NT555. Wait, looking at the rules, I need to find which non-terminals derive to these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree from the start symbol and see if the string can be obtained.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if each token in the string can be generated by the grammar, and if the overall structure matches.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. Each terminal is part of a production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So any production that is a terminal must be at the lowest level of derivation.\n\nSo perhaps the string is a series of terminals generated by terminal productions, but given that the grammar has multiple non-terminals, it's possible that some non-terminals derive to multiple terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is a linear sequence. To generate such a sequence, the grammar must allow for the simultaneous expansion of multiple non-terminals in a way that the order matches. So it's about the order of the derived symbols as per the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production is used once, so the string length would be 2^n -1 for n productions, but this is unlikely because the string here has 36 tokens, and the grammar has several non-terminals. For example, each non-terminal that can derive two non-terminals would multiply the number of symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation, but without knowing exactly, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to each production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long, and I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe I can see some patterns in the tokens or possible production chains.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt98 t804 t555 t372 t131 t640 t555 t30 t363 t14 t37 t30 t217 t378 t535 t37 t467 t804 t592 t637 t573 t892 t278 t98 t640 t592 t573 t637 t237 t555 t444 t593 t804 t573 t237 t555\n\nLet me try to segment this into possible groupings from the grammar.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\nFirst, 't98'. The rule for NT98 is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 't637' and NT98 \u2192 't98'?\n\nWait, wait. Let me look through the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking for 't98' as a terminal, I see that NT60 \u2192 't637', NT256 \u2192 't98'. So NT256 can derive 't98'. So the first token 't98' must come from NT256.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nIf S is derived into NT256 (yielding 't98') and NT993, but wait, no, because S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT487 is one part, NT993 is the other.\n\nWait, maybe I need to track how each part evolves.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each non-terminal can derive a series of terminals. So for example, NT487 can derive a chain leading to 't98' or 't933' etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT487's rules:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nNT103's rules:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964 or NT569 NT756.\n\nAnd NT569 \u2192 't569'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see 't569' being directly derived as a terminal, except for NT588 \u2192 't37' and others. Wait, no, looking through the rules again, I only see NT588 \u2192 't37'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me recheck the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217, NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591, NT367 \u2192 NT30, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the terminals in the grammar. The grammar seems to have several rules where non-terminals are replaced by terminals:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT60 \u2192 't573'\n- NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, is 't592' even in the language?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT that can derive 't592'. That's a problem because the first token in the string is 't592', which must come from some NT in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go through each NT and see their possible productions.\n\nLooking for tokens in the string: 't592', 't848', 't467', etc.\n\nLet me check NT589, no. Wait, the NTs in the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT that have a production with 't592' in it. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT103 -> 't673'\n- NT487 -> 't363' or NTs that go on\n- NT389: 't378' and 't237'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing something. Maybe 't592' is the result of a long chain.\n\nWait, perhaps 't592' is generated by a path in the grammar. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the NT487 rule: NT487 can be NT933 NT389.\n\nNT933: production is NT256 NT946.\n\nLooking at NT256: NT446 NT946.\n\nWait, this seems complex. Maybe I should use a parsing approach, trying to match the string's tokens to the grammar.\n\nLet me start by attempting to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't592'. Is there any NT that can derive to 't592'? I don't see it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the possible terminal symbols in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- 't592' is in NT589's productions? Wait, the given grammar has:\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I have the following NTs:\n\nLooking for any NT that can derive to 't592'. From the given rules, I don't see any NT starting with 't592' or a production leading to it.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't592', and no NT can produce that, then the string can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I missed something. Maybe through multiple steps.\n\nFor example, is there any path where an NT can derive into 't592'?\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\n- NT588: 't37' (no)\n- NT446: not producing any terminals I think\n- NT569: 't195' and 't588'\n- NT946: 't131'\n- NT946: 't256' and '833' maybe\n- Wait, NT256 -> NT446 NT946, but that's non-terminals. NT446 may not produce anything.\n\nWait, maybe I can't reach 't592' from any starting point, which means the first token can't be generated, so the string is invalid.\n\nYes, I think that's the case.

{"custom_id":"request-444","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or a non-terminal followed by two non-terminals. This should make parsing manageable.\n\nLet me start by understanding the grammar structure. The top-level rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, any string generated by this grammar should start with the two symbols derived from NT487 and NT993. \n\nLooking at the rules, NT487 and NT993 are each made up of two NTs. For example, NT487 is NT103 NT486. So each of these non-terminals will further split into two more non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. According to the grammar rules, each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers are part of their own rules. For instance, NT487 can be broken down into either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389, which in turn might break down further, eventually leading to 't' symbols.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string step by step, using the grammar to see if it can be constructed.\n\nThe string is: \nt217 t378 t363 t535 t555 t278 t14 t14 t689 t573 t30 \nt777 t217 t466 t237 t37 t278 t237 t217 t804 t573 t278 \nt637 t363 t535 t37 t444 t640 t466 t892 t817 t535 t278 \nt804 t30 t804 t689.\n\nI notice that the string has 39 tokens. Let's see how they could be grouped into the grammar's two-step productions.\n\nStarting with S: NT487 NT993. Let's take the first part, t217. Looking at the grammar, NT487 has two options: either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Let's see what those derive into.\n\nLooking at NT933 \u2192 NT697 NT389, so NT933 can produce t697 and t389. Alternatively, NT487 could be NT103 NT486, leading to t103 and t486.\n\nIn the string, the tokens start with t217. Looking at NT217 \u2192 NT467 or NT592. But wait, NT217 also appears in other places, like in the production of NT367. I might need to check all possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by building the derivation tree. Starting from S, each step adds two non-terminals, which can either be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me try constructing a parse tree:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n   - NT487: possible options, let's see if it can derive t217 later.\n   - NT993: perhaps producing something else initially.\n\nBut looking at the start, the first token is t217. Let me see if t217 can come from NT487 or NT993.\n\nLooking at NTs:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467 or NT592. Both of these are non-terminals, so they don't directly produce 't217'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT217 appears in different rules. For example, NT367 \u2192 NT217 NT964. So, does NT217 produce a terminal? Let me look back.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't immediately see NT217 producing a 't' directly. Wait, check the rules again. Hmm, actually, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467 or NT592\n- Also, NT367 \u2192 NT217 NT964\n\nSo NT217 doesn't have a terminal production. Then, how to get 't217' in the string. It must come from a deeper non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check all the rules again. Scanning through, I don't see any NT with 217 followed by a terminal, like NT217 \u2192 't217'. So perhaps NT217 is derived from something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules. Let me look again: \n\nLooking at the rule NT217 \u2192 NT467 | NT592. So, it's NT217 can split into NT467 and NT592. Neither of these are terminals. But in the string, we have t217. So, unless there's a way for NT217 to produce 't217', which seems not to be the case, that t217 might not be valid.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the production for NT217 again. Scanning through, I do see a rule:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467, NT592\n\nBut also, NT217 appears in another rule: NT367 \u2192 NT217 NT964. No, that's a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the production for NT217 in the first rule is as follows:\n\nWait, looking back, the rules are:\n\nNT367 \u2192 NT217 NT964.\n\nNo, that's NT367. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I missed an NT217 production.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again, I don't see any NT217 with a terminal production. So, how can the string start with t217? Unless it's a typo, but the string provided does start with t217.\n\nWait, maybe I got the NT217 production wrong. Looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT367 \u2192 NT217 NT964\n\nNo, so NT217 doesn't have a terminal production. Therefore, the string starts with t217, which is a terminal, but according to the grammar, the non-terminal NT217 can't directly produce t217. So, perhaps there's a way NT217 can ultimately produce t217 through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, let me think: if NT217 can produce NT467 or NT592, and if those can produce further non-terminals, perhaps one of those leads to a 't217'.\n\nLooking at NT467: Does it have a rule that includes 't217'? Let's see the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT467 with a terminal, but:\n\nWait, looking through:\n\n- NT466 \u2192 't640' (Wait no: looking back, the rules are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe relevant rules are:\n\nLooking for NT4xx:\n\n- NT363 \u2192 NT535 NT37\n- NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n- NT486 \u2192 't363'\n- NT569 \u2192 't378'\n- NT588 \u2192 't535'\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n- NT946 \u2192 't131'\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT591 \u2192 't278'\n- NT217 \u2192 't278'?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly one non-terminal on the right. But wait, no, Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So each production starts with S and uses two NTs. Then each NT has productions that either break down into more NTs or constants like 't555', etc. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Each token starts with 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the structure, each token might correspond to a terminal in the grammar, so let's list all the terminals:\n\n- t555\n- t689\n- t37\n- t848\n- t592\n- t892\n- t592\n- t777\n- t637\n- t467\n- t817\n- t637\n- t37\n- t804\n- t131\n- t535\n- t804\n- t14\n- t131\n- t817\n- t98\n- t372\n- t535\n- t817\n- t535\n- t593\n- t466\n- t573\n- t278\n- t444\n- t592\n- t217\n- t30\n\nNow, I'll try to map these terminals to the grammar. Each terminal must be the result of a production where the non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. Let's look for productions that result in these terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 -> NT60 NT530 (so this doesn't directly produce a terminal)\n- NT351 -> NT10 NT217: So NT351 can produce 't10' and 't217'? Wait, no, NT10's productions: NT10 -> NT147 NT951, which might produce more NTs, but wait, NT951 -> 't466'. Similarly, NT217 -> 't467'. So NT351 would produce 't' followed by results of NT10 and NT217. But NT10 is NT147 and NT951, which become 't466' and 't637'.\n\nWait, let me go step by step for each terminal.\n\nStarting with 't555' in the string: looking for a production that produces 't555'. Checking the grammar, I see NT60 -> 't637' and also NT60 has production NT60 -> 't573'. Wait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't555': Is there any NT that leads directly to 't555'? Let me check the productions:\n\n- NT530: NT530 -> NT60 NT446 (so NT530 produces t60 and t446, which are further non-terminals)\n- NT946: produces 't131'. So not relevant here.\n- NT951: produces 't466' and 't10' leads to 't466' via NT951? Wait, the production is NT951 -> 't466'. So NT951 can produce 't466'.\n- Looking for 't555', maybe NT530? Wait, no, NT530's production is NT60 NT446, but does NT60 or NT446 produce 't535'? Let me check NT60:\n\nNT60's productions: NT60 \u2192 't637' and also in another rule? Wait, the rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. I'm looking through all production rules for NT60:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT530 -> NT60 NT446\n- NT256 -> NT98 (but that's for the rule S \u2192 NT256)\nWait, perhaps NT256 can produce 't98', but in the string, we have 't592' which is not 't98'. So where does 't555' come from?\n\nWait, looking for 't555' in the terminals. Scanning all production rules, is there any NT that directly produces 't555'? I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't555'. So 't555' might not be present in the grammar at all. Wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT530 -> NT60 NT446 (so t60 and t446)\n- NT60 -> 't637' and NT256 -> 't98'\n\nWait, where is 't555' coming from? Is there any production for 't555'? Looking through all the NT production rules provided, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't555'. For example, T85 is produced by NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347, and NT185\u2192NT990 NT697, and so on. But none of these seem to directly produce 't555'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't555' is a result of a longer chain. Let me think.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't555'. Let me see where that could come from. So if any NT can produce 't555', but from the rules, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't555'. So perhaps the production isn't possible, which would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar, hence the answer is 'No'. But wait, let me not jump to conclusions.\n\nPerhaps there's a production chain that eventually leads to 't555'. Let me think of possible paths.\n\nWait, NT60 can produce 't637' and 't573', according to other rules. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT60 is sometimes part of larger productions, like NT530\u2192NT60 NT446, but do NT60 produce 't637' and 't573' as separate possibilities? Looking back at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' [so one production]\n- NT60 \u2192 't573' [is this correct? Wait, no. Let me check the rules again.]\n\nLooking at the NT60 rules: actually, in the given grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT256 \u2192 NT98\nBut earlier, NT60 appears as part of some productions. Let me check the entire grammar.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see NT60 appears multiple times but in different contexts. For example:\n\n- NT256 \u2192 NT98: That's when NT256 is used in the S rule: S \u2192 NT256 NT833.\n\nBut looking for NT60:\n\n- NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n- NT256 \u2192 NT98\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\n- NT636 \u2192 't777'\n- NT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\n\nWait, so NT60 is part of NT530, which is part of NT256, but that doesn't help with 't555'. Alternatively, is there an NT that can produce 't555' directly?\n\nLooking through all NT rules:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637' and 't573'? Wait, in the rules, NT256 \u2192 NT98, and also in the NT530 rule, NT530 breaks into NT60 and NT446. I think I'm missing a rule where NT60 can produce 't555'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think is a set of rules where each rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that the start symbol is S, and it's broken down into NT487 and NT993. So the first step in any derivation would be to produce these two NTs.\n\nEach NT has its own production rules, and some of them are terminals. For example, NT487 can produce 't363' or 't964', among others, and some have combinations like NT103 and NT486. \n\nSo the string is a sequence of these t's and numbers. To check if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if I can derive it step by step. Since it's a context-free grammar in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, and each expansion increases the length by one. So the string must have a length that matches the number of production steps.\n\nFirst, let me count the number of tokens in the string. I can split the string on spaces. Let me count them:\n\n1. t592\n2. t363\n3. t535\n4. t817\n5. t777\n6. t14\n7. t131\n8. t217\n9. t777\n10. t363\n11. t131\n12. t14\n13. t372\n14. t98\n15. t466\n16. t689\n17. t237\n18. t817\n19. t363\n20. t237\n21. t593\n22. t466\n23. t640\n24. t689\n25. t640\n26. t892\n27. t804\n28. t131\n29. t467\n30. t217\n31. t217\n32. t535\n33. t804\n34. t217\n35. t363\n36. t804\n37. t640\n38. t573\n\nThere are 38 tokens. The start symbol S is divided into two NTs, so the first step has two symbols. Each production step from an NT will split one symbol into two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time. To go from 2 symbols (after S->NT487 NT993) to 38 tokens, we need 36 production steps. Since 2 + 36 = 38, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to see if the terminal sequence can be matched by the grammar. Let's think about how this could work. Each NT in the grammar eventually produces terminals, but some NTs produce other NTs. We need to make sure that starting from S, all splits and expansions can lead to exactly the terminal string given, in order.\n\nLooking at the first token, t592. Checking the grammar, NT592 isn't present directly, but looking at the rules, I see NT697 -> NT351 NT409, and from there, NT351 -> NT10 NT217 and NT10->NT147 NT951, etc. Wait, but none of these rules produce t592 directly. Let me check all the rules for NT592 or any NT that can derive to t592.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule that produces t592. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through all the NTs and their productions to see if any of them result in t592.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT591 -> 't848'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n- NT964 -> 't640'\n- NT588 -> 't535'\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT990 -> 't817'\n- NT351 -> 't14', 't217'\n- NT147 -> 't367' (from 't673')\nWait, but NT351's rules are:\n\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217 or NT10 -> NT147 NT951, etc.\n\nBut looking through all the rules, none of the NTs produce t592. Hmm, that's a problem because the first token is t592.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the NTs and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT487 -> 't363', and 't103', 't486', 't933', etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see t592 in any of the rules. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nNT591 -> 't848'\nNT367 -> 't30'\nNT964 -> 't640'\nNT588 -> 't535'\nNT933 -> 't217'\nNT697 -> 't378'\nNT990 -> 't817'\nNT351 -> 't14', 't217'\nNT147 -> 't367' (from 't673')\nBut wait, NT367 is transformed into 't30'? Or is it another NT?\n\nWait, looking again, the rule for NT367 is: NT367 -> 't30' because in the rules, NT367's production is 't673'? Or is it that some NTs are transformed to produce other strings? Wait, in the given grammar, each rule is either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo for NT367, I see the rule:\n\nNT367 -> 't30'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rules are:\n\nNT636 -> 't777'\n\nNT389 -> 't689'\n\nNT951 -> 't466'\n\nNT217 -> 't467'\n\nNT409 -> 't555'\n\nNT368 -> 't237'\n\nNT399 -> 't372'\n\nNT673 -> 't848'\n\nNT409 -> 't555'\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong lines. Let me list all the NTs and their rules clearly.\n\nHere's a list of NT rules with terminals:\n\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\n\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\n\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\n\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\n\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\nNT591 -> 't848'\n\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\n\nNT147 -> NT367 NT591\n\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\n\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\n\nNT347 -> 't593'\n\nNT951 -> 't466'\n\nNT217 -> 't467'\n\nNT697 -> 't378'\n\nNT946 -> 't131'\n\nNT195 -> 't278'\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nNT256 -> 't98'\n\nNT60 -> 't573'\n\nNT347 -> 't593'\n\nNT951 -> 't14'\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the target string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and it's initially two non-terminals: NT487 and NT993. From there, each rule further breaks down into smaller non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols, which are the 't's and numbers in the string.\n\nLooking at the target string, it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My first thought is to parse this string to see how it can be generated step by step using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S -> NT487 NT993. So each production step doubles the number of symbols except when we hit terminal symbols. Let's break it down.\n\n1. S splits into NT487 and NT993.\n2. NT487 has two options:\n   a. NT103 NT486\n   b. NT933 NT389\n   Let's pick the first option, NT103 and NT486.\n3. However, looking further, NT103 is a terminal (t673) followed by NT486. So, the first part might be t673 t673, but wait, the grammar seems to have each production splitting into two, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps NT103 is followed by a production that results in a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT487 can produce NT103 NT486, which are both non-terminals. Then each of those can split further. Let me go step by step.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Another approach is to model the string as a sequence of nodes in a parse tree. Each node must correspond to a non-terminal, which then generates the terminals and possibly more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to simulate the parsing process using the Earley algorithm or another method. But I'm not too familiar with that. Alternatively, I can try to find if the string can be produced by the grammar by reconstructing the possible parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n`t37 t848 t131 t466 t378 t278 t372 t378 t217 t30 t363 t378 t466 t892 t817 t689 t30 t98 t555 t640 t217 t217 t848 t98 t37 t30 t689 t37 t848 t14 t777 t372 t237 t363 t363 t444 t98 t278 t777`\n\nLet me list them out as a sequence:\n\n1. t37\n2. t848\n3. t131\n4. t466\n5. t378\n6. t278\n7. t372\n8. t378\n9. t217\n10. t30\n11. t363\n12. t378\n13. t466\n14. t892\n15. t817\n16. t689\n17. t30\n18. t98\n19. t555\n20. t640\n21. t217\n22. t217\n23. t848\n24. t98\n25. t37\n26. t30\n27. t689\n28. t37\n29. t848\n30. t14\n31. t777\n32. t372\n33. t237\n34. t363\n35. t363\n36. t444\n37. t98\n38. t278\n39. t777\n\nThis is quite a long string, so perhaps I can look for the end of the string's components.

Wait, no, wait: looking at the grammar, NT588 is 't37'? Let me check.\n\nLooking: NT588 -> 't37'\n\nYes, so NT588 produces 't37'. Also, NT777 is 't372' according to the grammar. Wait, no, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\n\nAnd NT588 -> 't37'\n\nSo, NT588 is 't37'.\n\nBut the string ends with 't777', which is part of NT777, but wait NT777 isn't defined in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-464","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got to figure out if this string is generated by the given CFG. Let me see. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each rule has two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except the terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, productions are A \u2192 BC, where A and B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, every production indeed seems to be either two non-terminals on the left and a terminal or another non-terminal on the right. Wait, no, the productions are all of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> string of terminals? Or maybe sometimes a terminal and some non-terminals. I need to make sure.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993: so that's two non-terminals on the left, and two on the right. Then NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530: again, two non-terminals on each side. Hmm, but then looking at the others, like NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486: same, two non-terminals on each side. But then there are productions that look like NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389, which are both non-terminals. Wait, some rules in the grammar directly produce terminals, like NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, which are both non-terminals leading to more production steps, but others like NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389 are also non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out the productions and see. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals on the left and right. Wait, no, some are like NT10 \u2192 't147': so that's a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at it:\n\nLooking again, actually, no, the grammar has a mix of production rules. For example, NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, which is NT \u2192 NT NT, but then NT951 \u2192 't466'. So that's a terminal. Wait, no, the arrow in the grammar is \u2192, so it's S \u2192 NT487 NT993, meaning S becomes NT487 and NT993.\n\nBut in the grammar, some rules, like NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, which is two non-terminals on both sides. However, some other rules, like NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, are two non-terminals on left and two on right. But then NT951 is further producing a terminal: NT951 \u2192 't466'. Wait, no, the grammar is written as NT951 -> 't466', which means it's a terminal. So in that case, NT951 is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about what is a terminal and what is a non-terminal here. Let me clarify: in the grammar, NTs are non-terminals, and sometimes they expand into terminals. So in the given grammar, for example, NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389, which are both non-terminals. But in other cases, productions have terminals on the right. For example, NT103 \u2192 't673' is a production where a non-terminal on the left (NT103) produces a terminal 't673'.\n\nSo, each NT in the grammar can produce other NTs or terminals. Therefore, when building the string, each NT in the grammar may eventually produce a terminal string.\n\nNow, the given string is:\n\nt131 t640 t555 t14 t593 t217 t98 t14 t689 t689 t131 t217 t378 t640 t804 t30 t131 t363 t372 t237 t98 t30 t98 t555 t467 t372 t555 t217 t804 t573 t467 t98 t535 t131 t98 t363 t237 t30 t14.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the given CFG.\n\nGiven that in the grammar, each production is a binary split (two non-terminals), the way to compute this is similar to a bottom-up parsing or to see if the string can be split into the correct sequences.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree using memoization to check if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each consecutive pair of tokens in the given string corresponds to the non-terminals in the grammar. Wait, no, because the grammar produces combinations, so the tokens in the input string should correspond to a sequence of production steps.\n\nEach step in the grammar replaces an NT with two NTs or a terminal. Therefore, for the given string, the first token in the string would have to be the leftmost symbol in the derivation, and then each production would split from there.\n\nWait, but the first symbol in the string is 't131'. Looking at the grammar, are there any non-terminals that produce 't131'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT990 -> 't817' and NT367 -> 't30', etc. Wait, I'm looking for any NT that directly produces 't131'. Scanning through the list:\n\nLooking at each rule ending with a terminal:\n\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT588 \u2192 NT535\n- NT951 \u2192 NT351 NT409\n- NT990 \u2192 NT853 (wait, I don't see any NT that directly ends with 't131'.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nLet me check each entry to see if any production has a terminal as its only right-hand side, which would indicate a non-terminal producing a single token.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467 NT592\n- NT486 \u2192 NT637 \u2192 't363'\n- NT363 \u2192 't637'\n- NT894 \u2192 't892'\n- NT993 \u2192 't444'\n- NT894 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 ... no, 894 is a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, I don't see any non-terminals in the grammar that directly produce 't131'. Let me check each terminal in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n- 't131', 't30', 't14', 't467', 't237', 't372', 't555', 't573', 't98', 't673', 't848', 't640', 't555', 't467', 't30', etc.\n\nWait, 't131' is present. Let me see which NT rules produce 't131'. Hmm, looking through all the productions, none directly have 't131' as a production of an NT. So if the input string starts with 't131', then in the grammar, there's no NT that can directly produce 't131'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because the first token can't be derived.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Did I overlook a rule where 't131' is produced?\n\nLet me recount. From the provided grammar:\n\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588 \u2192 't378' and 't535'\n- NT195 \u2192 't278'\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT60 \u2192 't573'\n- NT347 \u2192 't593'\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' and 't592' (I see 't467' and 't592' are terminal, but 't467' is a terminal, perhaps)\n\nWait, so 't131' is also a terminal in the grammar. But looking through the productions, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't131'. Therefore, the first symbol in the string can't be generated by any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the productions. Let me make sure. For example, looking at NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-470","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production is S -> NT487 NT993. So, to derive the string, we'll start from S, replace S with NT487 and NT993, and then each of those can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: `t817 t278 t98 t555 t378 t278 t817 t593 t98 t217 t278 t535 t535 t378 t848 t573 t217 t37 t131 t378 t378 t535 t217 t593 t593 t467 t217 t217 t817 t817 t378 t37 t217 t237 t14 t848 t593 t689 t535 t592`.\n\nI notice that each part is separated by spaces, so the string has 43 tokens. Each token is either a non-terminal (like NT487, NT993, etc.) or a terminal like 't817', 't278', etc.\n\nLet me start building the parse tree. The first step is S -> NT487 NT993. So, the string must start with the production of NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487: From the grammar, NT487 can produce either:\n1. NT103 NT486 OR\n2. NT933 NT389\n\nAnd NT993: From the grammar, NT993 can produce 't444' as well as... Wait, checking the grammar again, I see NT993 -> 't444', but is there another production for NT993 beyond that? Let me check.\n\nNo, I see that NT993 only has one production: -> 't444'. So whatever path we take, the end part of the string must end with 't444'. Wait, but in the given string, the last token is 't592', which isn't 't444'. That's confusing. Did I make a mistake? Let me recheck.\n\nNo, wait, I think I misread. Let me check the grammar again for NT993. Hmm, no, it seems NT993 only has the production -> 't444'. So the last token should be 't444', but in our string, it's 't592'. That's a problem. So maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps I've missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string doesn't end with the longest production. Let me consider whether NT993 can produce anything else. Looking back, no\u2014it's only one terminal. So if the string's last token is anything else, like 't592', it can't be derived from NT993. That suggests that it's impossible, unless I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, in the grammar, let's check NT993 again. Yes, it's only -> 't444'. So the last part of the string must end with 't444', but it's ending with 't592', which is inconsistent. But wait, maybe it's possible through multiple steps.\n\nWait, no\u2014each production can only go one way. For example, NT993 only can produce 't444' directly. So any string with anything else after that can't come from NT993. Therefore, the string given doesn't end with 't444', which is a no-go.\n\nBut wait, let's check the given string again. The last token is 't592'. Hmm. Let me double-check the grammar to see if any NT can produce 't592'. Looking through the non-terminals, NT592 is not a terminal; I don't see any production for NT592. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let's check.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals and see what they produce. For example, NT85 -> NT185 NT347, which then might chain into more non-terminals until they reach terminals. But looking at the string, I see 't593' several times. So perhaps somewhere in the derivation, NT593 produces 't593'?\n\nWait, wait. Let me look at the NT entries:\n\nLooking for 't593', I see that NT593's production is: looking for NT593 in the grammar, but in the given rules, I don't see any where NT593 appears on the left-hand side of an arrow. Instead, perhaps it's linked through another production. Let me check.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I see that NT399 -> 't372' and NT993 -> 't444', but not NT593. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS: NT487 NT993\n\nNT487: NT103 NT486, NT933 NT389\n\nNT487 also can be NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\n\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\n\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\n\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486, NT933 NT389 (already noted)\n\nNT487 in the question was derived as:\n\nNT487 can become NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389.\n\nLooking deeper, each of these non-terminals have their own productions.\n\nFor example, NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n\nNT933 -> NT217 NT378\n\nSo, if you break it down, each non-terminal may have multiple paths.\n\nLet's try to parse the entire string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with 't817' and 't278' etc. But that's not any non-terminals. So perhaps the string starts with the terminal 't817', which suggests that the first non-terminal must produce it, but in our grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't817'?\n\nYes, looking through the rules:\n\nNT951 -> 't466'\n\nNT217 -> 't467'\n\nNT951 -> 't14'\n\nNT486 -> 't363'\n\nNT894 -> 't892'\n\nNT993 -> 't444'\n\nAlso, looking elsewhere:\n\nNT278 -> 't278'? Wait, no. Wait, the non-terminals each have their own rules. For example, NT951 can produce 't466', but where does 't817' come in?\n\nWait, looking for where 't817' is a terminal. Do any non-terminals produce 't817'?\n\nNot directly from NT, for example, NT673 -> 't848'\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which must expand into NT487 and NT993.\n\nBut in the string, the first tokens are 't817', 't278', etc. So perhaps the NT487 and NT993 non-terminals are being expanded into some sequences that produce these terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT993 only has 't444' as a production. So if the string is generated by the grammar, the end of the string must be 't444'. Since the string ends with 't592', which is not 't444', that suggests the answer is No. But wait, let me see\u2014perhaps the user made a typo, and the last token is 't444'?\n\nBut no, the user provided the string as it is: `t817 t278 t98 t555 t378 t278 t817 t593 t98 t217 t278 t535 t535 t378 t848 t573 t217 t37 t131 t378 t37"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-486","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Okay, first, let's understand the problem. The grammar consists of several non-terminal symbols that produce other symbols (terminals and other non-terminals). The string provided is a series of terminals connected by spaces, so each word in the string is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t14 t689 t466 t363 t14 t637 t637 t278 t14 t98 t278 t378 t131 t217 t378 t372 t804 t30 t444 t278 t777 t237 t535 t98 t98 t689 t14 t378 t848 t372 t37 t817 t640 t217 t640 t573 t14 t892 t640 t637 t444\".\n\nEach of these is a two-character string except 't804' and 't804' again. Wait, no, looking closer, some are three characters like t804. So, perhaps these are terminal symbols, each being a combination of letters and numbers.\n\nNow, the grammar is structured in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form X \u2192 YZ, where X, Y, Z are non-terminals, or X \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the rules directly produce two non-terminals, except some produce single terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar seems to have productions where on the right side, there are two non-terminals in most cases. For example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which would expand to NT487 producing two non-terminals, which themselves would need to produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nI think this is a binary tree structure where each production splits into two parts, and the leaves are the terminal symbols.\n\nBut looking more closely, some of the productions do produce a terminal and a non-terminal. For example:\n\nNT389 \u2192 't689' (terminal) and NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833.\n\nWait, so for the grammar, each rule is either a two-part split (like S \u2192 NT487 NT993) or a production that directly ends with a terminal, like NT389 \u2192 't689'.\n\nSo the parsing process would involve expanding each non-terminal into its components until only terminals remain.\n\nNow, the string provided is a concatenation of all the terminals, in order. So, if the grammar produces this sequence when starting from S, then it should match.\n\nThe approach I can take is to attempt to parse the string from the beginning, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nLet's start with the first symbol in the string: 't14'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals that directly produce 't14' are:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- S is the start symbol; S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nSo the string starts with 't14 t689 t466...' which corresponds to the first step of expanding S into NT487 NT993.\n\nNT487 is one of the non-terminals at the top, and its productions are:\n\nNT487 \u2192 't103' NT486\nNT487 \u2192 't933' NT389.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the rules for NT487 are:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389.\n\nSo NT487 can't produce 't14' directly. Instead, it's only two non-terminals. Therefore, 't14' is the result of NT487 producing through either its first or second production, but since 't14' is the first symbol, let's see if any non-terminal on the S side can directly produce 't14' directly. But S's first production is NT487 NT993, so perhaps the first symbol is the result of NT487 expanding into 't14' via a path.\n\nBut wait, in the first expansion step, S produces NT487 and NT993. So S is replaced by NT487 NT993. Then each of those non-terminals would then expand further until we reach terminals.\n\nSo to get the first symbol as 't14', let's see which non-terminals can derive 't14'. Looking through the non-terminals, I see NT20 terms have various productions, but perhaps NT10 is involved. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the production for NT217 \u2192 't467' and also NT217 \u2192 NT467? Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking at each non-terminal:\n\nLooking for which non-terminals have a production that directly includes 't14'. For example:\n\n- NT195 \u2192 't278'\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\n- NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368 and also maybe others?\nWait, maybe NT990 \u2192 NT367 NT697?\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their productions to find how they can produce 't14'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should map the string backward to see if it can be reduced by the given grammar, starting from the end.\n\nAnother approach: The string can be broken down as a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production in the grammar. The challenge is to determine the order in which non-terminals are expanded to produce this sequence.\n\nLet me think about the first few symbols: 't14 t689 t466...'\n\nSo the first two symbols are 't14' and 't689'. We need to see if, in the leftmost derivation, the non-terminals expand in such a way that their concatenation starts with these two symbols.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT487 NT993, the first two symbols must come from the expansions of NT487 and NT993. So, 't14' should come from NT487, and then 't689' from NT993. Or vice versa? No, because NTS comes from NT487 NT993, so the first part would come from NT487, expanding to 't14', and NT993 to 't689', and the rest follows.\n\nSo let's see if NT487 can produce 't14' directly. Looking at the rules for NT487, there is no production where NT487 goes directly to a terminal, only to two non-terminals. So NT487 must be expanded into its own parts. Therefore, 't14' cannot be the first terminal derived from NT487 unless it's part of a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-485","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by it. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which looks like each token is a terminal symbol. The grammar consists of non-terminals (NT) and terminals, where each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, following CNF.\n\nFirst, I notice that each production rule in the grammar has exactly two non-terminals on the right side except for the ones that directly produce terminals. So, all the NT symbols ultimately derive sequences of terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be formed by the start symbol S through these productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT487 and NT993. Looking at each of these, let's see what they produce.\n\nNT487 has two productions:\n1. NT103 \u2192 t673 t964\n2. NT933 \u2192 NT367 NT535 (since NT933's production is split into NT367 and NT535)\n\nWait, NT933's production is actually NT367 NT399, and NT399 is NT378. Hmm, maybe I need to parse this correctly.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Let me look up the grammar again. Oh, the grammar for NT933 is actually the production NT933 \u2192 NT367 NT399, but NT399 is another non-terminal that produces NT378. So NT933 \u2192 NT367 NT378.\n\nSimilarly, NT487 has two productions:\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nNT103 is a rule that outputs t673 t964, and NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT697. Let's see where NT569 and NT697 go.\n\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588, and NT195 is t278, NT588 is t37. So NT569 \u2192 t278 t37.\n\nNT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409. NT351 is NT10 NT217, which are t637 and t467 (since NT10 \u2192 t637 and NT217 \u2192 t467). NT409 \u2192 t555.\n\nSo putting that together, NT697 \u2192 t637 t467 t555. Wait, no, NT351 is NT10 NT217, which is t637 t467, and NT409 is t555. So NT697 \u2192 t637 t467 t555. But wait, NT697's rule in the grammar is NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217, which are terminals. So NT697 \u2192 NT351 t409? Or is NT351 NT409, so that's two NTs, but they both derive to terminals. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step.\n\nThe given string is: \n\nt444 t535 t535 t444 t689 t848 t278 t237 t573 t98 t892 t372 t689 t378 t278 t217 t535 t573 t30 t637 t30 t637 t535 t378 t466 t30 t98 t98 t689 t372 t593 t131 t30 t444 t892 t14 t804 t466 t466 t98 t555.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nLet me see what the start symbol S produces: NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet's first consider NT487 and NT993's productions.\n\nNT993 is not listed in the grammar as a non-terminal; wait, looking back at the grammar, the NT symbols are NT1 to NT993. So, NT487 and NT993 are the starting symbols.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so both must be expanded. So the derivation starts with NT487 and NT993.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t444, which suggests that one of these NTs (487 or 993) must derive to t444.\n\nLooking at NT487's productions:\n\n1. NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n   NT103 produces t673 t964.\n\n2. NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n   NT933 \u2192 NT367 NT378\n   NT367 \u2192 t637\n   NT378 \u2192 t555\n\nSo, NT487's expansion is either t673 t964 or t367 t555 (NT933 is t367 t409, but wait, no: NT933 \u2192 NT367 NT378. NT367 is t637, NT378 is t555, so NT933 \u2192 t637 t555.\n\nWait, NT367 is NT10 \u2192 t637 and NT217 \u2192 t467. So earlier I thought NT351 \u2192 t637 t467, but that's a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to make a clearer structure.\n\nLet me build a parsing tree for the given string using the grammar. Maybe it's easier to process the string in parts and see if each part matches the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t444.\n\nLooking through the grammar, which NT produces t444?\n\nLooking at all NT definitions, I see:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n- NT588 \u2192 t37\n- NT591 \u2192 't804'\nWait, no, NT591 does not produce t804; looking again, NT147 \u2192 t30, NT217 \u2192 t467, NT530 \u2192 t60, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the terminal symbols:\n\n- NT591 \u2192 t30\n- NT30 appears multiple times as either a terminal or part of another rule?\n\nWait, no. Let's look for any NT that directly produces t444. Scanning through the rules, I don't see any NT production that directly produces t444. Wait, that's a problem because the start symbols are NT487 and NT993.\n\nWait, but NT487's first production is NT103 \u2192 t673 t964, so t444 is not produced there.\n\nLooking back, does any NT directly produce t444? I went through all the terminal symbols, and the only NTs that produce terminals are:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\n- NT588 \u2192 t37\n- NT147 \u2192 t30\n- NT185 \u2192 t990 t697\n- NT217 \u2192 t467\n- NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\n- NT273 \u2192 NT530 NT60\n- NT309 \u2192 NT147 NT467\n- NT389 \u2192 t569 t756\n- NT444 \u2192 t444? Or is that an actual production?\n\nWait, looking at the initial grammar, do any of the NTs have a production that ends with t444? No, because the grammar seems to represent the productions as NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, etc., but looking for a rule that directly starts with t444. It doesn't seem so. So that suggests that none of the NTs directly produce t444.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again. Maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking back, I think I missed that NT487's first production ends with NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-494","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It seems that the non-terminals (those starting with 'NT') have productions that either split into two other non-terminals or eventually lead to terminal symbols, which are the lowercase letters with numbers, like 't378'. Each production in the grammar is of the form NT -> NT NT, which is typical for Chomsky Normal Form. The start symbol is 'S', which produces 'NT487 NT993'. So, the initial step is to generate a string starting with 'NT487 NT993', which should expand into the given string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t98 t378 t30 t217 t467 t848 t555 t278 t555 t689 t372 t592 t640 t372 t372 t30 t131 t37 t817 t237 t237 t378 t37 t237 t98 t363 t98 t573 t378 t98 t466 t467 t817 t848 t637 t30 t466 t14 t237 t467 t378 t640`.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string starting from the top symbol 'S' and see if it can be derived into the given string through a series of allowable productions.\n\n1. **Start production**: S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n   - The initial expansion is two parts: NT487 and NT993.\n\n2. **Expand NT487**:\n   Looking at the grammar, NT487 has two productions:\n   - NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n   - NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n   Additionally, from NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, and NT964 could lead to 't640', but wait, actually, looking closer, NT964 is a non-terminal, but in the production NT964 \u2192 't640' is possible. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, checking the production rules:\n- NT964 \u2192 't640' is correct.\n\nBut in NT487's production, it can go to NT103 NT486. Then, NT103 can go to NT673 NT964. Let me trace this out.\n\nExpanding NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486.\n\nNow, expand NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964.\n\nNT673 has a production \u2192 't848' directly? Wait, looking at the rules:\nWait, actually, from the given production rules, I see that NT673 \u2192 't848' is there. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, NT964 \u2192 't640' is present.\n\nSo, NT103 NT486 becomes t848 t640.\n\nNow, NT486 has a production \u2192 't363'. So, expanding NT486, we get t363.\n\nPutting it together, NT487 \u2192 t848 t640 t363.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Each production of NT is a split into two non-terminals, so each step doubles the count. Alternatively, when a NT is a terminal, it just uses that symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the string step by step.\n\nLet me list the grammar's non-terminals and their productions in a more organized way:\n\n- S \u2192 NT487 NT993 \u2192 (two parts: NT487 and NT993)\n- NT487 \u2192 either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389\n- NT993 \u2192 only production seems to be NT487 NT993, which is the same as S, so maybe it's another base case, but perhaps NT993 has a production to terminals? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT993 having a production except S. So maybe NT993 leads to S via its own rule, but that would go into a loop unless there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT993: is there any production for NT993? I don't see one; its only production is S. So perhaps I was wrong. Maybe I need to look for other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps NT993 has a direct production to terminals? Wait, perhaps I missed it. Alternatively, maybe the initial S leads to NT487 NT993, and then each of those can expand. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the grammar is structured. Let me list all the NTs and their productions:\n\nNT487:\n- NT103 NT486\n- NT933 NT389\n\nNT486:\n- 't363'\n\nNT103:\n- NT673 NT964\n\nNT964:\n- 't640'\n\nNT933:\n- NT217 NT697\n\nNT697:\n- NT351 NT409\n\nNT351:\n- NT10 NT217\n\nNT10:\n- NT147 NT951\n\nNT951:\n- 't466'\n\nNT147:\n- NT367 NT591\n\nNT591:\n- 't848'\n\nNT367:\n- 't848'\n\nSo, following the chain for NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 \u2192 NT673 NT964 NT363 \u2192 since NT673 \u2192 't848', NT964 \u2192 't640', and NT363 \u2192 't363'. So the substring becomes t848 t640 t363.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at NT993. Wait, the rule for S is S\u2192NT487 NT993. So the second part is NT993, which in the grammar, looking at the given rules, doesn't seem to have a direct production. It only appears in S's production. Therefore, perhaps NT993 doesn't split into anything else but stays as is? That doesn't make sense because then S would just output NT993, which isn't a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps NT993 has another production. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT993 having any production other than S. So perhaps that was a mistake.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I misread and NT993 does have a production. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list, do I see any NT ending with 993? Only S does. So perhaps NT993 is the same as S's other component, but since NT993 can't split into anything else, this would mean that S produces NT487 followed by NT993, which can't be further expanded, implying that S would only produce a string that starts with NT487 NT993, which would never result in all terminals, making the string unparseable unless NT993 somehow leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, but this doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Alternatively, perhaps NT993 is another terminal. Wait, looking at the given grammar, I don't see NT993 having a production that splits into terminals, but S uses it. So perhaps I was wrong to think that NT993 can't split, but maybe I missed a production. Alternatively, perhaps NT993 is part of another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the grammar properly.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that most of them are non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t37 t573 t466 t278 t278 t573 t573 t278 t593 t573 t689 t555 t640 t237 t467 t466 t467 t378 t640 t30 t98 t98 t278 t804 t372 t637 t535 t466 t30 t777 t804 t372 t593 t535 t37 t363 t444 t535 t278 t689 t98 t573.\n\nEach token in the string must correspond to a terminal in one of the production rules. So, I'll list out all the terminal tokens to see which non-terminals they can come from. Let's go through each token:\n\nt37 \u2192 Possible from NT60 (as per the grammar, NT60 \u2192 't637'? Wait, no, let me check. Looking back, NT60 appears in several places. For example, NT60 \u2192 't637' is a rule. So, 't637' is NT60, and 't37' is another rule. Wait, let me double-check. Oh, no, in the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 't637' is one rule, and another rule for NT60 is NT60 \u2192 't573'? Wait, wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT60 -> 't637' is listed, but also another entry:\nNT60 -> 't573' \n\nYes, so both 't637' and 't573' are derived from NT60. So, 't37' must come from NT37, but looking through the production rules, there's no NT37. Wait, hold on, no, the productions are for NT with specific numbers. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see an NT37. Wait, but let's check all the tokens. 't37' appears multiple times. Similarly, 't573' appears multiple times, which we've established could come from NT60.\n\nWait, but 't37' is a terminal, so it must be derived from some NT that goes directly to 't37'. Let me search for NT that have production to 't37'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't37'. Only 't37' and 't637' are separate. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't37' is a result of a chain of productions. Wait, no, in the grammar, each production is binary except for terminals, so if 't37' is a terminal, it must come directly from a non-terminal that has a production rule to 't37'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT487 has a rule: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, and another NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. But none of the tokens are NT487. Let's check NT933: I see that NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT372. So, NT933 might produce 't372'? Wait, no, looking at the NT933 rule, it's NT933 \u2192 NT217 NT372. But in the grammar, for NT217, the rule is NT217 \u2192 NT591 't848'? Wait, no, looking at NT217, the rule is NT217 \u2192 't467'? No, let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\n\nYes, so NT195 \u2192 't278', which is somewhere else. Let me approach this differently. Let me first list all the terminals in the string and see if each can be derived.\n\nThe string is: t37 t573 t466 t278 t278 t573 t573 t278 t593 t573 t689 t555 t640 t237 t467 t466 t467 t378 t640 t30 t98 t98 t278 t804 t372 t637 t535 t466 t30 t777 t804 t372 t593 t535 t37 t363 t444 t535 t278 t689 t98 t573.\n\nSo the terminals used are:\n\n- t37\n- t573\n- t466\n- t278\n- t593\n- t689\n- t555\n- t640\n- t237\n- t467\n- t378\n- t30\n- t804\n- t372\n- t637\n- t535\n- t98\n\nI need to see for each of these if they are the result of a single non-terminal's production.\n\nLet's start with 't37'. Is there a non-terminal that can directly produce 't37'? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT rules that directly produce 't37'. However, maybe it's reachable through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps 't37' is a terminal that isn't present in the grammar. That would mean it's not part of any production, so the string isn't generated by the grammar. Wait, but let me check all the terminals present in the string to see if each is accounted for in the grammar.\n\nLooking through each terminal:\n\n- t37: Not in the right-hand sides of any NT rules.\n- t573: NT60 \u2192 't573' is a rule, yes.\n- t466: NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833, and looking for 't466'. From the NT756 rule, which is in the grammar, I don't see 't466' directly, but wait, NT466 is another non-terminal. Wait, no, wait: the grammar has NT466 \u2192 't640' as a rule? No, wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT466. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking back:\n\nI see NT466 is not directly present. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me go through each terminal:\n\nt37: Not a RHS of any NT rule.\n\nt573: Yes, NT60 \u2192 't573'.\n\nt466: Wait, do any NT rules produce 't466'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the right-hand sides, I don't see 't466'. So 't466' is not directly derived from any NT. So that would mean the grammar can't produce 't466', so the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 two options: NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389.\n\n- NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT530.\n\n- NT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946.\n\n- NT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833.\n\n- NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697.\n\n- NT487 \u2192 another rule.\n\n- NT487 again.\n\nWait, looking for 't466', is it a RHS of any rule?\n\nLooking at all the RHSes:\n\n- NT103: maybe?\n\nWait, NT103 \u2192 NT990 NT697, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-509","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, understanding CNF: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because each rule on the left has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the rules where terminals appear, like NT60 \u2192 't637', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t573 t237 t98 t14 t467 t131 t466 t467 t592 t98 t37 t467 t466 t555 t777 t14 t444 t30 t98 t637 t804 t640 t131 t467 t378 t217 t14 t467 t363 t892 t592 t30 t804 t444 t817 t37 t363 t466 t372 t573 t278 t640 t555.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the given grammar. To do this, I'll work backwards from the string, trying to split it into the rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol is S, which produces NT993 and NT487. So, the entire string must be derived from S. That means S must be the start, so the first step is to see if the string can be split into two parts that correspond to NT993 and NT487.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t573, which is a terminal. Checking the grammar, NT60 \u2192 't637' and NT636 \u2192 't777'. So, 't777' is from NT636, which is in the grammar (NT636 -> 't777').\n\nWait, the string starts with t573, which is from NT946 \u2192 't573' (NT946 -> 't573'). So, perhaps the first part is t573, and the remaining string must be generated by the second part of S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the string from the start. Starting with S, which generates NT487 and NT993. So, the string is the combination of NT487 \u2192 something and NT993 \u2192 something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of NT487 and NT993 are:\n\nNT487 has two rules: \u2192 NT103 NT486 or \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nAnd NT993 is the terminal 't444' according to the grammar (NT993 -> 't444').\n\nSo, the string must start with the productions of NT487 and followed by 't444'.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t573. Let's see if t573 is an output of NT487.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions for NT946: NT946 -> 't573'. But wait, is NT487 connected to NT946? Let me check the grammar rules to see if there's a connection.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nBut do these non-terminals connect to 't573'? Checking NT487 rules, they lead to NT103 and NT486 or NT933 and NT389. I'm not seeing a path from NT487 to 't573' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the NT productions.\n\nLooking for 't573': NT946's rule is NT946 -> 't573'. So 't573' comes from NT946. Therefore, if the first symbol is 't573', that must be derived from NT946. But S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the first symbols should be from NT487's expansion, not NT946. So this seems off.\n\nHmm, perhaps the string starts with NT487's production. Let's see: maybe the first part is 't573' from NT487, but I don't see a direct path from NT487 to 't573'. Alternatively, perhaps the NT487 can go through other non-terminals that eventually produce 't573'.\n\nLooking at NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nNT933: Does it lead somewhere? Let's see, looking through the grammar rules, there's NT588 \u2192 NT372, wait, wait, NT933 is maybe not directly listed. Wait, let's recheck.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT933 is involved in NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409, but that's not directly NT933. Let me check all the NT rules to see if any lead to 't573'.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's check NT487's rules again: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLooking down, NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964.\n\nNT964 is in the rules: NT964 \u2192 't640'. Because looking at NT964 \u2192 't640' in the grammar.\n\nSo, if NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, and NT964 \u2192 t640, then a possible path is NT103 \u2192 ... \u2192 t640.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t573. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut NT487's first part goes to NT103 and NT486. So, how does NT103 lead to t573? Alternatively, perhaps the production NT697 leads to t573. Let me check NT588.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT673 \u2192 't848' (according to the grammar), and NT591 has a rule: NT591 \u2192 't278'. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to map this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is not from NT487 but from NT993. But according to S's production, S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the string must be the concatenation of NT487's production and NT993's.\n\nSince NT993 \u2192 't444', the string should end with 't444'. But looking at the end of the given string: ...444, which is 't444'. So that part is okay.\n\nThe problem is the beginning: does the string start with 't573', which doesn't directly come from NT487.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the string's order. Maybe the string is in reverse? Let me check: The string starts with 't573' and the last part ends with 't444', which is from NT993. But the beginning may be from NT487.\n\nWait, perhaps I can divide the string into two parts: part A from NT487 and part B from NT993 ('t444').\n\nSo, I need to check if part A can be derived from NT487.\n\nLooking at part A:\n\nt573 t237 t98 t14 t467 t131 t466 t467 t592 t98 t37 t467 t466 t555 t777 t14 t444 t30 t98 t637 t804 t640 t131 t467 t378 t217 t14 t467 t363 t892 t592 t30 t804 t444 t817 t37 t363 t466 t372 t573 t278 t640 t555.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-501","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me start by understanding how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals have productions to other non-terminals, and others directly produce terminal tokens. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions.\n\nThe string to check is: `t573 t14 t467 t535 t848 t237 t372 t37 t535 t37 t637 t777 t237 t278 t14 t237 t817 t573 t37 t689 t444 t363 t444 t131 t444 t573 t555 t592 t444 t30 t592 t131 t848 t14 t217 t892 t278 t378 t444 t593 t14 t131 t378`\n\nI notice that each word in the string is a terminal symbol, so the production rules must generate these terminals through the grammar.\n\nI think the strategy is to construct a parse tree where the root is S, and each internal node is a non-terminal, with leaves being the terminals in the string. However, since the string is quite long, this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol by applying the productions step by step, ensuring that the entire string is consumed without leftovers.\n\nLet me first list out all the production rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\nNT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\nNT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\nNT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\nNT756 \u2192 NT256 NT833\nNT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\nNT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\nNT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\nNT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\nNT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\nNT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951\nNT833 \u2192 NT9 NT894\nNT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588\nNT446 \u2192 NT636 NT226\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT591 \u2192 't804'\nNT636 \u2192 't777'\nNT389 \u2192 't689'\nNT588 \u2192 't37'\nNT946 \u2192 't131'\nNT195 \u2192 't278'\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\nNT256 \u2192 't98'\nNT60 \u2192 't573'\nNT347 \u2192 't593'\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\nNT217 \u2192 't467'\nNT409 \u2192 't555'\nNT368 \u2192 't237'\nNT399 \u2192 't372'\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\nNT217 \u2192 't592'\nNT951 \u2192 't14'\nNT486 \u2192 't363'\nNT894 \u2192 't892'\nNT993 \u2192 't444'\nNT588 \u2192 't535'\nNT933 \u2192 't217'\nNT697 \u2192 't378'\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\nNT990 \u2192 't817'\nNT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nWow, that's a lot of rules. Each NT (non-terminal) leads to either two NTs or a terminal. Some non-terminals have multiple productions, like NT487 has two.\n\nMy plan is to represent each non-terminal and see if the string corresponds to a possible sequence of productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down the string into terms that must be generated by each rule. Let me list the tokens:\n\nLooking at the string: t573 t14 t467 t535 t848 t237 t372 t37 t535 t37 t637 t777 t237 t278 t14 t237 t817 t573 t37 t689 t444 t363 t444 t131 t444 t573 t555 t592 t444 t30 t592 t131 t848 t14 t217 t892 t278 t378 t444 t593 t14 t131 t378\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t573, which must come from NT573. From the rules, NT60 \u2192 't573'. So that would mean NT60 should derive t573. Then, looking at the next token: t14.\n\nt14 is a terminal, but in the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t14. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at NT14 \u2192 ... actually, I don't see NT14. Checking the rules, there's NT9,9 etc., but not NT14. Hmm. Wait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't637' and also NT60 \u2192 't573'. So t573 is from NT60, and t573 is in our string.\n\nLooking at the second token, t14. None of the non-terminals directly produce t14. Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let's check the rules again.\n\nIn the rules, I see NT195 \u2192 't278', NT147 \u2192 't367' and 't591'. Wait, looking through all rules, none of the NTs directly produce 't573' except NT60. Similarly, 't14' is produced by NT951? Wait:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT951 can be derived in two ways: one leads to 't14' and another to 't466'. So if NT951 can produce 't14', then 't14' could come from NT951.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking for 't14':\n- NT951 \u2192 't14' [from line NT951 \u2192 't466', but wait, no, in the rules provided, it's:\n\nNT951: 't466' and maybe 't14'? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nThe rule for NT951 is: `NT951 -> 't466'` or `NT951 -> 't14'`? From the list provided, yes, looking:\n\nHere's a rule: NT951 \u2192 't466' is one, but also another rule: `NT951 -> NT217`? Wait, no. Let me go through the rules:\n\nWait, no, in the given list, for NT951: the rule is `NT951 -> 't466'`. Oh, but wait, another line: NT951 \u2192 't14' would have to come from another rule? Let me check all the rules given. Looking at the list again:\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nNo, I don't see NT951 having 't14' in its production. It only has 't466' as a terminal. So that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread the rules.

So S splits into two non-terminals: NT487 and NT993.\n\nNow, looking at the production rules for NT487 and NT993. Hmm, let me write them down:\n\nNT487:\n\u2192 NT103 NT486\n\u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nND939:\nNot sure, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, right, NT933 is a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, some NT entries eventually produce 't' strings.

So each token is like 't37', 't592', etc. So the input string is a series of these tokens, which are terminals.\n\nSo the plan is to parse the string by matching the non-terminals according to the grammar, replacing each with their right-hand sides (either two non-terminals or a terminal).\n\nBut since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to see if each of these 'tX' parts can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar is a bit complex with many non-terminals, so maybe it's easier to work backwards from the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at all the non-terminals that directly produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT487 has two rules:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals, which in turn can produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals like NT486, NT103, NT933, NT389 each have their own rules.\n\nWait, but maybe I should see if each 'tX' in the string can be matched by a rule of some non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps each 'tX' corresponds to a non-terminal that has a production ending with 'tX'.\n\nLet me look at all the non-terminals and see which ones have rules that end with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT487: the two options lead to NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389. None directly produce terminals.\n\n- NT993 has a production? Wait, looking again at the grammar, the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. I don't see any production for NT993 directly, so it must be part of a more comprehensive rule.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should look for all non-terminals that have production rules ending with a terminal. Let me scan each rule:\n\nLooking for 'a' terminals on the RHS:\n\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217 \u2192 but these are non-terminals.\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951 \u2192 non-terminals.\n\n- NT951 \u2192 't466' \u2192 finally, a terminal.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT990 \u2192 't817' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT367 \u2192 't30' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT399 \u2192 't372' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT673 \u2192 't848' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT147 \u2192 't363' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT591 \u2192 't593' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT951 \u2192 't466' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT990 \u2192 't817' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT367 \u2192 't30' \u2192 terminal.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT933 \u2192 't217' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT697 \u2192 't378' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT964 \u2192 't640' \u2192 terminal.\n\n- NT990 \u2192 't817' \u2192 terminal.\n\nWait, so many non-terminals have productions that end in a terminal. But what about the production rules. For example, NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569, but both are non-terminals. None of those directly produce terminals, unless their children do.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation must go through these terminals. Let me see the given string:\n\nThe string is: t37 t592 t30 t14 t555 t892 t637 t555 t278 t372 t237 t467 t637 t817 t217 t363 t278 t30 t593 t592 t535 t555 t637 t573 t30 t237 t848 t573 t30 t237 t278 t777 t98 t378 t217 t131 t14 t378 t444 t378 t98 t640 t555 t593.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Each token is a string starting with 't' followed by numbers. The first step is to check if each of these can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps instead of trying to parse the entire string step by step (which would take a lot of time), I can check if each 'tX' is covered by the grammar. Wait, I think each 'tX' is a production of some NT ending in that. Looking at the rules:\n\nFor each production endpoint that's a terminal:\n\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\n\nNT990 \u2192 't817'\n\nNT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT217 \u2192 't467'\n\nNT399 \u2192 't372'\n\nNT673 \u2192 't848'\n\nNT147 \u2192 't363'\n\nNT591 \u2192 't593'\n\nAnd others like NT351 \u2192 ends in NT217, which ends in 't467'\n\nWait, but I also see NT486 \u2192 't363' and NT389 \u2192 't378'.\n\nSo for every 'tX', I need to check if it's produced by some path in the grammar.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to check each token. Let's go through each token in the string and see if it's a terminal in the grammar. Then, see if there's a rule for some NT that produces it.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t37: Check if any NT's production ends with 't37'. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't37'. Wait, but perhaps some NT's production includes a terminal like 't37'. Scanning all the rules:\n\n- NT351 \u2192 't466' no\n\n- NT697 \u2192 't378' no\n\n- NT217 \u2192 't467' no\n\n- NT237 \u2192 't237' no; 't237' is the rule for NT237.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rule for NT237 isn't listed, but perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, in the given grammar, are there any terminal symbols other than the 't' followed by numbers?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, all the terminals are of the form 't' followed by numbers, like 't37', 't592', etc. So, for example, NT147 \u2192 't363', which is a terminal.\n\nSo for the token 't37', I need to see if there's any NT rule where the RHS includes 't37'.

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see what I have to do here. I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form, and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with a series of production rules. Each non-terminal seems to expand into a combination of terminals and other non-terminals. My task is to parse the given string and see if it can derive from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n\n`t98 t131 t535 t637 t98 t444 t573 t467 t466 t817 t278 t689 t637 t466 t363 t637 t804 t592 t573 t278 t777 t237 t278 t593 t98 t535 t804 t37 t372 t378 t372 t804 t217 t573 t217 t444 t467 t378 t14 t804 t30 t466 t637 t363`\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of t-prefixed tokens, each followed by a space. Each 't' is followed by a number. So, I need to consider each of these as individual tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT9 and NT487. So, the initial production is S -> NT9 NT487.\n\nThis means the string must start with the expansion of NT9 followed by NT487. Let's check the string starts with 't98' which is NT9 -> 't98'. The NT9 production is also defined as NT10 -> NT147 NT951, but NT10 is part of NT9's expansion. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar says:\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nWait, no, the initial productions are:\nS -> NT9 NT487\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nSo, S starts with NT9 and NT487. So the initial part of the string must be the expansion of NT9 followed by NT487.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't98'. Checking NT9's productions, we have:\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nBut also, looking at the detailed expansions of NT9, it seems that in the grammar, NT9 is defined as NT60 NT530, but NT60 in the grammar is:\n\nNT60 -> 't637'\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, each rule is a single step. So NT9 expands into NT60 NT530, which then each expand further. So perhaps S -> NT9 NT487, and each of theseNT9 and NT487 need to expand into their respective terminal sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, the first 't98' is the expansion of NT9. Wait, looking at NT9's production, it's NT60 NT530. And looking at the detailed rules, NT60 -> 't637', and NT530 -> 't573'. So the first part of the string starts with 't637 t573', but in our string, it starts with 't98 t131...'. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the grammar rules as a tree.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's S -> NT9 NT487.\n\nNow, let's see what each of these NTs expand into.\n\nNT9: The production is NT9 -> NT60 NT530. Then NT60 is 't637', and NT530 is 't573'. So the expansion of NT9 is 't637 t573'.\n\nNT487: Looking at the production, it's NT487 -> NT103 NT486. NT103 is 't964', and NT486 is 't363'. So the expansion of NT487 is 't964 t363'.\n\nSo S's expansion is NT9 followed by NT487, which should be 't637 t573 t964 t363'.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't98 t131 t535...', which is way longer and doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar is more complex, with NT487 having more options. Looking again, I see that S -> NT9 NT487.\n\nBut what if NT9 has other productions? Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, NT9's only production is NT60 NT530, and those are terminal. So S's expansion is fixed as 't637 t573 t964 t363'.\n\nBut the given string is much longer. So does that mean it's generated by a different path?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me reread it.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT9 NT487.\n\nThen, each NT has certain rules. NT9 -> NT60 NT530.\n\nNT487 in the grammar has two productions: NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389.\n\nWait, but looking more closely, the initial part of the grammar shows:\n\n```\nS -> NT487 NT993\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\n... and so on, with each NT having different rules.\n```\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial S's production is S -> NT487 NT993, but in my earlier assumption, I thought it was NT9 NT487, but looking back, the user provided the grammar as:\n\n\"Grammar: ```S -> NT487 NT993\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\nNT147 -> NT367 NT591\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\nNT833 -> NT9 NT894\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\nNT446 -> NT636 NT226\nNT103 -> NT673 NT964\nNT591 -> 't804'\nNT636 -> 't777'\nNT389 -> 't689'\nNT588 -> 't37'\nNT946 -> 't131'\nNT195 -> 't278'\nNT60 -> 't637'\nNT256 -> 't98'\nNT60 -> 't573'\nNT347 -> 't593'\nNT951 -> 't466'\nNT217 -> 't467'\nNT409 -> 't555'\nNT368 -> 't237'\nNT399 -> 't372'\nNT673 -> 't848'\nNT217 -> 't592'\nNT951 -> 't14'\nNT486 -> 't363'\nNT894 -> 't892'\nNT993 -> 't444'\nNT588 -> 't535'\nNT933 -> 't217'\nNT697 -> 't378'\nNT964 -> 't640'\nNT990 -> 't817'\nNT367 -> 't30'```\n\nWait, no, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nNT226 -> NT85 NT569\n\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\n\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\n\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT48"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-524","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string we're given has a bunch of tokens separated by spaces, so each token is either a terminal or the result of a production. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, it seems like everything eventually resolves to terminals like 't804', 't637', etc. The start symbol is S, and the grammar builds strings by expanding S into a series of NTs, each of which eventually becomes a terminal. \n\nThe string is: t278 t131 t592 t237 t14 t535 t466 t14 t777 t363 t30 t14 t237 t217 t817 t593 t378 t592 t593 t30 t817 t466 t372 t372 t372 t278 t892 t640 t467 t535 t37 t378 t217 t637 t98 t848 t444 t592 t444 t363 t466 t237 t131 t804 t444.\n\nI notice that the grammar has certain production rules for each NT. For example, NT226 can be t777 or t833, depending on the rule. So each of these NTs represents a step in the derivation.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start, using the grammar rules. Since it's a tree-based grammar, I can try to see if the string can be split into components that match the productions.\n\nLet me see if the first part makes sense. The string starts with t278 t131 t592... Looking at the grammar, t278 is produced by NT147: NT147 -> t804. Wait, no, in the rules, NT147 -> NT367 NT591, and then NT367 -> t30, and NT591 -> t278. So t278 is part of NT591.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how the NTs can derive to the terminals we have. For example, looking at the rules, NT367 -> t30 and NT399 -> t372, etc.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that match the rules. Let's start at the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t278. Looking at the grammar, t278 comes from NT592: NT592 is derived from NT367 and NT591. NT367 is t30, and NT591 is t278. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at NT591: it's a production that leads to t278. So NT591 -> t278. Also, NT147 -> NT367 NT591, which becomes t30 and t591, which is t278. So the combination is t30 t278.\n\nSo the initial part of the string is t278 t131 t592... Wait, maybe I need to see if the string can be built by concatenating the expansions. Let me check the possible order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be parsed using the grammar. Each element in the string is a terminal, so each must be the result of some production.\n\nLet me list all the terminals to see if they can come from the grammar:\n\nt278, t131, t592, t237, t14, t535, t466, t14, t777, t363, t30, t14, t237, t217, t817, t593, t378, t592, t593, t30, t817, t466, t372, t372, t372, t278, t892, t640, t467, t535, t37, t378, t217, t637, t98, t848, t444, t592, t444, t363, t466, t237, t131, t804, t444.\n\nEach of these should match the productions for the non-terminals. \n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. Start with S -> NT9 NT487 NT993. Wait, no, the grammar says S -> NT9 NT487 NT993. Wait, no, looking at the rules, S is split into three parts? Or wait, Chomsky Normal Form doesn't allow for more than two symbols on the RHS. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user defined the grammar as S->NT... So each production is two non-terminals. So maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait looking at the rules: Each production is two non-terminals, like S -> NT9 NT487. So S is split into NT9 and NT487, each of which must expand into terminals.\n\nWait, that seems odd because typically in CNF, start symbols produce two non-terminals, which recursively produce terminals. So S produces two parts, each of which is a non-terminal, which in turn produce their own terminals.\n\nWait, but the given grammar seems to have S producing the concatenation of two NTs, like S-> NT9 NT487, which would require both NT9 and NT487 to be terminals for the entire thing to be a terminal.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Alternatively, maybe the grammar is S -> NT9, NT487, NT993, but that doesn't fit since each production needs two non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but let's go with the grammar as given. Each production is two non-terminals, so S produces NT9 and NT487, and they each need to be terminals. But looking through the grammar, none of the NTs are terminals except for some of them, like NT131, but probably, I'm not seeing any terminals.\n\nWait, maybe all NTs except a few derive to terminals, but looking at the list, some have rules leading to terminals. For example, NT444 appears as a terminal, so T444 is a terminal. Similarly, NT217 is a terminal because one rule for NT217 is t592.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals are those that have only terminal options. For example, if an NT can only produce terminals, it's a terminal. But no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all symbols are non-terminals except the terminal symbols.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to better parse the grammar. Let me try to write down all the NTs and their possible expansions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each NT produces two other NTs or a terminal. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has two non-terminals. So, for example, NT147 -> NT367 NT591. So NT367 and NT591 must each derive to terminals for NT147 to be a terminal.\n\nBut in the given rules, we have several NTs that do have a mix of NT and terminal. Wait, the user wrote some rules ending with a terminal. For example, NT131 -> t637. Wait, that's a terminal. So if an NT directly produces a terminal, then it's a terminal production.\n\nSo, the NTs like NT367 (-> t30) and NT147 (-> NT367 NT591) would produce a sequence of terminals. So, for example, NT147 can produce t30 t591. But each of those must be a terminal or further expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the approach is to see if the string can be constructed by starting from the start symbol S, expanding it to the two NTs, each expanding further until all non-terminals resolve to terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string is a concatenation of sequences of terminals derived from the NTs.\n\nBut I'm still stuck on how S starts as NT9 and NT487, which would require each of those to generate a string of terminals. But looking at all the grammar rules, the NTs eventually resolve to terminals like t30, t593, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT can only produce a single terminal, but that's not the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It starts with S -> NT487 NT993, so the entire string must start with these two nodes. Let me note down the string to process it step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t217 t777 t573 t466 t535 t467 t573 t98 t817 t848 t817 t372 t592 t237 t535 t640 t593 t804 t237 t593 t278 t237 t278 t637 t444 t804 t37 t689 t37 t378 t467 t14 t131 t278 t535 t689 t363 t535 t892 t535 t637 t466 t237 t372 t637`.\n\nEach symbol here is a terminal, I think, because the non-terminals are all those NT followed by numbers, like NT487, NT993, etc. Wait, actually, the NT symbols are all two-character sequences? No, they're sequences like NT10, which is three characters, but the right-hand sides of the productions are always two symbols. So some of these are non-terminals (like NT487, NT993), others are terminals if they end with 't' followed by numbers, like t217, which would be a terminal symbol.\n\nThe first step is to check if the entire string can be derived starting from S. So S -> NT487 NT993, which means the string should start with NT487 and NT993, each followed by their respective productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t217, which is a terminal. So NT487 must produce t217. Let me check the grammar rules for NT487. Looking at the production rules:\n\nNT487 can go to NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nWait, so NT487 has two options. Each of these is a combination of two non-terminals. So each production for NT487 results in two non-terminals, which in turn produce other symbols.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is a terminal, t217. So that means either NT487 needs to produce that t217 directly, but in the given grammar, NT487 only produces NTs. Looking at the rules, NT487 has productions to other NTs, not to terminals. Similarly, NT993: looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT993, so maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar starts with S and has several NT rules, but I don't see a production for NT487 or NT993 except in S. So for the grammar to produce t217 as the first symbol, there must be a production for some NT that derives to t217. But looking through all the NT rules, none of them seem to end with t217 as a terminal. Each NT's production is either two NTs or a terminal. Wait, no, actually, some of the productions end with terminals like 't804', 't237', 't131', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT964 produces 't640', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT217 is a non-terminal that has a production leading to t592. Hmm.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t217. So to get that, we need an NT that can produce t217. Looking at the grammar, is there any NT that can produce t217? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, do any of them have a terminal as their right-hand side that's t217?\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217 (so NT351 can produce NT10 NT217)\n\nBut NT351 is a non-terminal; its production goes to two NTs, not a terminal. So t217 itself isn't a terminal in the grammar; instead, it's part of a production.\n\nWait, let me map all the symbols in the string:\n\nt217, t777, t573, t466, t535, t467, t573, t98, t817, t848, t817, t372, t592, t237, t535, t640, t593, t804, t237, t593, t278, t237, t278, t637, t444, t804, t37, t689, t37, t378, t467, t14, t131, t278, t535, t689, t363, t535, t892, t535, t637, t466, t237, t372, t637.\n\nSo each of these is a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should identify which are terminals and which are non-terminals. The non-terminals are all the NTxxxx, like NT487, NT993, etc., whereas the t followed by numbers are terminals. So:\n\nThe string starts with t217 (terminal). Let's find which NT can generate this. But looking through the grammar, none of the NT non-terminals produce t217 directly. Instead, let's look at the productions:\n\nLooking at all the NT rules, none produce a terminal. Wait, no, some of them might have a terminal on the right-hand side. For example, NT951 can produce 't466'. So some of the productions of the NTs result in terminals.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor example, NT951 -> 't466'. So NT951 can produce t466. Similarly, NT217 -> 't592'. So NT217 can produce t592. Similarly, NT636 -> 't777', which would mean that NT636 produces t777. Others like NT60 can produce 't637' or 't573', etc.\n\nSo, the process would involve breaking down each part of the string starting from the first symbol, which is t217, and see if there's a corresponding NT that can generate it.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, the only way to get t217 is if there's a production for an NT that produces it. Let me check all NT rules to see if any can produce t217.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT487: only NT103 and NT933. Both are non-terminals, so no terminal here.\n- NT487: other options? No, just those two.\n- NT993: Not sure, but looking back, I don't think NT993 has any production listed except being used in S.\n- Other NTs: I need to go through each to see.\n\nWait, actually, I might have missed some in the provided grammar. Let's list all the NT rules again to check:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nNT487: Both productions result in non-terminals, so no terminal.\n\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\n\nNT226 -> NT85 NT530\n\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\n\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\n\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 (already listed)\n... etc.\n\nWait, I think I missed that NT951 is a production for 't466'. So, NT951 is an NT that can produce the terminal 't466'.\n\nSimilarly, let's look for any NT that can produce 't217' directly via a production rule. From the list:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT636 -> 't777' (produces terminal)\n- NT351 -> NT10 NT217 (produces two NTs, no terminal)\n- NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-531","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got to figure out whether the given string \"t593 t372...\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at S, it directly expands into NT487 NT993. So, the string starts with \"t...\" which matches some terminals. Let me check NT487 and NT993 in the grammar.\n\nNT487 can expand in two ways: either into NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Looking at the string, the first part after S is \"t593 t372...\". Wait, \"t593\" and \"t372\" might correspond to some NT productions.\n\nWait, the string starts with t593. Let me see what NT593 is. Wait, actually, looking back, the NT labels in the grammar are up to NT993, but the terminals are combinations like NT10, NT226, etc., each of which expands into different terminals. So, each NT non-terminal ultimately expands into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string should start with the terminal outputs from NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t593 t372 t848 t37 t848 t30 t777...\". Let's see what nt593 and nt372 produce. Wait, NT593 is not in the grammar provided\u2014wait, no, in the grammar, there are NT entries, but I think the list was cut off. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT... that produce t593: From the grammar, NT367 \u2192 t30. NT951 \u2192 t466. NT305? Wait, looking through the rules, some NT seem to expand into specific t's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each NT as a production that can generate a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. To parse the string, I might need to construct a parse tree or use dynamic programming methods.\n\nSince the string is quite long, let me try to segment it into phrases that could be the expansion of the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t593. What's the rule for NT593? Let me search through the grammar rules provided. I see entries like NT103 \u2192 t673 t964, etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT964 \u2192 t640, but I don't see NT593 as a terminal; instead, NT367 \u2192 t30. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. Starting from S, which is NT487 NT993. So the first two non-terminals are NT487 and NT993. Let me find out what each of these produce.\n\nLooking for NT487:\nFrom the grammar, NT487 has two rules:\n1. NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo, both of these produce two non-terminals each. Let's see what those non-terminals expand into.\n\nFor NT487's first production: NT103 and NT486.\n\nNT103's rule: NT103 \u2192 t673 NT964. NT964 \u2192 t640. So NT103 \u2192 t673 t640.\n\nNT486's rule: NT486 \u2192 t363.\n\nSo the production from S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and NT487's first expansion would produce t673 t640, then NT993. But I'm not sure about that yet. Let me check what NT993 produces.\n\nLooking at NT993's rule: NT993 \u2192 NT530 NT444.\n\nWhat do NT530 and NT444 produce?\n\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446.\n\nNT60's rules:\nNT60 \u2192 t637 or NT147.\n\nWait, NT60 appears in two places: in the grammar as NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446, and in the rule for NT60 itself: NT60 \u2192 t637 or NT147.\n\nSo for NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446:\nNT60 can be t637 or NT147. Let's take NT60 \u2192 t637 first. Then NT446's rule: NT446 \u2192 t777.\n\nSo NT530 in this case would produce t637 t777.\n\nNT444's rule: NT444 \u2192 t378.\n\nSo NT993 \u2192 NT530 t378 \u2192 t637 t777 t378.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT487 NT993 \u2192 (t673 t640) (t637 t777 t378). So from S, we get t673 t640 t637 t777 t378.\n\nBut looking at the input string, the first part is t593 t372 t848... which is different from the S expansion I just computed. Hmmm, maybe I made a mistake or perhaps there's another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by looking at the first token in the string, t593, and see if it's derived from any NT.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, none directly produce t593. Wait, maybe a combination. For example, NT593 might not be present; perhaps it's derived from two NTs. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which non-terminals to expand. Maybe the correct path is different.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the string starts with t593, so I'll look for any production that gets t593 as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t593. Instead, it's likely that t593 is part of a multi-step derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT367 \u2192 t30. NT399 \u2192 t372.\n\nSo perhaps t372 comes from NT399. Let's see what NT399's rule is. Wait, from the grammar list, it says NT399 \u2192 NT372 NT368. So NT399 expands into NT372 NT368.\n\nThen NT372: looking through the rules, I don't see NT372. Wait, perhaps that's a terminal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a connection.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is more structured, and each pair of NT expansions corresponds to a word. Alternatively, maybe each tX is a terminal, so the entire string is a concatenation of tX's.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to parse the string as a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe string is: t593 t372 t848 t37 t848 t30 t777 t535 t363 t777 t892 t14 t131 t444 t777 t573 t892 t278 t98 t467 t689 t363 t592 t892 t467 t892 t592 t14 t98 t817 t14 t98 t817 t689 t98 t444 t378 t892 t378 t466 t593 t37 t804 t237 t592 t777.\n\nThat's a lot of t's, each probably corresponding to a production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note which nodes can produce which terminals.\n\nFor example, NT10 \u2192 t147.\n\nNT147 \u2192 t367.\n\nSo NT10 expands into t147 \u2192 t367.\n\nSimilarly, NT103 \u2192 t673 t964 \u2192 t673 t640.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nLet me first expand NT487.

Wait, no, NT530 isn't a terminal, it's a rule that produces NT60 and NT446.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a note of which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, each non-terminal either produces two non-terminals (which would need to be further broken down until reaches terminals) or directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo, any non-terminal that ends with a rule that directly produces a terminal is a leaf in the parse tree, meaning it corresponds to a single character in the string.\n\nThe string given is: t444 t98 t466 t848 t573 t593 t637 t14 t466 t467 t592 t378 t131 t535 t131 t535 t131 t573 t466 t217 t573 t848 t37 t892 t278 t592 t131 t37 t363 t804 t777 t817 t640 t892 t278 t378 t804 t467 t466 t592 t592 t535 t637 t363 t637 t817.\n\nFirst, let's parse the string into individual tokens:\n\nt444, t98, t466, t848, t573, t593, t637, t14, t466, t467, t592, t378, t131, t535, t131, t535, t131, t573, t466, t217, t573, t848, t37, t892, t278, t592, t131, t37, t363, t804, t777, t817, t640, t892, t278, t378, t804, t467, t466, t592, t592, t535, t637, t363, t637, t817.\n\nEach token is something like 'tXXX', where XXX is a number.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, some of these are terminals, others might be non-terminals.\n\nLooking at each rule, if a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal, that's a leaf. For example, NT487 can produce 't486' via NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, and then NT486 \u2192 't363', or via NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389, and then NT389 \u2192 't689'. So some of these tXXX might come directly from non-terminals that have production paths leading to them.\n\nBut wait, the string consists only of 't' followed by numbers. So, each token starts with 't', which is part of the production. So, for example, in the grammar, when a rule produces a terminal, that could be the 't' followed by a number. Let's see which rules actually produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT487 can produce 't486' or 't933' (but wait, let's see the exact productions.\nWait, I think I need to list all the terminals to see if they match.\n\nWait, no, the terminals are the ones that are directly produced. So in NT487, the productions are NT103 NT486 and NT933 NT389. So in order for NT487 to be a terminal, either of those branches must produce it. But in the grammar rules, NT486, NT933, etc., are non-terminals, so they would produce more until we reach a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the NTs can produce directly a terminal. Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking back at the rules, are there any NTs that directly produce a terminal with 't'?\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nYes, several NTs can produce terminal strings. For instance, NT60 \u2192 't637' or 't573'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217. I don't see NT217 producing a terminal yet, but looking further, NT217 \u2192 't592' or 't467'.\n- NT217's production is NT467 or NT592, which are both terminals: t467 and t592.\n\nWait, let's see NT467 and NT592.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT367 \u2192 't30' and NT399 \u2192 't372', so these are terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT804 \u2192 't777' or 't444', wait no, NT530 \u2192 NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217, but NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, and so on until they reach terminals like t351? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that some productions have 'a' as the right-hand side. For instance, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, but later I see NT486 \u2192 't363' and NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, etc. Each of these non-terminals eventually resolves to a terminal string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the productions that directly produce terminals because that's how the string is built step by step. So, I should go through each production and check if the right-hand side has any terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't147'?

So both NT103 and NT486 are non-terminals. Wait, no, unless some of them produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, looking back, some productions have 'a's, like NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, but NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964, which are both non-terminals. Then NT103 \u2192 673 and 964 are both non-terminals, so that might eventually produce more non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each of the terminals in the string corresponds to a production where the right-hand side is a single terminal. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother method is to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the process would start with the start symbol, S, and derive larger strings until it equals the target string.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t804, I need to see which non-terminal generates 't804'.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is quite long, but I'll break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, and the string starts with 't444', so I need to see if there's a derivation that starts from S and ends with this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S directly produces NT487 NT993. So, the first two tokens in the string must be generated from NT487 and NT993. Let's check that.\n\nThe string starts with 't444 t278 t378 t372 t363 t689 t466 t804 t555 t98 t777 t555 t637 t573 t237 t555 t444 t278 t444 t892 t804 t237 t555 t37 t573 t555 t237 t573 t444 t278 t378 t37 t467 t593 t14 t37 t467 t637 t804 t637 t848'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The first token is 't444', which comes from NT487 \u2192 ... Looking at the grammar, NT487 can produce 't363' directly or 't372'. But wait, in the given string, the first token is 't444', which doesn't match either 't363' or 't372'. Hmm, that's an initial inconsistency. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me look again. The string is: t444 t278 t378 t372 t363 t689 t466 t804 t555 t98 t777 t555 t637 t573 t237 t555 t444 t278 t444 t892 t804 t237 t555 t37 t573 t555 t237 t573 t444 t278 t378 t37 t467 t593 t14 t37 t467 t637 t804 t637 t848.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't444', but in the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT487 and NT993. Checking NT487 and NT993's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT487 can produce 't363' or 't372' via NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. Then, each of those may produce 't's or further grammar steps.\n\nWait, actually, 't444' is a terminal, but in the grammar, terminal symbols are only on the right-hand side of productions. Let me check if 't444' is part of any production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT993 \u2192 't444' directly. So, in the derivation, at some point, there must be an NT993 that directly produces 't444'.\n\nSo, the first token 't444' must come from NT993. Therefore, the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and then NT993 immediately produces 't444'.\n\nThat leaves the rest of the string to be generated by the other parts, but let's see. Wait, the next token is 't278'. But in the grammar, the other part is NT487, which has its own productions. So maybe I need to trace how the 't278' comes from NT487.\n\nLooking at NT487's productions:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nThen, each of these can further break down. Let's see:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT673 \u2192 't848' (from NT673 \u2192 't848')\nWait, no, in the grammar, it's NT673 \u2192 't848', so 't848' is a terminal. So, if NT103 produces 't848' via NT103 \u2192 't848', that would give 't848'.\n\nBut in the string after 't444' is 't278', so perhaps NT487's NT103 produces 't848' and NT486?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should build a parse tree, but it's getting complicated. Let me see the structure step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t444 (from NT993), then t278. So after S \u2192 NT487 NT993, we get t444 from NT993. Now, the next part is NT487, which needs to produce t278 and whatever comes next.\n\nWait, the string after 't444' is 't278 t378 t372 t363 t689 ...'. So the structure would be S \u2192 NT487 NT993 \u2192 NT487 produces 't278' and NT993 produces 't444'?\n\nWait, no. Because S produces NT487 and NT993, but each of those grammars must be expanded until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Each of NT487 and NT993 must produce a string of terminals. So S \u2192 NT487 NT993 means that the entire string is the concatenation of NT487\u2019s string and NT993\u2019s string.\n\nSo, after S, we have NT487's string concatenated with NT993's string, which starts with 't444'.\n\nWait, but in the example, after 't444' comes 't278', but in the derivation, it's Ntxxx... Let me try to map it:\n\nThe first symbol is 't444', which is from NT993. The second symbol is 't278'\u2014where does that come from? So S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which would mean the first part is NT487's derivation and the second is NT993's.\n\nSo if NT487's derivation produces 't278', and NT993's produces 't444', that would give 't278 t444', but in the string it's 't444 t278 ...', which implies that perhaps NT993 produces 't444' and NT487 starts with 't278'. Wait, that's the opposite order.\n\nWait no, S \u2192 NT487 NT993 would lead to NT487's output first, then NT993's. So the first symbols should come from NT487, then from NT993.\n\nSo in the given string, after 't444' (from NT993), the first symbol of the NT487 part should be the first symbol of NT487's string. But in the string, after 't444' is 't278', which would come from NT487's first symbol.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, what terminals can NT487 produce? Let's see:\n\nFrom NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, and both are non-terminals. Or NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389, both non-terminals. Then, each of those would break down further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the terminals that come directly from NT487. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, which terminals come from NT487? Let me go through:\n\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 (both non-terminals)\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389 (both non-terminals)\n\nSo, NT487\u2019s productions only break down into non-terminals. That's a problem because if S \u2192 NT487 NT993, then NT487 can't directly produce any terminals. So the first symbol after S would be the first terminal from NT993, but the next symbols would have to come from NT487, which can't produce terminals directly.

{"custom_id":"request-558","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It starts with S -> NT487 NT993. So any string generated by this grammar must start and end with NT487 and NT993 respectively. Okay, so I should check if the string starts with 't573' (assuming NT487 is represented by 't573' from the production rules) and ends with 't444' (since NT993 is 't444'). Wait, no, actually looking at the rules, NT487 can produce 't573', so the entire S would generate something starting with 't573' from NT487 and ending with 't444' from NT993. So the string must start with 't573' and end with 't444'. Let me check the given string: it starts with 't573' and ends with 't372 t466...' Wait, no, the last token is 't372', which doesn't match 't444'. That's a problem. Wait, the string ends with 't372' and 't466', but according to NT993, it should be 't444'. Hmm, this might already be a 'No', but let's proceed a bit more.\n\nWait, no, looking at the last rule, NT993 is 't444', so the entire string of symbols generated by S should end with 't444'. But the string given ends with t372, t466, etc., so that's a red flag. That probably means the answer is 'No', but let's confirm.\n\nBut let me not jump the gun. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting NT487 and the initial S's production.\n\nWait, S -> NT487 NT993, which would parse into something starting with NT487, which produces 't573', and NT993, which produces 't444'. So the string should start with t573 and end with t444. But the given string ends with t372, t466, etc. So the last part seems problematic, but I should check if the entire string follows the production rules.\n\nWait, maybe the string is concatenated in a way that satisfies the productions. Perhaps the string is a series of tokens that can be broken down into smaller parts according to the grammar rules, not necessarily starting with NT487 and ending with NT993... No, no, the start symbol S is the root, so any valid string must be derived from S, implying it starts with NT487 and ends with NT993. So the entire string should start with 't573' (from NT487) and end with 't444' (from NT993). However, the string ends with 't372 t466 t804 t640...', which doesn't fit 't444' at the end. So that's a clear indication the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the parsing is more complex, and I'm missing some productions. Let me check the rules more carefully. For example, NT487 can produce 't573' or 't964', right? Because looking at the production rules, NT487 can go to 't573' or 't964'. Similarly, NT993 is only 't444'. So S is starting with either NT487 (t573 or t964) and then followed by NT993 (t444).\n\nBut the given string starts with 't573', so that would fit NT487 -> t573, and the rest must be NT993, which is t444. However, the string ends with t372, t466, which suggests it's longer than just S -> NT487 NT993. Therefore, perhaps the string is longer than what's allowed, or the productions imply more steps.\n\nWait, but the given string is a list of tokens, not a tree structure, so perhaps the entire string is a concatenation of certain productions. Maybe the grammar allows more expansions.\n\nBut considering the way the grammar is structured, each NT (non-terminal) may produce several options, including more NTs or terminal symbols.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it's a list of t followed by three-digit numbers, so each token is a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of terms, each being a terminal.\n\nSo the question is whether this sequence can be derived by the grammar.\n\nGiven that, the start symbol S must derive to the entire string, which is a sequence of terminals. So we can only use the production rules that result in terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which NTs can produce terminals. For example, NT487 can produce 't573' or 't964'. These are terminals. NT636 can produce 't777', which is a terminal. NT10 can produce 't147' which is another NT, but 't147' is terminal if NT147 doesn't produce anything else. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT147 can produce 't367' and 't591'. Both are terminals. So NT147 is non-terminal and can only go to terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of how the string can be built.\n\nStarting with S, which must split into NT487 and NT993. So the string starts with whatever NT487 produces and ends with whatever NT993 produces, which is only 't444'. But the string provided ends with 't372 t466...', which suggests that the last part doesn't end with 't444', so that's a problem. Therefore, I'm already leaning towards 'No'.\n\nBut perhaps I should think of it more carefully. Maybe the entire string isn't a direct derivation of S, but perhaps some other way.\n\nWait, no. The structure is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the entire string must be the concatenation of the productions of NT487 and NT993. So if NT487 produces a certain string and NT993 produces another string, the entire string is their concatenation.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT487, the rules are:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nBoth of these are further expansions into NTs, which in turn can produce more NTs until we get to terminal symbols.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 \u2192 t444. So NT993 directly produces a single 't444', which is the end.\n\nWait, so perhaps S is followed by NT993, which gives 't444' as the right end. So the string provided, if correctly generated, must end with 't444'. However, the given string ends with t372, which is part of a different production, suggesting the end isn't t444. So that gives me a strong indication it's not part of the grammar's language.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me try to see if any other pattern emerges.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first halves correspond to NT487's production. Let's check if any part of the string starts with 't573', 't964' etc. But the crucial point is that the entire string must start with S's production and end with S's other production.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the entire sequence is a single list of terminals. So each 't' followed by a three-digit number is a terminal symbol. So the entire string is the concatenation of these terminals, so it's equivalent to S \u2192 ... (a series of NTs and eventually terminals).\n\nBut the starting part must be from NT487, which can only produce certain things, and the end must be from NT993, which only produces 't444'. So without a doubt, since the string ends with 't372... t466 t804...', which isn't 't444', it's definitely not part of the language generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar. So the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-550","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars, right? Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol.\n\nLet me look at the grammar provided. It starts with S and has various productions leading down to terminals like 't' and numbers. The string I need to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers, ending with 't30'. \n\nFirst, I think the approach should be to parse the string against the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, when parsing, I should look for a sequence that reduces from S through a series of productions, ending in the given string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string must start with NT487 and NT993. Wait, looking at the string, it starts with 't131', but NT487 produces 't363' (from NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, and so on until NT486 \u2192 't363'), and NT993 \u2192 't444'. So the first two tokens should be t363 and t444. But the string starts with t131, which is different. Hmm, maybe the order is different.\n\nWait, the grammar might be that S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which would mean the string starts with the symbols that NT487 and NT993 produce. So, let me check the productions for NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487: It has two options: NT103 and NT486. From the string, the first token is t131. Let me see what NT103 generates. Looking through the productions, NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964. Then, NT673 \u2192 t848 and NT964 \u2192 t640. So NT103 would generate 't848 t640'. But in the string, the first token is t131, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't131', which is NT487 generating t131? Let me check NT487's productions. Oh, NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389. So, what does NT933 produce? Looking at the productions, NT933 \u2192 NT217. Then NT217 \u2192 t592. Wait, but earlier, I thought NT103 is from NT487. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is that S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the string must start with the symbols that NT487 and NT993 produce. But the string starts with t131, which is part of NT487's production. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the entire string, the first token is t131. Let's see if t131 is produced by any NT. Checking the productions, I can see NT399 \u2192 t372, NT351 \u2192 t10 NT217, but no NT directly producing t131. Wait, so where is t131 coming from? Let me check the end of the string as well.\n\nThe string ends with t30, which is generated by NT591 \u2192 t372, but wait, no, looking at the string, the last part is t30. Let me see: NT303? Wait, looking for 't30', which is produced by NT147 \u2192 t30. Alternatively, NT278 \u2192 t593, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for each part step by step. Let me try a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993. So the string should be split into two parts: first from NT487 and then NT993.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t131. Let's see if t131 can be the first part. So, where in the grammar does t131 appear? Looking for NT productions that end with t131. Looking through the productions, I only see t131 as NT389 \u2192 t689, which is not 131. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down all the non-terminals and see where each 't' comes from. For example:\n\n- t131 comes from NT399 \u2192 t372? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production NT217 \u2192 t592. So, if any non-terminal produces t217, then that's t592.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for each 't' in the string and see which production can generate it. Let me list the 't's in the string:\n\nt131, t892, t555, t131, t592, t131, t592, t535, t593, t37, t363, t278, t593, t640, t573, t217, t593, t30, t466, t640, t466, t98, t30, t378, t466, t14, t372, t30, t777, t378, t804, t98, t14, t217, t592, t372, t98, t848, t98.\n\nEach of these must come from a production of a non-terminal, but since it's in CNF, each production is either two steps or one step. So, for each 't', it's a single step production.\n\nLet me think of how the string could be derived. Starting from S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nSo, the string must start with the steps from NT487 and NT993. The first token is t131. Let's see if that can be produced by NT487. Wait, looking back, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486. So the first symbol would be the result of NT103, which is 't848 t640' as per NT103's production. But the string starts with t131, not t848. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe I got the order wrong. Maybe S \u2192 NT487 NT993, and the string is a concatenation of the results of NT487 and NT993. So the first part is from NT487, the second from NT993.\n\nIf the first part is supposed to produce t131, then NT487 should somehow produce t131. But looking through its productions, I don't see t131 as an option. Similarly, looking at NT486 \u2192 't363', but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe NT487's production is via another route. Let me look at NT487's productions:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486. So to get t131, we'd need to have NT103 produce 't131', but looking at NT103's productions, it's NT673 and NT964. Then NT673 \u2192 t848, NT964 \u2192 t640. So that doesn't get us t131 either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way that combining the outputs from NT487 and NT993 can result in the string? But given that the string starts with t131, which seems impossible because NT487 as per the productions doesn't produce that. So maybe the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar. Looking again, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486. NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964. NT673 \u2192 t848. NT964 \u2192 t640. So, the combination would be t848 t640 from NT487, and then NT993 produces 't444' (NT993 \u2192 t444). So the string should start with t848 t640 t444, but in reality, the string starts with t131, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-568","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a list of production rules where each non-terminal on the left expands into exactly two non-terminals on the right. That makes sense for CNF, which requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals (or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in this case, all seem to be two non-terminals). Wait, no, actually, CNF can allow productions where one of the two is a terminal, but the right-hand side must be two symbols in total. Here, most of them are non-terminals, but I see some right-hand sides have terminals like 't640', but actually, looking again, many are two non-terminals but some are two terminals? Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the productions are all of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except for the ones where the right-hand side starts with a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, like NT487 -> NT103 NT486, etc. Then towards the end, I see rules like NT588 -> 't37', which is a terminal, and NT990 -> 't817', etc. So some production rules have terminals on the right-hand side. That seems okay because in CNF, the productions can have terminals, as long as the left-hand side is a non-terminal and the right-hand side has either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, no. In CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, every production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, either non-terminals or terminals. So yes, it's in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nNow, the target string is: `t640 t378 t98 t14 t637 t30 t217 t593 t592 t535 t689 t30 t131 t131 t467 t237 t467 t573 t777 t37 t466 t817 t378 t592 t637 t573 t777 t131 t14 t467 t444 t535 t372 t467 t14 t372 t237 t593 t804 t30 t555 t892 t640 t98 t98 t804 t37 t37 t555`.\n\nWait, that's a long string with many tokens. Each token is separated by a space, so it's a list of terminals.\n\nThe task is to determine if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string can give us some initial clues. In a CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the length of the derivation tree branches exponentially. Starting from the start symbol S, the number of symbols in the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string:\n\nLet me count sequentially:\n\n1. t640\n2. t378\n3. t98\n4. t14\n5. t637\n6. t30\n7. t217\n8. t593\n9. t592\n10. t535\n11. t689\n12. t30\n13. t131\n14. t131\n15. t467\n16. t237\n17. t467\n18. t573\n19. t777\n20. t37\n21. t466\n22. t817\n23. t378\n24. t592\n25. t637\n26. t573\n27. t777\n28. t131\n29. t14\n30. t467\n31. t444\n32. t535\n33. t372\n34. t467\n35. t14\n36. t372\n37. t237\n38. t593\n39. t804\n40. t30\n41. t555\n42. t892\n43. t640\n44. t98\n45. t98\n46. t804\n47. t37\n48. t37\n49. t555\n\nSo that's 49 tokens. Let's check if 49 is of the form 2^n -1.\n\nWait, the number of symbols in a CNF derivation starting from S would be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. So, for example, if we start with S, which is a single non-terminal, the first application of productions would replace S with two symbols, making the string length 2. Next step would have 4, then 8, and so on.\n\nSo, the string length must be 2^n for some n. Let's check if 49 is a power of two.\n\n2^5 = 32, 2^6 =64, so 49 is between 32 and 64, but it's not a power of two. So, 49 is not equal to any 2^n. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the grammar in CNF results in string lengths that are powers of two. 49 is not a power of two, so the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the tokens.\n\nCounting again: 49? Hmm, let me list them:\n\n1. t640\n2. t378\n3. t98\n4. t14\n5. t637\n6. t30\n7. t217\n8. t593\n9. t592\n10. t535\n11. t689\n12. t30\n13. t131\n14. t131\n15. t467\n16. t237\n17. t467\n18. t573\n19. t777\n20. t37\n21. t466\n22. t817\n23. t378\n24. t592\n25. t637\n26. t573\n27. t777\n28. t131\n29. t14\n30. t467\n31. t444\n32. t535\n33. t372\n34. t467\n35. t14\n36. t372\n37. t237\n38. t593\n39. t804\n40. t30\n41. t555\n42. t892\n43. t640\n44. t98\n45. t98\n46. t804\n47. t37\n48. t37\n49. t555\n\nYes, 49 tokens. 49 is odd and not a power of two. So it's impossible for a string generated by a CNF grammar to have 49 symbols because each step doubles the number of symbols, starting from 1.\n\nTherefore, without even looking at the specific symbols, the string length already tells us it's impossible. So the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step because it's a bit overwhelming at first glance.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol should not be on the right-hand side of any production. The grammar provided starts with S, so that's good.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and its production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string needs to be derived starting from S, and each step must follow the productions.\n\nThe input string is: t14 t892 t466 t593 t637 t817 t777 t378 t573 t804 t237 t573 t467 t592 t14 t535 t378 t640 t14 t535 t131 t573 t467 t378 t237 t466 t30 t804 t467 t573 t817 t217 t98 t593 t237 t592 t37 t372 t14 t444 t848 t363 t689 t592 t378 t278 t378 t237 t237.\n\nThat's a long string with many tokens separated by spaces. Each token is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the idea is to parse this string using the given grammar, starting from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a dynamic programming approach like CYK could be good, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can try to see if each part of the string can be generated by the given rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string can be decomposed according to the production rules.\n\nLet me first list out all the productions to see what non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nStarting from S, we get S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, the string must begin with sequences that can lead to NT487 and NT993.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT487:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nSimilarly, NT993 \u2192 NT990 NT697 or NT351 NT409.\n\nWait, but let me correct that. Actually, the productions are:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\nNT951 -> NT147 NT951 \u2014 Wait, that seems recursive, maybe a typo? Or perhaps it's a production to something else. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT946 -> NT256 NT833\nNT195 -> NT278 NT588\nNT60 -> 't637'\nNT256 -> 't98'\nND0 -> NT10 ...\nWait no, perhaps the string includes 't363', 't569', etc.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long, so perhaps it's better to start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t14. Let's see where t14 comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT951 \u2192 't466' (from earlier lines: NT951 -> 't466')\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT951 \u2192 't466' is one of the productions, so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the productions, NT951 has a production to 't466', and also to something else? Wait, let me check the production list again.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided a long grammar with multiple productions. It's going to be a bit time-consuming, but let's see.\n\nLooking for 't14' in the productions, I find that NT103 \u2192 't848' and also NT103 is used in NT951 \u2192 't466' or no? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, the user might have listed a lot of productions that result in terminals, such as:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't637',\nNT256 \u2192 't98',\nNT10 \u2192 't147' in one production, but wait, perhaps 't14' is a terminal generated by some NT.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT990 \u2192 't817' (from line: NT990 -> 't817')\nWait, wait, no, line says NT990 -> 't817', no, wait: looking at the list, line says NT990 \u2192 't817' \u2014 so that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT367 \u2192 't30', NT993 \u2192 't444', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nNT951 \u2192 't466'.\n\nWait, looking for where 't14' is a terminal.

But perhaps 't14' is generated by another NT.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the production NT990: NT990 \u2192 't817'. So, 't817' is a terminal generated by NT990.\n\nWait, but in the string, there is a 't14', so perhaps it's generated by some NT.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-577","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. The grammar consists of multiple production rules, each starting with 'NT' followed by two other non-terminal symbols. Each rule has two options separated by an arrow. So, for example, S -> NT487 NT993. That means S can be replaced by joining NT487 and NT993.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t444 t466 t98 t467 t640 t535 t593 t217 t237 t535 t593 t466 t237 t378 t14 t573 t817 t592 t363 t817 t689 t592 t637 t37 t804 t592 t466 t804 t804 t804 t98 t466 t848 t804 t535 t637 t892 t378 t131 t237 t278 t217 t363 t278 t30 t363 t30 t555 t804 t14`.\n\nI think my approach should be to check each token in the string and see if it can be derived by the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is at most two non-terminals, so each step replaces two tokens with one, but in this case, the string seems to have a mix of terminal and non-terminal symbols, but wait\u2014no, actually, looking at the productions, each non-terminal is expanded into either another pair of non-terminals or a terminal token like 'tXX'.\n\nWait, so each rule on the left side (like NT9 -> NT60 NT530) produces the tokens on the right side. So, for example, NT9 expands to NT60 and NT530, which could then be terminals or other non-terminals. So the idea is to see if the string can be built step by step using these rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules. Each rule application would replace two non-terminals with a terminal and possibly another non-terminal. Wait, no, each rule expansion is of a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each rule is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz. So each production expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals. That means every step in the derivation will increase the number of symbols by one since two non-terminals become one (but they are terminal or non-terminal). Wait, no, because two non-terminals are replaced by two non-terminals, so the count remains the same. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal is replaced by a terminal when it's on the right side of a production. For example, NT487 can be replaced by 't488' or something else, based on the productions. Wait, no\u2014the productions have non-terminals on the RHS as well, except some seem to have terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions: for instance, NT487 -> NT103 NT486, NT487 also has another option: NT933 NT389. So each of these non-terminals are replaced by two non-terminals, unless one of them is a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, let me look closely. For example, NT185 -> NT990 NT697. Then NT990 -> NT367 NT951, and NT964 -> 't777', right? Wait, no. Looking at NT60's production: NT60 -> 't637' and also -> 't573'. So NT60 can expand to either 't637' or 't573'. Similarly, NT446 -> 't636' or 't226'.\n\nSo some of these non-terminals are terminals already. So the grammar is such that when a non-terminal is replaced, it can produce either another non-terminal or a terminal. So each step in the derivation can reduce the number of non-terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production is left to non-terminal and has two symbols on the right. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a mix). But in this case, some of those are terminals.\n\nSo the string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols. So, to parse it, we need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut how do I determine that? Maybe I can try to build a derivation tree starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a context-free grammar parsing problem, trying to reduce the string to the start symbol using the productions, step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to do that.\n\nGiven that all non-terminals on the right side of the productions have two symbols, it's a binary tree structure. Each step in the parsing would involve finding a substring in the string that matches the production of a non-terminal, then replacing those two symbols in the string with the other non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I can model it as a reduction. Let's try to find the leftmost occurrence of a non-terminal that can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, but the grammar's productions can have terminals as well as non-terminals as the right-hand side. So, perhaps the correct approach is to look for non-terminals in the string and see if they can be replaced.\n\nBut wait, the given string is a concatenation of terminals, so perhaps the derivation starts from the start symbol S and the string represents the sequence of terminals that S can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is to list all the non-terminals and see if they can be formed through the productions, and then see if the string can be built from the start symbol.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. But since I'm not too familiar with that, and given that the grammar is provided with the production rules, perhaps a better way is to traverse the string and see if it can be divided into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a recursive descent parser for this grammar. I can write functions for each non-terminal, trying to match the corresponding productions.\n\nLet me start by listing all the productions and terminals:\n\nThe productions are:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\nNT226 -> NT85 NT530\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\nNT185 -> NT990 NT697\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486\nNT487 -> NT933 NT389\nNT351 -> NT10 NT217\nNT85 -> NT185 NT347\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT697 -> NT351 NT409\nNT147 -> NT367 NT591\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\nNT530 -> NT60 NT446\nNT10 -> NT147 NT951\nNT833 -> NT9 NT894\nNT569 -> NT195 NT588\nNT446 -> NT636 NT226\nNT389 -> NT569 NT756\nNT588 -> 't37'\nNT946 -> 't131'\nNT195 -> 't278'\nNT60 -> 't637' or 't573'\nNT256 -> 't226'\nNT60 -> 't573'\nNT256 -> 't98' [Wait, no, let me check the production for NT256]\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t217 t689 t444\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. It consists of a series of productions where each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow expands into two other non-terminals or directly into a terminal. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT487, NT993. So the final string should be formed by expanding these non-terminals through the productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t217 t689 t444\". This string is a sequence of three 't's followed by numbers. The task is to check if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the string: it's a sequence of three literals separated by spaces. In CNF, it's implied that the entire sequence is a single string without spaces, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we can consider the tokenization as each 't' followed by a number is a single terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in many cases, each token would be a separate terminal. So each 't' followed by a number is a single terminal, meaning each is a separate symbol. However, for the purpose of constructing the parse tree, each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers correspond to the non-terminals that expand into it.\n\nSo, to generate the string \"t217 t689 t444\", each of these terminals must be derived from some non-terminal that eventually expands into a terminal. Let's look at each terminal:\n\n1. t217: Looking at the grammar, I see that NT990 -> t817, and NT367 -> t30, among others. But where does 217 come from?\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that NT217 appears twice: once as NT217 -> t467 and another as NT217 -> t592. So NT217 can produce either 't467' or 't592'. So t217 isn't directly a production. Maybe 217 is part of some other non-terminal's production that eventually leads to it.\n\nLooking further, I see NT217 in multiple places. Wait, in the first look, I thought the productions were non-terminals producing other non-terminals, but let's check again.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT487 -> t103 or t933\n- NT697 -> t351 or t673\n- NT486 -> t363\n- NT60 -> t637, t573 (appears twice)\n- NT85 -> t185 or t347\nWait, I think I need to go step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string \"t217 t689 t444\" using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation would consist of combining two symbols at each step until we get the entire string.\n\nLet me first note that each 't' followed by a number represents a terminal, meaning we need each symbol in the string to be a terminal, which would require those non-terminals to expand into those terminals.\n\nBut stepping through, maybe each terminal in the string must be generated by a production. So:\n\n1. t217: Looking for a production that produces 't217'. Checking the grammar, I don't see any production that directly ends with 't217'. However, 217 is present in NT217's productions. So perhaps it's generated by expanding a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't217'.\n\nWait, let's find where 217 is a terminal. The only production that has a 't' and 217 is NT673 -> t640. Hmm, no. Looking through all the productions:\n\nWait, for example, NT673 produces 't640', which doesn't help. Wait, maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 217 is the result of a non-terminal that can produce a 't' followed by a number. Wait, but in the grammar, every production either goes into a terminal or another non-terminal. Hmm, perhaps it's helpful to look for whether the terminals in the string can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string \"t217 t689 t444\":\n\n- t217 needs to be from NT217, which can produce 't467' or 't592'. Neither is 't217', so that's a dead end.\n\nWait, perhaps 217 is part of another non-terminal's production. Let me check the productions where 217 is on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT217 -> t467 or t592.\n\nSo to get t217, perhaps 217 is derived from a different non-terminal's expansion. But in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that expand into 't217'. Therefore, it's impossible for 't217' to be derived from the grammar because there's no production that produces it.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string can't be generated, right? Because without a production that allows 217 to be a terminal, the string would include a terminal 't217' which isn't present in any production.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Maybe 217 is a result of some combination of non-terminals expanding into other terms. For example, perhaps a non-terminal X expands into NT... and that NT expands into 217 as a terminal. But in the given grammar, are there any non-terminals that produce 217?\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any NT that directly expands into 't217'. The closest is NT990 \u2192 t817, but that's not related. So unless 217 is produced by a combination of two non-terminals, which seems possible if a path exists through the grammar to produce 't217' as a terminal. But according to the given grammar, every production either expands into a terminal or another non-terminal, and I don't see any way to get 't217' into the string.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t217 t689 t444\" cannot be generated because 't217' is not an allowed terminal in the grammar. \n\nWait, but I should check all the terminal symbols. Maybe I missed something. Let me list all the terminal symbols in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are:\n\n- t217\n- t689\n- t444\n- t673\n- t256\n- t98\n- t573\n- t347\n- t593\n- t466\n- t555\n- t372\n- t237\n- t378\n- t964\n- t817\n- t467\n- t592\n- t363\n- t892\n- t444\n- t535\n- t217 again\n- t640\n- t894\n- t993.\n\nWait, I'm seeing t217 twice, which is consistent with the earlier observation.\n\nSo 't217' is a terminal symbol in the grammar, but based on the production rules, there's no way for a non-terminal to produce 't217' directly. Thus, the string contains a terminal that's not allowed, so it can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No', because one of the terminals in the string isn't present in any production of the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I don't need that here.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. So, I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by mapping each terminal in the string to possible production rules. Since the string is `t848 t640 t363 t444`, I'll look for each of these in the grammar.\n\n1. **t848**: Looking through the productions, I see that `NT964 \u2192 t964` is one production. Hmm, wait, the string has `t848`. Is there a production that leads to `t848`? Scanning the given NTs: NT367 \u2192 t367. No, that's `t367`. Wait, maybe looking at the grammar more carefully, I notice that some non-terminals have been rewritten into terminals. Let's check each NT:\n\n   - NT964: `NT964 -> t964` (from the given rules)\n   - Is there a rule for NT848? Hmm, no NT is defined as t848. Wait, but in the string it's t848, which might come from NT367->t367? Or is there a way to derive `t848` from another NT.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the defined NTs are:\n\n- NT367 \u2192 t367 (from production NT367 is set to 't367')\nSo, t367 is from NT367.\n\nBut the string has t848. Looking through the rules again, I don't see an NT that directly produces t848. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nLet me list all NTs that have terminals:\n\n- NT964 \u2192 t964\n- NT636 \u2192 t636\n- NT389 \u2192 t689\n- NT588 \u2192 t37\n- NT946 \u2192 t131\n- NT195 \u2192 t278\n- NT60 \u2192 t637 \u2192 Also, NT256 \u2192 t98, and NT60 is used there\n- NT347 \u2192 t593\n- NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530 (so NT9 eventually ends up in t637 and t530, which would produce t637 and then t530, but I think those are broken down further into more NTs)\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe string has four symbols, which means the derivation should produce exactly four symbols, but each step in the grammar can produce two symbols at a time because all productions are binary (like A \u2192 BC) except when terminals are present (A \u2192 a). Wait, actually, in CNF, terminals can't have more than one terminal per production, so each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, but here, all terminals are single, except perhaps for some multi-terminals in the string.\n\nWait, no. The grammar is in CNF, so all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. Therefore, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and this continues until a terminal is reached. But in our case, some non-terminals have been rewritten directly into terminals, as per the given productions.\n\nSo, to break down the string into the grammar:\n\nThe string is `t848 t640 t363 t444`.\n\nLet me consider whether each t is a terminal derived from an NT.\n\nLooking at the given productions, each NT corresponds to a specific terminal. Let me list each t and see which NT it comes from:\n\n- t848: Looking for an NT that becomes t848. Scanning through, I see NT367 \u2192 t367, which gives t367. Similarly, NT964 \u2192 t964. So, no NT gives t848. But wait, is t848 part of a production? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t848. So, unless t848 is a terminal and there's a rule that directly has t848, which there isn't. Therefore, perhaps t848 is not produced by any NT in the given grammar, which would mean that the string cannot be derived from the grammar because it includes a symbol not in the grammar's terminals.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nLet me double-check all the NT productions:\n\nNT964 \u2192 t964\n\nIs there any NT that produces t848?\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n- No, I don't see any NT with production ending in t848.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t848, and since there's no NT producing t848, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe given NTs and their productions:\n\nNT487: produces t363 and t686? Let's see:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and also NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389.\n\nSo, from NT487, you can get sequences involving t363 or t933 and t389.\n\nWait, but the NT487 is part of the start symbol S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nSo, perhaps let me try to reach t848 through the NTs.\n\nLooking at NT367 \u2192 t367. NT964 \u2192 t964. So, those don't help.\n\nIs there a way that some combination of NTs could produce t848?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is built up through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace each symbol in the string and see if any NT in the grammar produces it.\n\nGiven the string:\n\n1. t848\n2. t640\n3. t363\n4. t444\n\nLet's check each:\n\n- t848: Looking through the given NTs, none of them seem to have t848 as a terminal.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, CNF means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) can be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT487 and NT993. So, the start production is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Both of these non-terminals are on the RHS. Next, each of these non-terminals has their own productions.\n\nI notice that each non-terminal eventually ends with a production that produces a single terminal string, like NT933 \u2192 t217, NT977 \u2192 t378, etc. So, the entire process is generating a terminal string by expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet's take the given string and list all the terminals: t217, t278, t37, t98, t637, t573, t777, t372, t237, t892, t444. There are 11 tokens, which means when fully expanded, the CFG should produce a string with 11 terminals. Let me check the number of productions in the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So, two non-terminals. Each of these will need to be expanded further. Let's see how each non-terminal relates to the string.\n\nLooking at NT487 \u2192 t363 via NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 \u2192 t363. Wait, that's one possible path. Alternatively, NT487 can go to other non-terminals, but the one that leads to t363 is through NT103 and NT486, which each lead to terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t217, which seems to come from NT951 \u2192 t466, but that's not matching. Maybe I should map each token to a non-terminal production.\n\nStarting from the string, perhaps I can reconstruct the derivation. Let's list the tokens: t217, t278, t37, t98, t637, t573, t777, t372, t237, t892, t444.\n\nI think each token must be generated by a production rule that directly outputs that terminal. So, for each token, I can note the non-terminal it comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n- NT217 \u2192 t467\n- NT278 \u2192 t592\n- NT37 \u2192 ?\nWait, looking at the grammar, perhaps NT37 isn't present. Wait, hold on: the productions given don't include NT37, but in the string, t37 appears. So maybe I need to check if NT37 exists or leads somewhere, but in the provided grammar, NT37 isn't present as a non-terminal, so perhaps this is a red flag.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. I don't see NT37 in the rules, but the string has t37. So that would be a problem because the grammar doesn't have NT37 as a non-terminal that produces t37. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n- NT951 \u2192 t466\n- NT217 \u2192 t467\n- NT487 \u2192 t363 (via NT103 NT486)\n- NT389 \u2192 t569 NT756, which then goes to t378 or others, but not t389.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. Let's consider the grammar and see which sequences of non-terminals can generate the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nNT487 must produce the first part of the string. Let's see what NT487 can go to:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nSo, NT103 must then produce t217 as per NT103 \u2192 t673 NT964 \u2192 t217 via NT673 \u2192 t848, which isn't the case. Wait, NT103 \u2192 t673 NT964 \u2192 t217. Wait, no, looking at NT103's production: NT103 \u2192 t673 NT964, and NT964 \u2192 t640. But wait, NT964 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So NT103 \u2192 t673 NT964, but then NT964 \u2192 t640. But in the given string, the first term is t217, which can't come from NT103's expansion. Hmm, something's off.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Let me make sure I'm parsing the grammar correctly. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking at NT487's first production: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486. So to get t363, we have to go through NT103 and NT486. Let's see:\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\nNT673 \u2192 t848 (if that's a terminal) but looking in the grammar, NT673 \u2192 t848. So NT673 produces t848 as a terminal. Then NT964 \u2192 t640. But wait, NT640 is not a terminal. Wait, no, NT964 has a production: NT964 \u2192 t640. So, yes, NT964 is a terminal. So NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 \u2192 t217 (from NT103) and t573 (from NT486).\n\nWait, in the string, the fifth token is t573, which might come from NT486. Let me see:\n\nNT486's production: NT486 \u2192 NT60 NT446.\nNT60 \u2192 t637, and NT446 \u2192 t363, but no, wait, looking at NT446's production: NT446 \u2192 t636 NT226 \u2192 t226?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me map this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t217, t278, t37, t98, t637, t573, t777, t372, t237, t892, t444.\n\nLet's try to see if each token can be matched to a terminal production.\n\nLooking at t217: It comes from NT951 \u2192 t466, but no, actually, looking at the grammar, NT217 \u2192 t467. So the production is NT217 \u2192 t467. So the string has t217, but wait, there's no NT217 in the rules. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see several NTx where x is 217, 278, etc. For example:\n- NT217 \u2192 t467\n- NT278 \u2192 t592\n- NT37 \u2192 ? Not sure, but in the given grammar, is there a production like NT37 \u2192 t37?\n\nWait, the user didn't provide any production for NT37 in the grammar. Looking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 t467\n\nYes, so I don't see any NT37 production, which would mean that t37 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to have t37 if the grammar doesn't have a production for NT37. Thus, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it includes t37 without a corresponding production.\n\nBut wait, the user's input includes t37, and according to the grammar provided, there's no production for NT37. So, that immediately makes the string invalid, so the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I remember that CNF has certain characteristics: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to follow that structure.\n\nThe string to check is: `t217 t278 t37 t98 t573 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892 t444`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Let's list the productions to see how symbols expand. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it expands to NT487 NT993. So S is a starting point, and two non-terminals follow it.\n\nNext, NT487 can expand into either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Similarly, NT933 is another non-terminal that can expand into NT990 NT697. This seems like a chain of non-terminals that eventually lead to some terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step. The entire string is composed of 11 tokens: t217, t278, t37, t98, t573, t637, t777, t372, t237, t892, t444.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals (like t217, t278, etc.) while others might be non-terminals that need further expansion. Wait, no, in the context of the grammar, the non-terminals are the ones on the left side of the arrows, like S, NT487, NT993, etc. When they expand, they produce other symbols, sometimes terminals, sometimes other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486, so if NT103 and NT486 are non-terminals, they might expand further, but some of them produce terminals, like 't637' (NT636 \u2192 't636'), which I see in the string.\n\nWait, actually, let me check which non-terminals produce which terminals. For instance, NT10 \u2192 NT147 NT951, then NT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591, NT367 \u2192 NT30, and NT591 \u2192 't804'.

Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions for NT409 \u2192 't555' and NT60 \u2192 't573', NT673 \u2192 't848', NT964 \u2192 't964'?\n\nLooking back, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at each production, the ones that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT103 \u2192 't673' wait, the production NT673 \u2192 't848' is one of the productions.\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between NT symbols and terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-142","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t217 t278 t535 t98 t637 t573 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t892 t444`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production except possibly the start symbol itself. Additionally, the grammar does not have any \u03b5 productions, and there are no productions where a non-terminal is expanded into a single terminal symbol in multiple ways.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that all the productions fit the structure of CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT487 NT993 is a production where S is replaced by two non-terminals followed by a terminal symbol. Similarly, each production either splits into two non-terminals or expands into a single terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the string given consists of a series of terminal symbols: `t217`, `t278`, `t535`, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the leaves of this tree match the given string in order. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production only splits into two parts, so the parse tree will be a binary tree. Each step of production will split the non-terminal into two parts until all are terminals.\n\nLet me list the string tokens and see if I can find the corresponding productions:\n\nThe string is: t217, t278, t535, t98, t637, t573, t777, t817, t378, t593, t278, t37, t892, t444.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\n1. The first token is t217. Looking at the grammar, t217 appears in NT217 \u2192 t467 or t592. Wait, no. Let's check the productions. NT217 has two rules: NT217 \u2192 t467 and NT217 \u2192 t592. So t217 must be a terminal or come from another production, but wait, in the given grammar, t217 is a terminal because the production NT217 \u2192 t467 and NT217 \u2192 t592. Hmm, no, wait: looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at NT217's productions:\n\nNT217 has two rules, one of which is NT217 \u2192 t467 and the other is NT217 \u2192 t592. So t217 isn't directly a terminal; it must come from another production. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check more carefully.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT217 has two rules: NT217 \u2192 t467 and NT217 \u2192 t592. So t217 is a terminal if it appears in the string, but in the given string, the first token is t217, which isn't present except in NT217 where it's part of the production. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nIn the grammar, I don't see t217 as a terminal in the productions; instead, NT217 is a non-terminal that produces t467 or t592. Therefore, if the string contains t217, that can't be correct unless it's part of the productions, but looking at the grammar, the only way to get t217 is from NT217, which isn't listed as a terminal. Wait, but the string has t217 as the first token. That seems impossible because according to the grammar, t217 is only in the productions of NT217, which are t467 and t592.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me look again. Oh, probably a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT217 has two productions: NT217 \u2192 t467 and NT217 \u2192 t592. So, t217 is a terminal, but in the given string, the first token is t217, which according to the grammar, should never appear as a terminal. So that's a problem. That would mean the string can't be generated because the first symbol isn't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the intended string starts with T217 (uppercase) instead of t217, but no, looking back, the string is `t217 t278...` so lowercase.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check NT217 again. The production rule for NT217 is: NT217 \u2192 t467, NT217 \u2192 t592. So that means t217 isn't a terminal but is derived from NT217, which produces t467 or t592, neither of which is t217. So that would mean the string cannot have t217 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the grammar wrong somewhere. Let me double-check. The grammar has the rule NT217 \u2192 t467 and NT217 \u2192 t592, so t217 is not directly representable as a terminal. Thus, the string starts with t217, which cannot be derived because it would require NT217 to produce t217, which isn't in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT217, the rules are:\n\nNT217 -> t467\n\nNT217 -> t592\n\nYes, so t217 isn't a terminal; it's only in the productions of NT217 as a destination of a production, but cannot be produced. Therefore, the string starts with t217, which is impossible, so the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check all the productions again to ensure I didn't miss t217 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT217 is a non-terminal that can produce t217. The productions for NT217 are both to terminals, t467 and t592. Therefore, the start symbol S must expand into NT487 and NT993, and each non-terminal must expand into terminals as per the rules. If at any point a non-terminal that produces t217 is encountered, but in this case, the string starts with t217, which can't be produced from any non-terminal because the only non-term that can expand to t217 is NT217 which only goes to t467 or t592.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check: for example, are there any non-terminals that directly produce t217?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT147 \u2192 NT367 NT591\n\nNT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368\n\nNT256 \u2192 NT446 NT946\n\nNT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n\nNT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n\nNT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446\n\nNT60 \u2192 t637\n\nNT217 \u2192 t467 and t592\n\nAh, wait a minute, there is a NT217, but not t217. The string has t217, which isn't in the productions. So that token cannot be generated by the grammar, making the entire string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is meant to have T217 as the first symbol, in which case the answer would still be No, because again, it's not derived from any non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the first token in the string is t217, and the grammar doesn't have a production that produces t217 from any non-terminal, the answer must be No.\n\nI think that's the key point.

{"custom_id":"request-148","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one non-terminal in the case of left recursion. But looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT487 NT993, which is a bit unusual because it has two non-terminals, but that's allowed since the start symbol can produce terminal symbols as well.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t217 t278 t37 t98 t637 t573 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t535 t892 t444.\n\nEach token in the string looks like 'tXX', where XX is a number, which suggests that each 'tXX' corresponds to a terminal symbol derived from a non-terminal. \n\nI need to see if the string can be generated by following the grammar's production rules step by step.\n\nStarting with S, it produces NT487 NT993. So, I expect the string to start with the symbols that NT487 and NT993 generate. Let's look at the productions for NT487 and NT993.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT487 has two production rules:\n1. NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n2. NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n\nSimilarly, NT993 is a terminal? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar, I see NT993 is on the right side of the production. Actually, checking the grammar:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I think I might have misread. It says S -> NT487 NT993, and then NT993 is defined as 't444' in the rules. So wait, actually, yes: S is replaced by NT487 NT993. So when S is expanded, it's two non-terminals: NT487 and NT993. Now, NT993 is a terminal because it's written as 't444' in the productions. Wait no, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, NT993 isn't a non-terminal, but actually, I think I misread the initial setup. The grammar starts with S, and each non-terminal is represented as NT followed by a number. So the initial S is NT487 and NT993. Then, looking into the productions for NT487 and NT993.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the productions are all of the form NTx -> NTy NTz. The only places where a non-terminal becomes a terminal are when, for example, NT636 -> 't777'. So, each non-terminal can either produce two more non-terminals or can produce a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the string we're evaluating starts with t217. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t217. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT367 -> 't30' and NT697 -> 't378', and NT964 -> 't640', and NT399 -> 't372', but specifically, looking for 't217', I don't see any production directly yielding t217. Wait, wait, hold on: one of the productions is NT951 -> 't466', but not 217. Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT60 -> 't637'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT60 -> 't573' (Wait, that's same as above, but perhaps a mistake)\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT217 -> 't467' (two different entries here: NT217 has two rules, but they both produce 't467'? So maybe a duplication)\n- NT409 -> 't555'\n- NT368 -> 't237'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT673 -> 't848'\n- NT217 -> 't592' (another rule for NT217)\n- NT951 -> 't14'\n- NT486 -> 't363'\n- NT894 -> 't892'\n- NT993 -> 't444'\n- NT588 -> 't535'\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n- NT697 -> 't378'\n- NT964 -> 't640'\n- NT990 -> 't817'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\nWait, looking at the string: it's t217 t278 t37 t98 t637 t573 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t535 t892 t444.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nThe first token is t217. So according to the grammar, which non-terminal can produce 't217'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT933 -> 't217' is one, and NT367 -> 't30' isn't. Also, looking again, for example, NT231 might produce, but no, the string doesn't have that.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n- NT933 -> 't217'\n\nYes, that's correct. So, t217 comes from NT933.\n\nBut then, NT933 must have been produced by some other non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT933 is a non-terminal in the left-hand side of a production. Wait, the grammar as given doesn't include NT933 as a production from another non-terminal. Let me check the grammar's production list.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT487 NT993\n\nNT487 has rules: NT487 -> NT103 NT486 or NT487 -> NT933 NT389.\n\nWait, so NT487 can produce NT933 and NT389.\n\nLooking at NT933, is it a terminal? No, because it's on the right side of other productions? Wait, no, looking at the list, NT933 only appears on the left side of a production. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT933 on the right side. Let me check:\n\nYes, the productions are all left-hand side, except for S. So NT933 is a non-terminal that can be produced by some other rule, but in the given grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal expands to NT933. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the list again:\n\nThe production rules are:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 | NT933 NT389\n\nNT487 ... continues.\n\nNT226 ... etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a production for NT933. Let me double-check:\n\nThe list is:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\n...\nNT226 -> NT399 NT368\nNT256 -> NT446 NT946\nNT756 -> NT256 NT833\n...\nNT933: The production for NT933 isn't here. So wait, does that mean NT933 cannot be a terminal, because there's no rule for it? Or perhaps I made a mistake; perhaps in the given grammar, NT933 is on the right side of some production.\n\nWait, wait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT933 isn't listed as a non-terminal that's been defined as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the given grammar has an error, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps NT933 is produced by another non-terminal. Let me check if any other non-terminals produce NT933.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nLooking for 'NT933 -> ...' in the list:\n\nI don't see any production for NT933. So perhaps NT933 is actually produced by NT226? Or some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again at the productions:\n\nIs there a production for NT399 -> something? Yes, NT399 -> 't372'.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892 t444.\n\nNow, looking at each production rule:\n\n- S -> NT487 NT993\n- NT9 -> NT60 NT530\n- NT226 -> NT85 NT569\n- NT256 -> NT446 NT946\n- NT756 -> NT256 NT833\n- NT185 -> NT990 NT697\n- NT487 -> NT103 NT486\n- NT487 -> NT933 NT389\n- NT351 -> NT10 NT217\n- NT85 -> NT185 NT347\n- NT389 -> NT569 NT756\n- NT697 -> NT351 NT409\n- NT147 -> NT367 NT591\n- NT226 -> NT399 NT368\n- NT530 -> NT60 NT446\n- NT10 -> NT147 NT951\n- NT833 -> NT9 NT894\n- NT569 -> NT195 NT588\n- NT446 -> NT636 NT226\n- NT103 -> NT673 NT964\n- NT591 -> 't804'\n- NT636 -> 't777'\n- NT389 -> 't689'\n- NT588 -> 't37'\n- NT946 -> 't131'\n- NT195 -> 't278'\n- NT60 -> 't637'\n- NT256 -> 't98'\n- NT60 -> 't573'\n- NT347 -> 't593'\n- NT951 -> 't466'\n- NT217 -> 't467'\n- NT409 -> 't555'\n- NT368 -> 't237'\n- NT399 -> 't372'\n- NT673 -> 't848'\n- NT990 -> 't817'\n- NT367 -> 't30'\n\nWait, I notice that NT60 has multiple productions, like 't637' and 't573'. So when NT60 is expanded, it can turn into either of those terminals. Same for NT487, which can be 't363' or 't389'. So in the string, every time I see a terminal like t217, I can check if it's produced by any of the corresponding NTs.\n\nLooking at the string: t217 appears once. Let's find which NT can produce t217. Looking at the production rules for NTs that have 't217' as a right-hand side. Checking the list, I see NT917? Wait, looking again, I think I might have missed. Wait, NT351 -> NT10 NT217. So NT217 is the one that produces t217 because in the productions, I see NT217 -> 't467'. Wait, no, looking at the end of the list: NT217 is in NT367 -> 't30' and elsewhere. Wait, wait, actually, looking through, the NTs that have terminals as RHS:\n\n- NT351 -> NT10 NT217 \u2192 I think I might have missed this earlier. Wait, let me recheck the grammar rules. NT351 -> NT10 NT217 \u2192 but that's a production into two NTs, but the string has terminal t217, so that can't be directly used. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string back into the grammar. The string has 18 terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So, each terminal in the string is the result of a production that is a single terminal, and the non-terminals are the ones that need to be further expanded.\n\nSo, starting from the start symbol S, which is NT487 NT993.\n\nLet's write down the process as a tree.\n\n1. Start with S: NT487 NT993\nEach non-terminal needs to be expanded.\n\nFirst, NT487: Looking at the productions, NT487 can be NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nSimilarly, NT993: Looking through the rules, I see NT993 \u2192 't444'. So NT993 produces 't444', which is a terminal, so that's easy.\n\nSo the first step: S \u2192 NT487 't444'. Now, we need to expand NT487.\n\nNT487 can be NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLooking at 't217' in the string. Wait, let's structure this properly. The string is t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892 t444.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to process the string backward or see if each terminal can be matched by some NT.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t217, then t278, etc., ending with t444.\n\nFirst, the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT487 NT993.\n\nSo the entire string should be generated by expanding NT487 and NT993.\n\nSince NT993 produces 't444' as a terminal, that's the last part. So the string up to the last 't444' should come from NT487.\n\nNow, NT487 can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLooking at the string, the next part after t444 is ... wait, no. Wait, the entire string is S's expansion, so S \u2192 NT487 NT993 \u2192 [expansion of NT487] [expansion of NT993] \u2192 ... so the first part is NT487's expansion, followed by 't444'.\n\nIn the string, the first part is t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892 t444.\n\nSo the last part is 't444', so that's the expansion of NT993. Then, the part before that must be the expansion of NT487.\n\nSo, NT487's expansion must generate the string t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892.\n\nNow, let's see: NT487 can be either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nLet's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486.\n\nWe need to see if the string starting with t217 can be split into two parts: the expansion of NT103 followed by the expansion of NT486.\n\nLooking for a split point. The string is: t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892.\n\nSuppose we split after the first part.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the production rules. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NTx, etc.) can expand into two non-terminal symbols or terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t217 t278 t535 t98 t637 t573 t777 t817 t30 t804 t466 t592 t555 t593 t278 t37 t892 t444\n\nI notice that all elements are either terminal strings (like t217, t278) or non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals. My goal is to follow the derivation steps backwards, starting from the string and breaking it down into productions.\n\nLet me start from the end of the string and work my way back to the start. The string starts with t217 and ends with t444.\n\nLooking at the string, the first step is to find which production ends with t217. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT591 expands to t367 NT591 \u2192 t367 NT591? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the productions for NT367 is: NT367 \u2192 t367 NT? Hmm, no, let's check the given grammar:\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't217' in the terminals. I see that NT217 has a production: NT217 \u2192 t467, and another: NT217 \u2192 t592. So t217 isn't directly a terminal but corresponds to NT217 \u2192 t467 or t592. But wait, the string starts with t217, which must be part of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider each part of the string and see if I can match them to productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, and in a CFG in CNF, the derivation tree will consist of a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, expanding to two children until terminals are reached.\n\nSo, starting from the entire string, I need to split it into chunks that match the productions.\n\nBut splitting it might be complex. Another approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings in CNF grammars. I can try to apply a similar reasoning.\n\nFirst, list all the possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal in the string.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string: t217, t278, t535, t98, t637, t573, t777, t817, t30, t804, t466, t592, t555, t593, t278, t37, t892, t444.\n\nEach of these terminals corresponds to a specific production rule of a non-terminal. Let me find which non-terminals produce each of these.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t217: Looking for a production rule where NT217 is on the left. From the grammar, NT217 appears in the production NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368, and also in NT591 \u2192 t367 NT217? Wait, no, I think I need to look up the exact rules.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal and find which non-terminal defines them.\n\n- t217: Check the productions. I see NT217 \u2192 t467 and NT217 \u2192 t592. So t217 is part of the derivation when NT217 is expanded. So, in the string, t217 must come from either t467 or t592, which are produced by NT217.\n\nWait, no, actually, t217 itself is part of the string, so perhaps it's the result of a terminal symbol in the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps t217 is the terminal symbol and corresponds to NT217 being expanded, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. In the grammar, each NT symbol is a non-terminal that can expand into other non-terminals or terminals. So if the string contains a terminal (like t217), it must come directly from a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT990 \u2192 NT389 NT391? Wait, no. Let me list all the terminals as produced by non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT60 \u2192 't637'\nNT256 \u2192 't98'\nNT60 \u2192 't573'\nNT347 \u2192 't593'\nNT951 \u2192 't466'\nNT217 \u2192 't467'\nNT951 \u2192 't14'\nNT486 \u2192 't363'\nNT894 \u2192 't892'\nNT993 \u2192 't444'\nNT588 \u2192 't535'\nNT933 \u2192 't217'\nNT697 \u2192 't378'\nNT964 \u2192 't640'\nNT990 \u2192 't817'\nNT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo, NT993 produces t444, NT588 produces t535, NT933 produces t217, etc.\n\nSo in the string, t217 must be the expansion of NT933, because that's the only production that directly yields t217: NT933 \u2192 t217 NT389. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT933 \u2192 NT389 NT217? Or is it the other way around? Let me check.\n\nLooking back: NT933's production lines. Wait, the grammar as given includes NT933 \u2192 't217'? No, looking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see NT367 \u2192 't30', NT147 \u2192 't804'? No, wait, the list:\n\nLooking for t217: the grammar has NT217 \u2192 t467 and t592, so t217 as a terminal must come from NT933, where NT933 might produce t217 directly?\n\nWait, looking for NT933: I see in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT147 \u2192 t804\n- NT487 \u2192 t30\nWait, actually, I think I might have misunderstood. The grammar is presented with all the productions, and each production is on a line. So, for example, NT367 has a production to 't30' as one of its rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT60 \u2192 't573'\n- NT256 \u2192 't98'\n- NT347 \u2192 't593'\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n- NT217 \u2192 't467'\n- NT951 \u2192 't14'\n- NT486 \u2192 't363'\n- NT894 \u2192 't892'\n- NT993 \u2192 't444'\n- NT588 \u2192 't535'\n- NT933 \u2192 't217'\n- NT697 \u2192 't378'\n- NT964 \u2192 't640'\n- NT990 \u2192 't817'\n- NT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nAh, I see. So, NT933 produces t217 as one of its options. So, whenever NT933 is expanded, one of its children is t217.\n\nSimilarly, NT588 produces t535, and so on.\n\nNow, back to the string. The string is a sequence of these terminals in order.\n\nI need to see if there's a way to derive this entire string by expanding the start symbol S. Since S \u2192 NT487 NT993, as the first production.\n\nSo, S expands into two parts: NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet me see what NT487 and NT993 produce.\n\nLooking at NT487's productions:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\nNT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo, NT487 can expand into NT103 and NT486, or NT933 and NT389.\n\nSimilarly, NT993's productions: From the grammar, NT99"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way of structuring CFGs where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has S as the start symbol. The string provided is a sequence of terminals, so it's a sentence, and I need to check if it's a valid derivation from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S directly produces NT487 NT993. So the string should start with NT487 and NT993. Looking at the string, it starts with t217 t278 t37 t98 t637 t637 t777 t817 t30 t804 t14 t467 t555 t593 t278 t37 t892 t444. Wait, that's a lot of t's followed by numbers. But the initial step from S is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, so the string should after S derive into those two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me parse the string correctly.

So perhaps each step reduces non-terminals towards terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this with a top-down parsing or backtracking, but that's complex. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either splitting into two non-terminals or generating a terminal. So maybe I can represent the string as a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, and leaves are terminals.\n\nBut let's break it down. The initial symbol is S, which must split into NT487 and NT993. So the first two parts from the string should come from these two, but let's see:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT487 NT993. Since S is the start, the string must start with NT487 and then NT993. The first part of the string is t217... which is a terminal. So perhaps NT487 is generating t217, and NT993 is generating the rest.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can check which non-terminals directly produce terminals.

Scanning through:\n\nLooking for 't' followed by something else:\n\nWait, maybe 't' is just part of a terminal. For example, 't14' is a terminal. Let me check if any non-tree directly produce 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, no. In the production rules given, I see:\n\nNT946 \u2192 't131' and NT516 is not there, but looking into the given productions, for example:\n\n- NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217\n- NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347\n- NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756\n- NT951 \u2192 't466' and 't14' is another terminal.\n\nWait, looking specifically, NT951 has two productions: NT951 \u2192 't466' and NT951 \u2192 't14'?\n\nWait no, let's check. The given productions include:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 NT467 NT591\n- NT217 \u2192 NT592\nWait, no, looking back. The given productions are:\n\nThe given grammar's productions are listed line by line, e.g., S \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nThen NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\n\nThen NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569\n\nAnd so on. So each production line is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking at each line, I need to see if the RHS is a terminal or a pair.\n\nFor example, the first one:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nThis is non-terminals, so S splits into NT487 and NT993.\n\nThen, NT9 \u2192 NT60 NT530\n\nAgain, two non-terminals.\n\nContinuing this way, until we find any NT that produces a terminal (a single terminal symbol, like 't278').\n\nSo, let's list all the productions where a non-terminal A is directly producing a terminal string (i.e., A \u2192 a):\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n- NT588 \u2192 't37'\n- NT446 \u2192 't98'\n- NT409 \u2192 't555'\n- NT933 \u2192 't217'\n- NT697 \u2192 't378'\n- NT990 \u2192 't817'\n- NT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nAdditionally, in NT951: NT951 \u2192 't466' and NT951 \u2192 't14' (wait, in the given grammar, does NT951 produce two terminals? Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided productions:\n\nSearch for NT951 \u2192 ... I see:\n\n- NT951 \u2192 't466'\n\nWait, that's one terminal. Looking further down:\n\nI see NT555: Is there an NT555? Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't555', in the given productions:\n\nWait, I see NT409 \u2192 't555'.\n\nAlso, NT951's production is in the given grammar as NT951 \u2192 't466' and I don't see another production for NT951. So perhaps NT951 only produces 't466'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other NTs:\n\n- NT446 \u2192 't98'\n- NT389 \u2192 't689'\n- NT588 \u2192 't37'\n- NT409 \u2192 't555'\n- NT933 \u2192 't217'\n- NT697 \u2192 't378'\n- NT990 \u2192 't817'\n- NT367 \u2192 't30'\n\nSo, now, the string provided is:\n\nt217 t278 t37 t98 t637 t637 t777 t817 t30 t804 t14 t467 t555"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. I'm given a grammar with a starting symbol S, and a string composed of various \"t\" followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. If I can, I'll say \"Yes\"; if not, \"No\".\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's all in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That helps because it simplifies the structure. Each non-terminal can expand into two other non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t535 t131 t573 t573 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t535 t892 t444`.\n\nI notice that each \"t\" followed by numbers corresponds to a terminal symbol. So each token in the string is a terminal. My job is to see if these terminals appear in the correct order through the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to backtrack from the string, applying the grammar's rules in reverse, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can produce the string. Alternatively, maybe I can build the parse tree from the string upwards. Let me consider how the grammar produces the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production for S is S -> NT487 NT993. So S always starts with NT487 and NT993. That seems straightforward. Let me check each rule to see where the terminals come from.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, some expand into terminals, others into two non-terminals. Let's see which terminals are used:\n\nNT487 -> 't363' (from the rules, NT487 can produce either 't363' or 't933 't389')\nWait, looking at the production for NT487: NT487 -> NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Then those non-terminals have their own productions.\n\nWait, let me list out the terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFrom the grammar, some NT rules directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT487 -> NT103 NT486 (but wait, NT103 produces 't673' or 't964'), or NT933 NT389. Wait no, looking at the given rules:\n\nWait, each NT has specific rules. Let me list the terminals each NT can produce:\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to create a mapping from NTs to their possible terminal strings.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules:\n\nFirst, S -> NT487 NT993. So both NT487 and NT993 must derive to some string that produces the terminal parts.\n\nThen each of these NTs will lead to some more NTs, until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me see which NTs directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT60 -> 't637' or 't573'\nNT256 -> 't98' or 't237'?\nWait, no. Wait, the rules are listed as:\n\nNT60 -> 't637' or NT217\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the rules row by row. Maybe I missed some. The original grammar is:\n\nS -> NT487 NT993\nNT9 -> NT60 NT530\nNT226 -> NT85 NT530\nWait, no, the original grammar probably has all the rules on separate lines.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all given.\n\nLet me look at the string. It's a sequence of t-terms: t217, t278, t535, t777, t817, t378, t593, etc. Each of these seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if this sequence is a possible derivation starting from S.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT487 NT993 according to the first production. So S can directly produce two NT-nonterminals: NT487 and NT993. So the first step is to get the sequence starting with NT487 and NT993, then each of those non-terminals will eventually derive to a sequence of t's.\n\nSo let's break it down step by step. The string starts with t217. Let me see which production ends with t217. Looking through the rules, NT226 \u2192 NT399 NT368, and NT399 \u2192 t372. Hmm, but that's not t217. Alternatively, NT217 has a production: NT217 \u2192 t592 and also previously, NT217 \u2192 t467. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, the rules list includes NT217 \u2192 NT467 (I think I missed that earlier). Let me confirm: yes, looking at the list, NT217 has two productions: \u2192 t467 and \u2192 t592. So NT217 can produce t467 or t592. Hmm, but the string has t217, which isn't directly a terminal from any of the productions I see here. Wait, did I miss any production where a nt leads to t217?\n\nWait, in the NT389 \u2192 t689 rule, but that's not t217. NT588 \u2192 t37, but that's not relevant. Let's scan all the NT rules to see if any produce t217 directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only t terms are listed at the end. Let's see all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT367 \u2192 t30\n- NT195 \u2192 t278\n- NT60 \u2192 t637 or t573\n- NT256 \u2192 t98 or t573? Wait, checking the list: NT256 \u2192 NT60 NT446 or NT60 NT946, but the terminal versions are in other rules. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal rules first.\n\nFrom the productions, the terminal symbols are:\n\n- NT195 \u2192 t278\n- NT487 \u2192 t363\n- NT894 \u2192 t892\n- NT993 \u2192 t444\n- NT588 \u2192 t37\n- NT933 \u2192 t217\n- NT697 \u2192 t378\n- NT147 \u2192 t367\n- NT530 \u2192 t60 (but t60 is also part of other rules, but in the string we have t60 as part of the sequence? Wait, no, the string doesn't have t60. It has t573 twice. Wait, let me check the string: yeah, there are t573 multiple times. Let me see.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar's terminal rules:\n\nNT60 \u2192 t637 or t573. Wait, actually, let's see the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT60 has two productions: \u2192 t637 and \u2192 t573.\n\nSo NT60 can produce either 't637' or 't573'. So in the string, t573 appears multiple times. So that's possible.\n\nNow, looking for t217. Scanning the terminal list, do any non-terminals produce t217? Let's check:\n\nNT399 \u2192 t372\nNT217 \u2192 t467 or t592\nWait, there's also NT933 \u2192 t217. Oh, yes, NT933 can produce t217. So if NT933 can derive to t217, then perhaps that's where the t217 in the string comes from.\n\nSo let's try to trace the string back to S.\n\nThe string starts with t217. So the first symbol in the string is t217, which is produced by NT933. So the first step is S \u2192 NT487 NT993, but perhaps NT993 branches into NT933 and then t217. Wait, but let me think about the steps.\n\nAlternatively, the first symbol is t217, so we need to find a production where a non-terminal A \u2192 t217. Looking at the grammar, only NT933 \u2192 t217. So to get t217 as the first symbol, we must have that NT933 is the first non-terminal in the derivation. But S starts as NT487 and NT993. So to get NT933 in the first position, perhaps NT993 must derive something that includes NT933.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to structure this step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t217, which must come from NT933 \u2192 t217.\n\n2. So the first part of the string is derived from NT933, which is itself part of S's production. But S is NT487 NT993. So perhaps after expanding NT487 and NT993, one of them is NT933.\n\nWait, no. The initial S is NT487 and NT993. So both need to be expanded. So t217 must come from either NT487 or NT993. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT487: according to the rules, NT487 can produce two options, but they all lead to further non-terminals, like \u2192 NT103 NT486 or \u2192 NT933 NT389. Wait, looking at the given rules:\n\nFrom the list:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nOh, yes, so NT487 can produce either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. So if the first part is t217, perhaps NT933 is part of that.\n\nWait, but the initial S derivation is S \u2192 NT487 NT993. So if NT487 is expanding into NT933 NT389, then NT487 could produce something starting with NT933. Let me see.\n\nSo let's imagine that in S's expansion, NT487 is replaced by NT933 NT389. Then, the leftmost part (NT487) starts with NT933, which produces t217. So the first token would be t217, which matches the string.\n\nThen, the next part would come from NT389. Let's see what NT389 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT389 \u2192 NT569 NT756.\n\nSo after t217 (from NT933), we'd have the next symbol coming from NT389. But in the string, after t217 comes t278, which is the second token.

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t217 t278 t37 t777 t817 t30 t804 t14 t592 t555 t593 t278 t535 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892 t444`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. All the rules here are either two-terminals or one-terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT487 NT993. So any valid string generated by this grammar must start and end with these two non-terminals, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't217', which is a terminal. So let's see which non-terminals produce this. Looking through the rules, I see NT217 \u2192 't217'. Similarly, the last token is 't444', and from the rules, NT444 \u2192 't444'. That's a good start because the start symbol S produces NT487 and NT993, and each of these must eventually produce a terminal string.\n\nNext, I'll try to build the parse tree starting from the root S.\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nSo I have two subtrees: one for NT487 and one for NT993.\n\nLooking at NT487, according to the rules, NT487 has two options: it can produce 't486' or 't933 t389'. In the string, after the initial 't217', which is part of NT217 (from earlier step), we have a long chain of terminals. Let's see where 't217' fits in.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't217', which is part of NT217. So how does that connect back to S? Let me trace this.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me outline the steps more systematically.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals (t217, t278, etc.) separated by spaces. Since it's a single string, we need to parse it as a single sequence of symbols.\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which splits into NT487 and NT993. So the string must be a concatenation of the strings derived from NT487 and NT993.\n\nSo the string should be something like (NT487 String) followed by (NT993 String).\n\nLooking at the string, it has 20 tokens. Let's see how they can split.\n\nBut before that, check each token against possible terminals.\n\nThe first token is 't217', which is from NT217 (rule: NT217 \u2192 't217'). So NT217 must produce this. In the rules, NT217 is only derived as 't217'. So any application of NT217 must only produce this terminal. Therefore, NT217 can't be part of a larger production; it's a terminal itself.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT217 is defined as producing 't217', meaning it can only generate 't217'. So if the string contains 't217', it's from NT217, and if it contains more non-terminals, they must build the rest.\n\nWait, looking again: The string starts with 't217', which is NT217. So perhaps the NT487 and NT993 must derive strings that start and end with specific terminals.\n\nLet me see the structure again:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nEach of these must derive a string of terminals. So the entire string should be the concatenation of two sequences: one from NT487 and one from NT993.\n\nLet's look at each part.\n\nStarting with NT487:\n\nRules for NT487 are:\n- NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486\n- NT487 \u2192 NT933 NT389\n\nSo both options start with two non-terminals. Let's see if any of these produce 't217' or other terminals.\n\nLooking at NT103: Its rules are:\n- NT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964\n- NT103 \u2192 NT60 \u2192 't637'\n\nWait, so NT103 can produce a terminal 't637' if it goes through the second rule. Otherwise, it splits into NT673 and NT964.\n\nWait, but NT964 is defined as 't640' (from NT964 \u2192 't640'?) Wait, checking the rules: Looking through, I don't see a production for NT964. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, the only 't' terminals are:\n\n- NT217 \u2192 't217'\n- NT278 \u2192 't278' (from NT85 \u2192 ... \u2192 NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697; then NT697 \u2192 NT351, etc. Wait, actually, NT85's rule is NT85 \u2192 NT185 NT347, then NT185 \u2192 NT990 NT697. Then NT990 \u2192 NT367 NT951; NT697 \u2192 NT351 NT409. Then NT351 \u2192 NT10 NT217. So NT351 can eventually produce NT10, NT217, etc. Wait, this is getting complex. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse-engineer the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t217. Let's see if that comes from NT217, so the derivation for NT217 must be 't217'.\n\nBut wait, in the rules, NT217 \u2192 't217' is a terminal, so that's it. So the production NT217 can only be rewritten as 't217', meaning that any NT217 must directly produce 't217'. So if the string has a 't217', it's part of a larger NT217 production, but since it's a single terminal, NT217 can't split. So any occurrence of NT217 in the derivation would only produce 't217'.\n\nWait, but in the context of the entire string, perhaps the string has 't217' as a result of NT217, but that might interfere with the rest of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t217 t278 t37 t777 t817 t30 t804 t14 t592 t555 t593 t278 t535 t131 t637 t637 t777 t372 t237 t892 t444.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 20 in total.\n\nStarting with NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into two parts: one from NT487 and one from NT993.\n\nSo the first part would generate the beginning of the string, then the second part would generate the rest.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try to walk through the parsing process.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT487 NT993\n\nSo the string must be (NT487 derived string) followed by (NT993 derived string).\n\nLet me look at NT487's rules:\n\nNT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nFirst option: NT103 NT486.\n\nNT103 \u2192 NT673 NT964 or NT60 (which is t637).\n\nSo NT103 can produce 't637' directly or as NT673 NT964.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't217', which is from NT217, but how does that connect? Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. The entire string is a single concatenation, so the initial NT487 must produce a sequence that starts with t217. But according to the rules, how does NT487 derive 't217'?\n\nWait, looking at NT487's rules, there's no way NT487 directly produces 't217' because its rules are either two non-terminals or combinations leading to non-terminals that produce other tokens.\n\nSo maybe the initial 't217' is actually part of a longer"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

In this grammar, I see that most non-terminals (NT) produce two other non-terminals, but there are some that directly produce a terminal string (like t217, t278, etc.).

Each step should take the first or last symbol of the remaining string and see if it matches any of the terminals in the grammar, then check if the parent non-terminal can produce that terminal along with the other non-terminal needed.\n\nLet's start by identifying all the terminals in the string: t217, t278, t37, t777, t817, t378, t593, t278, t37, t131, t637, t573, t777, t817, t30, t804, t466, t592, t555, t593, t278, t37, t892, t444.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some non-terminals have rules that produce a single terminal, like NT367 \u2192 t30, which is present in the string. So we can start with that.\n\nStart with t30: NT367 \u2192 t30. So the string starts with t30. That means the original non-terminal must split into NT367 and something else. But looking at the grammar, the higher non-terminals that produce NT367 are NT367 \u2192 NT399 NT368. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT367 \u2192 t30. So the initial production rule would have to be S \u2192 NT487 NT993, which would split S into NT487 and NT993. Then, each of those non-terminals will produce sequences leading to the terminals in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parse the string in parts.\n\nLooking for the longest possible matches from the start of the string. The first token is t217. Looking at the grammar, NT990 produces t817, but that's not helpful. Wait, NT367 \u2192 t30, so if the string is t30... that would match from somewhere down, but perhaps in the middle or end.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last token is t444. From the grammar, NT993 \u2192 NT487 NT486, and NT487 has production rules. Let me see NT486: from the grammar, NT486 \u2192 t363. And NT487 has two options: either NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. \n\nIf the last part is t444, which comes from NT993 \u2192 NT487 NT486, and then each of those needs to produce a terminal. Let's see: NT486 \u2192 t363, which is present in the string. So the last part would be t444 (from NT993), which requires NT487 \u2192 something that leads to t... and then t363.\n\nSo let's try to see the string's end: ...t592 t555 t593 t278 t37 t892 t444.\n\nLooking for t444, which is the result of NT993 \u2192 NT487 NT486. NT486 is definitely t363, which is in the string as t363. So the last part is:\n\nNT487 \u2192 t something, then t363. Looking, in the grammar, NT487 \u2192 NT103 NT486 and also NT933 NT389. NT103 \u2192 t673 t964. Hmm, no, because t444 would require another terminal, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to construct a leftmost derivation. Alternatively, I can try to match the entire string by splitting it into parts that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to split the string into segments that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt217 t278 t37 t777 t817 t378 t593 t278 t37 t131 t637 t573 t777 t817 t30 t804 t466 t592 t555 t593 t278 t37 t892 t444.\n\nFirst, let's see if the first part corresponds to any rule. Maybe t217 and something.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT217 \u2192 t592, but that's a production rule for NT217 \u2192 t592. However, the first token is t217, which is different. Alternatively, perhaps we're dealing with a larger non-terminal that produces t217.\n\nWait, no. The only way to get a t217 is if a non-terminal directly produces it. Looking through the grammar, I see NT147 \u2192 t367, but that's t367, not t217. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices.\n\nWait, no, the grammar defines NTx... Each rule is like NT... \u2192 a or NT... \u2192 NT... NT....\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446, which produces t637 and t98. Wait, no: NT60 \u2192 t637, and NT446 \u2192 t98? Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't637'\n- NT446 \u2192 't98'\n\nSo NT530 \u2192 NT60 NT446 would lead to t637 t98. But that's not matching any part of our string, which has t637 at position 14. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think recursively. Let's look for the first token, t217, and see if it's directly produced by any non-terminal, and then see if the rest of the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce t217? Scanning:\n\nLooking down:\n\n- NT147 \u2192 t367 \u2192 so t367 is produced by NT147.\n- NT217 \u2192 t592.\n- NT367 \u2192 t30.\n- NT399 \u2192 t372.\n- NT389 \u2192 t569.\n- NT331 (I don't think so) wait, maybe NT530, but earlier we saw that.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the non-terminals directly produce t217. That would mean we have to find a way to produce t217 via a series of non-terminals. Let me think.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569.\n- NT569 \u2192 NT195 NT588.\n- NT195 \u2192 t278.\n- NT588 \u2192 t37.\n\nSo NT569 \u2192 t278 t37. If that's the case, then could NT226 produce something that leads to t217? No, because NT226 \u2192 NT85 NT569, which produces NT85, then t278 t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe t217 is produced by NT217 \u2192 t592. But the string starts with t217, so if the first non-terminal is NT217, which then produces t592, but t592 is in the string as the next part. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nLooking at the string again: the first two tokens are t217 t278.\n\nIf NT217 produces t592, then we'd need t592 as the next token, but the second token is t278, which doesn't match"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar seems to follow this since every S and NT production has two parts.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. In the grammar, certain NT symbols produce a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT964 produces 't640', NT367 produces 't30', etc. So, each 't...' segment in the string corresponds to a production step where an NT symbol is replaced by that 't...' string.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol: 't217'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT217 can produce 't467'. But wait, NT217 also has another production: NT217 -> NT467. Or perhaps I need to check all possible productions for NT217.\n\nLooking at the grammar, actually, I see NT217 has two productions: NT217 -> NT467 and also (wait, looking back) the user input shows NT217 is rewritten as NT467, but later in the list under NT951: NT951 -> 't467' and under NT217, it's shown as NT217 -> NT467. So, to get 't217', wait, looking through the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't217'? Checking the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't217'. Hmm, that's odd.

{"custom_id":"request-345","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all the production rules are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. That helps because it might be easier to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t217 t278 t535 t777 t817 t30 t804 t466 t592 t555 t593 t278 t535 t131 t573 t573 t777 t817 t30 t804 t14 t592 t555 t593 t278 t37 t892 t444`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. The variables in the grammar seem to correspond to these, so each 't' followed by a number might map to a variable. For example, 't217' might come from NT217.\n\nI should start from the top-level symbol, which is S. Looking at the grammar, S produces NT487 NT993. So S breaks down into NT487 and NT993.\n\nLet's see if both NT487 and NT993 can produce the respective parts of the string. \n\nStarting with NT487: According to the grammar, NT487 can produce NT103 NT486 or NT933 NT389. Looking at the string, the first part after t is t217, which corresponds to NT217. Wait, but S starts with NT487 NT993, which would generate parts starting with t217 and t592, since NT217 is t217 and NT592 is t592. Hmm, let me see.\n\nWait, the string starts with t217, which could come from NT217, but looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT217 -> NT467 | NT592. So NT217 can go to NT467 (which is t467) or NT592 (t592). But in the string, the first few tokens are t217, which isn't directly an option. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has variables like NT217, which produce t467 or t592. But in the string, there are tokens like t217, which might not be directly produced by any variable. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Actually, looking at the grammar, some variables produce terminals. For example, NT217 -> t467 or t592. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT217 -> t467 or t592. But the string has t217 and t592, which aren't directly covered by any production rules I see. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's rules have variables starting with NT and ending with numbers. For example, NT217 is a variable, and it can produce t467 or t592. So if the string starts with t217, but NT217 doesn't produce t217, that might be an issue. Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the string tokens and map them to variables that produce them. Let's list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t217\n2. t278\n3. t535\n4. t777\n5. t817\n6. t30\n7. t804\n8. t466\n9. t592\n10. t555\n11. t593\n12. t278\n13. t535\n14. t131\n15. t573\n16. t573\n17. t777\n18. t817\n19. t30\n20. t804\n21. t14\n22. t592\n23. t555\n24. t593\n25. t278\n26. t37\n27. t892\n28. t444\n\nNow, I'll go through each token and see if it corresponds to a terminal from the grammar. For example:\n\n- t217: Looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces t217 from a variable. Let me check: NT217 -> t467 or t592. So t217 isn't directly produced. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me check the grammar rules again. I see:\n\n- NT217 -> t467 | t592\n- NT592 -> t573 | t573\nWait, no, NT592 can produce t573 from NT573, which is t573. So if the string has t592, that would come from NT592.\n\nWait, let me clarify: NT592 -> NT573, and NT573 -> t573. So t592 would come from NT592, which breaks down into NT573, which is t573. But in our string, we have t592 as token 9, 12, 22, etc. Wait, but looking back, do any variables produce t592?\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I don't see any variable producing t592 except perhaps via a path. Let's see:\n\nLooking for where t592 comes from, perhaps:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT592 isn't a target of any production, but perhaps through decompositions.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. Looking through the rules, I see NT592 might not be a terminal. Wait, no, NT592 is on the left side, and the rules for it are:\n\nNT592 -> NT573\n\nBut NT573 -> t573. So NT592 produces t573, so t592 isn't directly a terminal. That's confusing because the string has a token of t592, which isn't a terminal according to the grammar. That suggests that either I've made a mistake, or the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread something. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT producing t592. Instead, I see NT592 -> NT573, which then produces t573. Therefore, t592 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal, which means it can't appear in the string as is. The string has t592 as token 9, 12, 22, etc. So that's a problem. Unless I made a mistake in the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial input is incorrect, but assuming it's correct, the presence of t592 in the string can't be explained by the grammar because NT592 only produces t573 through another variable. Therefore, t592 can't appear as a terminal in the string generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me make sure. The rules are for variables like NT592, which can produce NT573, and then NT573 produces t573. So any occurrence of t592 in the string would mean the string is invalid because it cannot be produced directly by any variable.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains 't592' as a token, which isn't a terminal, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Thus, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
