{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string `t55` is generated by the given context-free grammar. First, I remember that context-free grammars are in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are non-terminals breaking down into other non-terminals and terminals. At the end of the list, I notice several rules that produce terminals, which are the leaves of the grammar. These are the base cases our string must match through a series of derivations.\n\nThe target string is `t55`. In CNF, the way to derive a string is by expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain. So, to get `t55`, we'd need a production that directly or indirectly leads to `t55`.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the last few lines have:\n- NT31 \u2192 't8'\n- NT51 \u2192 't18'\n- NT87 \u2192 't79'\n- NT31 \u2192 't8'\n- NT51 \u2192 't18'\nBut wait, checking again, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through the rules one by one.\n\nI see NT91 \u2192 't55'. Oh, that's crucial. So NT91 directly produces `t55`. So if we can derive NT91 from the start symbol S, then the string `t55` would be generated.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S. Let's look at the production for S:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nSo S breaks down into NT29 and NT46. We need to see if both NT29 and NT46 can be derived to eventually produce terminals that, when combined, lead to `t55`.\n\nStarting with NT29. Let's see what NT29 can produce. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT29 on the left-hand side except in S's production. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine all non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me list out all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't96' (though I'm not sure if that's correct; let me check again)\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n- NT40 \u2192 't80'\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n- NT71 \u2192 't54' (Wait, no, looking back: I think I might have misread NT70 \u2192 't54' as well as NT71, but I'm not seeing NT71 here.

Let me check all NT22 rules: there are two for NT22, one producing NT53 and NT45, and another producing NT92 and NT31. So it's ambiguous.)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the rules again more clearly.\n\nHere's the grammar list:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT40 NT87\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT49 NT55\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT56 \n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me get this straight. Each rule is separate, so:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n- NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n- NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n- NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n- NT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 (duplicate)\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n\nWait, so perhaps some are duplicates or conflicting.\n\nNow, to derive `t55`, we need to get to NT91 \u2192 't55'. So, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Let's see if both of these can be broken down into 't55' somehow.\n\nStarting with NT29: I don't see a production for NT29 except in the first rule of S, so I don't think NT29 has any production other than that. That seems odd. Maybe I missed it. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nNT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\nNT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\nNT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\nNT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 (again)\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\nNT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\nNT51 \u2192 NT25 NT87\nNT51 \u2192 NT40 NT87\nNT31 \u2192 NT49 NT55\nNT14 \u2192 NT56 \n\nWait, I'm seeing that NT22 is defined multiple times. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, NT53 NT45, and NT92 NT31. And another NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, which is a duplicate.\n\nBut for NT29, I don't see any rule other than appearing in S's production. That must be a typo; perhaps NT29 is defined elsewhere. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nAh, yes! I missed that. The rule NT29 \u2192 't53' is present. So NT29 is a terminal, producing 't53'. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 't10' is another terminal.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT46 \u2192 't53' 't10'\n\nBut our target is 't55', so that's not matching. But perhaps through other derivations, NT29 can be transformed to something else, leading to 't55'.\n\nWait, no. Because if NT29 \u2192 't53', then when S expands, it becomes 't53' 't10', which is 't53t10', not 't55'. So that doesn't give us the desired string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. If NT29 can derive to something that can eventually produce 't55', perhaps through NT91.\n\nBut if NT29 \u2192 't53', then S will produce 't53' from NT29 and whatever comes from NT46. So S \u2192 't53' (something). Let's see what NT46 can do. NT46 can be broken down into NT92 and NT25.\n\nNT92 \u2192 what?

{"custom_id":"request-2","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string `t71` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and I need to see if I can derive `t71` from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol is on the left, and the right side has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The S production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, to get `t71`, I need to see if I can break down NT29 and NT46 into their components, eventually leading to the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nLet's start with NT29. Looking through the productions, NT29 \u2192 NT8 NT53. So, I need to derive NT8 and NT53. Let me look at NT8 next. NT8's production is listed as NT8 \u2192 't4'. Hmm, so that's a terminal, which gives us the 't4' part of the string. Wait, the string is `t71`, not starting with `t4`. That's a problem. So if NT8 leads to 't4', but we have `t71` in the string, maybe I took the wrong path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT29 again. NT29 \u2192 NT8 NT53. Is there another production for NT8? Yes, it's only NT8 \u2192 't4'. So that gives us 't4', but in the string, the first part is 't71'. That can't be. Maybe I need to check if there's another way to get NT29 to produce something else that leads to 't71'.\n\nWait, looking back, is there another production for NT29? No, it only has NT29 \u2192 NT8 NT53. So that must be the way to go. So with NT29 being 't4' and NT53 leading to something else.\n\nLet's look at NT53. NT53's production is NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. So, I need to derive NT13 and NT55.\n\nNT13's production is NT13 \u2192 NT31 NT49. So, I need NT31 and NT49. Looking at NT31, its production is NT31 \u2192 NT49 NT51. Wait, that can't be right because that would create a cycle: NT31 \u2192 NT49 NT51, and NT49 would go to NT25 NT87, which seems to get more complex.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of starting from S, maybe I should see if `t71` can be generated directly. But according to the grammar, NT40 \u2192 't80' and NT40 is one of the productions on the right side of S.\n\nWait, looking at S \u2192 NT29 NT46. If NT46 can produce 't71', then perhaps that's the way. Let me check NT46's productions. There's NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT45, and NT46 \u2192 't10'. No, that's not helpful because we need `t71`.\n\nWait, let me check NT46 again. Oh, no, actually, looking at the given productions, I see that NT46 has a production NT46 \u2192 't55'. So that's a terminal. But I need 't71', not 't55'.\n\nLooking back, maybe I have to go through NT46 in another production. Wait, perhaps I misread a production. Let me check again:\n\nNT46: \n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT45\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n\nHmm, perhaps NT46 also can produce other non-terminals through some other path, but looking at the given productions, I don't see any other options for NT46 except those that produce terminals or other non-terminals that lead to terminals.\n\nBut if NT46 is supposed to produce 't71', that's not the case here. Wait, no, in the productions, I don't see NT46 producing 't71' directly. Let me check all the productions again. Hmm, looking through all the NT productions:\n\nNo, I don't see NT46 leading to 't71' directly. Maybe it's through some combination. Let me think about NT46 again. If NT46 can produce NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT45, and then 25 and 45 can produce other things.\n\nWait, NT25's production is NT25 \u2192 't73', and NT45 \u2192 't37'. So if NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT45, then that would lead to 't73' 't37', which is not 't71'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25. Then NT92 \u2192 't25' and NT25 \u2192 't73', so that's 't25' 't73' \u2192 not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire string. The string is `t71`. So, starting from S, we have S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, that's two parts: NT29 and NT46. If we can derive 't71', it must be from one of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT29 \u2192 NT8 NT53. NT8 is 't4', and NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. NT13 \u2192 NT31 NT49. NT31 \u2192 NT49 NT51. NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87. NT87 \u2192 NT55. Hmm, let's see.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT8 NT53.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't4'.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT31 NT49.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT49 NT51.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if it's leading me anywhere. Let's try the other production for S, but I think S only has one production: S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a production for NT46 that leads to a chain that includes 't71'.\n\nWait, looking back at the NT40 production: NT40 \u2192 't80'. But I don't see NT40 being used elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step:\n\n- The string is `t71`. So it's a single terminal, so we need a production that directly gives 't71'. None of the productions have that. So either there's a mistake, or maybe the string can be derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, but maybe it's produced through NT55 or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT40 NT91, NT55 \u2192 NT80, and NT55 \u2192 NT21. NT21 is a terminal maybe? Or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, NT91's production is NT8 NT71. So, NT91 \u2192 NT8 't71'. But then, if I have NT91, and NT8 is 't4', perhaps that's the way.\n\nWait, let me trace this:\n\nIf NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71.\n\nBut wait, NT8 \u2192 't4'. So NT91 \u2192 't4' 't71', which is 't4t71t', but that's not the string. Alternatively, maybe the reverse.\n\nBut the string is `t71`, which is just one 't71'. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar, none of the productions produce 't71' directly. So unless `t71` is the result of a longer chain, but given that it's a single terminal, it must appear directly.\n\nSince none of the non-terminals have a production that includes 't71', it's impossible for 't71' to be generated. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The productions are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. None of them have 't71' as a terminal. So it's impossible.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nThe string `t71` cannot be generated by the given CFG because none of the productions directly produce 't71'. All terminals in the grammar are either single-character strings, but 't71' is a multi-character string that isn't directly produced by any production.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nThe string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nStep-by-step explanation"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of a bunch of production rules, and the string is composed of two tokens: \"t35\" and \"t20\". I'll need to trace back from the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me recall the start symbol S in the given grammar. Looking at the production rules, S starts with NT29 NT46. So, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. That means any string generated by this grammar must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, looking at the string \"t35 t20\", it's two tokens separated by a space. I think each token corresponds to a symbol in the grammar. So, it's like NT35 NT20. Wait, but the grammar doesn't have NT35, does it? Let me check the production rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT35 isn't listed anywhere. Hmm. That might be a problem. If S can't produce anything ending with NT35, then the entire string \"t35 t20\" might not be generated. But let me not jump to conclusions yet. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the tokens correspond to the NTs.\n\nWait, maybe the T's in the strings are actually the terminal symbols, so \"t35\" would be a terminal token, meaning it's just a single symbol. So, each \"tX\" is a terminal. So, the string \"t35 t20\" is two terminal symbols: \"t35\" and \"t20\".\n\nSo, for the entire string to be generated by the grammar, the entire string must be derived from the start symbol through a series of productions.\n\nLet me start from the start symbol S. S \u2192 NT29 NT46. That means the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT46, which are written in the grammar as S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nSo, the string \"t35 t20\" would have to come from NT29 and NT46 each being expanded into some sequence of non-terminals that eventually produce \"t35\" and \"t20\" respectively.\n\nWait, but each of NT29 and NT46 have their own productions. Let me check what NT29 and NT46 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT29, I see: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So, NT29 can directly produce the terminal \"t53\".\n\nSimilarly, NT46 \u2192 't10' or multiple options. Let me check all productions for NT46. Looking back, NT46 has these rules: \n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT45\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 NT55 NT55\n- NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT67\n- NT46 \u2192 NT85 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 NT87 NT20\n- NT46 \u2192 NT55 NT10? Wait, no, looking at the rules, for NT46, one of them is NT46 \u2192 't10'. So, in fact, NT46 can directly produce 't10' as well as other combinations.\n\nWait, looking through again, the rule for NT46 is written as:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n...\nThen later,\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, maybe in the original list, I missed that. Let me make sure. Looking back, the list of rules includes NT46 \u2192 't10'. So, NT46 can be a terminal on its own.\n\nSo, in our string, after NT29, which produces \"t53\", but wait, in the string we have \"t35\" and \"t20\". So, how does this work?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again: the string is \"t35 t20\", which is two terminals. To generate this, we need the derivation to produce exactly these two tokens.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, NT29 must produce \"t35\" and NT46 must produce \"t20\". But does NT29 have a production to \"t35\"?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT29: it's listed as NT29 \u2192 't53'. So, NT29 can directly produce \"t53\", but not \"t35\". So, if the string has \"t35\" in it, and the grammar can't produce \"t35\" from any of its non-terminals, that would mean the string is not generateable.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: Maybe the NTs can produce multiple tokens, and the string \"t35 t20\" is the concatenation of two NTs. So, NT29 could produce \"t35\" but since NT29 can't, because NT29 only \u2192 't53', that would mean it can't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the string. Maybe the string is actually more than two tokens. Let me count the tokens in \"t35 t20\". It's two tokens, correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the S rule is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so to get \"t35\" and \"t20\", we'd need NT29 to produce \"t35\", which it can't, as per the rules. Since NT29 only goes to 't53', which is a concrete terminal. Therefore, any string derived from NT29 must end with 't53', but in our case, we have 't35' as the first token, so that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a production for NT29 that allows it to produce something else.\n\nLooking back at the production rules for NT29, I only see NT29 \u2192 't53'. There's no other production. So, the only terminal that NT29 can expand into is \"t53\". So, no, the string cannot start with 't35' because NT29 can't produce that.\n\nTherefore, since the string starts with 't35', and the non-terminal that's supposed to expand into that is NT29, but NT29 cannot, because it only can expand into 't53', the string \"t35 t20\" can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because maybe the entire string is supposed to be a single production. Let's check S's production again. S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string \"t35 t20\" would require that NT29 expands to \"t35\" and NT46 expands to \"t20\". But NT29 can't do that. So, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that the string is more than two tokens? The given string is \"t35 t20\", which is two tokens. So, I think it can't be generated because the required conditions are not met.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Specifically, in line 40, NT55 -> 't21'. But in line 1, the start symbol S is NT29 and NT46. So to get t21, it would have to come from a non-terminal that can produce 't21', which is NT55 in line 40.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, one of the symbols must be t21, which comes from NT55, so somehow, the derivation must lead NT55 to produce 't21', and somewhere else, maybe NT92 or NT22 must produce 't20' and 't96'.\n\nWait, the string is t21 t20 t96, which is three tokens, so it's the result of S deriving to three symbols. But S produces two non-terminals, so how does this string have three tokens? Unless each of those non-terminals expands into one or more 't' symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is three tokens, which suggests that S must derive into three symbols. But the start symbol S is S -> NT29 NT46, which are two symbols. So each of these can potentially expand into one or more symbols. But in order to get three 't' symbols, perhaps one of them expands into one 't' and the other into two, but I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nWait, let's think about how the expansion would work. Each production in the grammar can either be another pair of non-terminals or a 't' token. So the string has three 't's, so three 't's must be derived from the two initial non-terminals. So each 't' in the string must come from a production.\n\nHmm, this can be tricky. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is t21 t20 t96. So let's list them as three separate tokens: T1=t21, T2=t20, T3=t96.\n\nEach of these must be generated by some productions from the grammar.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT46.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar rules and the string I need to check. The string is `t25 t53 t54`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the non-terminals (like S, NT22, etc.) seem to eventually produce terminal strings. Chomsky normal form typically allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This grammar seems to follow that because each production either breaks down into two non-terminals or directly gives a terminal.\n\nThe string is a sequence of three terminals: t25, t53, t54. Since each t is a terminal, the derivation must start from the start symbol S and break down into these terminals.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, per the first production rule: S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So S must be split into NT29 and NT46. Therefore, the string should start with whatever NT29 produces and then whatever NT46 produces.\n\nLooking at NT29: According to the given grammar, NT29 \u2192 't53'. That's a direct terminal production, so when we have NT29, it generates 't53'. So the first part of the string should be 't53'.\n\nNow, the second part is NT46. Let's look at all productions for NT46. The rules are:\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nWait, looking again, there are multiple rules for NT46. Let me see all the NT46 productions:\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\nWait, did I miss some? Let me check:\n\nYes, under NT46, I see: NT46 \u2192 't10', NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14, and NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87. So four possible ways to expand NT46.\n\nOur string's second part is 't53', but according to NT46's rules, it can only directly produce 't10' or other combinations. 't53' isn't a direct production of NT46. So perhaps the derivation isn't possible from S \u2192 NT29 NT46 because NT46 can't directly produce 't53'.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let's see. The string is t25 t53 t54. So the breakdown would be S \u2192 NT29 NT46 \u2192 t53 (NT29) followed by something that gives t25 and t54. But if NT46 can't directly produce t25 or t54, but rather combinations or other terminals, maybe we need a deeper breakdown.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and NT46 breaks down further. So maybe after NT46 breaks down into more non-terminals, those can then produce t25 and t54.\n\nLet me see. For example, suppose NT46 breaks down into NT22 NT14. Then NT22 can break down further. Let's check NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31, NT22 \u2192 NT22 NT14, etc. Wait, perhaps each step gets more complicated.\n\nBut my string starts with t25, which is a terminal. So maybe the derivation is such that the first part is something that produces t25, and the second part produces t53 and t54. Wait, but in the initial S \u2192 NT29 NT46, NT29 gives t53, and NT46 has to give the rest. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check the grammar again. There are multiple rules, so perhaps NT46 can produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce t25 and t53.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the parsing needs to have the string split into three parts, each generated by a terminal. The grammar must derive the string in such a way that each terminal in the string is generated by a production step that leads to the end, with no non-terminals left.\n\nBut let's think about the breakdown step by step. Let's consider S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So S is split into NT29 and NT46. NT29 \u2192 t53 directly. So the string starts with t53, and then NT46 must generate the remaining two parts: t25 and t54. But wait, the string is t25 t53 t54, so after the initial t53, we have another two terms. So perhaps the NT46 produces more non-terminals, but the way the string is presented, the entire string is t25 t53 t54, which would imply that the NT46 must produce t25 and then t54, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I got the initial breakdown wrong. Let's look again. The string is t25 t53 t54. So perhaps the way it breaks down isn't S \u2192 NT29 NT46 but something else. No, according to the grammar, S starts with NT29 NT46.\n\nSo let me outline the possible derivations step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\n2. NT29 \u2192 't53'.\n\n3. Now, NT46 needs to produce 't25' and 't54' as the next two terminals. But how? Looking at NT46's productions, directly, it can produce only terminal 't10' or combinations of non-terminals, but not 't25' or 't54' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar for NT46 again.\n\nThe productions under NT46 are:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo none of these directly produce 't25' or 't54' except in combinations. So how can NT46 produce just 't25' or 't53'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's consider that the entire string must be generated from S, meaning that the string is a concatenation of the terminals produced by NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo the string is t25 t53 t54. So perhaps S \u2192 NT29 NT46, but NT29 produces 't53' and NT46 produces 't25 t54'.\n\nBut for NT46 to produce two terminals, it must expand into a non-terminal that itself expands into two terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at NT46's productions, they're all either direct terminals or two non-terminals. So to produce two terminals, the NT46 would need to expand into non-terminals that each then expand into a terminal.\n\nWait, in that case, NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14. Then, NT22 would be part of the breakdown.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14.\n\nThen, we have to see if NT22 and NT14 can produce the remaining t25 and t54.\n\nWait, but after NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14, the string after t53 would be the expansion of NT22 and NT14, which are separate.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nAfter T53, the next part is the result of NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14. Now, these NT22 and NT14 must now produce t25 and t54.\n\nSo NT22 needs to produce t25. Let's check NT22's productions.\n\nNT22 can be broken down as:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT22 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n\nNone of these directly produce 't25'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps NT53 is produced by another rule.\n\nWait, NT53 is not the same as NT25. NT25's production is NT25 \u2192 't73', NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, etc.\n\nWait, maybe this path isn't leading me anywhere. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87, which would require further breakdown.\n\nSo after t53, NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87.\n\nThen, NT25 \u2192 't53'?

{"custom_id":"request-35","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t55 t21 t73 t20\". I'm a bit rusty, but let's go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided shows all the production rules. My string is made up of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46 (S \u2192 NT29 NT46). So, both NT29 and NT46 are non-terminals that need to be resolved.\n\nLet's break down each part of the string: \"t55\", \"t21\", \"t73\", \"t20\". These correspond to specific non-terminal productions.\n\nStarting with NT29 \u2192 't53'. According to the grammar, NT29 is a terminal 't53'. So, when we expand S, the first part (NT29) becomes 't53'. Now, the string we need is \"t55 t21 t73 t20\". That means the second part of S must generate \"t21 t73 t20\".\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The entire string is \"t55 t21 t73 t20\". So, the first part of S must generate \"t55\", and the second part must generate \"t21 t73 t20\". Wait, or is it that both parts must combine to form the string?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the entire string is the concatenation of what NT29 and NT46 generate. So, let's see: if NT29 must produce 't55' and NT46 must produce 't21 t73 t20', or something else.\n\nWait, let me check each non-terminal:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'? No, earlier I thought NT29 \u2192 't53', but let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 is defined as 't53' (NT29->'t53'), right? Yes. So S starts with t53, but our target string starts with t55. That can't be, right? So that's a problem. If S produces NT29 NT46, and NT29 is 't53', but the string starts with t55, which is from another NT.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me check S again. The start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, when derived, it'll be (NT29's string)(NT46's string). So the target string is t55 t21 t73 t20. So, the first part of S's derivation should be t55, and the second part should be t21 t73 t20. Or perhaps the second part breaks down further.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because S produces two non-terminals, so both parts must be strings produced by those non-terminals. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT29 and NT46 produce.\n\nSo, the target string is four terminals: t55, t21, t73, t20. So NT29 must produce t55, and NT46 must produce t21 t73 t20. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT29: the production is only NT29 \u2192 't53', which is a single terminal. So NT29 can only produce 't53'. But our target string starts with 't55', which is from another non-terminal.\n\nWait a minute, that's a contradiction. S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the first part, NT29, must produce 't55' to match the first 't55' in the target string. But NT29's production is only 't53'. That's impossible. So the first part cannot be 't55', meaning that the string cannot be generated. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misreading the non-terminals. Let me double-check. Let's list all the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT25 \u2192 NT92 NT25 (Wait, no, the grammar seems to have multiple entries for some NT's. For example, NT22 has two production rules: NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 and NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31. So each NT can have multiple options.\n\nSo, for NT29, the grammar says NT29 \u2192 't53'. So it can only produce 't53'. Therefore, if the target string starts with t55, which comes from another NT.\n\nSame for NT46: looking at the grammar, NT46 has two production rules: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 and NT46 \u2192 't10'. So NT46 can produce 't10' directly or the combination of NT92 and NT25.\n\nAh, so perhaps NT29 isn't the first part. Wait, no, S is NT29 NT46, so the entire string is (NT29's string)(NT46's string). So the first part must be NT29's string, which is 't53', but the target starts with 't55', so that's a problem. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol is wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the entire NT46 subtree to generate the first part? No, S must split into NT29 and NT46. So first part is NT29, which is 't53' only, and the second is NT46. So the first symbol must be t53, but the target starts with t55, which is from NT25. Therefore, it's impossible for S to produce a string starting with t55.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Some of these productions directly lead to terminal symbols, ending the derivation process. For example, NT8->'t8', which means 't8' is a terminal string.\n\nThe given string has four terminals: t87, t74, t96, t79.

So each line is an NT (with some letters, perhaps the number) -> two parts. For example, NT46 is produced as NT92 and NT25.\n\nNow, focusing on the string: `t87 t74 t96 t79`.\n\nLet's break it down into four parts: t87, t74, t96, t79.\n\nBut wait, the production starts with S->NT29 NT46. So the string should be the concatenation of NT29's derivation and NT46's derivation.\n\nSo first part: t87 is likely part of NT29. Let me check NT29: from the grammar, NT29->'t53'. Wait, wait: yes, looking at the grammar, NT29->'t53'. So NT29 directly expands to 't53', which is a terminal. But the string starts with t87, not t53. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I have the NT29 wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT29 is part of S's production. S->NT29 NT46. So S produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking up NT29's production: in the grammar list, I see NT29->'t53'. So NT29 expands to 't53' directly.\n\nBut the first symbol in our string is 't87', which doesn't match 't53'. That suggests that 't87' might not be part of the derivation from NT29, but perhaps from NT46. But S's production is NT29 and NT46. So S -> nt29 nt46, so the string is nt29 expansion followed by nt46 expansion.\n\nWait, but the string is t87 t74 t96 t79. So maybe it's split as t87 t74 and then t96 t79? Or perhaps each part is from each non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the productions for NT29 and NT46 each can produce multiple terminals, and the string is a combination.\n\nWait, but S's production is S->NT29 NT46, which are two separate non-terminals. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo in the string `t87 t74 t96 t79`, it's four terms, but S would produce two parts. Hmm, but the string has four terminals. So perhaps that can be split into two parts: [t87 t74] and [t96 t79], each corresponding to the expansion of NT29 and NT46 respectively.\n\nBut let me see: NT29 -> 't53' as per the grammar, but in the string, the first part is t87 t74.

That would imply that either the grammar isn't correct, or the string is not in the language, because t87 isn't part of NT29's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in reading the NT29 production. Wait, looking again:\n\nYes, yes: NT29->'t53'\n\nSo NT29 can't produce t87.

{"custom_id":"request-55","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out step by step whether the string can be derived from the grammar. \n\nLet me start by understanding the grammar and the string we're dealing with. The grammar consists of production rules for various non-terminals (like S, NT29, NT22, etc.), all of which eventually produce terminals like 't10', 't73', and so on. The string to evaluate is `t10 t73 t31 t95 t37`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string has five tokens separated by spaces. So, the string is a sequence of these terminals: t10, t73, t31, t95, t37. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT29 NT46. So, S -> NT29 NT46. That means the start symbol S leads to two non-terminals, which must be expanded into the terminals. So, to generate the string we have, each of these non-terminals must derive into the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nThe string we have is five tokens, which means that the initial derivation from S must produce a string that splits into these five terminals. But looking at the productions, I think I need to see if each of these terminals can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminals again for clarity:\n\n1. t10\n2. t73\n3. t31\n4. t95\n5. t37\n\nLet's check each terminal and see which production rules they come from.\n\n1. t10: Looking at the grammar, NT46 -> t46 is sometimes present. Wait, looking through, I see that NT46 has rules like -> t10 (from the second rule: NT46 -> NT31 NT25) and also in some of the rules, NT46 might produce a terminal like t10. Wait, let me check the specific production for NT46.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT46, there are multiple rules, and one of them is NT46 -> t10. So, t10 comes from NT46. So, the first token t10 comes from NT46.\n\n2. t73: Looking through the grammar, NT73 isn't a non-terminal. Wait, let's see. The available terminals are, for example, t73. Wait, actually, in the grammar rules, I think I see NT22 -> t73. For instance, one production is NT22 -> t73. So, t73 comes from NT22.\n\n3. t31: Looking through, t31 is a terminal as well, and I recall a production like NT22 -> t31. So yes, t31 comes from NT22.\n\n4. t95: Checking the grammar, I don't immediately see t95 as a terminal, but wait, actually, looking through, I see that NT31 -> t31, and then NT31 can be expanded further. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the production rules more carefully.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the terminals are the right-hand side when a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal. So, looking back:\n\n- NT22 -> t73\n- NT22 -> t96\n- NT22 -> t92\n- NT22 -> t31\n- NT22 -> t53\n- Also, NT31 has productions like -> t31, but maybe I'm misremembering. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT22 appears multiple times with various productions, some end with terminals like t22, t53, etc.\n\nWait, for t95, where does it come from? Hmm, I'm looking through the list and I don't see any production directly resulting in t95. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through, I see NT31 -> t49, but not t95. Wait, perhaps t95 comes from a non-terminal. Let me check the production rules for NT22:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31 (duplicate)\nNT22 -> NT49 NT87\nWait, no, sorry, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT22 has several productions:\n\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT45 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 -> NT92 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n...\n\nWait, no, in the list provided by the user, the NT22 rules are:\n\nLooking at the specific lines:\n\n\"NT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT45 (duplicate)\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\"\n\nWait, I think I may have a mistake here because in the initial grammar, the user listed:\n\n\"NT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 -> NT92 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT22 -> NT49 NT87\"\n\nWait, no, in the actual list, let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nUnder NT22, there are several rules:\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n- NT22 -> NT49 NT87\n\nWait, so t95 doesn't come from any terminal on the right-hand side. So perhaps there's a mistake in my memory. Wait, but the string is t10 t73 t31 t95 t37.\n\nWait, perhaps t95 comes from a different non-terminal. Let me check for other non-terminals that might produce t95.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t95. For example, NT40 -> t40, and some other production, but not t95. Similarly, NT85 -> t85, etc. Wait, so maybe the t95 token is from NT95, but that's not present in the grammar. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t95 is produced by a non-terminal that's not listed, but that seems unlikely since the grammar is provided in full. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nLet me go through the grammar again to spot any t95.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for any production that ends in 't95'. Scanning through all the production rules, the right-hand sides include 't10', 't73', 't31', etc. Looking for 't95':\n\n- NT25 -> 't73'\n- NT22 -> 't73'\n- NT22 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't96' (as per, for example, NT27->t96)\n- Wait, wait, I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal is directly expanded into 't95', but in the grammar, I don't see any such production. So perhaps 't95' is not in the grammar, which would mean the string can't be generated. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe 't95' can be derived through a sequence of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps 't95' is produced by a non-terminal. Let's go through the grammar step by step.\n\nWait, 't95' is the fourth token. So, in the string `t10 t73 t31 t95 t37`, the fourth token is t95. So we need to see if t95 is possible. Wait, in the grammar, none of the non-terminals' immediate productions produce t95. So perhaps t95 is not part of any production in the grammar, meaning that the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but the fifth token is t37, which does appear in the grammar. NT46 -> 't10' and 't73' is produced by NT22, so that's fine. But the fourth token is t95, which as per the grammar, isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. So perhaps this token is impossible, hence the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Maybe I'm missing a production rule for a non-terminal that can produce t95.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze possible derivations.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the grammar. It consists of multiple non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT25, etc.) that can produce other non-terminals or terminal symbols (like t4, t20, etc.). The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, needs to derive into NT29 NT46. So, any valid string must come from this starting point.\n\nThe string given is `t4 t20 t56 t35 t34 t34`. Since this is a sequence of terminals, each part must correspond to a production that eventually leads to these terminals without any non-terminals left in the end.\n\nLooking at each terminal symbol in the string:\n\n1. t4: Let's check which non-terminals produce t4. Scanning through the rules, I see NT8 -> t4. So, if somewhere in the derivation there's an NT8, it can produce t4.\n\n2. t20: Which non-terminals produce t20? Looking through the rules, I spot NT85 -> t20. So, a NT85 would produce t20.\n\n3. t56: Now, looking for t56. The rule is NT14 -> t56. So, NT14 produces t56.\n\n4. t35: Hmm, t35 is produced by NT87 -> t35. So NT87 would be needed for t35.\n\n5. t34: t34 can be produced by two non-terminals. NT70 -> t34 and NT84 -> t34. So either NT70 or NT84 can produce t34.\n\n6. t34 again: Same as above, another occurrence of t34.\n\nSo, constructing a possible parse:\n\nThe start symbol S needs to go to NT29 NT46. Let's see what NT29 and NT46 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT29 -> t53 (from NT29 -> 't53').\n\nNT46 has multiple options. One of them is NT46 -> t55. Another is NT46 -> t10. Also, there are others like t61. Wait, in the given string, the second element is t20, which comes from NT85. So perhaps a path that goes through NT46 producing t55 or t10, but those don't help for t20. So maybe another path for NT46.\n\nLooking back, another option for NT46 is NT46 -> NT71 NT25. Let me break that down.\n\nNT71 -> t40 (from NT71 -> 't40'). So NT71 produces t40.\n\nNT25 can produce t73, t55, t31, etc. Wait, from the rules, NT25 has options: NT25 -> NT22 NT14, which leads to t56 because NT14 is t56. Wait, but in our string, after t4, we have t20, which is NT85. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT46 can produce another path. Let me see: NT46 can go to NT92 NT25. Let's see NT92 -> t25 (from NT92 -> 't25'), and NT25 can produce NT22 NT14, which is t56, or other paths.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe starting from S and try to see if each part can match.\n\nLet me outline each step:\n\n1.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar has these production rules, and some non-terminals are rewritten into terminals. The starting symbol is S, and the string we're checking should be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's composed of six tokens: t87, t20, t37, t56, t36, t73. I need to see how each of these can be generated from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules to see if I can break down the string into the non-terminals that generate these terminals.\n\nLet me start by listing the production rules again to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT22 rule: it can produce t96 (from NT92 -> t25, but wait, that's NT92 -> t25, but NT22 -> NT92 NT31, and NT31 -> t49, and NT25 -> t73. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, in the rules, some non-terminals end with 't', meaning they directly produce a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT16 -> t38\n- NT40 -> t80\n- NT45 -> t37\n- NT51 -> t22\n- NT22 -> t96 (Wait, no, NT22: NT22 -> NT53 NT45, and NT45 -> t37. Hmm, that's a path. So NT22 can be broken down into t37 and something else.)\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by building a parse tree.\n\nThe given string is six tokens long, which suggests that the derivation would involve several steps, possibly involving the start symbol S.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S produces NT22 and NT46:\n\nS -> NT22 NT46\n\nSo, the derivation begins with S expanding into two non-terminals: NT22 and NT46.\n\nLet's look at both:\n\n1. NT22 can be expanded into NT53 and NT45 (from the rule NT22 -> NT53 NT45).\n\n2. NT46 can be expanded into NT92 and NT25 (from NT46 -> NT92 NT25).\n\nAlright, so now each of these can be further expanded.\n\nStarting with NT22:\n\nNT53 expands into NT13 and NT55 (from NT53 -> NT13 NT55).\n\nNT45 expands into NT22 and NT31 (from NT45 -> NT8 NT22? Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT45 -> NT8 NT22?\n\nWait, let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT22: NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT45: NT45 -> NT8 NT22\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because NT8 leads to t4, but I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I have:\n\nNT22: NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT53: NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT45: NT45 -> NT8 NT22\n\nWait, but then NT45 depends on NT8, which is another non-terminal that produces t4.\n\nWait, let me go through each step.\n\nFirst, S -> NT22 NT46.\n\nNow, NT22 -> NT53 NT45.\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55.\n\nNT13 -> NT31 (since NT13 -> NT31).\n\nNT31 -> t49 (since NT31 -> t49).\n\nSo, NT13 NT31 becomes t49 and something else? Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, each NT rule can produce either another NT or a terminal. So, when expanding NT22 into NT53 and NT45, we consider both of these.\n\nNT53 can be expanded into NT13 and NT55.\n\nNT13 is another non-terminal, which then expands into NT31.\n\nNT31 produces t49 directly.\n\nSo, the path for NT22 would go like this:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT13 -> NT31\n\nNT31 -> t49\n\nThen, NT55 can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 -> NT25 and NT87.\n\nSo, NT55 becomes NT25 and NT87.\n\nNT25: NT91 and NT87 (from NT25 -> NT91 NT87). Wait, no, looking back: NT25 is defined as NT25 -> NT91 NT87.\n\nWait, NT25 -> NT91 NT87.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\nNT91 can be expanded into NT8 and NT71.\n\nNT8 -> t4 (from NT8 -> t4).\n\nNT71 -> NT40 and NT85.\n\nNT40 -> t80 (from NT40 -> t80).\n\nNT85 -> t35 (from NT85 -> t35).\n\nWait, that's a lot.

Hmm, so the first token is t87.\n\nLooking at the rules, which NT starts with t87?\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see:\n\n- NT46 -> t10, but NT46 can be broken down into NT92 and NT25.

{"custom_id":"request-78","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t8 t86 t61 t36 t36 t8 t37`, and I need to figure out if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF has two main characteristics: each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left-hand side, or a single terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear as a terminal in any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it uses symbols like S, NT29, NT46, etc., which are non-terminals, and some have rules that either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S -> NT29 NT46, and then each NT has either a production to two NTs or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t8 t86 t61 t36 t36 t8 t37`. Each of these is a terminal, and they must correspond to a sequence of production steps leading up to them.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two symbols at a time, which suggests that the string length should be a power of 2. Wait, let me think: in CNF, every production is either A->BC or A->a, so the derivation tree is a binary tree. Starting from S, each step could add either two symbols or just one (but in this case, each production of a non-terminal produces two symbols or a terminal). Wait, but every step produces exactly two symbols if it's a non-terminal, but when it's a terminal, it's done. So the string length would be 2^n where n is the number of steps. But in this case, the string has seven symbols. 2^3=8, which is more than seven, so maybe the length isn't directly a power of two, but I think it's okay because each production could combine two symbols into one in the reverse direction.\n\nWait, no, actually, for a CNF grammar, the maximum possible length of a string of length k is 2^k. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nSince all production rules except for NT14, NT22, etc., produce terminals, maybe it's better to see each terminal in the string and trace back which non-terminals they come from.\n\nLet me list the symbols in the string:\n\n1. t8\n2. t86\n3. t61\n4. t36\n5. t36\n6. t8\n7. t37\n\nI need to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at each symbol:\n\n- t8: Where is this defined? Checking the grammar, NT40 -> 't80'? No, t8 is in NT8 -> 't4'. Wait, no, looking back: The grammar has NT8 -> 't4' (since I saw the rules). Let me check: Yes, in the grammar, NT8 -> 't4'. So t8 is 't4'. Wait, no, in the string, t8 is the first symbol, so it must come from NT8, which produces 't4'. Wait, but 't8' is the terminal, so if NT8 -> 't4', that can't be. That can't be right because 't8' is in the string, so perhaps I misread. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT8 -> 't4'.\n\nSo NT8 produces 't4', which is 't4' as a terminal. So if the string has 't8', that would mean maybe there's a confusion. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but let's proceed.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is 't8'. So to produce 't8', which is a terminal, the NT must be NT8, which produces 't4'. Wait, no, that's conflicting because NT8 would produce 't4', but our string has 't8' first. So perhaps my mistake is in how I'm interpreting the NT rules.\n\nWait, the production rules are as follows:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT8 is not on the left of any production except perhaps the ones where it's on the right. Wait, no, the production rules are on the left side:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nWait, maybe I need to list all the productions again to avoid confusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to create a parse tree for the given string.\n\nLet me consider the string as seven symbols. Starting from S, which is NP:S -> NT29 NT46.\n\nSo S is the start, and it produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, each of these can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo let's look at NT29: The production for NT29 is given as NT29 -> 't53'. So it's a terminal, so that's fine. So NT29 contributes 't53' as the first symbol. But in our string, the first symbol is 't8', which is different. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT29 is part of a non-terminal that eventually produces 't8'. Wait, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions work.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by walking through each symbol in the string and seeing where they come from.\n\nLet me list the symbols again: `t8`, `t86`, `t61`, `t36`, `t36`, `t8`, `t37`.\n\nSo first symbol is t8. Looking for which non-terminal can produce t8. From the grammar, NT8 -> 't4' and NT14 -> 't56'. So if t8 is to be produced, perhaps it's from NT40: because the grammar has NT40 -> 't80' and earlier I saw another line: Wait, no. Let me check again: The grammar has lines like NT46 -> NT92 NT25, which may or may not help. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps each symbol in the string is directly reachable by some NT, meaning each symbol is the result of a production.\n\nBut when S-> NT29 NT46, each of these is a non-terminal, so we'd have to expand those. So for example, S can expand to NT29 and NT46, each of which can either be terminals or produce more non-terminals. But in the string, the first symbol is 't8', so that suggests that the first non-terminal NT29 must expand to 't8' through some chain of productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT that produce 't8'. I see:\n\n- NT51 -> 't40'\n\n- NT67 -> 't87'\n\nWait, no, 't8' appears only in the string. Wait, the grammar lines show NT22 -> 't96' and other terminals. So looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT that produce 't8' as a terminal. I see in the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT71 -> 't55'\n\n- NT16 -> 't38'\n\n- NT25 -> 't73'\n\n- NT14 -> 't56'\n\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no 't8' is directly produced. So maybe 't8' comes from a chain. Like, is there any production that produces NT that eventually leads to 't8'?\n\nWait, for example, looking for NT that produce other Nts which produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT8, it's defined as 't4', so 't4' is the only terminal it produces.\n\nSo perhaps 't8' is part of a larger expansion. But according to the grammar, the only NT that directly produces terminals are:\n\nNH, let's list them all where 'a' is a terminal:\n\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n\n- NT9 -> I don't see this, not in the given.\n\nWait, the given grammar has:\n\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n\n- NT70 -> 't54'\n\n- NT55 -> 't80'\n\n- NT91 -> 't55'\n\n- NT71 -> 't55'\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n\n- NT40 -> 't80'\n\n- NT40 -> 't84'\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n\n- NT22 -> 't96' and others with t numbers.\n\nWait, looking again, some of the NTs do have t's in their productions. For example:\n\n- NT40 -> 't80' and 't84'\n\n- NT45 -> 't37'\n\n- NT85 -> 't36'\n\nWait, this complicates things.

Let me count the tokens: there are seven symbols. So the parse tree for the string would have a length of seven, which means the derivation would have seven steps if it's a leftmost derivation. Alternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, the number of reductions would depend on the structure.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be constructed by following the productions. Since S starts with NT29 NT46, which are both non-terminals, the first step is to see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT29: it's defined as 't53'. Oh, wait, in the grammar, NT29 -> 't53'. So the first symbol in the string is 't79', which is different from 't53'. That's confusing because the first production of S is NT29 NT46, which would produce 't53' and whatever NT46 produces. Wait, no, the production for S is NT29 NT46, which is supposed to be replaced by their respective terminal productions. So the string starts with 't79', which doesn't match 't53', which is what NT29 produces. Hmm, that suggests that S cannot directly produce 't79' because it starts with NT29 -> 't53', so the first symbol of the string should be 't53'. But the string starts with 't79', which is not possible unless the derivation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the production for NT29 again. Looking back, yes, NT29 -> 't53'. So the first part of S is NT29, which can only produce 't53'. Therefore, the first token of the string should be 't53', but it's 't79' instead. That would mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol doesn't match any possible terminal from NT29.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the grammar correctly. Each production is a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right. So S -> NT29 NT46 means S can produce NT29 followed by NT46. So the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT29 can produce and NT46 can produce.\n\nNow, checking the string again: the first symbol is 't79', which would correspond to what NT29 can produce. If NT29 can't produce 't79', then S can't derive the string either. But earlier I thought NT29 -> 't53', so that's the only option. Therefore, the first symbol in the string must be 't53', not 't79'. So unless there's a non-terminal that produces 't79', which I don't see, this suggests that the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait another thing: perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me see all the productions that produce terminals. It's possible that I missed a production that results in 't79'.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT79 isn't present because the non-terminals go up to NT95 or something. Wait, looking through the list:\n\n- NT79 isn't a non-terminal here, because the highest non-terminal I see is NT95.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their productions to ensure I didn't miss 't79'. Let me go through each non-terminal.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70, which further down reduces to 't38' and 't55', so the first token would be 't38'? No, in the string it's 't36', 't18', etc.\n\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14, which becomes 't4' and 't56'.\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'.\n\n- NT31 -> 't8'.\n\n- NT38 -> 't94'.\n\n- NT40 -> 't84'.\n\n- NT45 -> 't37'.\n\n- NT46 -> 't10' (once) and 't55' (another rule).\n\n- NT51 -> 't40', 't22', etc. Wait, looking back, NT51 has multiple productions: NT51 -> 't40', 't22'; 't18', 't87', etc. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check: yes, NT51 has several productions. So NT51 can produce 't40', 't22', 't18', 't87', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT85 -> 't35', and other non-terminals have various terminal productions.\n\nWait, but 't79' is a terminal. So unless a non-terminal directly produces 't79', the string can't start with 't79'. Looking at the grammar, none of the productions seem to directly produce 't79'. Let me check each non-terminal's productions to see if any produce 't79'.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any that directly produce 't79'. So the initial step is that the first non-terminal is NT29, which can only produce 't53', so the first token in the string must be 't53', but the string starts with 't79', which is a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol 't79' is not a possible terminal from any production of the start symbol S, which starts with NT29 NT46, both of which produce 't53' and their respective non-terminals that eventually terminate in other terminals.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake by assuming that the string must be the concatenation of exactly the productions of S. Let me double-check that.\n\nYes, S is the start symbol, so the entire string must be the concatenation of what S's productions can generate, considering all possible reductions. So if S can only generate 't53' (from NT29) and something else from NT46, the first token of the string can't be 't79' unless I'm misunderstanding the production of NT29.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is different, but looking at the grammar, S is clearly defined as NT29 NT46, so that's the only way to start.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the string starts with 't79', which isn't possible because the first production from S starts with 't53'. Therefore, the string is not in the language generated by this grammar.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if any other starting production could produce 't79' as the first symbol. Since S is the only starting symbol, and it's not directly producing 't79', but only 't53' and whatever from NT46, and neither 't53' nor the next symbol allows 't79'.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of a longer derivation. For example, could there be a path where NT29 leads to a longer sequence that includes 't79' early on? But no, because NT29's only production is to 't53', which is a single terminal. So NT29 can't produce multiple symbols; it directly produces one terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated because the first symbol doesn't match any possible output from the start symbol S.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't79', but the grammar's start symbol S produces 't53' as the first symbol. Thus, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to decide whether the string is part of the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has each production rule with two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. So, all the rules start with a single capital letter, like S, NT22, etc., leading to two non-terminals. Also, I notice some terminal symbols, represented by 't' followed by numbers, like 't80', 't36', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t36 t94 t54 t53 t4 t96 t80 t36`. It looks like a sequence of terminal symbols. The task is to see if there's a derivation path in the grammar that starts with the start symbol S and ends with this string.\n\nThe initial step is to analyze the production rules to see if they can generate the given string. Let's start from the top.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT29 NT46. So, S -> NT29 NT46. Both NT29 and NT46 are non-terminals.\n\nNow, let's look at the productions for NT29 and NT46.\n\nFor NT29: The productions are:\n- NT29 -> NT22 NT... Wait, let me check. Looking through the rules, I see NT29 -> NT22 NT14? No, actually the rules as given:\n\nLooking back:\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n- NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n- NT71 -> NT40 NT85\n- NT40 -> NT84 NT67\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n- NT49 -> NT25 NT87\n- NT16 -> NT38 NT55\n- NT40 -> 't80'\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT25 -> 't73'\n- NT31 -> 't49'\n- NT14 -> 't56'\n\nWait, actually, that's not correct. I think I misread some of the rules. For example, the production for NT22 is listed twice. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT53 -> 't40'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, that's a bit messy, but let me try to structure this better. The grammar seems to have many non-terminals, but a subset of them are terminals. So, the terminal symbols are those that are not on the left-hand side of any production and appear on the right-hand side. For example, 't80' is a terminal, as well as 't4', 't10', 't36', etc.\n\nMy approach will be to work backwards from the string to see if I can build back to S using the productions.\n\nThe string is: t36, t94, t54, t53, t4, t96, t80, t36.\n\nLet me write them in order as a list: [t36, t94, t54, t53, t4, t96, t80, t36].\n\nNow, let's think about the structure. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation adds exactly two non-terminals. So, the length of the string must be a power of two, right? Because each step doubles the number of symbols. Wait, but that's when starting from one symbol. However, in this case, the start symbol produces two non-terminals, so each step could add two.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others. So, the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps taken.\n\nBut the string here has 8 symbols, which is 2^3, so three steps after S. That could be possible.\n\nBut let's not get bogged down by that yet. Let's try to break down the string from the end, looking for the end symbols and seeing if they match any productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string from the start. Let's see.\n\nThe first symbol is t36. Let's see which productions produce t36. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT84 -> 't71' [No]\n- NT55 -> 't80' [No]\n- NT70 -> 't54' [Yes, so NT70 could produce t54, but wait, nt70->t54.\nWait, but the string starts with t36, which isn't a terminal in nt70's production. So where does t36 come from?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT84 -> 't71' [No]\n- NT29 -> 't53' [No]\n- NT22 -> 't96' [No]\n- NT49 -> 't86' [No]\n- NT70 -> 't54' [No]\n- NT51 -> 't22' [No]\n- NT38 -> 't94' [Yes, NT38->t94\n- NT40 -> 't80' [Yes, NT40 -> t80\n- NT53 -> 't40' [Yes, NT53->t40\n- NT13 -> 't31' [No]\n- Other NT rules produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t36, which isn't listed as a terminal in any production, so that's a problem. Unless I'm missing something. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT84 -> 't71', which is t71, so t71 is a terminal. Similarly, NT55 -> 't80' so t80 is terminal. Wait, does any NT produce t36?\n\nWait, I check the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, the only one that produces t36 is NT84 -> 't71', which is t71. Wait, no, 't71' is another terminal.

My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it indeed seems to follow this form, with some rules producing two non-terminals and others producing terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the string has eight tokens, each prefixed by a 't'. My first thought is to map each of these tokens to see if they correspond to any terminals in the grammar.

Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking at the production rules provided, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't61'. That's a red flag. If 't61' is in the string, unless it's derived through a series of productions, the string might not be in the language.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible for a non-terminal to be expanded into t61 indirectly. Let me see which non-terminals produce t61. Checking the grammar, NT40 \u2192 t84 NT67, but NT67 is a non-terminal that is further generated. NT84 \u2192 t71, so NT84 can't produce t61.\n\nWait, let me check again. The rules provided don't have any NT directly leading to 't61', so I think NT61 isn't a non-terminal in this grammar. Therefore, 't61' can't be part of the string generated by this grammar because there's no way to produce it.

Scanning through all the production rules, I don't see 't61' on the right-hand side of any rule.

Looking at the rules for NT46:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 | NT22 NT53 | NT40 NT67 | NT85 NT51 | NT31 NT49 | NT55 NT25.\n\nSo, each of these produces two non-terminals. But for our string, we need the output to be 't4', which is in the rightmost part, so perhaps we need to trace back how the different parts of the string are generated.\n\nLet me list the string as a sequence: [t55][t31][t94][t25][t86][t56][t34][t34][t4].\n\nEach terminal is a token, so the grammar must generate each of these in order, separated by non-terminals that then resolve to empty (since it's CNF, each production is binary, but each step reduces a single non-terminal into two, so the string will be a series of leaves).\n\nAlternatively, since the string has to be generated step by step, perhaps a way to approach this is to work backwards from the string, trying to find substitutions that produce the string.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree and see if the string matches any derive sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm, but since the user hasn't specified a method, I can try to see step by step.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in CNF, the parse tree is a binary tree of depth equal to the length of the string. So, for a string of length 9, the parse tree should have a root at level 1 (height 8).\n\nBut maybe that's getting too technical. Let me consider the steps:\n\n1. The string starts with t55. Looking at the rules, which NTs produce 't55'? Let's check each rule:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4': no\n- NT29 \u2192 't53': no\n- NT55 \u2192 't80' or 't49' (wait, NT55: rule is NT55\u2192NT49 NT91 and also other rules? Wait, looking at the initial grammar:\n\nWait, the rules provided are a lot, but let me find where 't55' comes from. For example, NT29\u2192't53', so 't53' comes from NT29.\n\nLooking for terminals in the string: t55, t31, t94, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't80' and 't49' via NT55\u2192NT49 NT91.\n\nWait, no, let me parse the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nNT22 -> NT96, etc.\n\nNT46: multiple rules, including NT46\u2192't10', but the string has t4 as the last token.\n\nWait, but the last token is t4, which is 't4' from NT8\u2192't4'.\n\nSo perhaps the production chain ends with NT8 generating 't4'.\n\nSo, the string must be generated by a series of productions that eventually reach t8 (since t4 comes from NT8).\n\nBut stepping back, let's think of the string as a series of t's and digits. The string is: t55, t31, t94, t25, t86, t56, t34, t34, t4.\n\nEach tX is a terminal, as per the grammar. So, how can these terminals be produced by the grammar.\n\nFor each tX, which non-terminal can produce it?\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, I need to see which NTs directly produce a 'tX' terminal.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't80' and 't49'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't55' or 't10'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't22' or 't40'\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't37'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't20' or 't79'\n\n- NT34...

NT87 \u2192 't74', 't20', 't79', 't86'\n\nWait, looking at NT87: it has a production to 't86'.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided rules:\n\nNT87: \u2192 't74', 't20', 't79', 't86'.\n\nYes, so NT87 can produce 't86'.\n\nSimilarly, NT40 \u2192 't84', 't67'?\n\nWait the rule is NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67. Wait, no, let me check the provided grammar.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n\nWait, but I see NT84: 't71'\n\nNT67: 't87'\n\nSo NT40 can produce 't84' and 't67', but in this case, we have in the string t84 is 't71', but that's a single token 't71'.\n\nWait, perhaps that's unclear. Let me parse through each rule step by step.\n\nLet me create a list of which NTs can produce each terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- 't4' \u2192 NT8\n\n- 't53' \u2192 NT29\n\n- 't80' \u2192 NT55\n\n- 't49' \u2192 NT55\n\n- 't55' \u2192 NT92, NT25, NT22, etc. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT55's rule is: NT55\u2192 NT49 NT91.\n\nWait, no: according to the provided grammar, the rules for NT55 aren't immediately clear. Let me scan the provided grammar lines:\n\nLooking for NT55: I see in the provided rules, for example:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, NT40 NT93, etc. Wait, maybe I should list all rules where NT55 appears?\n\nLooking through the rules given, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT13 NT40\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rules.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the string to see how many tokens there are. Counting them: t35, t56, t56, t86, t18, t40, t4, t35, t34. That's 9 tokens. So, the derived string has 9 symbols.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Each non-terminal eventually resolves to some terminals, adding to the string. Since each production is either terminal or two non-terminals, the derivation tree will have a structure that's a left or right branching tree, depending on how the parsing goes.\n\nI remember that for a string of length n, in a CFG with CNF, the number of steps in the derivation must be 2n-1. Let's check: the string has 9 symbols, so 2*9 -1 =17 steps. But I don't know if that's necessary right now.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to derive the string step by step. Let's start with S and see if we can build the string.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nSo, S is two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46.

The string is \"t61 t8 t74 t95 t25 t34 t61 t4 t87 t22\". Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that many non-terminals produce other non-terminals, and a few produce terminals. My job is to generate the string step by step, making sure each part of the string corresponds to a derivation in the grammar.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals: t61, t8, t74, t95, t25, t34, t61, t4, t87, t22. I think each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the start string would be derived into NT29 NT46, which then needs to be expanded into terminals.\n\nSo the initial string after S is Nt29 Nt46. Let me see what each of these can produce. Looking at the production rules, NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT46. Wait, but NT29's production is listed as NT29 -> 't53'? No, wait, let me check. Looking back, I see that NT29 is actually a terminal because it's written as NT29 -> 't53'. Hmm, no, wait, looking at the rules again, maybe I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-127","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. So I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with a bunch of productions. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals, and the right-hand side has exactly two symbols. Except for some rules where terminals are written as 't' followed by a number, like 't80', which I guess are terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t55 t61 t36 t56 t53 t36 t87 t96 t36 t22`. That's a sequence of 10 tokens: t55, t61, t36, t56, t53, t36, t87, t96, t36, t22.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I know that each production has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, every production must be A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal. So in this grammar, most rules are non-terminals producing two non-terminals, but some produce terminals directly. So I should look for those to see which terminals can appear in the string.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT51 -> 't40'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\n\nWait, I notice that some of the rules have 't' followed by a number, like 't55', which are terminals. These are the leaves in the parse tree. The others are non-terminals which can split into other non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT46. So any valid string must start with NT29 followed by NT46, right?\n\nLet me check the string: it starts with t55. Looking at the productions, when does NT29 produce a terminal? Looking at NT29 -> 't53'. So if NT29 is a non-terminal, it can only produce 't53'. But in our string, the first token is t55, which is not t53. Hmm, but wait, S starts with NT29, which produces 't53' directly. So the first token in the generated string should be 't53' if S starts with NT29. But here, it's t55, which can't come from NT29. That seems like a contradiction. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the start symbol. Let me check: the grammar is S -> NT29 NT46, so S produces NT29 and NT46. So any string generated by S must start with the concatenation of what NT29 produces and what NT46 produces.\n\nLooking at NT29's production: NT29 -> 't53'. So the first symbol must be t53. But the string starts with t55. That can't be, right? So that would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar because the start symbol produces t53 as the first symbol.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe NT29 can produce multiple things? No, looking at the grammar, NT29 only has one production: NT29 -> 't53'. So that's a terminal. So NT29 can only contribute t53 to the string, meaning S produces t53 followed by whatever NT46 produces.\n\nIn our string, the first token is t55. So that would mean the first symbol should be t53, but it's t55. So that's a problem. Therefore, unless I'm missing something, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol doesn't match any production of NT29.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe the first symbol is being produced by a different part of the grammar, but no. S starts with NT29 and NT46, so the first symbol is what NT29 produces. Since NT29 only produces 't53', the first token must be t53.\n\nIn the string given, it's t55. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the productions. Let me look again: are there any rules where a non-terminal can be 't55'? Checking: No, 't55' is a terminal, so NT55 -> 't55' is its only production. So as a non-terminal, it can only produce 't55'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the last token is t22. Looking at the grammar, NT22 has several productions:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWhen does NT22 produce a terminal? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT22 directly producing a terminal. It only has rules that split into other non-terminals. So to get to a terminal, you have to go through those non-terminals. Let me see if any of them lead to NT22.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, none of the rules produce NT22 as a terminal. So the only way to get t22 is through NT22. But in our string, the last token is t22, so that would have to come from NT22. But since NT22 can't produce a terminal directly, then how is it generated?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Looking for any non-terminals that produce t22 directly. Yes, there is a rule:\n\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nSo NT51 can produce t22. But in our string, the last token is t22, so somewhere in the derivation, NT51 must appear, which could produce t22.\n\nBut let me go back to the first point. Since the string starts with t55, and the start symbol S produces NT29 and NT46, which in turn produce t53 and something else. So the first token should be t53, but it's t55, so that's a mismatch. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nUnless... wait, perhaps the string isn't a direct start. No, in context-free grammars, the entire string must be generated by S. So the string must start with t53 followed by something. Here, it's t55, so that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string starts with `t55`, but the only way `t55` can appear is directly from the non-terminal NT55, which does not appear as the left-hand side of any production. Since the start symbol S must produce NT29 and NT46, the first symbol must be `t53`, which does not match the given string. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the productions seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT46 is two non-terminals, which is fine. Some productions directly produce terminals like NT8 \u2192 't4'. So that's straightforward.\n\nThe string given to check is `t4 t71 t35 t94 t31 t79 t86 t20 t36 t8 t18`. My task is to see if this can be derived from the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S, which is defined as NT29 \u2192 NT46. So S is replaced by NT29 NT46. Hmm, but wait, in the given grammar, looking at S -> NT29 NT46, right? So S starts as NT29 and NT46. So any expansion of S must go through NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, let's look at the string and count the number of symbols. The string has 11 't' symbols, like `t4`, `t71`, etc., so each of these is an atomic element. Since each production rule that introduces a terminal is only introducing one symbol at a time, I think I can model this as a sequence of productions that build up the string step by step.\n\nI need to see if the sequence of 'ts' can be generated by following the production rules. Each step should expand non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals until we get down to terminals only.\n\nLooking at the string, let's note the order:\n\n1. t4\n2. t71\n3. t35\n4. t94\n5. t31\n6. t79\n7. t86\n8. t20\n9. t36\n10. t8\n11. t18\n\nWait, but when you start with S, you get NT29 NT46, which are two non-terminals. Each of these will need to be expanded into a sequence of symbols to eventually produce each token in the string.\n\nSo, the starting point is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Now, let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT29: in the given grammar, NT29 \u2192 't53'. So NT29 can immediately produce 't53', which would be one of the tokens. Wait, but in the string, the first token is 't4', not 't53'. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake here or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT29 appears to be defined once: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So if NT29 \u2192 't53', then in the string I have 't4' as the first symbol. That doesn't match. Hmm, that might be a problem because if S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and NT29 \u2192 't53', then the first symbol should be 't53', but the string starts with 't4'. That suggests that either the start symbol is different, or the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's confirm. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT29 NT46. NT29 expands to 't53', and NT46 expands to... looking at the grammar for NT46: there are multiple rules. For example, NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT55, and also NT46 \u2192 't4'. Wait, wait, on checking, I see multiple entries for NT46:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT55\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n... and so on. Oh, wait, no, in the given grammar, I think NT46 is listed under different non-terminals. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\n\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nNT25 -> 't73'\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nNT14 -> 't56'\n\nNT91 -> 't55'\n\nNT70 -> 't54'\n\nNT51 -> 't40'\n\nNT45 -> 't37'\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nNT87 -> 't74'\n\nNT67 -> 't87'\n\nNT84 -> 't71'\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nNT22 -> 't96'\n\nNT92 -> 't25'\n\nNT85 -> 't35'\n\nNT38 -> 't94'\n\nNT55 -> 't80'\n\nNT87 -> 't20'\n\nNT31 -> 't8'\n\nNT51 -> 't18'\n\nNT87 -> 't79'\n\nNT46 -> 't55'\n\nNT31 -> 't95'\n\nNT46 -> 't61'\n\nNT49 -> 't86'\n\nNT70 -> 't34'\n\nNT84 -> 't36'\n\nNT13 -> 't31'\n\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait a minute, I see that NT46 appears multiple times with different productions. So for example:\n\nNT46 can be:\n\n\u2192 NT92 NT25\n\n\u2192 NT22 NT55\n\n\u2192 NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check line by line:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT46, there are two rules:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT22 NT55\n\nAnd then again:\n\nNT46 -> 't10'.\n\nWait, that can't be, because NT46 is defined more than once. Wait, looking more carefully, in the given rules, I see:\n\nAfter NT29 -> 't53', the next group is for NT22, then for NT25, etc. Then under NT46:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT22 NT55\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nYes, so NT46 has three productions: two to other non-terminals and one to a terminal.\n\nWait, but that's not possible in CNF. Because in CNF, every non-terminal must have production rules that only go to other non-terminals or terminals. But in this case, it looks like NT46 can produce another non-terminal (like NT92 or NT22) or a terminal 't10'. Wait, no, actually, 't10' is a terminal, right? Because all other terminals are just 't' followed by a number as per the string.\n\nSo in this case, NT46 can either be replaced by NT92 and NT25, or by NT22 and NT55, or directly by 't10'. So that's three possible productions for NT46: two consisting of two non-terminals and one terminal.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, a production must have at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So for example, A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo in the case of NT46 \u2192 't10', that would be allowed because it's a single terminal. The other rules are two non-terminals each, so that fits CNF. So yes, this grammar is in CNF.\n\nOkay, so getting back to the string. The first symbol is t4. Looking at the possible terminals, NT46 can produce 't10' or another non-terminal. But wait, not all terminals are directly produced. Looking through the other rules, I see that NT8 \u2192 't4', NT38 \u2192 't94', NT40 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps it's intended. Or perhaps I need to check the correct one.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n- NT55 -> 't80'\n- NT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Each production is considered, so NT55 has multiple rules. So when expanding NT55, we can choose any of those. However, depending on the input, using 't80' or 't21' early might affect the rest of the parse.\n\nNow, looking at the string to parse: `t49 t80 t34 t36 t94 t74 t4 t37 t40 t96 t10 t22`\n\nThis looks like a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, which correspond to the sequence of productions leading to those terminals.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the starting point is S, which must be the root of the parse tree, so the entire string must be derived from NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me outline the structure:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string is generated from NT29 producing something ending with t53 (since NT29 \u2192 't53'), and NT46 producing t10. But wait, looking at the string, the first t49 is part of the string, so maybe I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break down the string in order and assign each terminal to a production.\n\nLet me list the string as a sequence: [t49, t80, t34, t36, t94, t74, t4, t37, t40, t96, t10, t22]\n\nLet me try to process it step by step.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the first part must come from NT29, which eventually must derive to t49 (since the first symbol is t49). So let's see NT29.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nWait, that's only one production. So NT29 can only be t53. But the string starts with t49, so this is a problem. Hmm, unless I'm misinterpreting the NT29's production. Wait, in the given grammar, NT29 is defined as:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nSo NT29 can only produce t53. Therefore, the first symbol in the string must be t53, but it's t49 instead. That suggests that it's impossible to derive the string as it doesn't match.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check the NT29 rule.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nYes, that's the only rule for NT29. So NT29 can only produce 't53'. Therefore, in the string, we need a 't53' somewhere as the prefix of NT29's derived string.\n\nBut the first symbol is t49, which suggests NT29 would need to produce t49. But it doesn't. So perhaps the given string is not in the language because NT29 can't be t49.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misassigned the production. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nIs that correct? Yes. So NT29 can't produce t49.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t49, which can't come from NT29. Hence, the string isn't derivable by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the order. Let me see the S production again: S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the first part is NT29, which should produce a string ending in t53 if it's the first element, but the string starts with t49.

The string is `t53 t34 t74 t10 t56 t35 t71 t21 t21 t34 t34 t31`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars generate strings by expanding the start symbol until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with a single non-terminal on the right. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So here, the productions are all two symbols on the right, either non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most rules have two non-terminals on the right side, except for some which have a terminal followed by a non-terminal or a non-terminal followed by a terminal. For example, `NT40 -> NT84 NT67` and `NT84 -> t71`, but wait, let me check. Wait, actually, the grammar as given seems to be written with some rules having a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa. For example, `NT84 -> t71`, which is a terminal, so that would be a production for the non-terminal NT84 as a terminal symbol. Similarly, `NT51 -> t40`, etc. So, any production where both symbols are terminals would represent a terminal, but in this case, the productions are more mixed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is all terminals, so each token in the string must match a production that directly produces that token. To approach this, I should build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, `S -> NT29 NT46`. So the string must start with the expansion of NT29 and then NT46. So splitting the string into two parts: the first part from NT29 and the second part from NT46.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts: `t53 t34` `t74 t10 t56 t35 t71 t21 t21 t34 t34 t31`.

So, looking at NT29: I don't see a production for NT29 in the rules. Hmm, that's strange. The start symbol is S, which becomes NT29 NT46. But if NT29 isn't defined, that might already be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps NT29 is another way, but maybe the rules are written with some non-terminals in the middle. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking again, I notice that some rules have a starting point, like `NT25 -> NT22 NT14`, which is acceptable as long as all the non-terminals in the right-hand side have their own productions. So, maybe I was wrong about NT29. Perhaps, in the initial rules, each non-terminal is defined.\n\nWait, so S -> NT29 NT46, but if NT29 isn't defined anywhere, that would mean S can't be derived, which would imply the string can't be generated. But the string does include t53, which might be from NT29. Hmm, perhaps I need to check if NT29 is correctly defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the initial rules. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, there is a rule `NT29 -> 't53'` \u2014 no, looking through, I don't see a rule that starts with NT29.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. This makes it easier to analyze the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT29 NT46. So S directly expands into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. Each of these needs to be expanded according to the production rules until we get terminals only.\n\nSo the given string is a list of terminals: t36, t86, t54, t71, t36, t40, t34, t56, t49, t95, t53, t34, t25. I need to see if this string can be derived from S in the grammar.\n\nEach terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule ending with that terminal. For example, looking at NT22, one of its productions is NT22 -> NT53 NT45, and another is NT22 -> 't49'. So 't49' is directly produced by NT22.\n\nI should map each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals and then see if I can build the string from the start.\n\nLet me list each token and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\n1. t36: Looking at the grammar, check which NTs directly produce t36.\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't36' except maybe I missed it. Wait, let's check the list again.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I see NT67 -> 't87', NT40 -> 't4', NT38 -> 't94', etc. Hmm, I don't see t36 as a terminal. Oh wait, no, the string has t36 multiple times. But let me check if any NT produces t36.\n\nWait, looking through all the terminals, I see NT49 -> 't94', NT84 -> 't71', NT13 -> 't31', etc. But I don't see any NT directly producing 't36'. Did I miss that? Maybe it's produced indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake because I need to look through each NT's production to see if any directly generate t36.\n\nWait, looking at all the rules, the terminals are things like 't4', 't22', 't53', etc. Let me list all the terminals:\n\n- NT40 -> 't80'\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT25 -> 't73'\n- NT31 -> 't49'\n- NT14 -> 't56'\n- NT91 -> 't55'\n- NT70 -> 't54'\n- NT85 -> 't35'\n- NT46 -> 't10'?

So that is, NT84 directly produces t36.\n\nSo in the given string, we have 't36'. That must come from NT84. So somewhere in the derivation, there's an NT84.\n\nSimilarly, let's break down each token:\n\n1. t36: NT84\n2. t86: NT49\n3. t54: NT70\n4. t71: NT85\n5. t36: NT84\n6. t40: NT40 directly, but wait, looking at the rules, NT40 can produce t34 or via NT24, etc. Wait, looking at NT40:\n\nLooking at the NT40 production: NT40 -> 't80' \u2014\u2014 so 't40' is actually not a terminal; wait, no, let's see: in the grammar, NT40 -> 't34' is one of the options? Wait, looking back, the given NT40 is: NT40 -> 't80' from earlier but also NT40 has a production to 't34'? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\nNT40 -> 't80' is one of the rules, but in other cases, for example, NT85 -> 't35' is a terminal. So wait, is 't40' a terminal or is it produced by some NT?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the only NT -> t are:\n\n- NT40 -> 't80' \u2192 so 't80' is terminal\n- NT40 -> 't34' \u2192 wait, actually, looking back, the rules are listed as:\n\nIn the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT40 -> NT85 -> 't35'?

{"custom_id":"request-183","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or some terminals. That's good, because it makes parsing easier, but I might need to work through it.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t80 t53 t34 t34 t71 t8 t56 t74 t56 t21 t87 t37 t49`.\n\nI notice that it's a sequence of terminals. So each of these terms must be produced by some production rule. Since the grammar is CNF, each step in the derivation must produce exactly two non-terminals, and ultimately, they resolve to terminals.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, matching each terminal with the possible productions.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first part of the string: `t80 t53 t34 t34 t71 ...`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that `t80` is directly produced by the production `NT40 -> 't80'`. So the first part of the string can be matched by NT40, which is a non-terminal.\n\nNow, next is `t53`. Looking at the productions, `NT22 -> NT53 NT45` and `NT22 -> NT92 NT31`. Also, `NT29 -> 't53'`. So how does this fit?\n\nWait, `t53` is produced directly by NT29. So if I have `t53` as the next terminal, maybe NT29 is part of the production. But NT29 is a non-terminal that produces `t53` as a terminal string. So perhaps the structure is something like NT40 -> NT29 't53' something?\n\nWait, let me think. The string starts with `t80`. NT40 -> 't80' is one option. Then, after that, NT40 must be part of a larger structure. Because in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the entire string is a series of terminal symbols, which must have been derived from a sequence of non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, and each must be the result of replacing each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is one derivation starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT22 NT46. Let me write that down: S \u2192 NT22 NT46.\n\nSo S produces NT22 and NT46. So the entire string must be a concatenation of the strings derived from NT22 and NT46.\n\nSo maybe I should split the string into two parts, one for NT22 and one for NT46, concatenated.\n\nLet me count the string: it's 13 symbols long. So if I split it at the seventh symbol, perhaps. But wait, maybe the split is determined by the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the entire string as part of the S production. Let me try to think of it as S \u2192 NT22 NT46. So the string is the concatenation of what NT22 produces and what NT46 produces.\n\nSo let's take the string as [Part1][Part2], where Part1 is the string derived from NT22 and Part2 is the string derived from NT46.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT22 NT46, which means after expansion, the entire string is what NT22 generates followed by NT46 generates, without any other symbols in between. So if the string is [NT22 string][NT46 string], then perhaps we can split the given string into two parts accordingly.\n\nLet me look at NT22's production. It has multiple rules. Let me list all the NT22 rules:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45, NT92 NT31, NT22 NT53, NT22 NT45.\n\nWait, some rules are two non-terminals, others are one non-terminal leading to more.\n\nWait, no: looking at the productions, NT22 can produce:\n\n- NT53 NT45 (so two non-terminals)\n- NT92 NT31 (two non-terminals)\n- NT22 NT53 (two non-terminals)\n- NT22 NT45 (two non-terminals)\nWait, wait, that's different.

The string I need to evaluate is `t79 t21 t40 t36 t61 t79 t18 t20 t56 t87 t86 t31 t53 t80`.\n\nI remember that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, plus the possibility of terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, you can only have two non-terminals on the right, or a single terminal. So, in the given grammar, all productions seem to fit that, except maybe in cases where a production is a single terminal. But in standard CNF, terminals on the RHS are allowed, so that's okay.\n\nNow, to check if the string can be derived from S, I need to see a way to break down the string into the productions. Since all productions are in CNF, each step produces two symbols. However, when dealing with a string, we might have to apply productions multiple times or see if the symbols can be built up.\n\nLooking at the string: `t79 t21 t40 t36 t61 t79 t18 t20 t56 t87 t86 t31 t53 t80`. That's 14 symbols. So, the derivation should start with S and take steps that produce two symbols each time until we reach 14 symbols. Wait, actually, every production in CNF adds one symbol, right? Because each application of a production increases the number of symbols by one. So starting from S, the initial length is 1. After each step, it increases by 1. So to get to 14 symbols, that would require 13 productions. Wait, but 1 + 13 = 14, yes. Hmm, but maybe that's not the best way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar might have multiple possible derivations, perhaps there's a way to parse the string into segments that match the rules. Let me try to parse it from the start symbol and see if it can generate the entire string.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with the symbols generated by NT29 and NT46. Let me see what NT29 and NT46 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53' (from NT29 -> 't53'). So, if NT29 produces t53, then that part is 't53'.\n\nNow, NT46. Let me check the productions for NT46. There are a few productions, like NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, but also NT46 \u2192 't10' and others. Wait, I think I need to look through all the NT46 productions. From the list, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nAlso, NT46 appears elsewhere as well, but looking at the given productions, NT46 can be either a non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, for NT46:\n\nThere's NT46 \u2192 't10', so one production is directly producing 't10'. So, if NT46 can be 't10', then the string can start with t53 t10, which would be the first two symbols. Looking at the string, the start is t79 t21... which doesn't match t53 t10. So perhaps NT46 is not the first production to use the terminal 't10'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Wait, actually S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so it's NT29 followed by NT46. So the string would be generated by NT29 yielding t53, then NT46 yielding... maybe another t. Wait, but NT46 can produce a terminal like t10, but in the string, after t53 comes t21. Hmm, that doesn't match t10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Maybe NT29 and NT46 can be expanded further before reaching terminals.\n\nSo let's break it down. Let's take the string and see if it can be split into pairs that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if we can reduce it to the start symbol by applying inverse productions. That might be easier.\n\nIn this approach, I want to see if the string can be reduced step by step to S by applying reverse productions.\n\nStarting with the string:\n\nt79 t21 t40 t36 t61 t79 t18 t20 t56 t87 t86 t31 t53 t80\n\nBreaking it down as a sequence. Let me check the end: the last symbol is 't80'. Looking at the productions, 't80' is produced by NT46 and NT8. So, NT46 \u2192 't10' or 't...' Wait, actually, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't46'? Wait, no, in the list, NT46 is:\n\nLooking back, the productions are:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, no, NT46 is a production like:\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10' is one of the productions, yes. So, if the last symbol is 't80', is that possible? Wait, no, wait: 't80' is produced by other non-terminals, like NT46: Not directly, because looking at ND46, the productions for NT46 include 't10', but t80 is produced by, say, NT46?\n\nWait, no. Let me check each production to see which ones produce 't80' or 't79' etc.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10' is one of them. So 't10' is directly from NT46.\n\n- Other non-terminals produce terminals like t21, t22, etc.\n\nWait, but looking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't86'\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't49'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't49'\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't56'\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't40'\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't74'\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't87'\n\n- NT84 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't80'\n\nWait, so NT55 \u2192 't80'. So the non-terminal NT55 can produce t80. Looking through the grammar, where does NT55 come from?\n\nLooking at the production list, I don't see NT55 as a left-hand side except in the initial list. Oh, wait, yes, the top-level production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, but looking deeper, for example, NT51 can produce 't40' and 't18', etc.\n\nWait, looking for where NT55 is:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT55 \u2192 't80' is in the productions.\n\nWait, but also, looking back:\n\nWait, the production NT46 \u2192 't10' is one, but where is NT55?\n\nWait, looking through the given productions:\n\nNT55 is given as:\n\nNT55 \u2192 't80'\n\nSo, NT55 can produce 't80'. So, to get 't80' at the end, the last non-terminal must produce it via NT55. But in our string, the last symbol is 't80', which must come from a production that ends with 't80', which is from NT55.\n\nSo that suggests that the last step in the derivation is something like NT55 \u2192 't80'. So in reverse, the last two symbols could be a combination leading to NT55.\n\nWait, no, in the string, it's just t80, but in the grammar, it's the last symbol, so it must come from a terminal, which could be from NT55.\n\nSo, proceeding, the last symbol is 't80', which must come from NT55.

The string is \"t34 t86 t40 t25 t55 t74 t74 t56 t8 t35 t37 t40 t87 t79\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar, which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make it easier to parse using CYK or similar methods, but maybe I can backtrack from the string.\n\nEach symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal in the grammar. Let's check each symbol in the string against the terminals listed in the grammar. The terminal symbols are: t34, t86, t40, t25, t55, t74, t79, t56, t8, t35, t37, t40, t87. \n\nWait, I see all these terminals in the grammar. For example, t8 is a terminal, as is t46, t22, etc. So all symbols in the string are terminals present in the grammar. That doesn't necessarily mean it's correct, but it's a start.\n\nNow, I'll try to see how the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's write the string as a sequence: t34, t86, t40, t25, t55, t74, t74, t56, t8, t35, t37, t40, t87, t79.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production on the left side has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So the start symbol S is S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nLet me break this down. The first two symbols should be NT29 and NT46, but the string starts with t34, which is a terminal. So either NT29 produces t34 or another non-terminal that eventually produces t34.\n\nLooking at NT29's production: NT29 \u2192 't53'. Oh, wait, no\u2014it's a non-terminal, but in the provided grammar, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar again:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nOh, right. So NT29 is a non-terminal that directly produces t53. So the first step is that S \u2192 NT29 NT46 becomes t53 NT46. But the first symbol of the string is t34, not t53. That seems problematic. \n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the string's first symbol is t34, but according to the grammar, the first production for S is NT29 \u2192 t53. So the first step would produce t53 NT46, but the string starts with t34. That suggests that perhaps the parse tree isn't correctly aligned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the terminal t34 is produced by another non-terminal that eventually leads to it. Let me see which non-terminals produce t34. Looking at the grammar, NT70 \u2192 't54', but wait, that's NT70 \u2192 t54. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe through other productions.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see how the string can be formed.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to draw the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, the string is t34... Let me think. Maybe t34 is produced by NT70, but NT70 \u2192 t54. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t34 is part of a longer chain. Let's see the production hierarchy.\n\nLooking for symbols that can lead to t34.\n\nWait, no, t34 is a terminal symbol. Looking through the grammar, I see NT70 \u2192 t54, but that's not t34. Wait, no, maybe I'm wrong\u2014NT70's production is NT70 \u2192 t54? Or is it another option?\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nNT70 -> t54\n\nSo NT70 directly produces t54. But in the string, we have t34, so unless there's a non-terminal that can produce t34, it's not possible. But looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t34?\n\nI don't see any non-terminal in the grammar with a production to t34. All the terminal symbols are like t53, t86, etc. So if the string has t34, but no non-terminal can produce t34, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The grammar's terminal list is:\n\nt8, t35, t37, t40, t87, t74, t79, t56, t8, etc. So wait, the string has t34, which is a terminal, but according to the grammar provided, there is no production that leads to t34 as a terminal. That would mean the string cannot be generated because it contains a symbol that isn't in the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions, I don't see any production that directly results in 't34'. So if the string has 't34', that's not possible. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The non-terminals are all the NTs. The terminals are all the others like t8, t35, etc. Since none of the NTs have t34 as a production, it's impossible for t34 to appear in any derived string.\n\nTherefore, the string contains a terminal that's not produced by any production in the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal symbol 't34', which is not present in any production rule of the grammar.

So the only way to produce a terminal is if a rule ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that the grammar may not have any production rules directly producing 't49'.

For example, NT25 produces t73, NT87 can go to t74, t95, t35, etc., as per:\n\nNT87 \u2192 't74', 't95', 't35'.\n\nAnother NT87: NT87 \u2192 't74', 't95', 't35'?\n\nWait, looking at the production rules again:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT87:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the production rules provided:\n\nThe first bunch of rules, like:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n... etc.\n\nLooking through, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't49'. So perhaps 't49' is produced by a non-terminal that doesn't have a direct production, which would imply that the string cannot be derived, meaning the answer is No. But that can't be, because the string includes t49, so maybe 't49' must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all possible rules for any that produce 't49' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any non-terminal directly mapping to 't49'.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should help in parsing.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol, it's S. The production for S is S -> NT29 NT46. Both NT29 and NT46 are non-terminals. So the string should start with the strings derived from NT29 and NT46.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t22 t74 t34 t20 t20 t87 t35 t96 t4 t56 t94 t73 t8 t21 t10.\n\nLet's start by matching the first part. The first symbol is t22. Looking through the NT rules, where does t22 come from? Looking at the NT definitions, I see NT22 has productions:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70, NT22 -> NT53 NT45, and NT22 -> NT92 NT31.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me check again. The NT22 rule is given as:\n\nNT22 -> NT22 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nWait, but I'm looking for where t22 is. Oh, wait, looking at the NT definitions, I see that some NTs are terminals. Like NT46 becomes 't55' in the NT46 rule. Similarly, NT22 is a terminal.\n\nWait no, actually in the NT definitions, some of them are terminals. Let me check each one:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT22's production is given as NT22 -> NT38 NT70, etc. But looking at the terminals:\n\nFor example, NT8 -> 't4', NT16 -> 't38', NT31 -> 't49', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each NT to its terminal or further productions. It might be a bit messy, but perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down by each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by trying to parse the string using the parse tree based on the grammar.\n\nBut since the string is quite long (15 symbols), I need to see if it can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet me first write down the string again:\n\nt22 t74 t34 t20 t20 t87 t35 t96 t4 t56 t94 t73 t8 t21 t10.\n\nLet me try to match from the start symbol S -> NT29 NT46.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be the results of NT29 and NT46.\n\nFirst, NT29: Looking at the grammar, NT29's production is NT29 -> 't53'. So NT29 produces 't53'. But the first token in the string is 't22', not 't53', so that's a problem. Wait, that can't be right. So if NT29 is a terminal 't53' but the string starts with 't22', that would mean that the string is not starting with the leftmost symbol. So that would imply that the string is invalid because the first symbol must be 't53', not 't22'.\n\nWait, that's a big point. Let me check: NT29 is derived from S, so the first token should be the result of NT29. Since NT29 -> 't53', it should produce 't53'. But the string starts with 't22', not 't53', so that immediately suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT22, NT25, etc.) produces exactly two other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.

Then NT13 is a terminal 't31'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't53', which I just concluded comes from NT53. But to get 't53', we have to have NT53 expanding into 't53' (but looking at the rules, I don't see a rule for NT53 that directly produces 't53'.

The string is \"t21 t22 t96 t10 t61 t40 t74 t53 t87 t31 t22 t56 t37 t40 t73 t37\". \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I can see that all the rules seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT46 is a single non-terminal splitting into two, so that's good.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which terminals are present. For instance, NT40 \u2192 't80' and there's also NT40 \u2192 't4'. Wait, in the string, I see \"t40\", so I need to check which production corresponds to that. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't4' and also NT40 \u2192 't80' and NT40 \u2192 't4', but wait, checking the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT67 -> 't87'\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules provided, I realize that NT40 has two production rules: NT40 -> NT84 NT67 and NT40 -> 't4'. So the string has \"t40\", which must come from NT40. But the production is either NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67 or NT40 \u2192 't4'. So 't40' can't come directly from NT40 because NT40 can't produce 't40'; it can produce 't71' via NT84 and NT67 as their terminals.\n\nWait, but the string includes \"t40\" at position 5. So \"t40\" in the string is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT40 can produce either two non-terminals or 't4'. So how do we get \"t40\"?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Looking back, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking for NT40's productions:\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT67 -> 't87'\n\nSo NT84 and NT67 can eventually produce 't71' and 't87', respectively. Therefore, the only way NT40 can produce terminals is through those paths, which would be 't71' and 't87', but the string includes 't40', which isn't directly produced by NT40. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the given grammar, NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87, which both have further productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has \"t40\" where NT40 can only produce 't4' or two non-terminals. But in the string, I have 't40' as a terminal. How does that happen?\n\nWait, in the string, the part with 't40' is \"t40\", so that must be a terminal. But according to the grammar, NT40 can't produce 't40' directly. Its production rules don't include a terminal 't40', only 't4' and other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if I got the productions correctly.

The string is `t34 t79 t18 t8 t18 t25 t53 t95 t21 t79 t95 t34 t18 t10 t49 t96 t37`. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, especially when using algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I might not need to use that here since I can directly try to parse the string.\n\nLooking at the initial production rule, the start symbol is S, and S expands to NT29 NT46. So the string must start with t29 and t46. Wait, no\u2014wait, the grammar's NT symbols might map to the t strings. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the NT rules are all on the left, and the right-hand sides can be terminals or other non-terminals. So, the start symbol S will ultimately produce a sequence of terminals because each production seems to lead to terminals or other non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT46 can produce either 't10' directly or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me clarify: in this grammar, each production for a non-terminal (NT) is either two other NTs or a single terminal. So to generate a string of terminals, the entire production must resolve all non-terminals to terminals.\n\nSo the process involves traceable from the start symbol S down to the given string.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nThe string starts with `t34 t79 ...`, but I think it's split into tokens, so each `tXXX` is a single symbol, e.g., t34 is a terminal, t79 is another, etc.\n\nSo, first, I need to see how S can produce a string. The starting production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with t29 and t46. Wait, but looking at the grammar, NT29 produces 't53' according to one of the rules.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing because I can apply the CYK algorithm or check the leftmost derivations, but since the string is manageable, I can also try a top-down approach manually.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46. So the first two symbols in the string must be produced by these non-terminals. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are \"t31\" and \"t61\". So, I need to check if NT29 can produce \"t31\" and NT46 can produce \"t61\".\n\nLooking at the productions for NT29 and NT46:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n- NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT40. So, NT29 can split into NT53 and NT40.\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 or NT45.\n\nFirst, let's check NT53 and NT40:\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55 (from the list, I see NT53 -> NT13 NT55, which is correct).\n- NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67 or NT45.\n\nWait, actually, let's see the productions for NT31 and NT46:\n\nWait, the string starts with t31, t61, so NT29 must produce t31, and NT46 must produce t61.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: it can only go to NT53 and NT40, so no direct terminal. So, the only way is if NT53 can produce t31, but looking at NT53, it's NT13 -> NT55, which is a problem because I don't see a direct terminal from NT13. Wait no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT53 NT40. So NT29's first production is NT53 and NT40.\n\nNow, NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. So NT53 is NT13 and NT55.\n\nLooking at the terminals listed:\n\nNT13 can only produce t31, because in the given list, NT13 \u2192 t31.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT13 is defined as NT13 -> t31. So if NT53 can lead to t31, that would require NT13 to produce t31, but wait, NT13 is a non-terminal that directly produces t31. So, if NT53 can produce t31, that would require the derivation of NT53 \u2192 ... \u2192 t31.\n\nBut hold on, in NT53's production, it's NT13 and NT55. So NT53 can't directly produce a terminal, since both NT13 and NT55 are non-terminals. Therefore, this path might not be possible because NT53 can't produce a terminal on terminal symbols alone. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014NT53 is a non-terminal that only produces NT13 and NT55, so unless those can produce terminals, NT53 can't produce a terminal. But in the given list, NT31 is a non-terminal that directly produces t31. Wait, but the string starts with t31, which is a terminal. So for NT29 to produce t31, it must be via a production that directly includes a terminal, but looking at NT29's productions, it's only NT53 and NT40, which don't produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In the grammar, a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly only if there's a production rule like A \u2192 a. So in this case, NT31 \u2192 t31. So the non-terminal NT31 can produce t31. But in the main derivation, the string starts with t31, but the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which would need to produce two non-terminals, so their productions would lead to two terminals. But t31 is a single terminal, not a pair. So perhaps this can't be correct.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is that NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT40, and then NT53 might produce t31 through NT13, but that's not straightforward because NT53 doesn't directly produce t31. Let me try to clarify:\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for NTx \u2192 a:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\nNo, wait, it says NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45? Wait, in the given list, I see:\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\nWait, no, let me look again:\n\nWait the grammar is as follows:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT22 NT38? Wait, looking at the input line:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nLine starting with NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nSimilarly, another line: NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nWait, so NT22 has two productions: one to NT53 NT45 and another to NT92 NT31.\n\nBut in any case, I'm focusing on the initial split of S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nSo S must produce NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, the string starts with t31, which is the first symbol. So the first non-terminal must produce t31. So either NT29 produces t31 or NT46 produces t31. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT40, which are both non-terminals, so unless there's another production for NT29 that directly produces a terminal, then it can't produce t31. Looking through the grammar, does NT29 have a direct production to a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\nDo I see NT29 \u2192 a? It seems no; all of NT29's productions are to combinations of non-terminals. So NT29 can't produce a terminal. Then, the first symbol t31 must come from NT46, because S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so one of these must produce t31.\n\nSo checking NT46's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT46 has several productions:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT45, or NT46.\n\nLooking for a production that includes a terminal.

The string is `t18 t36 t87 t40 t31 t37 t49 t20 t86 t35 t18 t20 t10 t71 t18 t79 t40 t87`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be parsed using methods like recursive descent or the CYK algorithm, but since this is a bit complicated, I think a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT29 NT46. So the string must start with t53 and t46 because NT29 -> 't53' and NT46 has multiple possibilities, but one of them is 't46'. \n\nWait, checking NT46, it can expand to several things. Let me check the productions for NT46: Oh, I see NT46 -> 't46' is indeed one of them. So the first part of the string needs to start with 't53' followed by 't46'. Let's check the string: the first token is 't18', which doesn't match 't53' or 't46'. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. The start symbol S is NT29 NT46. NT29 is 't53', so the parse tree should start with t53. But the string starts with t18. That's conflicting. Unless I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT29 NT46, but in the parse tree, each NT can be replaced by their expansions. Maybe the expansions can lead to the given string. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S -> NT29 NT46, which expands to t53 and some token. But the string starts with t18, which is not t53. So that makes me think the string doesn't start correctly, meaning it's not generated by the grammar.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look deeper. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't18'. Is there a NT that directly produces 't18'? Checking the productions, I see NT51 -> 't40', NT45 -> 't37', NT31 -> 't8', NT51 -> 't18' (wait, looking at the rules: NT51 -> 't40' and NT51 -> 't18'? Let me check the rules again. Yes, in the grammar, NT51 has two productions: NT51 -> 't40' and NT51 -> 't18'. So 't18' can come from NT51. So first token, 't18', could be from NT51.\n\nNow, the second token is 't36'. Let's see what expands to t36. Looking through the rules, I see NT22 -> 't36'? Wait, checking NT22, it has various production rules. Looking through, I don't see a direct production for 't36'. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check all NT22 productions: NT22->NT38 NT70, NT25 ... Wait, in the initial list, NT22 also has a production 't96' and others. Or is there a direct 't36'? No, I don't see a production for NT22 that directly gives 't36'. Hmm, maybe it's part of a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the second token is part of a production that comes later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Since the start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT46, and both need to be expanded. NT29 is 't53', and NT46 can be 't46', but if in the string, maybe the first token is part of a longer expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the split is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the string as a sequence that can be grouped into two parts, each part being the result of NT29 and NT46 expansions respectively. So first, parse the string as A B, where A is derived from NT29 and B from NT46.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: NT29 appears in several rules, like S -> NT29 NT46, and also other NT29 rules like NT29 -> NT22 NT14. So perhaps the string is built by expanding NT29 and NT46 each into a sequence of tokens.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t18. As I found, t18 can come from NT51. But if NT29 is supposed to generate t53, then t18 can't be part of NT29. So that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in thinking that S immediately splits into NT29 and NT46. Wait, the production S is S -> NT29 NT46, which would require that the entire string is generated by these two NTs combined. So each is a separate branch in the parse tree.\n\nSo, perhaps I should split the string into two parts and see if each part can be derived from NT29 and NT46 respectively.\n\nBut with 19 tokens, that might be complicated. Let me see if I can find a way to parse the entire string by breaking it down step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree recursively. I can try to find the first step: the entire string must be split into two parts, corresponding to NT29 and NT46. Each of these needs to be derivable into their respective trees.\n\nLet's look at the first token in the string, 't18'. As established, 't18' can come from NT51, perhaps. But NT29 is supposed to produce 't53' or more expansions. Wait, perhaps I need to find a longer path.\n\nWait, maybe I should start with S -> NT29 NT46, so the string must be derivable from the concatenation of the two subtrees of NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me consider each NT29 and NT46 as separate units.\n\nFirst, let's consider NT29. Its productions include S itself, so it might need multiple expansions. But let's see what it can produce.\n\nLooking at NT29's rules:\n\nNT29 -> NT22 NT14\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 also has direct 't96' which might be useful.\n\nWait, but if I'm trying to get 't18' as the first token, maybe that's from NT29. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for the production to be split into multiple NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the first part of the string as the expansion of NT29 and the second part as the expansion of NT46.\n\nTaking the string: t18 t36 t87 t40 t31 t37 t49 t20 t86 t35 t18 t20 t10 t71 t18 t79 t40 t87.\n\nWe can attempt to split it into two parts that match NT29's and NT46's expansions.\n\nLooking for possible splits, perhaps the first part ends with 't35' which is part of NT25 -> NT22 NT14 and other rules. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making this too complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to model the stack in a pushdown parser. Starting with S on the stack, and processing each token. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two symbols on the right, making it efficient for a recursive descent parser.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can process the string step by step, checking for possible expansions. Let me try that.\n\nThe first token is 't18'. From earlier, t18 can come from NT51. So let's see: NT51 can be T. Let me check the rules for NT51: it seems to have production NT51 -> 't40' and NT51 -> 't18'. So 't18' can be used as an atomic step.\n\nWait, but in the context of NT29, which is supposed to expand into other NTs. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial mistake was assuming that S directly becomes NT29 NT46, but what if the start symbol produces more NTs in sequence? No, I think in this case, S is replaced directly by NT29 NT46, so both must be expanded to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the entire string is a concatenation of two parts: one from NT29 and one from NT46. So, I can split the string into two parts and check each.\n\nLet me try splitting the string into two halves. The entire string has 19 tokens, so perhaps the first 10 tokens come from NT29 and the latter 9 from NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-286","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar consists of. CNF means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, all the rules indeed fit this structure.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string `t61 t21 t37 t21 t94 t80 t35 t25 t80 t95 t8 t96 t79 t73 t21 t40 t4 t61` can be generated by this grammar. To do this, I think I should try to parse the string using the given rules, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar produces NT29 NT46. So the first part of the string should derive from these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t61, which is the first part of the first production. Wait, no, the string is a series of tokens, so let me count them. The string has 17 tokens. Each step in the derivation should consume a part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like applying the productions step by step and checking if the string can be derived.\n\nLet me try to write down the string and see how the non-terminals might fit. The string is: t61, t21, t37, t21, t94, t80, t35, t25, t80, t95, t8, t96, t79, t73, t21, t40, t4, t61.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the initial step is to split the string into two parts: the first part derived from NT29 and the second from NT46. But I'm not sure how to split the string yet. Maybe I can backtrack once I have more information.\n\nLet me list all the production rules to see how the non-terminals can expand into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT55. NT13 \u2192 NT31, and NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, and so on. I'm noticing that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT40 \u2192 't80', NT25 \u2192 't73', etc.\n\nPerhaps I can construct a parse tree starting from S and see if each non-terminal can produce the corresponding part of the string.\n\nLet me attempt to break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Let me assume that the first part of the string is generated by NT29 and the second by NT46. So, the string starts with NT29 generating 't61', then the second part 't21'.\n\nWait, but NT29 might produce multiple terminals. Looking at the rules, NT29 \u2192 't53'. Wait, no, NT29 \u2192 't53'? Let me check the rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT29 beyond the ones provided. Wait, looking again, the rules for NT29 are:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nWait, no, wait, looking at the list:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nWait, no, wait, the list given is:\n\nLooking through the NT22, NT25, etc., I see NT29 \u2192 't53'.\n\nSo if NT29 \u2192 't53', then the first part of the string must begin with 't53', but the string starts with 't61'. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if the string starts with t61, but NT29 \u2192 t53, which is different. So maybe I misassigned the production.\n\nWait, maybe the start symbol isn't S but the string is broken into parts by NT29 and NT46, and each of those can produce multiple terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by seeing if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the terminals derived from each non-terminal.\n\nLet me try another approach: see if each non-terminal production can generate the corresponding terminal.\n\nLet's look at S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nSo the string should have a split point where NT29 produces a certain sequence, and NT46 produces the rest.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 can produce t4 and t61, according to the rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT46 has several productions:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10', 't55', etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT46 production rules:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't10' and NT46 \u2192 't55', among others. Also, NT46 \u2192 't61' appears twice: once under NT46 \u2192 't61' and another under NT49 \u2192 't61'.\n\nWait, so the string ends with t61, which could be from NT46.\n\nSo the last part could be generated by NT46.\n\nSimilarly, the first part is generated by NT29. Let me check the production of NT29.\n\nFrom the rules, NT29 \u2192 't53' and also NT29 \u2192 something else? Wait, looking back:\n\nYes, the grammar shows NT29 \u2192 't53' and also NT29 \u2192 't29' is not present, so it's only NT29 \u2192 't53'.\n\nWait no, looking at the rule for NT29, I think I may have misread. Wait, the provided grammar has NT29 \u2192 't53'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking through the list, the rule NT29 \u2192 't53' is present, right? So if NT29 produces 't53', then the first token in the string is t61, which doesn't match 't53', so that can't be right.\n\nHmm. So maybe the initial assumption about how to split is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me go through the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the production rules. Let me make a list.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, etc.\n\nLooking at NT29:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53' (I think that's correct from the provided rules)\n- Also, looking at NT29 in the rules, I don't see any other productions besides NT29 \u2192 't53'. So it only produces 't53'.\n\nSimilarly, NT46:\n\n- 't10', 't55', 't61' (appears twice), and others, but let me count.\n\nWait, the provided rules include NT46 \u2192 't10', NT46 \u2192 't55', and then under other non-terminals, like NT49 \u2192 't61', and NT29 \u2192 't53' \u2014 but is NT46 also directly producing 't61' via another rule? Or is the 't61' a typo?\n\nWait, no. Looking again, under the grammar provided, I see that NT46 has the following rules:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10', 't55', and also it appears under some other non-terminals, but not directly as NT46 \u2192 't61'. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT49 \u2192 't86' \u2192 no, that's under NT49.\n- Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up NT46 and NT49.\n\nWait, let me redo this.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNow, looking at NT29, seems to produce 't53' only.\n\nThen NT46 has productions. Let me list them:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT46 \u2192 't10' (same as above)\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT46 \u2192 't38'?\nWait, no. Wait, let me re-examine. The provided rules:\n\nAh, I missed some. Let me list all rules for NT46:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, under NT46:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- Also, under NT46 \u2192 NT40 NT25\n  - NT40 \u2192 't84' etc. Wait, that's a production to NTs.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I think the list includes several NT46 productions:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT46 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string I'm given is `t34 t54 t94 t71 t94 t55 t54 t95 t34 t8 t8 t36 t49 t22 t34 t36 t79 t54 t4`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning. The string starts with `t34`, so I need to find a production rule for `t34`. Looking at the grammar, I see that `NT84 -> t71`, but that's not directly helpful here. Wait, actually, looking again, `NT54` is not listed as a terminal. Hmm, maybe I need to trace back the rules.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last few tokens are `... t54 t4`. I see that in the grammar, `NT40 -> t84`, but `t84` is in the grammar as a term. Wait, actually, `t84` is a terminal? Or is `t84` a non-terminal? No, looking at the grammar, all the production rules have non-terminals on the left, and on the right, some are terminals. For example, `NT40 -> t84`, which means that 't84' is a terminal.\n\nSo, when the string has `t84`, that's a terminal, so it can't be further expanded. Similarly, for `t54`, I see that NT55 -> t80 and another production like NT71 -> t40. Wait, but in the string, I have `t54`. Is `t54` a terminal? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where something expands to 't54', so that suggests that 't54' is a terminal. Wait, but in the string, it's a token, so maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, the string is `t34 t54 t94 t71 t94 t55 t54 t95 t34 t8 t8 t36 t49 t22 t34 t36 t79 t54 t4`. So each of these is a terminal symbol, but I'm not sure if all of them are terminals. For example, 't71' is in the grammar as NT71 -> t40 and NT83? Wait, no, NT71 is not present. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT71 -> t40, so 't71' would be a terminal, but in the string, I have `t71` as a token. So that would correspond to the production NT71 -> 't71' perhaps, but I don't see that exact rule. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT71 -> t40, which means it expands to 't40', so 't71' would not be a terminal, but in the string, we have `t71` as a separate token, which doesn't match any rule unless it's a terminal. But in the grammar, NT71 is a non-terminal, so perhaps in this case, 't71' is a terminal, but I'm not sure. Hmm, that's a point of confusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this by building a parse tree starting from the root symbol S. But S is NT, right? No, wait, the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT46. Wait, so S expands into two non-terminals, NT29 and NT46. So the initial string must be split into two parts, each corresponding to the two non-terminals.\n\nSo the entire string must be parsed by first checking if it can be split into two parts, each part corresponding to NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo let me try to split the string into two parts. The string is:\n\n1. t34\n2. t54\n3. t94\n4. t71\n5. t94\n6. t55\n7. t54\n8. t95\n9. t34\n10. t8\n11. t8\n12. t36\n13. t49\n14. t22\n15. t34\n16. t36\n17. t79\n18. t54\n19. t4\n\nIf the entire string can be divided into two parts corresponding to NT29 and NT46, then S can generate the whole string. So let's see.\n\nFirst, NT29 -> NT according to the grammar? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT29 is a non-terminal because on the left side of the rule, it's on the left side of the production. Looking at the production rules:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't84' \u2014 so this is a terminal\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10' \u2014 another terminal\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71' \u2014 another terminal\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\n\nWait, so in the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT46. So to derive the string, the first step is S -> NT29 NT46. So the entire string must be split into two parts: the first part must be derivable from NT29, and the second part from NT46.\n\nSo I need to find a way to split the string into two parts, let's say part A and part B, such that A can be derived from NT29 and B from NT46.\n\nLooking at the entire string, perhaps I can divide it into the first part and the second part. Let's try.\n\nFirst, the string is 19 tokens long. So I need to try different splits. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nLet's start with S -> NT29 NT46.\n\nSo we need to parse the string into two parts: part A (starting with the first token) must match NT29, and part B (remaining tokens) must match NT46.\n\nWait, but it's a two-part structure, so we need to have the entire string as A concatenated with B, where A is a derivation from NT29 and B from NT46.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can try building the parse tree from the top down.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Maybe an approach is to split the string into A and B, and then check if A can be generated by NT29 and B by NT46.\n\nSo let's try splitting the string into A and B in a way that each part can be parsed.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first several tokens are 't34 t54 t94 t71 t94 t55 t54 t95'. Let's see how long that is. Wait, maybe I should try splitting the string at different points.\n\nAlternatively, let's start by seeing what rules the non-terminals NT29 and NT46 can lead to.\n\nLooking at NT29: in the grammar, NT29 -> NT38 NT70.\n\nSo NT29 must expand into NT38 followed by NT70.\n\nSo for the first part A, it should start with NT38 and then NT70.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't34'. Wait, but that might be part of NT38. Let me check.\n\nLooking up production rules:\n\nNT38 -> 't94' as a terminal.\n\nWait, so if NT38 can produce 't94', then perhaps the string starts with that."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

No. Line 28 is NT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nSo that means NT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t74, but NT29 only produces t53.

So the string should be [NT29's expansion] [NT46's expansion].\n\nThe given string is t74 followed by t49, etc., but if NT29 \u2192 t53, then the first token should be t53, not t74.

Let me go through each rule carefully:\n\nLooking at the grammar again:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70 | NT25\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14 | NT22 NT92 | NT49 | NT71 | NT87 | NT55\n\nNT38 -> t94\n\nNT55 -> t80\n\nNT29 -> t53\n\nNT22 -> t96 | t53 | t31 | t18 | t79 | t54 | t71\n\nNT8 -> t4\n\nNT14 -> t56\n\nNT25 -> t73 | t87 | t31 | t18\n\nNT46 -> t10 | t55\n\nNT31 -> t8 | t51 | t8 | t55\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-341","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for simplifying the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze and sometimes aiding in parsing algorithms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules are of the form like S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which seems like each non-terminal is combined with another to produce the next level of expansion. Some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT40 \u2192 't80' and NT8 \u2192 't4'. \n\nThe string we're testing is `t18 t4 t37 t61 t36 t35 t80 t80 t53 t40 t87 t8 t95 t18 t53 t74 t71 t61 t96 t21 t56`. I notice that it's a series of 't's followed by numbers, which likely correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nThe approach to solving this might involve tracing the derivation of the string starting from the start symbol S. Each step involves expanding non-terminals into their respective productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and see their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, NT92 NT31, NT92 NT45, NT53 NT45\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, NT49 NT91, NT25 \u2192 't73'\n- NT31 \u2192 't49', NT14 \u2192 't56', NT91 \u2192 't55', NT70 \u2192 't54', NT51 \u2192 't40', NT45 \u2192 't37', NT8 \u2192 't4', NT46 \u2192 't10', NT87 \u2192 't74', NT67 \u2192 't87', NT84 \u2192 't71', NT29 \u2192 't53', NT22 \u2192 't96', NT92 \u2192 't25', NT85 \u2192 't35', NT38 \u2192 't94', NT55 \u2192 't80', NT87 \u2192 't20', NT31 \u2192 't8', NT51 \u2192 't18', NT87 \u2192 't79', NT46 \u2192 't55', NT31 \u2192 't95', NT46 \u2192 't61', NT49 \u2192 't86', NT70 \u2192 't34', NT84 \u2192 't36', NT13 \u2192 't31', NT55 \u2192 't21'\n\nSo, the string starts with t18. Looking at the rules, 't18' is produced by NT51. So, the first part is NT51.\n\nLooking at NT51's productions: it can go to 't40' or 't18'. Since the string starts with 't18', NT51 must expand to 't18'. So that's the first step.\n\nNext, the string is now followed by t4. So after 't18' comes 't4'. Let's see, 't4' is produced by NT8. So after 't18', the next non-terminal to expand is NT8.\n\nWait, but the string after 't18' is 't4 t37...'. So the sequence is 't18 t4 ...'. Let's think about how this could happen.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT29 NT46. So S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Each of these non-terminals needs to produce the corresponding part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t18 could be from NT51, which we've covered. Then the next t4 would need to come from NT8, which requires NT8 \u2192 't4'. So how does NT29 NT46 relate to that?\n\nWait, S is NT29 NT46, which means both NT29 and NT46 need to produce part of the string. So let's consider:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nBut wait, 't53' is produced by NT29, and 't10' by NT46. Then how does that fit into the string? The string starts with t18, which is from NT51, but S is producing NT29 NT46, so perhaps the initial breakdown is different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The entire string is the concatenation of the productions. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be the concatenation of the outputs of the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze the entire string:\n\nt18 t4 t37 t61 t36 t35 t80 t80 t53 t40 t87 t8 t95 t18 t53 t74 t71 t61 t96 t21 t56\n\nWe need to trace how each part of this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So NT29 and NT46 must together produce the entire string.\n\nBut let's break the string into two parts, perhaps: the first part corresponds to NT29's production, and the second part to NT46's.\n\nWait, maybe I should split the string into two segments assigned to NT29 and NT46.\n\nAlternatively, considering that NT29 and NT46 could produce parts of the string in any order, but since NT29 and NT46 are separate, the entire string is the concatenation of what NT29 produces and what NT46 produces.\n\nBut how do we know how to split the string between them? Since each non-terminal can generate a sequence, perhaps the entire string must be the concatenation of two sequences, one generated by NT29 and the other by NT46.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the structure step by step.\n\nLet's assign S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT29 generates and what NT46 generates. So let's split the string into two parts. Let's see, the first part is up to a certain length where NT29 would generate, followed by NT46 generating the rest.\n\nWait, that might be more systematic. Let's attempt that.\n\nSuppose the string is split into two parts: A and B, where A is generated by NT29 and B is generated by NT46. So A concatenated with B should be the given string.\n\nI need to figure out where to split the string so that A is generated by NT29 and B by NT46.\n\nLet's look at NT29's rules: NT29 \u2192 't53'. Hmm, so if the entire A is just 't53', then NT29 would produce it. Alternatively, NT29 can expand into other non-terminals, but in this case, looking at the given grammar, let's see all NT29's productions:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, I provided:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT29 directly produces 't53'. Therefore, if A is just 't53', then the rest must be generated by NT46.\n\nSo let's see: the string is:\n\nt18 t4 t37 t61 t36 t35 t80 t80 t53 t40 t87 t8 t95 t18 t53 t74 t71 t61 t96 t21 t56\n\nIf A is the first 't53', then the rest is:\n\nt4 t37 t61 t36 t35 t80 t80 t40 t87 t8 t95 t18 t53 t74 t71 t61 t96 t21 t56\n\nThis would be generated by NT46. Let's see how that could be possible.\n\nBut wait, S is NT29 NT46, so NT29 produces 't53' and NT46 produces the rest. So the entire string is 't53' followed by what NT46 produces.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't18', not 't53'. So that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-363","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t37 t79 t18 t22 t56 t79 t37 t87 t34 t86 t35 t86 t54 t35 t56 t21 t54 t40 t36 t96 t95 t49\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is split into tokens with spaces, so each token is a separate element.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string is constructed by replacing S with the RHS, which is NT29 NT46. That means the first step would be to expand S into NT29 and NT46. Each of these non-terminals can then be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with \"t37\" and ends with \"t49\". Each \"t\" followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol. I'll need to see if these terminals appear in the correct order based on the production rules.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that produce terminals because those are the leaves in the parse tree. For example, NT51 \u2192 't22' is one such rule. Each rule with a terminal tells us what a non-terminal can produce.\n\nI'll start by looking for the terminals in the string to see if they match any non-terminals that can produce them. For example, \"t37\" is a terminal, so according to the grammar, there's a non-terminal that produces it. Looking through the rules, I see NT38 \u2192 't94', but that's not 37. Wait, looking again, I see NT46 has multiple rules, like NT46 \u2192 't10', 't55', 't55' again, and others like NT45 \u2192 't37'. Ah, there it is: NT45 \u2192 't37'.\n\nSo if the string starts with \"t37\", that suggests that one of the non-terminals in the derivation must be NT45. Let me check if NT45 appears in the grammar. Yes, under NT45, it's replaced by 't37'.\n\nBut how do we get to NT45? Let me see. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the first expansion is NT29 and NT46. Now, looking at NT29: according to the rules, NT29 \u2192 't53'. So the first terminal after S would be 't53', not 't37'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't37'. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. The string is \"t37\" as the first token, but S \u2192 NT29 NT46 implies that the first step is to produce 't53' from NT29 and then from NT46. So the first part would be 't53', but the string starts with 't37', which isn't 53. So perhaps this is incorrect. Maybe I need to backtrack or consider other production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by expanding the non-terminals in a different order. Let's consider that the production rules can be applied in any order as long as each rule is applied to a single non-terminal at a time.\n\nSo starting from S:\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\nThen, we need to expand NT29 and NT46. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nFrom NT29:\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nFrom NT46:\nNT46 \u2192 't10', 't55', 't61', 't95', 't54', 't40', 't35', 't55', 't37', etc. Wait, NT46 can produce 't37' via NT46 \u2192 't37'? Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT46 \u2192 't10', 't55', 't61', 't95', 't54', 't40', 't35', 't55', 't37'. So yes, one of the options is 't37' from NT46.\n\nBut the string starts with 't37', so perhaps the first expansion of NT46 is 't37'. Then, what comes next?\n\nAfter NT29 \u2192 't53' and NT46 \u2192 't37', the string would start with 't53 t37', but in the given string, it's 't37 t79...'. That doesn't match. So perhaps that's not the case. Maybe I'm getting the order wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is done depth-first, so perhaps NT29 is expanded first to 't53', but in the string, the first token is 't37', which is from NT46, so perhaps the NT46 is being expanded before NT29.\n\nWait, that can't be because in the initial step, S \u2192 NT29 NT46; you can't expand one before the other until both are fully expanded. So maybe that's not possible. Unless in some way the NT46 is allowed to be partially expanded before NT29.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT29 or NT46 can be expanded to include more non-terminals that can produce the required terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, building a parse tree.\n\nLet's list the string again: t37 t79 t18 t22 t56 t79 t37 t87 t34 t86 t35 t86 t54 t35 t56 t21 t54 t40 t36 t96 t95 t49.\n\nI'll try to match these terminals with the possible non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the earliest token: 't37'. From the grammar, I see NT46 \u2192 't37' is one of the rules. So we can have NT46 produce 't37'.\n\nBut how do we get to NT46? S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so both NT29 and NT46 are non-terminals that must expand outwards.\n\nWait, but maybe one of them expands to 't37' directly, and the other is expanded deeper. Let's think about the order of expansion. Perhaps after S, we have NT29 expanding to 't53' (if we apply the rule NT29 \u2192 't53'), and then the NT46 would need to expand to something that starts with 't79', 't18', etc.\n\nBut wait, the first token is 't37', so maybe that's the expansion of NT46, but then after that, the other non-terminal (NT29) would generate 't53', but the string starts with 't37'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't37', which is from NT46, and then the rest of the string comes from the expansion of NT29 and the other parts.\n\nLet me try to look for possible expansions that start with 't37'. So, starting with NT46 \u2192 't37'.\n\nBut then, in the string after 't37' is 't79', so the next expansion would need to generate 't79', which is part of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any non-terminal that can produce 't79' and is connected to 't37'? Let's see. Perhaps NT49 can produce 't79'? Looking at NT49's rules: NT49 \u2192 't86', 't36'. Hmm, not 79.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let's go back to the start:\n\nThe string starts with t37, then t79, t18, t22, t56, t79, t37, t87, etc.\n\nIf t37 is produced by NT46, then what comes after? Maybe the next parts involve expanding other non-terminals that can produce t79.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce t79.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any directly. Let me check:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10', 't55', 't61', 't95', 't54', 't40', 't35', 't55', 't37' \u2014 no t79.\n\nWait, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT46 is involved in some productions, but are there any where NT46 is on the left and becomes a terminal?\n\nLet me look:\n\n- NT25->'t73'\n\n- NT22->'t96'\n\nWait, but NT22's production can go to 't96', but that's when NT22 is the left-hand side. So NT22 is a non-terminal, not NT46.\n\nLooking for 't10' in the productions: Yes, I see NT55 -> 't80', and others, but not NT46.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing NT22 and NT46. Let me make sure.\n\nFrom the rules, NT46's productions are only one:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nSo when we have NT46, it splits into NT92 and NT25.\n\nSo for S -> NT29 NT46, that would split into NT29 (t53) and NT46 (which is NT92 NT25). Then, that would be t53, followed by whatever NT92 and NT25 produce.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string starts with t96, but S's first production is t53 followed by NT46. Hmm, but the string starts with t96, which is a terminal, so S must produce something that starts with t96, but according to S's production, it starts with NT29 (t53). That's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests a contradiction. Because S must first produce t53, but the string starts with t96, which is a terminal produced by NT22.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT22, not NT29. Wait, but according to the grammar, S-> NT29 NT46. There's no production that starts S with NT22. So how can the string start with t96, which is a terminal for NT22?\n\nWait a minute, this suggests a problem. Because according to the grammar, the first split is S-> NT29 NT46, which would produce two non-terminals. But in the string, the first token is t96, which is a terminal for NT22.\n\nThis seems impossible unless the starting symbol can somehow produce NT22, but according to S's production, it's fixed as NT29 and NT46. Therefore, the string starting with t96 would imply that NT29 and NT46 need to somehow start with t96, but NT29 is t53, so this can't happen.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the grammar. Let me double-check the initial productions:\n\nLooking back: S-> NT29 NT46\n\nYes, that's the only way to start a derivation. So the first two symbols must be the expansions of NT29 and NT46.\n\nTherefore, the string should start with t53 followed by whatever NT46 produces. But the given string starts with t96, which is a terminal for NT22, not NT29 or NT46.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the given string cannot be generated by the grammar, because the first part of the string starts with t96, which is generated from NT22, but S can't produce NT22 in its first step.\n\nUnless there's a way for S to generate a different part, but no, S only splits into NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo the string must start with t53, but it starts with t96, which is from NT22.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right because in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So maybe I need to re-examine this.\n\nWait, maybe the terminals are being treated as separate rules. In CNF, everything is a non-terminal except for terminals. So, in this case, the rules that produce terminals are like S -> NT29 NT24 or something? Wait, no, the given rules don't include right-hand sides with a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Oh, perhaps the right-hand side is a terminal followed by a non-terminal? But that's not allowed in standard CNF. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions are allowed to have a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. So, NT40 -> 't80' is a valid production in this context because 't80' is a terminal. Similarly, other productions like NT85 -> 't35' or NT29 -> 't53' involve terminals. So, these are allowed because in CNF, each production can have a single non-terminal on the left, and the right-hand side is either a terminal or a non-terminal (but in a context where the next step is a derivation).\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production should have either two non-terminals (since in CNF, every production must be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal). So, S -> NT29 NT24 is a production in two non-terminals on the right, and other productions like NT8 -> 't4' are a terminal on the right. So that fits CNF because they're all either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nOkay, so that makes sense. Now, the string to evaluate is: `t25 t56 t54 t35 t25 t18 t61 t49 t96 t96 t18 t40 t49 t71 t34 t31 t20 t40 t8 t94 t80 t87 t71` \n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT24 (Wait, looking at the grammar, it's S -> NT29 NT24? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the first rule is S -> NT29 NT46. Oh yeah, I was wrong earlier. The rules are:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT46\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n- NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n- NT71 -> NT40 NT85\n- NT40 -> NT84 NT67\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n- NT49 -> NT25 NT87\n- NT16 -> NT38 NT55\n- NT40 -> 't80' <-- This is a terminal production\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT25 -> 't73'\n- NT31 -> 't49'\n- NT14 -> 't56'\n- NT91 -> 't55'\n- NT70 -> 't54'\n- NT51 -> 't40' <-- Hmm, duplicate entry, maybe?\n- NT45 -> 't37'\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n- NT87 -> 't74'\n- NT67 -> 't87' <-- Same as NT87\n- NT84 -> 't71'\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n- NT22 -> 't96'\n- NT92 -> 't25'\n- NT85 -> 't35'\n- NT38 -> 't94'\n- NT55 -> 't80' <-- same as previous NT40->'t80'\n- NT87 -> 't20' <-- new terminal\n- NT31 -> 't8'\n- NT51 -> 't18'\n- NT87 -> 't79' <-- another\n- NT46 -> 't55'\n- NT31 -> 't95'\n- NT46 -> 't61'\n\nWait, some of these seem redundant or conflicting. For example, NT51 -> 't40' appears twice. But perhaps they are meant to be different, but I might need to clarify. However, the terminal productions should be fine as they are. Also, some non-terminals have multiple productions, like NT46.\n\nNow, the string is quite long, with 21 tokens. Let me see how they might fit into the grammar.\n\nTo parse this, I can try performing a top-down or bottom-up derivation, but since the string is given, perhaps it's easier to perform a recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token can be matched to the start symbol S through the productions.\n\nLet me see the overall structure. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT46. So the string should start with the two non-terminals NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first tokens are t25, t56, etc. Wait, but S -> NT29 NT46, which is two non-terminals, so the first two symbols of the string must be the results of NT29 and NT46.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t25, which is a terminal. So that suggests that the first production used is either S or a non-terminal leading to a terminal. Wait, no, because S produces two non-terminals, so the first symbol should be a non-terminal derived from NT29. But in the string, the first token is t25, which is a terminal. That suggests that NT29 must produce t25 directly.\n\nLooking at the NT29 productions: Yes, there's NT29 -> 't53' and 't56'? Wait, let me check. Wait, the given grammar has:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'? No, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, let me correct this. I have to look for all the productions where the non-terminal produces a terminal. Let me list them all:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' (from the list above, yes, I see NT29 -> 't53').\n\nWait, wait, let me go back:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53' (Yes, correct).\n- NT46 -> 't10'.\n- NT85 -> 't35'.\n- NT38 -> 't94'.\n- NT55 -> 't80'.\n- NT87 -> 't74'.\n- NT67 -> 't87'.\n- NT84 -> 't71'.\n- NT29 -> 't53'.\n- NT22 -> 't96'.\n- NT92 -> 't25'.\n- NT85 -> 't35'.\n- NT31 -> 't49'.\n- NT14 -> 't56'.\n- NT91 -> 't55'.\n- NT70 -> 't54'.\n- NT51 -> 't22'.\n- NT45 -> 't37'.\n- NT8 -> 't4'.\n- NT46 -> 't10'.\n- NT87 -> 't20'.\n- NT31 -> 't8'.\n- NT51 -> 't18'.\n- NT87 -> 't79'.\n- NT46 -> 't55'.\n- NT31 -> 't95'.\n- NT46 -> 't61'.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I see that some of these are actually same non-terminals but with different productions. For example, NT46 appears multiple times with different right-hand sides.\n\nBut back to the original string: The first token is 't25'. So 't25' is a terminal, meaning that the first step must be a non-terminal producing 't25'.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, which one leads to 't25'?

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, and the grammar has a lot of production rules. I remember that CNF has each production rule either producing two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the production rules, I notice that many non-terminals (like NT22, NT25, etc.) eventually produce terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers), or other non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT29 and NT46. So the string must start with either 't53' (from NT29) or 't10' (from NT46) because S directly splits into those two.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t86 t25 t18 t49 t96 t25 t71 t94 t94 t35 t55 t73 t61 t87 t61 t87 t4 t73 t94 t34 t94 t40 t80`.\n\nThe string starts with 't86', which I don't see directly being produced by any NT. Wait, no, the non-terminals don't directly produce 't86' except through longer chains. Let me think: 't86' is from NT49, which is in the rules. So I need to check if the grammar allows a path that produces 't86' in the beginning.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, the start symbol S splits into NT29 and NT46. NT29 produces 't53' and NT46 produces 't10' directly. So the initial letters should be either t53 or t10, but the string starts with t86. That doesn't align. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake because perhaps I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, NT53 is in the production list, which has a rule NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. And earlier, I thought NT29 \u2192 t53. Let me confirm. No, the production S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Then NT29 has a production NT29 \u2192 't53'\u2014yes, that's correct. So S directly produces 't53' followed by NT46, which produces 't10', making the initial two parts 't53 t10'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't86', so that doesn't match. So if the string starts with 't86', that would require that the first production starts with a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't86'. Let me see: NT49 is the non-terminal that produces 't86' because in the rules, NT49 \u2192 't86'. So I need to see if S can produce something that leads to NT49.\n\nWait, but S only splits into NT29 and NT46. For the string given, maybe it's longer than what's covered by S, but the string must start with a production from S. So it's either 't53' or 't10'. So the first token should be either of those.\n\nBut the string starts with 't86', which is not 't53' or 't10'. That seems like a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding the production hierarchy.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46: So the entire string must be the combination of the expansions of NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo the start is NT29 and NT46. Let me see what each of these produces.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53' directly (from NT29 \u2192 't53').\n\nNT46 has multiple productions, but one of them is NT46 \u2192 't10'. But looking back, I see that NT46 also has other productions, like:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT61 (Wait, looking at the rules, actually, looking at the grammar, NT46 has multiple rules, but one is NT46 \u2192 't10', and others like NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87, etc.)\n\nSo perhaps NT46 can sometimes produce a terminal, but in one case, it's 't10', and in others, it's combinations of non-terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string: the second token is 't25', then 't18', 't49', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I need to trace through the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a longer production path than just 't53' or 't10'. Wait, but S produces NT29 and NT46, so the initial symbols are the first symbols of NT29 (which is 't53') and NT46 (could be 't10' or something else, but in some cases, NT46 might produce multiple non-terminals).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT46 has:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT94\n\nWait no, looking back: NT46 \u2192 't10', NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25?

{"custom_id":"request-400","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. My task is to determine if the string is part of the language defined by the given grammar. The output should be either \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nFirst, I'll recap what CNF entails. CNF is a specific form for context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that in each production, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe given grammar has a series of production rules, each either expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to evaluate is `t87 t18 t73 t54 t53 t18 t10 t61 t96 t71 t37 t31 t40 t94 t10 t36 t36 t95 t18 t96 t34 t21 t55 t8`.\n\nSince the string is composed of symbols like 't87', 't18', etc., and these seem to be terminals, I need to check if the string can be derived by the grammar through a series of productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the derivation length of the string 's' should match the structure where each token is either a terminal or the result of two non-terminals. However, since this is a parse tree, every internal node (non-terminal) must be split into exactly two parts. This implies the string length must be 2^n, where n is the number of splits.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string length is 25 tokens. Let me count: 25 tokens. 25 is not a power of two (2^4=16, 2^5=32), so that's a red flag. In a truly derived sentence from a CNF grammar, the number of symbols should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation path. Hmm, wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, another way: if you start with a single non-terminal S, each production splits it into two non-terminals, and so on. The total number of leaves in the parse tree at the end would be 2^k where k is the number of splits. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string should be of the form 2^k. Let's see: 25. Hmm, 25 is not a power of two, but 24+1=25, which might not directly apply. Wait, but more accurately, the number of symbols in a correctly derived string from a CNF grammar should be 2^n, where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation path. For example, the start symbol S is one non-terminal. If each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, the number of symbols at each level would be 2^i after i steps. But actually, the number of symbols would increase until the leaves are all terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: The grammar is in CNF, which allows each production to be either a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol S, when fully expanded (only replacing non-terminals with two non-terminals until terminals are reached), would yield a string of length 2^n for some n. But in this case, the string is 25 symbols long, which is not a power of two (e.g., 16 or 32), so it's impossible for it to be a result of a fully expanded grammar with only non-terminals in CNF. However, this might not necessarily rule it out because in the given string, some of the symbols are already leaves (terminals), so perhaps the derivation stops before all non-terminals are replaced. Wait, no. In a typical leftmost or rightmost derivation, all non-terminals would be replaced two at a time until all are terminals. Otherwise, we wouldn't have a valid string.\n\nWait, but if parts of the string are already terminals, perhaps that's allowed. So maybe the grammar can produce a string where some parts are terminal, making the string longer than 2^k.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because in a fully leftmost derivation, the number of non-terminals reduces each step, but the terminals are the leaves. So, the length of the string (number of symbols) can't be less than 2^k for some k. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing with the depth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently: check each symbol in the string to see if it's reachable or if there's a path in the grammar that leads to that symbol through some productions.\n\nSo let me list all the terminals in the string: t87, t18, t73, t54, t53, t10, t61, t96, t71, t37, t31, t40, t94, t10, t36, t36, t95, t18, t96, t34, t21, t55, t8.\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so each must correspond to a production in the grammar. For each terminal symbol, I should check if there's a production in the grammar that directly produces it.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- t87 appears in NT87 \u2192 t74, NT84 \u2192 t71, NT67 \u2192 t87, NT87 \u2192 t20, NT31 \u2192 t8, NT51 \u2192 t40, NT87 \u2192 t79, etc. So looking for t87: It's directly produced by NT67, and also by NT31, and NT87 on some productions.\n\nSimilarly, t18 is produced by NT14 \u2192 t56? Wait, no. Let me check: NT43 \u2192 t38? Wait no, looking through the grammar, let me find which non-terminals produce t18.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for terminals, t18 appears on the right-hand side of NT31 \u2192 t8, NT91 \u2192 t55, etc. Wait, perhaps looking for t18:\n\nLooking at the grammar: I see NT13 \u2192 t31, NT55 \u2192 t21, but for t18, I don't immediately see a rule where it's a direct production. Wait, let me check each:\n\nActually, I go through each rule's RHS and list the terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t10\n- NT42 \u2192 't?

{"custom_id":"request-399","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a good structure for parsing, especially with algorithms like CYK, but I'm not too familiar with CYK, so maybe I'll try a different approach.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal on the left is rewritten into two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S. \n\nLet me see the structure of the grammar:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nThen, each NT rule seems to break down into two other NTs or into a terminal (indicated by an arrow to a single string of 't's and numbers). For example, NT40 -> 't84' 't67' means it production two terminals.\n\nSo, each production either splits into two non-terminals or into two terminals. Since the string starts with t4, t34, etc., I'm guessing we'll be looking for a sequence that can be generated by expanding non-terminals into terminals step by step.\n\nThe string given is: t4 t34 t20 t10 t10 t55 t74 t96 t4 t96 t20 t80 t61 t74 t18 t96 t4 t96 t95 t21 t10 t80 t22 t8.\n\nI think I should work backward, starting from the string and trying to find possible productions that can produce this sequence. That is, split the string into pairs of terminals and see if each pair can be derived from some NT rule.\n\nBut since the production rules are in CNF, each step produces two symbols, so the string must have an even number of symbols. Let's check the length: count the tokens. There's 23 tokens, which is odd. Hmm, that might be a problem because every step in the grammar produces two symbols. So maybe the string length should be a power of 2 multiplied by some count, but 23 is odd, and 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. So 23 isn't a power of 2. That seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake counting.\n\nLet me recount: 1. t4, 2. t34, 3. t20, 4. t10, 5. t10, 6. t55, 7. t74, 8. t96, 9. t4, 10. t96, 11. t20, 12. t80, 13. t61, 14. t74, 15. t18, 16. t96, 17. t4, 18. t96, 19. t95, 20. t21, 21. t10, 22. t80, 23. t22, 24. t8. So it's 24 tokens. Okay, that makes sense. 24 is divisible by 2^something, so that's better.\n\nNow, since the start symbol is S, which expands to two NTs: NT29 and NT46. So the entire string must be the combination of two parts, each derived from NT29 and NT46. So I can split the string into two parts at the first token and see if each can be generated by NT29 and NT46 respectively, or vice versa. But wait, actually, NT29 and NT46 are both non-terminals that can produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's more accurate to think that S starts with NT29 -> NT29 NT46, so the entire string must be the combination of whatever NT29 produces and NT46 produces. So the string should be a left part generated by NT29 and a right part generated by NT46.\n\nSo let me split the string into two parts. The length is 24, so maybe I can try splitting it in the middle, after 12 tokens.\n\nFirst 12 tokens: t4 t34 t20 t10 t10 t55 t74 t96 t4 t96 t20 t80\nNext 12 tokens: t61 t74 t18 t96 t4 t96 t95 t21 t10 t80 t22 t8\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the entire string should be a combination of two parts from NT29 and NT46. Let me try another approach.\n\nI think a better way is to consider that S starts with NT29 and NT46, so the overall string must be a concatenation of two strings: one generated by NT29 and the other by NT46.\n\nSo perhaps I can try to split the overall string into two parts and see if one part is generated by NT29 and the other by NT46. Let me check the first two tokens: t4 t34.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT40 -> 't84' 't67'. Wait, not exactly. Let me look for which NTT starts with the first few tokens of each possible splitting.\n\nLooking for NT29:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' 't55'.\nWait, but 't53' is the result of NT53, which splits into NT13 and NT55.\n\nWait, but maybe I should build a tree. Alternatively, let's think about what each NT can produce.\n\nStarting with the overall structure S -> NT29 NT46. So the string must be NT29's derivation followed by NT46's derivation.\n\nSo I can think of the string as [Part1][Part2], where Part1 is generated by NT29 and Part2 by NT46.\n\nSo first, try to factor the entire string into two parts. Let me attempt to see what NT29 could generate. Let's consider possible split points.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: NT29 only appears on the left of S and in the definition NT29 -> 't53' 't55' from the given rules? Wait, no. Let me look: In the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' 't55'\n\nYes, because in the last lines: NT25 -> 't73', NT31 -> 't49', etc., and I see that NT29 is mentioned as NT29 -> 't53' 't55'.\n\nWait, no, looking again: The given rules include:\n\nNT25 -> 't73'\n...\nNT29 -> 't53' 't55'\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the list, after NT8 and others: \n\nNT29 -> 't53' 't55'.\n\nYes, so NT29 directly generates 't53 t55'. Then NT53 and NT55 have their own productions.\n\nSimilarly, S is NT29 NT46, so S generates t53 t55 followed by t92 t25 (since NT46 can go to 't92' 't25').\n\nWait, but maybe that's too vague. Let me check all the possible NT productions.\n\nLet's list all the NTs and their definitions:\n\n- NT22: NT38 NT70\n- NT25: NT22 NT14\n- NT29: NT53 NT55\n- NT31: NT49 NT87\n- NT40: NT84 NT67\n- NT46: NT92 NT25 (and also 't4' 't10' from another production?

{"custom_id":"request-417","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t21 t22 t37 t4 t73 t87 t71 t34 t79 t94 t74 t55 t25 t94 t31 t54 t96 t53 t10 t56 t56 t25 t80 t20 t71`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a string generated by a grammar in Chomsky normal form implies. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure can be parsed using a method like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for such grammars.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that it consists of a series of production rules. Each rule either has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which is a production with two non-terminals, and some other rules like NT8 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string we're evaluating consists entirely of terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number). Since the grammar only has these terminals as the base cases (i.e., A \u2192 a), the productions must derive directly from these terminals. However, the challenge is to see if the entire string can be built up by the productions provided.\n\nI'll try to break down the string step by step, attempting to parse it using the grammar. Let me list the string again for clarity:\n\nt21, t22, t37, t4, t73, t87, t71, t34, t79, t94, t74, t55, t25, t94, t31, t54, t96, t53, t10, t56, t56, t25, t80, t20, t71.\n\nI'm going to start from the beginning and see if each symbol can be derived from the grammar's start symbol S.\n\n1. Starting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, S generates two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. We'll need to see what each of these can produce.\n\n2. Let's look at NT29: According to the grammar, NT29 \u2192 't53'. So, NT29 is a terminal string 't53'.\n\n3. Now, NT46. Looking at the grammar, NT46 has two rules: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 and NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT31 and other nt46 rules. Wait, let me check the exact productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT46, the rules are:\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n- NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT54\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT61\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT86\n- NT70 \u2192 't54' (wait, that's another NT rule, not NT46)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check NT46's productions:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n- NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT54\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT46 -> nt31 nt61\n- NT46 \u2192 nt49 nt86\n- NT84 \u2192 nt71\n- NT46 \u2192 t10\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, the entry for NT46 includes:\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT49 NT91\nNT46 -> NT31 NT54\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT31 NT61\nNT46 \u2192 nt49 nt86\nAnd then more:\nNT84 -> nt71\nNT46 -> t10\n\nSo, for NT46, the options are various combinations. Now, looking at the string, the second symbol is t22. Wait, our string is t21, t22, t37, etc. Wait, the first symbol is t21, which is generated by NT25 \u2192 't73'? No, wait. Let me check: the symbols in the string are t21, t22, t37, t4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach. Instead of focusing on S, maybe I should work backwards from the string and see if each part can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more efficient, but that might take a while. Let me see if I can find a leftmost derivation or rightmost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can group the string into pairs that fit into NT46, which seems to be a major part.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and NT29 is 't53', we need NT46 to produce the rest of the string after 't53'. Wait, no, the string is all terminal symbols, so each part must be derived into terminals.\n\nBut wait, S is derived into two non-terminals, NT29 and NT46, each of which must themselves be derived into a string of terminals.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of t-strings, which suggests that each non-terminal in NT46 must be producing a part of the string. Let me think: S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so NT29 and NT46 must produce concatenated strings that together form the given string.\n\nBut NT29 \u2192 't53', so it's fixed as 't53'. Then NT46 must produce the rest of the string starting from the third character, since NT29 is the first part. Wait, no: the string is 't21 t22...', so S must derive into the entire string, which is 24 symbols, each being a terminal. But if S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and NT29 is 't53', and NT46 is derived into a string that's 23 symbols long, but 't53 t...' would not match the start, which is 't21'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string is a single production starting from S. Wait, no, S is the start symbol, so it can only derive into other symbols. However, in this case, the entire string is given, which must consist of symbols derived from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider that each symbol in the string must come from a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't4', NT16 \u2192 't38', NT22\u2192't96', etc. But not all non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT29 \u2192 't53', which is terminal, NT25 \u2192 't73', etc.\n\nSo, the strategy is to see if each symbol in the string can be linked through the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, but considering the string's length, it's 24 symbols, and the starting symbol S produces NT29 and NT46, each of which are 1 and then (potentially) 23 symbols. But the problem is that NT46 can be a chain of multiple symbols, but the grammar may have longer sequences, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the provided string is a direct string of terminals that are connected through the grammar's productions. But without knowing the derivation steps, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the symbols in the string and see if they are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal either produces a single terminal or more non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each symbol in the string, it must either directly correspond to a terminal production or must be part of a larger chain that expands into it.\n\nFor example, let's look at the first symbol: t21.

Also, each production has two non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be two non-terminals. But looking at some of the rules, like `NT40 -> 't84' NT67`, that's a mix of a terminal and a non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I should check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the problem states it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I'm mistaken. But some productions seem to involve a terminal on one side. Maybe I'm misunderstanding CNF. No, wait, CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals. Oh, but looking at the grammar rules, some have a mix. For example, `NT40 -> 't84' NT67` has a terminal, which would violate CNF. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nBut putting that aside, I'll try to parse the string step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals. Each production starts with S and eventually reduces to terminals. I need to check if the string can be derived from S by applying the productions.\n\nStarting with S, which -> NT29 NT46. So the string starts with t53 t40 because NT29 is 't53' and NT46 is 't40' according to the grammar. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT29 -> 't53' and NT46 -> 't10' (I think I'm getting this wrong. Wait, looking at the rules, let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar is provided as rules. For example, NT29 -> 't53'. So S -> NT29 NT46 becomes 't53' 't40' since NT46 -> 't40' but wait, in the grammar, NT46 appears multiple times. Let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25, and also NT46 -> 't10'. Similarly, other NT nodes have multiple rules. So S is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. NT29 is 't53' and NT46 is 't40' or can be broken down further.\n\nWait, so the string starts with t55 t96... That doesn't match S's first expansion.

Let's see:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' and NT46 can be 't10' or broken down further. So S can start with t53 t10, but the string starts with t55, which is different. Hmm, maybe the string isn't derived from S, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string starting from S backwards, using the grammar rules.

The last symbol is 't80', which is produced by NT55. So before 't80', there's 't21', which must be part of a rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT21 isn't directly defined, but looking at the grammar, let's see. Wait, I'm looking for a production that ends with 't21', but in the grammar, the only NT with 't21' as a terminal is NT55 -> 't21', right?

I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The goal is to determine whether the string is produced by the grammar, ending with either 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given rules, all except for the terminals end with two non-terminals on the right side.

However, the string starts with t20, not the non-terminals in NT29 or NT46. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to match it step by step.

Let's see which non-terminals can produce t20:\n\nLooking at the NT rules, NT87 \u2192 't20' is one option. So if we have NT87, it can derive t20. But is there another path?\n\nLooking further, can any NT lead into NT87? So NT87 is a non-terminal that can derive 't20', but to get there, do any non-terminals produce NT87?\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT47? Wait, I don't have that in the rules. Let me check.\n\nWait, no NT produces NT87 except NT87 itself. Oh wait, wait, some NT rules have 't20' as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each NT production:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 '...'\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 '...' or 't96'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't49', 't8',... etc.\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't80'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10', 't55'\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't86'\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't13', 't55'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't49', 't91'\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't40', 't85'\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't51', 't16'\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't74', 't20'\n\nWait, so NT87 can produce 't20' and 't74' as well. Wait, did I miss that earlier? So NT87's rules are:\n\nLooking at the given rules, yes: NT87 \u2192 't74' and 't20'.\n\nSo, the string starts with t20, which can only come from NT87.\n\nSo the first step would be, after expanding S \u2192 NT29 NT46, we have NT29 and NT46 as non-terminals. But the string starts with t20, which is from NT87. So maybe S needs to be expanded further.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So S starts with NT29 and NT46. The string we're checking starts with t20 t54 t55... So first, t20 is part of the string, which is a production of NT87.\n\nBut the expansion of S as NT29 NT46 would directly generate t(derived from NT29) concatenated with t(derived from NT46). So that would mean the first part is t(from NT29) and then t(from NT46).\n\nBut our string starts with t20, which is from NT87, not from NT29 or NT46. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the string is constructed in such a way that S through multiple productions leads to the sequence of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a parse tree where the start with S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then each of those can be expanded further until terminals are reached. So maybe each NT29 and NT46 can be expanded step by step.\n\nLet me write down the parsing process:\n\nWe need to get the string: t20 t54 t55 t40 t22 t18 t79 t74 t4 t35 t54 t8 t22 t49 t56 t31 t18 t40 t20 t10 t61 t40 t4 t96 t73 t31.\n\nThe first symbol is t20, which must come from a production that can yield t20.\n\nLooking, NT87 can produce t20. So t20 comes from NT87.\n\nSo in the parse tree, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then one of them (maybe NT46) expands into NT87. Wait, no: S \u2192 NT29 NT46, each NT is separate. So perhaps one NT29 produces some part and NT46 produces the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT29 is t53, and NT46 is something else, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list what each non-terminal can produce as a series of steps. Let me map out the possible expansions:\n\nLooking at the NT rules, let's see if they can derive certain terminal sequences.\n\nFor example, 't20' comes from NT87, which itself might be derived from other NTs. Looking back, do any NTs produce NT87? Checking the rules:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't74', 't20'\n\nSo NT87 is a leaf; it can't be expanded further. So it can only produce 't74' or 't20'. Therefore, in the parse tree, any NT87 node must be the terminal in the string, which is either 't74'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But I'm not very familiar with CYK, so maybe I'll try a more manual approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the method of checking if each production leads to the correct terminals, building the tree from the bottom up.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT26. Each side of the production is a non-terminal. So I need to split the string into two parts corresponding to each non-terminal, parse each part, and check if they produce the correct sequence.\n\nBut wait, the string might not exactly split that way, so perhaps I need to see if the string can be broken down into two parts each generated by NT29 and NT26. Let's see the original string:\n\nt55 t56 t25 t87 t37 t54 t31 t8 t8 t49 t80 t94 t94 t36 t71 t8 t34 t87 t71 t40 t4 t35 t40 t18 t10 t31.\n\nWait, that's 27 tokens. Let me count the number of tokens in the string. Let's list them:\n\n1: t55\n2: t56\n3: t25\n4: t87\n5: t37\n6: t54\n7: t31\n8: t8\n9: t8\n10: t49\n11: t80\n12: t94\n13: t94\n14: t36\n15: t71\n16: t8\n17: t34\n18: t87\n19: t71\n20: t40\n21: t4\n22: t35\n23: t40\n24: t18\n25: t10\n26: t31.\n\nSo 26 tokens. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t55, then t56, t25, t87, t37, t54, t31, t8, t8, t49, t80, t94, t94, t36, t71, t8, t34, t87, t71, t40, t4, t35, t40, t18, t10, t31.\n\nThat's 25 tokens. Hmm, okay, 25 tokens. So the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, NT29 and NT26. Each of these needs to produce 12.5 tokens, which can't be, so maybe the string needs to be divided into two parts, each corresponding to NT29 and NT26, but I'm not sure how.\n\nWait, the initial production is S -> NT29 NT26. So the entire string must be a concatenation of two parts: the first part derived from NT29 and the second from NT26. So the number of tokens in the string must be equal to the sum of the tokens from NT29 and NT26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should find the leftmost derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to go through each production step to see how each terminal can be derived.\n\nBut given that this is a complex grammar, perhaps I should first try to find if any of the non-terminals directly produce terminal strings. Looking through the given productions, many non-terminals are connected directly to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT40 -> 't80' (so it's a terminal). Similarly, NT91->'t55', and others are connected to terminals.\n\nWait, let's list the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT55 -> 't80' (but wait, in the given, NT55 has several productions, one of which is -> 't80', but others as well. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT40 -> 't80'\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT55 -> 't80' (as one of its productions)\n- NT70 -> 't54'\n- NT83? No, wait, I see NT51, NT40, etc., but let me see:\n\nLooking at all the productions, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal string, others don't. For example, NT85 -> NT51 NT16. Both NT16 and NT51 may produce terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the top-down approach would involve expanding the start symbol and seeing if the resulting non-terminals can produce the required terminal sequence.\n\nBut manually doing this would take a lot of steps. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for any inconsistencies.\n\nWait, the string starts with t55. So the first part of the string should be generated by NT29 and the second part by NT26. Since the entire string is t55 followed by other tokens, maybe that's part of the NT29 branch. Wait, NT29 is in the production of S.\n\nLet me see, the initial step:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT26\n\nSo the string must be a concatenation of what NT29 can produce and what NT26 can produce. So I need to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT29 and NT26.\n\nBut I'm not sure where to split. Maybe I should look for which NT29 can produce a certain prefix and NT26 can produce the remaining suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the entire string and see if it can be a single derivation from S, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire sequence and see if each production can expand correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to look for any non-terminals in the string that aren't directly replaceable, meaning that they must be part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, reducing the length by one each time. So the number of non-terminals in the string should increase, but in our case, we're dealing with a string that's all terminals, so the derivation must ultimately reduce all non-terminals to terminals.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the string is all terminals, so it's the result after fully expanding all non-terminals. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding if the sequence of terminals can be generated starting from S.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt55 t56 t25 t87 t37 t54 t31 t8 t8 t49 t80 t94 t94 t36 t71 t8 t34 t87 t71 t40 t4 t35 t40 t18 t10 t31.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 25 tokens (from 1 to 25).\n\nStarting with S, which is NT29 followed by NT26. So I need to split the string into two parts: the first part derived from NT29 and the second from NT26. The lengths of these two parts should add up to 25.\n\nWait, but without knowing how to split, maybe I can choose a split point and see if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see which non-terminals can derive the given terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's try to see if any of the non-terminals directly derive parts of the string.\n\nFor example, NT29 -> NT45 NT92.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT22 -> multiple options, but let's see what NT29 can produce.\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' (Wait, no.

This is helpful because it simplifies parsing; the parse tree is a binary tree, and each node corresponds to a production.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT29 NT46. So the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. That means the string must start with the expansions of NT29 and NT46. Let's check the string: the first token is t34, which may correspond to one of these.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT29: It appears in two places, I think. Wait, looking at the given grammar, NT29 \u2192 't53', right? Because in the list, the production NT29 is given as `NT29 -> 't53'`. So, NT29 expands directly to t53. So the first part of the string, t34, doesn't match nt29. Hmm, that's a problem because S starts with NT29 NT46.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. The first production is S -> NT29 NT46. So the leftmost non-terminal is NT29. Now, the string starts with t34. So, does NT29 produce t34 in any production? Looking through the productions for NT29, I see `NT29 -> 't53'`. There's no production for NT29 that yields t34. That suggests a problem because the first token shouldn't be t34 if the production starts with NT29. Alternatively, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar entries are provided as lines, each starting with the left-hand side, then the production. So for NT29, the entry is `NT29 -> 't53'`. So NT29 directly produces t53. So if the string starts with t34, that comes from something else.\n\nBut the initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the first symbols after expansion should come from NT29's expansion and NT46's expansion. So if S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then the first two symbols should be whatever NT29 and NT46 produce. So if NT29 produces t53, and NT46 produces t4 (because looking at the productions, NT46 \u2192 't10' or 't46'? Wait, looking back: NT46 has two productions: `NT46 -> 't46'` and `NT46 -> 't10'`. Wait, actually, no, looking again, it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal on the left or a terminal, but in this case, it's a mix. Let me list all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14.\n\nNT25 also \u2192 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, each non-terminal has various productions, sometimes to other non-terminals and sometimes to terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to start correctly, the first symbol must come from expanding NT29 and NT46, or from another non-terminal if applicable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me step back. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So when we expand S, the first symbol in the string should come from NT29 or NT46? No, the expansion of NT29 could produce a terminal, like 't53', and NT46 could produce, say, 't4'. So the first two tokens in the string should be 't53' and 't4'.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t34, not t53 or t4. That suggests that t34 is produced by something other than NT29 or NT46. Wait, but S starts with NT29 and NT46; their expansions must come first. So if the string starts with t34, which doesn't match anything from NT29 or NT46, then the string can't be correct unless there's a different way.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for S: it's S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So S directly produces NT29 NT46. So the expansion starts with NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, NT29 \u2192 't53'. So the first symbol should be t53, but in the string, it's t34. So t34 is not 't53' or 't4' or any of the terminals that other NTs might produce. So unless there's a way for another non-terminal in the string to generate t34, but the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which starts with NT29 and NT46, which produce t53 and t4 respectively, which are different from t34.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot start with t34 because it's supposed to come from NT29 and NT46's expansions, which yield t53 and t4. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any other production can generate t34.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal expands directly to t34. Only NT46 and some others have 't34' in their productions? Wait, looking back:\n\nNT51 -> 't40'.\nNT40 -> 't84', but also NT40 has a production to t84.\n\nWait, looking for 't34', I see that both NT70 and NT84 have productions to t34 and t36, respectively. Let's look:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't54' and also NT70 \u2192 't34'.\n- NT84 \u2192 't71' and also NT84 \u2192 't36'.\n\nSo in the production rules, NT70 has two options: produce 't54' or 't34'. Similarly, NT84 has two options: produce 't71' or 't36'.\n\nSo if the string starts with t34, that would require that one of the non-terminals in the initial expansion must produce it. But the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which produce t53 and t4 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the first token should be t53 or t4. Since the string starts with t34, it's not possible.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It looks like every non-terminal has exactly two non-terminals as its productions, except for those that produce terminals directly. That's consistent with Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar is a bit complex with several non-terminals and productions. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t80 t94 t40 t80 t34 t71 t40 t21 t22 t55 t80 t80 t94 t56 t54 t55 t34 t25 t95 t10 t37 t35 t61 t25 t8 t73 t25`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree should be a binary tree, and each left-hand side of the productions (excluding terminals) should generate two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSince the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, each production step must reduce the number of non-terminals by one. So, for the given string, the length will correspond to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. The number of symbols in the string should be equal to 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the height of the tree. Wait, let me check that.\n\nThe string has 28 symbols. So, 2^n -1 = 28 \u2192 2^n=29, which is not a power of 2. That might be a problem because in CNF, the derivation height is n if the string has 2^n - 1 symbols. But 29 isn't a power of two. Wait, 2^5 is 32, which minus 1 is 31. 2^4 is 16, minus 1 is 15. So 28 doesn't fit. Hmm, does that mean it's invalid? Because for a grammar in CNF, the length of the string must be 2^n -1 for some n. So 28 isn't suitable. But wait, the given number of symbols is 28, which doesn't fit the required form.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count the symbols again. The string is: t80, t94, t40, t80, t34, t71, t40, t21, t22, t55, t80, t80, t94, t56, t54, t55, t34, t25, t95, t10, t37, t35, t61, t25, t8, t73, t25.\n\nThat's 27 symbols, right? Wait, let me recount.\n\nNo, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me list them:\n\n1. t80\n2. t94\n3. t40\n4. t80\n5. t34\n6. t71\n7. t40\n8. t21\n9. t22\n10. t55\n11. t80\n12. t80\n13. t94\n14. t56\n15. t54\n16. t55\n17. t34\n18. t25\n19. t95\n20. t10\n21. t37\n22. t35\n23. t61\n24. t25\n25. t8\n26. t73\n27. t25\n\nSo 27 symbols total. Now, is 27 equal to 2^n -1? Let's see:\n\nn=5: 31\n\nn=4: 15\n\nSo 27 is in between, which is not of the form 2^n -1. That suggests that the string might not be possible under a context-free grammar in CNF because such grammars generate strings with lengths that are one less than a power of two. Therefore, a string length of 27 can't be generated by such a grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Maybe the string's length doesn't matter in this case, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-terminals in the grammar can derive into strings of varying lengths as long as each step reduces non-terminals correctly.\n\nWait, but in the given context-free grammar in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals as the right-hand side (RHS), except for those terminals. But in reality, in CNF, each RHS consists of exactly two non-terminals only. Wait, no\u2014the RHS can consist of a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the grammar is in CNF which allows A\u2192a and A\u2192BC, but in this case, all productions except the terminals have two non-terminals on the RHS. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, etc.\n\nEach production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the initial string consists entirely of terminals, so each terminal in the string must have been generated by a rule where A \u2192 a, where a is the terminal.\n\nSo for each terminal in the string, we can have a production that directly produces it. But the question is, can the entire string be generated by the combination of these production rules.\n\nGiven the string is 27 symbols, which is 27 terminals. For CNF grammars, the number of terminals in a derivation is at least 1 (if the start symbol is a terminal) or more.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that in a CNF grammar, each production step either contributes one terminal (if A\u2192a) or two non-terminals (if A\u2192BC). So the total number of symbols in the derivation tree at any level is 2^n, but when fully expanded, the number of terminals is 2^k -1, where k is the number of leftmost expansions.\n\nWait, but with multiple non-terminals at the top level, the number of symbols can vary. But the overall structure is a binary tree of non-terminals, with the leaves being terminals.\n\nWait, but our string is all terminals, so the entire string must come from a full expansion of the initial non-terminals. So the start symbol S generates some structure that expands into all these terminals.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the start is two non-terminals. Each of those can further expand into either another pair or a terminal.\n\nGiven that the total number of terminals is 27, which is an odd number, that's acceptable because each expansion step would add an even number of symbols or result in a terminal. But the total number of symbols isn't a strict 2^n -1.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to trace the string backward through the grammar. Starting from the last symbol and seeing if each part can be broken down according to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 27 symbols, so in reverse, starting from the last symbol t25. The last symbol is t25, so let's see which productions result in t25.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production NT25 \u2192 't56' is there. So t25 would have to come from another production. Wait, in the given grammar, let me check the rules for NT25.\n\nLooking back: Yes, 'NT25 -> 't13' 't55''. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions: The grammar has a number like NT22, NT25, etc. Each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So for example, NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT55, or NT25 \u2192 't56'? Wait, in the given grammar, there's:\n\nNT25 -> 't13' 't55' and also NT25 -> NT55 NT22.

So all the productions here seem to fit that.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT29 NT46, as per the first production: S -> NT29 NT46. This means the string must be built by expanding S into two parts: NT29 and NT46. I should probably look at how each of these non-terminals can be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT29: one of its productions is NT29 -> 't53'. So that's a terminal symbol. Then NT46 can produce several things, like NT92 NT25, or 't10', among others. So in the string, the first part seems to be \"t96 t4...\", but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should take the string and split it based on the productions. Let's see, the string is a sequence of terminals: t96, t4, t4, t94, t74, t25, t94, t94, t87, t94, t22, t55, t71, t54, t21, t35, t73, t71, t73, t94, t20, t20, t56, t25, t96, t36, t22, t10.\n\nI need to see if this string can be built by expanding S into two parts, each of which must themselves be built from their respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, S -> NT29 NT46. So the overall structure would be something like NT29... followed by NT46... Then the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo first, I need to see what NT29 can produce. Looking at NT29's productions:\n\nNT29 -> NT22 NT14 | NT51 NT73 | NT38 NT55.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the grammar provided, it's a bit more detailed. Let me list all the NT29 productions:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' [from the given rules, as per the user's input: NT29 -> 't53'].\n\nSo NT29 directly can produce 't53'. So if S expands to NT29 NT46, and NT29 is 't53', then NT46 must produce the rest of the string after 't53'.\n\nLooking at the string again: after 't53', the next tokens are t96 t4 t4... But that might not directly align. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe I should parse the entire string as a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to simulate the parse process. Let's think about the string as a series of terminals, and the non-terminals can be any of the given NT{number} symbols.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT29 NT46. So we'll have two branches: NT29 and NT46. Let's look at each.\n\nFor NT29: Its productions include NT29 -> 't53', among others. So if we take that, then NT29 becomes 't53'. So the string starts with 't53' from NT29, but let's see what's actually being generated.\n\nWait, no. Wait the string we're evaluating is \"t96 t4 t4 t94 t74 t25 t94 t94 t87 t94 t22 t55 t71 t54 t21 t35 t73 t71 t73 t94 t20 t20 t56 t25 t96 t36 t22 t10\".\n\nBut if S -> NT29 NT46, and NT29 -> 't53', then NT46 needs to parse the rest of the string starting from index 0 of NT46's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string step by step, trying to fit the productions.\n\nWait, let's first check if the string starts with any production of NT29. NT29 has productions that include t53, but also NT22 NT14, etc. So if the string starts with t53, that's one possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if the string can be split into two parts: one part matching NT29, and the other part matching NT46.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't96', which is a terminal. So perhaps let's consider if the initial production of NT29 can be 't96...'.\n\nLooking back at NT29's productions: I see NT29 -> 't53' as one production. Other productions are:\n\nLooking more carefully, the user's grammar includes:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'.\n\nAre there other productions for NT29 in the user's input? Let me double-check.\n\nIn the user's grammar: I see several NTxx rules, but for NT29, I see only:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' \u2014 yes, that's the only production for NT29.\n\nSo that means NT29 can only produce 't53'. Therefore, the first part of the string must be 't53', but the actual string starts with 't96' \u2014 which is not 't53'.\n\nSo that would mean that the string can't be generated by the grammar, because the first symbol is 't96', but NT29 can only generate 't53'. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I have to parse the entire string as a combination of production rules. Maybe the NT29 doesn't directly produce 't53', but instead a longer sequence. Let me think again.\n\nNo, in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So for terminal symbols, they can't be further expanded except via their direct productions. So in this case, NT29 can only produce 't53' directly. Therefore, the first token of the string must be 't53'. But the string starts with 't96', which doesn't match. So this would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I missed any productions for NT29. Scanning through the grammar provided, looking for NT29:\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\nNT29: Only appears in this way:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'. So yes, only that.\n\nSo yes, NT29 can only directly produce 't53', making the first symbol 't53'. Since the string starts with 't96', which doesn't match, the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided a grammar where the initial production is S -> NT29 NT46. Then, each NT has several productions, some terminal, some combining other non-terminals. For NT29, the only production is NT29 -> 't53'; that's the only way it can be expanded.\n\nSo in that case, the first token of the string must be 't53', but the given string starts with 't96'. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar seems to be in CNF because each production either has two non-terminals on the right or directly produces a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions in the grammar. Let me outline the approach:\n\n1. **Parse the string:** The string consists of a sequence of terminals. Each terminal corresponds to a production in the grammar when the right-hand side of a production consists of that terminal.\n\n2. **Identify the structure:** Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. This means that the string can be viewed as a series of nodes in a parse tree where each parent node (non-terminal) produces two children. The leaves of the parse tree will be the terminals in the string.\n\n3. **Start from the root (S):** The grammar starts with S. I need to see if S can derive the given string by expanding S step by step.\n\nBut stepping through each production expansion manually might be time-consuming, especially for a long string. Maybe a better approach is to use the concept of parsers, particularly since the grammar is in CNF, an efficient parser like the CYK algorithm could be used. However, since I might not be familiar with implementing the CYK algorithm, I'll try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a parse tree that matches the given string by breaking it down step by step.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. That means S expands into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. So the root of the parse tree will have NT29 as the left child and NT46 as the right child.\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to expand into their respective parts. Let's process NT29 and NT46.\n\nNT29: The productions for NT29 seem to be: NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT49 (only one production). So NT29 is replaced by NT53 and NT49.\n\nNow, nt53: Let's look at its productions. nt53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. So NT53 expands into NT13 and NT55.\n\nNT13: It expands into NT31 NT10.\n\nNow, NT31 has two productions: NT31 \u2192 NT8 NT56 or NT31 \u2192 't49'. Wait, hold on. Looking back, I think the original grammar might have some typos or possible misalignments. Wait, no, the productions for NT31 are: NT31 \u2192 NT8 NT56 and NT31 \u2192 't49'. Wait, but in the given list, the grammar for NT31 is given as NT31 -> NT14 NT92, NT22 -> NT92 NT31, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the list.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT46.

Hmm, maybe not t87.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n- NT74 is produced by NT79? Wait, the list doesn't have NT79 directly. Maybe I'm missing that. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the only NT that ends with a 't' is when it directly produces a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't53', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a lot of 't87's, which isn't directly produced by any NT in the grammar, except perhaps if a longer path leads to it. Wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, does any NT produce a 't87'? Let's scan each production:\n\nI see NT87 appears in the list as a production on NT58, but in the given grammar, looking through all the NT rules, I only see NT55 \u2192 't80', NT87 is mentioned multiple times as a terminal in different places. Wait, yes, NT55 \u2192 't80', NT87 is used as a non-terminal in multiple places, but does any NT have 't87' as a terminal? It seems not. Wait, the string has 't87' as a terminal, so does any NT produce 't87'?\n\nWait, no, the NTs have 't' tokens as direct results, but I don't see 't87' directly as a terminal. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking for the rule where NT produces 't87', but I only see rules like NT79 \u2192 ?, and NT55 \u2192 't80', NT46 \u2192 't55', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong\u2014I should check more carefully.\n\nWait, let me scan the entire list again:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n- NT22 \u2192 't53' (multiple times)\nWait, hold on, maybe I need to look for the rule where NT51 produces 't87'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT51 -> 't40' (from one rule, but also other rules)\n- NT87 is present as a non-terminal, but not as a production. So in the given grammar, 't87' is only present as a terminal if any NT leads to it directly. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Or maybe there's a typo in my understanding.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces 't87' as a terminal directly. So that's confusing because the string has 't87' as a terminal. Maybe I made a mistake in checking the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check all NT productions again more carefully:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with 't87'. I see:\n\n- NT46 -> 't10', etc.\n- NT85 -> 't74'\n- NT31 -> 't8'\n- NT55 -> 't80'\n- NT51 -> 't40' (multiple times)\n- NT45 -> 't37'\n- NT87 is used as a non-terminal in multiple places, but not as a terminal. So, perhaps my initial thought is correct, that the grammar doesn't have a production that directly produces 't87' as a terminal, which would mean the string can't be generated as it contains 't87' as a terminal. But wait, that contradicts the provided answer, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking at all the productions, the terminals are:\n\n- t4, t8, t10, t18, t21, t22 (occurs multiple times), t25 (many times), t29, t31, t35, t36, t37, t38, t40, t45, t46, t49, t51, t53, t54, t55, t56, t67, t70, t71, t73, t74, t79, t80, t87, t84, t94, t96, etc.\n\nWait, but looking for where 't87' is produced as a terminal: let's check each rule:\n\nIs there any NT that directly leads to 't87'? From the list, I see NT51 sometimes refers to 't40', but that's different. Wait, looking through all the NT rules, I don't see any production that ends in 't87' as a terminal. So that would mean the string cannot be formed because the grammar doesn't have any NT leading directly to 't87' as a terminal, so the string contains an invalid token.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because 't87' is present in the string, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Maybe I'm miscounting the symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps 't87' is the result of a non-terminal that doesn't produce it directly but via longer paths. Let me try to find a chain that leads to 't87'. For example, starting from S \u2192 NT29 NT46. NT29 \u2192 't53', which would require NT53 \u2192 't87'? Wait, I don't see NT53 having that production.\n\nWait, from the grammar, looking for NT53:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't87' nowhere, but wait, the grammar does have NT13 \u2192 't31', NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. There are a bunch of non-terminals, like S, NT22, NT25, etc., and terminals like t80, t71, and so on. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is a series of terminals separated by spaces. \n\nThe string is: t18 t37 t80 t73 t55 t86 t73 t10 t86 t94 t4 t86 t71 t87 t25 t71 t20 t74 t61 t61 t53 t37 t34 t79 t53 t54 t8 t56 t71.\n\nI need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each terminal in the string must correspond to a production that produces that terminal directly or via a series of steps.\n\nLet me first write down the grammar for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46  \nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70  \nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14  \nNT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71  \nNT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91  \nNT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85  \nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67  \nNT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16  \nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55  \nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25  \nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45  \nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31  \nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87  \nNT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55  \nNT40 \u2192 't80'  \nNT51 \u2192 't22'  \nNT25 \u2192 't73'  \nNT31 \u2192 't49'  \nNT14 \u2192 't56'  \nNT91 \u2192 't55'  \nNT70 \u2192 't54'  \nNT51 \u2192 't40'  \nNT45 \u2192 't37'  \nNT8 \u2192 't4'  \nNT46 \u2192 't10'  \nNT87 \u2192 't74'  \nNT67 \u2192 't87'  \nNT84 \u2192 't71'  \nNT29 \u2192 't53'  \nNT22 \u2192 't96'  \nNT92 \u2192 't25'  \nNT85 \u2192 't35'  \nNT38 \u2192 't94'  \nNT55 \u2192 't80'  \nNT87 \u2192 't20'  \nNT31 \u2192 't8'  \nNT51 \u2192 't18'  \nNT87 \u2192 't79'  \nNT46 \u2192 't55'  \nNT31 \u2192 't95'  \nNT46 \u2192 't61'\n\nWait, I think I might have some inconsistencies here. For example, NT51 appears to have two different productions: NT51 \u2192 't40' and NT51 \u2192 't18'. The same with NT87 having NT87 \u2192 't20' and NT87 \u2192 't79' and 't20'. Also, NT46 has multiple productions. Maybe that's part of the issue.\n\nNow, the string starts with t18, which I think must come from NT51 because NT51 \u2192 't18' directly. Let me see if NT51 can be a part of the derivation.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT51 has productions: NT51 \u2192 't40', NT51 \u2192 't18'. But in the initial derivation, S is NT29 NT46, right?\n\nSo S = NT29 NT46.\n\nLet's parse the string step by step. The string has 31 tokens, so that would mean the leftmost derivation has 31 steps? Or no, each step adds one symbol, so starting from S which is two symbols (NT29 and NT46). Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo for the string to be generated, it must be a series of terminals, each of which is produced directly by a production, possibly built up through leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nPerhaps using the CYK algorithm would be a good approach, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll need to see if the string can be broken down into productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can backtrack from the string to see if each terminal is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the first token t18, which comes from NT51 \u2192 't18'. So NT51 must be the start.\n\nThen, since NT51 is at the beginning, the next symbols must come from the production of NT51.\n\nBut NT51 can be either 't18' or 't40', but in this case, 't18' is part of the string, so NT51 must produce 't18'.\n\nThen, looking at NT51, it's used in the string as 't18', so that part is covered.\n\nThe next token after 't18' is 't37', which I think comes from NT45, since NT45 \u2192 't37'.\n\nLooking back, I saw that NT22 has multiple productions, including NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the entire string as a leftmost derivation, step by step.\n\nThe string is: t18 t37 t80 t73 t55 t86 t73 t10 t86 t94 t4 t86 t71 t87 t25 t71 t20 t74 t61 t61 t53 t37 t34 t79 t53 t54 t8 t56 t71\n\nSo, let's list the tokens:\n\n1. t18\n2. t37\n3. t80\n4. t73\n5. t55\n6. t86\n7. t73\n8. t10\n9. t86\n10. t94\n11. t4\n12. t86\n13. t71\n14. t87\n15. t25\n16. t71\n17. t20\n18. t74\n19. t61\n20. t61\n21. t53\n22. t37\n23. t34\n24. t79\n25. t53\n26. t54\n27. t8\n28. t56\n29. t71\n\nI think I'll need to see each of these can be derived step by step.\n\nStarting with S = NT29 NT46.\n\nSo S can produce NT29 NT46. Let's see NT29 \u2192 't53' and NT46 has multiple productions, like t92, t25, t55, etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking back, NT29 \u2192 't53', which is a terminal derivation.\n\nSo S \u2192 't53' NT46, but wait, that's not the case because S is NT29 NT46, so both must be derived. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so when we derive, each of NT29 and NT46 must be expanded.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53', which is a terminal. Then, NT46 can be expanded into various non-terminals, each of which can then be further expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and then NT29 is 't53', NT46 must then produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with 't18', which is produced by NT51, so that suggests that the NT51 part is in the tree.\n\nBut wait, in the initial S, we only have NT29 and NT46. So perhaps the string must be derived as a sequence that starts with 't53' from NT29, but the provided string starts with 't18', which comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let's see what the string starts with.\n\nThe string is: `t94 t8 t31 t86 t31 t22 t95 t25 t74 t49 t61 t21 t71 t40 t21 t35 t96 t79 t21 t87 t49 t25 t21 t18 t34 t94 t71 t8 t40 t25`.\n\nSo, S's expansion is NT29 NT46. The first non-terminal is NT29, which must produce 't53' according to line 29. Wait, no, looking back, NT29 -> 't53' is line 29: yes.\n\nBut the first token in the string is 't94'. Hmm. Wait, that might be a problem. Because NT29 is supposed to be 't53', but the string starts with 't94'. That seems off. Unless NT29 can produce something else.\n\nLooking back, NT29: in line 29, NT29 -> 't53'. But is there another production for NT29? Let's check the grammar. The given lines: line 29 says NT29\u2192 't53', and no other productions for NT29. So NT29 can only produce 't53'. But our string starts with 't94', which is different. That suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I misread the rules. Let me check line 29 again. Line 29: NT29 -> 't53'\u2014so yes, only terminal.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then the first two tokens must be 't53' and whatever NT46 produces. But the first token is 't94', which is not 't53', so this suggests that S's expansion can't generate the string because the first part is wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check. Perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at line 29: NT29 \u2192 't53', yes. So NT29 can only be 't53'. So the first token must be 't53', but the string starts with 't94', which would mean the string is not generated by this grammar. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut just to be thorough, perhaps I should check the rest. Maybe there's another way, but since S starts with NT29 and that only produces 't53', the first token has to be 't53', but it's 't94' in the string. So No, the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nHowever, wait, in the grammar, maybe I missed something. Let me go through all the NT29 productions again. No, line 29 is the only one for NT29. So indeed, S starts with 't53' and 'tsomething else', but the string starts with 't94', so it can't be correct.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's check the first token: t25. Does NT29 produce t25?\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: From the grammar, I don't see NT29 directly producing anything except maybe through another non-terminal that eventually becomes t25. Wait, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nSo NT29 directly produces t53. So the first part of the string should be t53, but the given string starts with t25. That doesn't match. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, did I miss a rule for NT29? Let me check the grammar again. Here's the rule:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nSo NT29 can only produce t53, so the first symbol in the string should be t53. But the string starts with t25. Therefore, the string does not start with t53, which is the only option for NT29.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first part doesn't match any possible expansion. However, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the start symbol or the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT29 NT46. So the first two symbols should be the expansion of NT29 followed by NT46. The string starts with t25, which would have to be the expansion of NT29 if possible. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT29 can produce t25 directly or through a series of expansions leading to t25 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me look at the grammar again. Each production for a non-terminal is written as NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> 'tN', where N is some number.\n\nSo for S -> NT29 NT46, the expansion would start with NT29. The string starts with t25, so that would require NT29 expanding to t25, but from the grammar, NT29 directly only produces t53, not t25.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's helpful because each production step can only generate a fixed number of symbols, either two or one terminal.\n\nThe given grammar is a bit long, so I should write down all the productions and see if there's a pattern.

For example, NT40 -> 't80' is a terminal. So, some of these non-terminals are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t55 t20 t54 t40 t94 t10 t18 t25 t20 t31 t36 t80 t4 t54 t56 t94 t61 t53 t34 t36 t4 t10 t55 t94 t36 t31 t22 t96 t20 t35 t34`.\n\nThat's a total of 36 tokens, so the parse tree must have a depth such that the number of symbols matches. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two, so the maximum number of symbols for a string of length n is 2^(n-1), but that's more about the structure than the actual symbols here.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. Starting from the entire string and trying to break it down into the non-terminals step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that some non-terminals are terminals already, so they correspond directly to specific symbols. For example, NT40 -> 't80' is one such case. So looking at the string, when I see 't80', I can check if it matches any terminal productions.\n\nLet me try to parse from left to right, or maybe bottom-up. Alternatively, I can build the parse tree and see if it matches the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, I can traverse the string from left to right, trying to match the non-terminals step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let's try to see if the string can be built by starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. So the string must start with the expansions of these two.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t55. Let's check which production of NT29 goes to 't55'. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' is one production, another is NT29 -> 't53' and perhaps others? Wait, NT29 has two productions: one is NT29 -> 't53', and another is NT29 -> 't53' again? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar for NT29: S->NT29 NT46, and under NT29, the productions are 't53' only. Wait, looking back, under NT22, there are multiple productions, but for NT29, I don't see other options. Wait, looking at the initial list:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, under NT29, the only production is NT29 -> 't53'. So NT29 can only produce 't53'.\n\nSo the first token must be 't53'. But the string starts with 't55', which is not 't53', so that would imply that the first production can't use NT29 to generate 't55'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, under S it's S->NT29 NT46. So S produces NT29 followed by NT46. Each of these non-terminals will generate some sequence of tokens.\n\nSo the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo the string should be divided into two parts: the expansion of NT29 and then the expansion of NT46.\n\nGiven that, let's check the beginning of the string. If NT29 must start with 't53', but the first token is 't55', that's a problem. Unless there's a typo in the grammar provided.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check again. Let me see the productions under NT29: according to the user's input, under NT29 it's:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nIs that correct? So yes, only one production, which is 't53'.\n\nTherefore, the first token must be 't53', but the string starts with 't55', so there's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, S can only produce strings that start with 't53' followed by something generated by NT46.

{"custom_id":"request-494","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I'm checking is `t22 t71 t73 t96 t56 t20 t34 t54 t34 t25 t71 t49 t54 t25 t37 t95 t10 t71 t25 t55 t22 t56 t54 t4 t21 t8 t36 t79 t31 t80 t95 t86`. \n\nFirst thing I'll do is look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands to NT29 NT46. So the string must start with whatever NT29 and NT46 produce. From the right-hand sides, NT29 \u2192 't53' and NT29 \u2192 other options, wait no, looking back, the NT29 is defined as NT29 \u2192 't53'? Or wait, looking at the rules, I think I might have misread that. Wait no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT29: NT29 -> 't53'? Or do I need to look through the rules again. Let me scan through:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'? No, wait: 't29' is in NT22 and NT84. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me list all the NT and their productions properly.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, etc. Also, NT22 has another rule, like NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 and others. Wait, the grammar seems extensive with many non-terminals. This might be a tricky one.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string according to the grammar, simulating the process. Alternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string can be derived step by step from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal, which might help in a top-down parsing approach.\n\nBut parsing a string of 35 tokens manually could be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string breaks down into segments that match the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I can identify the sequence of non-terminals that the string represents.\n\nLet me first write down the string as a list of tokens so I can process it step by step: t22, t71, t73, t96, t56, t20, t34, t54, t34, t25, t71, t49, t54, t25, t37, t95, t10, t71, t25, t55, t22, t56, t54, t4, t21, t8, t36, t79, t31, t80, t95, t86.\n\nWait, that's 35 tokens. Let me note that each production in the grammar only produces non-terminals or terminals, where each terminal is a single token like 'tXX'. So each step in the derivation will expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nSince S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the derivation must start with NT29 and NT46. So the first two tokens in the string must correspond to the expansions of NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at NT29, its production rules are:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'? Wait, no, actually, scanning through, I see NT29 in the rules. Let me check all the rules again. Wait, the production NT29 isn't directly present in the initial rules provided, but wait\u2014looking again, actually, I think I misread. Let me scan all the rules to see what NT29 does.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, etc.\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, etc.\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'? Or wait, no\u2014looking further down, I see NT29 is actually used in the rule for NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT87 and other options, but that doesn't directly give NT29's rules. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me go through each production in order.\n\nAfter S, the next rule is NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70. Then, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45. So NT22 has at least two rules.\n\nLooking further, NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, NT25 \u2192 NT92 NT25, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm forgetting the actual NT29 rules. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the rules systematically.\n\nLet me list all the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31, NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT45\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, NT25 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT25 \u2192 NT53 NT87\n- NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71, NT91 \u2192 NT55 NT16\n- NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, NT55 \u2192 NT46 NT25, etc.\n- [This is getting extensive.]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to figure out which non-terminals can produce each 'tXXX' token. Because each 'tXXX' is a terminal symbol, the derivation must eventually produce such a token. So, for each 'tXXX' in the string, it must be the result of a production that has that terminal as its right-hand side.\n\nSo let me go through each token in the string and see which non-terminals can produce it. \n\nFirst token: t22.\n\nLooking at the rules, which non-terminals have a production that includes t22? Looking through the list:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't80'? No, wait, I think I'm confused again. Maybe I should look for any NT rule where the RHS includes t22. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85, and other rules don't directly produce t22 except where:\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the rules provided, some non-terminals produce a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10' (no, wait that's 't46' \u2192 't10'?)\nWait, let me re-examine each rule:\n\nLooking for rules where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. Let's go through each:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 some non-terminals\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each non-terminal and their possible right-hand sides (as terminals if they exist).\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'\n- NT31 \u2192 't49'\n- NT14 \u2192 't56'\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n- NT70 \u2192 't54' and others.\n- NT51 \u2192 't40', 't18'?\nWait, some non-terminals have multiple productions, some as terminals, some as non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nLooking at NT8 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT91 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT29 could be a problem\u2014looking for any production where the RHS is a terminal.

Wait, let me check each rule step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that each 'tXX' must be produced by a single-step production in the grammar where a non-terminal directly maps to that terminal.\n\nSo for t22, which non-terminal(s) have a production that results in 't22'? Looking through the rules, I think I might have missed that.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t22.

Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by parsing the string step by step, breaking it down into possible components.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as a sequence and see if it can be decomposed using the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is: t36 t22 t61 t22 t37 t61 t18 t31 t8 t40 t35 t61 t74 t79 t10 t61 t74 t20 t74 t18 t8 t4 t25 t73 t54 t79 t35 t96 t21 t36 t71 t53.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the start symbol S, which produces NT29 and NT46.

Looking at the rules, NT46 can produce 't61', but I can't find a production that leads to 't36'. Alternatively, maybe t36 comes from NT46 somehow, like via other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps 't36' comes from NT84. Let's check: Does any non-terminal produce 't36' as a terminal? Looking through the rules, I see that rule28: NT84 \u2192 't71' and rule45: NT49 \u2192 't86', but I don't see t36. Wait, maybe that's a mistake.

So the string starting with t36 would need to be 't53' somehow, but that's not possible. So that might mean that t36 isn't part of NT29. Alternatively, maybe the first production is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built differently. Wait, maybe I shouldn't worry about S directly and instead parse from the start.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to split the string into the first part from NT29 and the second from NT46.\n\nLet me see if the first part t36 can be generated by NT29.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53' (rule29). So if the first token is t36, that would require that t36 is 't53', which it isn't, or that there's some other way. So that suggests that the first part may not be from NT29. Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rule for NT29 again. Yes, rule29: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So if the first token is t36, it can't be from NT29, unless it's somehow combined, but that's not possible since NT29 only produces 't53'.

Some rules also have terminals as their right-hand sides, which are essentially the basic symbols that can't be split further. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46. So, the string starts with NT29 followed by NT46.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t49 t55 t10 t86 t10 t36 t71 t96 t55 t21 t22 t21 t25 t94 t25 t31 t94 t37 t74 t73 t79 t71 t20 t55 t20 t31 t80 t53 t34 t31 t55 t87 t54`.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the bottom-up parsing method, also known as the shift-reduce parsing, but since I'm just evaluating, I'll try to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start from the left and see which symbols from the grammar can produce the starting part of the string. The start is NT29 and NT46. So, I'll break the string into these parts.\n\nFirst, NT29: Looking at the grammar, NT29 -> 't53' according to the rules. So, the first part of the string should start with t53. Checking the string, the very first token is t49, which doesn't match t53. Wait, but that might mean that maybe the initial NT29 is being further expanded into more symbols before producing t53. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a parse tree starting from the bottom. Let me think: Starting from the leaves, which are the terminals. The string is a sequence of t's and numbers, so each token is a terminal symbol derived directly from a rule.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT22 -> NT38 NT70, but some rule like NT22 also goes to 't96' or 't55'. Let me list some of the rules:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70, but also NT22 -> 't96', 't22', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, for NT22, there are multiple production rules. Let me see:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, maybe my approach should be to traverse the string and try to match production rules step by step.\n\nLet's try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t49 t55 t10 t86 ...\n\nLooking at the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should start from the end of the string to see if the last part can be reduced down.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ...t54. Checking the rules, NT70 -> 't54' and NT54 isn't a symbol because all production rules are for non-terminals only, so NT70 is a terminal. So t54 must come from NT70.\n\nSimilarly, t53 is a terminal from NT29, but that would mean that the initial NT29 reduces directly to t53. But in the string, the first token is t49, not t53. So that can't be right. That suggests that perhaps the initial NT29 isn't producing t53 directly, but some longer derivation path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's see: the string is a linear sequence, so perhaps each non-terminal in the grammar needs to expand into sequences of terminals. So the string should be a sequence of terminals that can be formed by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to break the string into parts that fit the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token, t49. Let's see where t49 comes from. Looking at the rules, NT51 -> 't22', wait no, let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't10' (rule 46: NT46 -> 't10'; rule 46 also has other options, like NT92 NT25, etc.), and there's another rule where NT55 -> 't80' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, these are the terminal productions (where the right-hand side is a terminal, i.e., a single 't' followed by a number):\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT22 -> 't22' (Wait, but NT22 as a non-terminal can't expand to itself unless it's in the left-hand side, which isn't allowed. So perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, the rules for NT22 show multiple options, but some might produce terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT22's rules:\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, none of the NT22 rules produce a terminal directly. But in the rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\nWait, no, that's still non-terminals. Hmm, then where does 't22' come from? Maybe I missed a rule.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\n NT22 -> NT92 NT31\nSo that's a production, but no terminal. Wait, is that correct? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. So all the rules that have 't' as a terminal are ones like:\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT16 -> 't38'\nNT40 -> 't84'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nSo, in the rules above, the production NT38 -> 't94' and NT49 -> 't86' would produce the tokens t94 and t86 respectively.\n\nSo, going back, the string starts with t49, which must be produced by some rule.\n\nLooking for where 't49' appears in the productions:\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT51 -> 't22', which is t22, but how about:\n\nWait, the rule NT85 -> 't74' (t74), NT31 -> 't49'\u2014so t49 comes from NT31.\n\nSo, the first token is t49, which comes from NT31. So, in the parse, we have the right-hand side of a rule for NT31 as 't49'. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the first part: NT31 -> 't49'.\n\nThen, the next part after t49 is t55. So, the second token is t55. Let's see where t55 comes from.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT55 has multiple productions:\n\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91, which are non-terminals, so it doesn't produce t55 directly.\n\nWait, oh, looking again, I see NT55 has a production NT55 -> 't21', but that's not t55. Wait, no\u2014looking back:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here.

{"custom_id":"request-505","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make it easier to parse the string because each step in the derivation would either produce two new non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the production for S is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So S must first expand into NT29 and NT46. Then, each of those non-terminals can be expanded further according to their production rules. The string we need to evaluate is a series of terminals, so each of these non-terminals must eventually produce the corresponding terminal in the string.\n\nLet me write down the string: t10 t73 t74 t37 t54 t31 t37 t74 t55 t53 t37 t96 t25 t18 t18 t55 t73 t31 t54 t4 t53 t80 t22 t71 t95 t18 t56 t8 t10 t25 t31 t71 t20.\n\nThat's 31 tokens, each a terminal. So, the derivation must produce exactly 31 terminals through the series of non-terminals.\n\nSince each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of steps in the derivation should correspond to this structure. The first step is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Each of those non-terminals needs to expand into parts of the string.\n\nI think the approach is to check if each non-terminal in the derivation can be expanded into the corresponding sequence of terminals in the string. Essentially, building a parse tree from S down to the string, ensuring that each non-terminal expands correctly to the right terminals.\n\nLet me start by mapping each non-terminal to the parts of the string it should produce. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are t10 and t73. Let me see where these appear in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT46 \u2192 t10 because there's a production NT46 \u2192 t10. So the first part, t10, must come from NT46. Wait, no, according to S \u2192 NT29 NT46, S must first expand to NT29 and NT46, so the first part is NT29, then NT46. So the string starts with t10, which is the production for NT46. That would mean that NT46 is the second non-terminal, not the first. Hmm, but in the production, S expands to NT29 first, then NT46. So the initial expansion is NT29 and NT46. So the first token should come from NT29. But in the string, the first token is t10. Wait, no. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the production S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so S expands into NT29 followed by NT46. Therefore, the leftmost non-terminal is NT29, which should produce the first part of the string, and NT46 should produce the second part.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t10. Let me check if NT29 can produce t10. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see a direct production for NT29 except in the case of NT29 \u2192 t53, which is in the rule NT29 \u2192 t53. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT29 is defined as NT22, right?\n\nWait, let me list out the non-terminals and their productions to keep track.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and note their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 | NT25 (appears multiple times)\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar is given as a list where each line is a rule.

Because looking at the production of S: NT29 (which starts the first part) and NT46 (the second part).\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string should start with NT29 producing some sequence and then NT46's.\n\nThe first token is t10, which occurs in NT46's production as NT46 \u2192 t10. So that suggests that the second non-terminal in the initial expansion (NT46) is producing t10. But in the string, the first token is t10, which would imply that NT29 is producing it, but NT29 can't directly produce t10. Looking at the rules: NT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's clarify.\n\nThe initial expansion is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the leftmost non-terminal is NT29, which should be the first part of the string, and NT46 is the second part. But the string starts with t10, which is the output of NT46. That suggests that t10 is part of the second part.\n\nSo, perhaps the first non-terminal (NT29) needs to produce a sequence that starts with some tokens, and then the second non-terminal (NT46) produces t10. But NT29 can't directly produce any terminal except t53 as per its rules. So is there a way for NT29 to produce multiple non-terminals that eventually result in the terminal stream?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think in terms of a parse tree. Each node in the tree must match a production, and the leaves must be terminals.\n\nWe have S as the root, which splits into NT29 and NT46. So, the left subtree must parse into the first part of the string, and the right subtree must parse into the second part.\n\nThe first token is t10, which is NT46's production. So perhaps the right subtree is just [t10], meaning NT46 directly produces t10, making that a leaf node. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT46 can produce t10 only via a specific production.\n\nLooking back, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string I need to check is quite long. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific production rules. Each rule must produce exactly two non-terminal symbols, or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I can see that it fits the CNF structure because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t34 t54 t71 t35 t22 t71 t18 t8 t36 t54 t37 t8 t86 t21 t10 t18 t61 t55 t34 t8 t79 t71 t18 t18 t40 t4 t54 t21 t37 t8 t53 t79 t37 t18.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Starting with S, according to the grammar, S -> NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with the results of NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t34. I'll need to trace back which production rules generate t34, but perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, making sure that each terminal can be derived from a production.\n\nWait, maybe parsing is the way to go. I can try to apply the productions in reverse, breaking down the string into smaller parts. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the full string, perhaps I can split it into parts that match the grammar. The first thing is to look for terminals that can be derived from a single production. For example, if a terminal is a result of a production, I can split the string around that and continue.\n\nLooking at the string, t34 appears multiple times. From the grammar, I see that NT34 -> 't34'. So whenever I encounter t34, it's just one step back.\n\nSimilarly, t54 is in NT54, which is derived from 't54' from the grammar. So t54 is a terminal as well.\n\nI'll try to approach this step by step:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT46. So the string must split into two parts after the initial NT29 and NT46. Let's check if the string starts with t34 t54 (since NT29 is derived to 't53' and NT46 to 't10' initially, but that may change later). Wait, actually NT29 leads to 't53', which in turn leads to other terminals. I might need to build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work from the top-down using the grammar. Let's think recursively. S is NT29 NT46, so the string must be derived from the concatenation of the two parts generated by NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me check if the string can be split into two parts after some point, with the first part generated by NT29 and the second by NT46.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's 37 tokens long. Let me count them: 37. So the split has to be after the first k tokens, where k varies. For each possible split, I need to check if the first part is generated by NT29 and the second by NT46. But given that the string is too long, doing this manually would be tedious. Maybe I can find patterns or check for terminals that must come from specific productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler approach. Since the grammar consists of a bunch of productions, each rule has a left-hand side (LHS) symbol and right-hand side (RHS) which is two symbols. If any of the RHS symbols are terminals, they must match the corresponding token in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT29 -> 't53' and NT53 is further derived. Similarly, NT46 is derived into 't10'. So let's see:\n\nFor example, if S is NT29 NT46, then the first part is NT29, which leads to 't53'. So the first token should be t53. But the string starts with t34, so this doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I got the grammar rules wrong. The grammar is in CNF, so each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo let's check the provided rules. For example, NT29 -> 't53', which is a terminal. That means NT29 can't be further split; it's just 't53'. So S is NT29 NT46, which would be 't53' followed by whatever NT46 generates.\n\nWait, so if S produces NT29 NT46, and each NT29 and NT46 are terminals? Then S would produce 't53 t10'. But the string starts with t34, which doesn't match 't53 t10'. So that's a problem. Did I get the NT29 and NT46 wrong?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: NT29 -> 't53' and NT46 -> 't10'. So S would be t53 t10. But the string starts with t34, which doesn't match. So that would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar, but wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the derivation is more complex. Maybe NT29 can produce more than just 't53'; perhaps 't53' is a terminal that is itself derived from another production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT53 has a production NT53 -> NT25 NT87, which is a non-terminal pair. Then NT25 is 't73', and NT87 is 't74'. So 't73 t74' would become 't73t74'. But in the string, I don't see 't73 t74' anywhere. Instead, there's 't37 t8 t86 t21 t18 t61 t55 t37 t37 ...'. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I should draw a parse tree. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t34. From the grammar, NT34 -> 't34'. So that's a leaf node.\n\nLooking deeper, maybe I can go back to the rules. Let me see all the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT34 -> t34\n- NT54 -> t54\n- NT29 -> t53\n- NT46 -> t10\n- NT22 -> t96\n- NT84 -> t71\n- NT55 -> t80\n- NT67 -> t87\n- NT87 -> t73\n- NT85 -> t35\n- NT71 -> t55\n- NT51 -> t40\n- NT45 -> t37\n- NT87 -> t20\n- NT31 -> t8\n- NT51 -> t18\n- NT46 -> t61\n- NT61 -> t87\n- NT49 -> t86\n- NT70 -> t34\n- NT84 -> t36\n- NT13 -> t31\n- NT55 -> t21\n- Others produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t34, which is produced by NT34. So t34 can come from NT34. Now, let's see the substring after t34: t54 t71 t35 t22... which could be generated by NT54 NT71, etc. But I think I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to work backwards.\n\nLooking at the string, the last part is ... t79 t37 t18. t18 is produced by NT18, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT18.

The grammar is provided, and I need to check if the string `t36 t21 t31 t8 t18 t4 t94 t18 t87 t86 t53 t20 t21 t94 t4 t71 t49 t94 t53 t31 t25 t49 t86 t49 t54 t49 t20 t25 t53 t71 t21 t37 t49 t61` is part of the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I should remember that a CFG in CNF has production rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Also, in CNF, each production has at most two symbols on the right-hand side, which makes it efficient to parse with a CYK algorithm or similar methods. But since I'm not planning to implement a parser, maybe I can approach this by starting from the start symbol and breaking down the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol given is S, which produces NT29 NT46. So, the initial step is that the string should be a sequence starting with t53 (from NT29) followed by t10 (from NT46). Looking at the string, the first token is t36, which doesn't match t53 or t10. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, no. The start symbol S -> NT29 NT46, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT46. So, the first part of the string must be what NT29 expands to, followed by what NT46 expands to.\n\nLooking at NT29, in the grammar, it's written as NT29, but I need to check its production rules. Looking through, I see NT29 -> 't53'. So NT29 directly expands to 't53'. That makes sense, so the first part of the string should start with t53. But the given string starts with t36, which doesn't match. That suggests the string might not be in the language, but I should check if I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again. The productions for NT29: I don't see it in the provided list. Wait, the user provided lines are all the productions. Looking through, I see NT22, NT25, etc. But I don't see NT29 in the production rules. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, looking again: the production rules include NT29? No, the list I was given includes NT29, but wait, let me check: NT29->'t53', yes, that's correct. So S starts with NT29, which is 't53', then NT46, which is 't10'. So the string should start with t53 t10.\n\nBut the given string starts with t36, which is different. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the first symbol doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine. Perhaps I'm miscounting or the productions are different. Alternatively, maybe the string can be parsed differently. But in the start, the first symbol must come from NT29, which is 't53', and the second symbol from NT46, which is 't10'. So the first two symbols should be t53 t10. The given string starts with t36, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me double-check. The rule for NT29 is indeed 't53' as per the user's provided lines. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, the first two tokens should be t53 and t10, but the user's string starts with t36. That's a discrepancy. Therefore, the string is not possible under this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again. The user provided the grammar starting with S->NT29 NT46, then NT22->NT38 NT70, etc., until the end. I need to make sure I didn't miss any productions. Scanning the provided productions, indeed, I see NT29 is explicitly present: 'NT29 -> 't53''. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the first symbol is t53, which is not present in the given string.

But the token before that is t37, which is in NT52? Wait, no, looking at the grammar... Wait, looking back, I see NT45 -> 't37', and also NT87 -> 't79' and NT71 -> 't55' and NT79? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem, starting from the beginning to the end, applying the grammar rules.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The string is in reverse order? Or no, it's just a list of tokens, each being a terminal or a non-terminal step. Wait, in the problem statement, each line of the grammar shows NT... followed by ->, so for example, S -> NT29 NT46. Each non-terminal can be replaced by two other non-terminals, unless it's a terminal (like 't4').\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, each production is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each rule is of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except for the base cases which become terminals. So some non-terminals expand directly into two terminals. Hmm, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT40 -> 't80' (so NT40 is a terminal, actually, but in a typical CFG, terminals don't have productions). Wait, this might be the issue. In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So perhaps in this grammar, some non-terminals only expand to two non-terminals (S and others), and others directly to terms.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, for example, S -> NT29 NT46, which are two non-terminals. Then NT29 -> 't53'. Wait, looking back, NT29 is a non-terminal that expands to 't53' which is a terminal. So NT29 is a production that goes to a terminal. Similarly, NT22 -> NT38 NT70 and then looking more, NT38 -> 't94' and NT70 -> 't54', so NT22 would expand to 't94' and 't54', which are terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I have to make sure each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So for example, NT40 -> 't80' is a production from NT40 to a terminal.\n\nSo, with that in mind, the given string consists of these terminals, each connected in a way that if you can take the entire string and apply the reverse process of the grammar (i.e., breaking down each token into the non-terminals that can produce it), you should get an expansion that eventually reaches S.\n\nSo the approach here is to parse the string from left to right or maybe from right to left? Wait, usually, to check if a string is in the language, you can parse it using the grammar's rules, expanding non-terminals until you get terminals. But when doing it in reverse, it might help.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to write out the parse tree or use the productions in reverse, matching the string from the end backwards, trying to reduce it to S.\n\nGiven that, let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t49 t22 t54 t36 t31 t95 t34 t95 t40 t21 t34 t79 t56 t10 t25 t80 t96 t20 t49 t34 t94 t71 t37 t55 t36 t25 t86 t53 t35 t49 t4 t35 t79 t87 t71.\n\nWait, 36 tokens. That's a lot. Maybe I can break it down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as an equation where each step, we see if the current token can be matched by any non-terminal's terminal productions.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to write all the productions and then see which non-terminals can produce each token.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT46\n\nSo S can only be used if the string starts with terms from NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be derived from NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t49 and t22.\n\nSo does NT29 produce t49? Looking in the grammar, yes: NT29 -> 't53'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT29 in the production list:\n\nWait, after the initial S, NT29 is defined as:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let me organize:\n\nS: S -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22: NT22 -> NT38 NT70, NT22 -> NT53 NT45, NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT25: NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT25: Also NT25 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT40: NT40 -> 't80'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm listing all non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals are:\n\nS, NT22, NT25, NT91, NT55, NT71, NT40, NT46, NT29, NT22 (multiple rules), NT38, NT70, NT85, NT53, NT16, NT40, NT51, NT25 (multiple?), etc. It's a bit messy, but perhaps some non-terminals have multiple rules.\n\nMy plan is now to parse each token, starting from the beginning, and see if it's compatible with any non-terminal's terminal production.\n\nLet me list all possible terminal expansions for each non-terminal:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS: S -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22: NT22 can expand to:\n\n- NT38 NT70 (so a production that would generate a non-terminal and another non-terminal)\n- NT53 NT45\n- NT92 NT31\n\nBut wait, NT38 can expand? Let's check if NT38 is a terminal or not. NT38 in the grammar is defined as NT38 -> 't94', so it's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT70 -> 't54' (terminal)\n\nThus, NT22 -> 't94' 't54' via the second rule.\n\nSimilarly, NT92 is defined as NT92 -> 't55' (a terminal), and NT31 -> 't49' (terminal).\n\nSo, for all non-terminals, if I can list their possible terminal productions, that would help.\n\nI think an effective approach is to build a parse table or use the CYK algorithm, but given the time constraints, perhaps a step-by-step parse from left to right would work.\n\nBut considering the time, let me try working it out token by token.\n\nGiven the string S is t49 t22 t54 t36 t31 t95 t34 t95 t40 t21 t34 t7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which is a terminal symbol because looking at the grammar, all the right-hand sides of the productions are terminals or other non-terminals, except when a non-terminal is directly converted into a single terminal.\n\nFirst, let me understand the approach. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for the terminals, which are single symbols.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t79 t18 t71 t37 t74 t36 t37 t35 t8 t25 t21 t21 t10 t25 t54 t74 t79 t8 t96 t79 t73 t4 t8 t4 t96 t94 t35 t49 t80 t20 t74 t8 t71 t80 t31 t80`.\n\nSo, to check if this string is generated by the grammar, I can perform a leftmost derivation or a rightmost derivation.

Wait, the string is given as t55 t79 t37 t53 t21 t73 t55 t20 t86 t61 t54 t31 t8 t53 t35 t80 t20 t4 t36 t95 t22 t71 t18 t4 t40 t18 t49 t4 t61 t20 t34 t73 t53 t10 t96 t55.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't55'.

So S's right-hand side starts with 't53' and then the next non-terminal is NT46. But the string starts with 't55', which would be the first symbol.\n\nWait, that doesn't align.

So S -> NT29 NT46 would expand to 't53' followed by whatever NT46 expands into.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't55', which doesn't match 't53', so that's a problem.

The start symbol must produce two non-terminals initially. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT29 NT46. Each of these are non-terminals that need to be expanded. \n\nI think the most efficient way to approach this is through the CYK algorithm, which parses strings for CFGs. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break down the string and see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nThe string has a bunch of \"t\" followed by numbers, so it seems like most of these are terminals, probably the result of expanding non-terminals into strings of terminals. \n\nLet me list the string again without spaces: t80 t18 t31 t79 t8 t21 t61 t95 t40 t22 t80 t25 t55 t31 t53 t4 t79 t49 t54 t74 t54 t20 t54 t79 t21 t25 t31 t73 t25 t54 t73 t22 t73 t21 t73 t37 t56\n\nWait, wait, the initial grammar has S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Since the start symbol is a non-terminal, each of these must be expanded into a string, and the entire string is a concatenation of these expansions.\n\nSo the entire string is made up of two parts: one generated by NT29 and the other by NT46.\n\nI need to check if the string can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT29 and the second by NT46.\n\nBut first, I should see what NT29 and NT46 can generate.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: looking back at the grammar, I think I might have missed some. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT29's productions: It's possible that NT29 can generate t80. Because in the rules, NT29 \u2192 't53'... Wait, no, looking through all the NT29 rules, I don't see a production where NT29 is the left-hand side except where it goes to other NTs. Wait, no. The grammar only has specific rules listed, like NT8 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, the provided grammar is a big list of production rules for non-terminals. So do any of these NT29 or NT46 have rules that allow them to produce terminals, or are they only expanded into other NTs?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think most of the NTs are terminal symbols in some cases. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, which are both non-terminals, but then in other cases, like NT46 \u2192 't10', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules to see if any NTs produce terminals. \n\nYes, I see lines like NT8 \u2192 't4', NT22 \u2192 't96', NT25 \u2192 't73', NT14 \u2192 't56', NT91 \u2192 't55', NT38 \u2192 't94', NT49 \u2192 't86', etc. These are all non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal symbol. \n\nBut looking at the first production, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, both NT29 and NT46 must be expanded into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but in the end, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so their expansions must result in terminal strings.\n\nSo I need to find the leftmost derivation from S, splitting the string into the two parts from NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me think of how the CYK algorithm works. I have to check each position in the string and see if any production can generate the substring starting at that position.\n\nBut since this is a manual process, perhaps I can approach it by trying to find possible splits and see if each half can be derived.\n\nThe string has 38 tokens. Since S produces two non-terminals, the string must be split into two parts, each of which must be generated by one of the two non-terminals, NT29 and NT46.\n\nSo let's look at possible split points. For example, if I split after the 19th token, the first part is from t80 to t21, and the second part is from t25 to t56.\n\nWait, but that's assuming the split is in the middle. Actually, the total length is 38 tokens. So S would be NT29 generating the first k tokens, and NT46 generating the remaining (38 - k) tokens. So for each possible k from 1 to 37, I need to check if both NT29 can generate the first k tokens and NT46 can generate the last (38 -k).\n\nBut that's a lot, so perhaps I can find a way to match the tokens step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for each NT in the grammar and see if they can produce a substring, starting with specific terminals.\n\nLooking at NT29 and NT46 in the given grammar, perhaps their productions can help generate parts of the string.\n\nLet me see if I can find which NTs can produce certain terminal sequences.\n\nStarting with NT29:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT29, but I don't see any direct or indirect productions for NT29 except those that terminate in terminals. Wait, looking through all the rules, I think NT29 might not directly produce terminals; maybe it's only via other non-terminals. Wait no, in the rules I provided, I don't see NT29 having any productions except as a left-hand side, so perhaps NT29 can only produce a string by expanding into other NTs.\n\nWait, looking carefully, I see many productions where the left-hand side is an NT followed by other NTs and a terminal. For example:\n\nNT29: I don't see any productions for NT29 directly. Let me check again.\n\nWait the initial list starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then the next is NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, and so on. Wait, so perhaps NT29 is on the right side of other rules.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminal symbols, such as S, NT29, NT46, and many others that seem to lead to terminal symbols like 't95', 't4', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: t95 t96 t4 t54 t73 t21 t79 t74 t49 t61 t35 t61 t54 t35 t34 t74 t94 t40 t22 t79 t54 t18 t55 t36 t55 t95 t31 t74 t18 t31 t4 t61 t49 t40 t20 t74 t35.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. The productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe task is to see if this string can be derived from S. To do this, I can try to parse the string backwards, reconstructing possible non-terminals. Alternatively, I can use a top-down or bottom-up approach. Maybe I'll try the bottom-up method here, starting from the string and trying to find leftmost derivations.\n\nBut before diving into parsing, let me list all the production rules for clarity.\n\nThe production rules are:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT51 -> 't40'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, I notice that some of these productions have the same non-terminal, so perhaps there's redundancy. For example, NT55 has two productions: NT55 -> NT49 NT91 and NT55 -> NT22 NT14, but in the second rule, it's actually the same as the first line under NT55, which is 't53' and 't21'. Wait no, looking again, I see:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT55 has:\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT55 -> ... I see that it's listed twice: NT55 -> NT22 NT14 and then again later as NT55 -> 't21'.

Because NT55 can also produce a terminal 't21'. So that's one of the rules for NT55.\n\nSo NT55 has three productions:\n\n1. NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\n2. NT55 -> NT22 NT14\n\n3.

Both are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT29 and NT46, from the rules provided:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n- NT46 -> 't10' or 't55' or ... wait, looking at the grammar, NT46 has multiple productions:\n\nLet me check the grammar rules:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT31 NT53\nNT46 -> NT55 NT52?

I think in the given grammar, NT46 is defined as:\n\nFrom the list provided:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT31 NT53\nNT46 -> NT25 NT45\nNT46 -> NT45 NT37\nWait, I'm not seeing NT46 producing directly to 't10' but from earlier, I see:\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I made a mistake. Let's list all the NT46 productions correctly:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT31 NT53\nNT46 -> NT25 NT45\nNT46 -> NT45 NT37\nWait, but nowhere does NT46 directly produce a terminal, except maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking back, perhaps I should recheck the grammar rules:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar given:\n\nIt's a list, so let me list all the rules where NT46 is on the left:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT46 -> NT22 NT14\n- NT46 -> NT25 NT87\n- NT46 -> NT13 NT55\n- NT46 -> NT31 NT53\n- NT46 -> NT25 NT45\n- NT46 -> NT45 NT37\n\nWait, that's all. So the only NT46 productions are compositions of other non-terminals. I don't see NT46 directly producing a terminal. Instead, looking at the other non-terminals, perhaps I'm missing a terminal in the string that corresponds to NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't46'? Wait, no, the string doesn't have 't46'. Wait, no: the string is `t22 t61 t74 t36 t35 t36 t18 t40 t34 t25 t10 t87 t8 t96 t61 t53 t34 t74 t40 t35 t18 t10 t35 t71 t87 t96 t4 t4 t87 t8 t35 t55 t56 t79 t21 t49 t87 t20`. So all the terminals are t followed by a number, but none of them are t46. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, perhaps NT46 can be derived into a terminal. Let me recheck the grammar. For example, NT46 has a production NT45 -> t37. So if NT46 is derived into NT25 NT45, then NT25 could be a non-terminal. Looking at NT25, the rules:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT25 -> 't73'\n\nAh, there we go. So NT25 can produce 't73' as a terminal. So if NT46 is derived into NT25 't73', then that would give 't73'. But in the string, I don't see 't73', but I do see 't74', 't36', etc.\n\nBut wait, the initial S is NT29 NT46. NT29 is 't53' and NT46 is a non-terminal that needs to be derived. So let's say S expands first to 't53' and NT46.\n\nNow, NT46 needs to produce a string of terminals. Since NT46 can be broken down into other non-terminals, perhaps recursively until terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n1. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n2. NT46 -> NT22 NT14\n3. NT46 -> NT25 NT87\n4. NT46 -> NT13 NT55\n5. NT46 -> NT31 NT53\n6. NT46 -> NT25 NT45\n7. NT46 -> NT45 NT37\n\nEach of these involves two non-terminals, except NT45, which can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, NT45 -> t37 and NT13 -> t31, etc.\n\nLet me try to see if any of these can lead to the string.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since S is NT29 NT46, which is 't53' and NT46. So the first token is 't53', followed by whatever NT46 can produce.\n\nSo the string starts with 't53', but looking at the given string, the first token is 't22', not 't53'. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the string is as follows:\n\nFirst token is 't22', but according to the grammar, the first symbol should be 't53' because S is NT29 NT46, which is 't53' followed by whatever NT46 can produce.\n\nBut wait, the given string is: t22 t61... which starts with 't22', which is not 't53' or anything else listed as S's production. S is NT29 NT46, which is 't53' and NT46. So the first token should be 't53'. But in the string, it's 't22'.\n\nThat's a problem. If the first symbol is 't22', then it can't be derived from S, because S starts with 't53'.\n\nSo, that would immediately mean that the string is not generated by the grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I haven't misunderstood the grammar. Maybe S is something else. No, the grammar says S -> NT29 NT46, so S produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. NT29 -> 't53', so the string starting from S must begin with 't53'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't22', so it's impossible for this string to be generated by this grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that most of the rules are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, meaning each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. However, some rules like NT40 \u2192 't80' are terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t55 t4 t61 t55 t94 t87 t94 t36 t80 t37 t53 t79 t71 t36 t96 t80 t56 t37 t61 t86 t55 t20 t8 t56 t31 t56 t36 t87 t74 t79 t56 t25 t37 t96 t71 t61 t53 t86`.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string must start with the expansion of NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me break down the string into two parts: the part generated by NT29 and the part generated by NT46.\n\nFirst, I'll consider NT29. Looking at the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT22. So NT29 expands into NT22. NT22 has multiple productions. Let me check the given grammar for NT22:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nSo NT22 can expand into three different options. I'll need to see which path the string takes.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part after N29 is 't55 t4 t61 t55 t94 t87 t94 t36 t80 t37 t53 t79 t71 t36 t96 t80 t56 t37 t61 t86 t55 t20 t8 t56 t31 t56 t36 t87 t74 t79 t56 t25 t37 t96 t71 t61 t53 t86'\n\nWait, that's a bit long. Let me note that after NT29 (which is NT22), the first symbol is 't55'. So I'll look at the possible productions from NT22.\n\nIf NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70:\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT55 (since NT38 \u2192 NT55), and NT70 \u2192 't54' (from NT70's production). So the expansion would be 't55' and 't54'. But in the string, after 't55' comes 't4', which doesn't match 't54'. So this path might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31, then:\n\nNT92 \u2192 NT25, so NT25 has multiple productions. Let's see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT49 NT25 | NT22 NT14 | other? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nBut wait, in the given rules, NT25 is defined as NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT55, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, etc. I think I need to list all the rules for NT25:\n\nLooking back, NT25 expands into multiple options:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nNT25 \u2192 NT92 NT31\nWait, no, let me recheck the grammar:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT25 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, maybe I'm misparsing that. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT25 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, actually, looking at it again, I see:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT25 -> NT92 NT31\nWait, but in the initial list, I see:\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nSo maybe I should think of NT25's productions.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAfter NT29 expands to NT22, the first token is 't55', which suggests NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 since NT38\u2192NT55 (as per rule NT38 \u2192 NT55) and NT70 \u2192 't54'. But in the string, after 't55' is 't4', which is not 't54', so that path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, another NT22 production: NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45.\n\nLet's see what NT53 expands to. Looking at the grammar, there's a rule:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT31 (as per rule NT31 \u2192 't49', but wait, in the grammar, it's:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nBut for NT53, do we have a production? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT91 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't80'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT92 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT85 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me try to build a tree for the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, building the parse tree for the string.\n\nLet me start by considering S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the entire string must be the concatenation of expansions from NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, after the first part (from NT29), the second part should come from NT46.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst, NT29 expands to NT22. As we saw, NT22's possible expansions are:\n\n1. NT38 NT70\n2. NT53 NT45\n3. NT92 NT31\n\nIn the string, after 't55' comes t4, which is not part of the first option (t55 t54), so it could be the second option. Let's explore that.\n\nSo, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45.\n\nNow, NT53 \u2192 NT31 \u2192 't49'? Wait, but in the grammar, NT31 is defined as 't49', so NT53 expands to 't49'?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I think NT53 is a non-terminal, so it must be expanded further unless it's directly a terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55 (from rule: NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55)\nand other rules, but in the given list, NT53 appears in several productions:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55 (1st line)\nNT53 \u2192 NT53 NT14 (but this is a left recursion, which is not helpful)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the rules for NT53 beyond these.\n\nWait, the given rules include:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\nNT31 \u2192 't49'\nNT14 \u2192 't56'\n\nSo if NT53 expands to NT13 NT55, then we have to expand each further.\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31', which is a terminal.\n\nNT55 \u2192 't80', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, NT53 \u2192 't49' 't80'\n\nIn the string, after 't55' (from NT53) comes 't4', which would be 't49'? No, 't4' is different from 't49'. So perhaps this path is not correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-570","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me see. First, I should understand the grammar structure and see if I can parse the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, every string generated by this grammar must start with NT29 followed by NT46. Then, each NT production is broken down into two other NTope productions. For example, NT29 can be broken down into NT22 and NT49. Hmm, but looking at the productions, I see that many of them have terminal symbols, like 't80', 't4', etc. So, the leaves of this grammar are the 't' followed by a number, which I guess are terminal symbols representing parts of the string.\n\nThe string given is: `t35 t80 t35 t71 t10 t61 t87 t36 t40 t22 t34 t40 t86 t36 t37 t73 t22 t74 t56 t95 t4 t80 t49 t4 t53 t36 t71 t49 t55 t73 t37 t25 t73 t10 t36 t40 t94 t31 t4`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be built by the grammar, starting from S and breaking it down according to the production rules.\n\nFirst step: Start with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the first part is NT29 and then NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35. Now, I need to see if t35 can be produced by NT29. Looking at the production rules for NT29, the only production is NT29 \u2192 NT22 NT49. So, NT29 can't produce t35 directly. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe in the productions, I should be looking for NT29's production.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, is there any rule that produces t35 from NT29 directly? Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT22 NT49. So, no, NT29 only goes further down.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a linear sequence of terminals and non-terminals, so I need to parse it from start symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build the parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the string.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would help, but given that the string is long and the grammar isn't trivial, maybe it's better to attempt a top-down approach or look for a bottom-up way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for each production and see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nWait, let's see: The string starts with t35, but S produces NT29 NT46, so maybe the first part is NT29, which is split into NT22 NT49. Then, each of those can split further, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since each step is a binary split, maybe the string should, when divided according to the production steps, match the symbols.\n\nBut given that the grammar seems to produce a lot of t followed by numbers, perhaps the string is a combination of these t symbols in sequences that match the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to see if the entire string can be associated with the structure of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nGiven that, each non-terminal in the derivation replaces into two non-terminals, or sometimes a terminal, in each step.\n\nSo, starting from S, we have S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nSo the derivation starts with two symbols: NT29 and NT46. The string must be a sequence that results from expanding these non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLet me see: The first symbol in the string is t35. Now, S starts as NT29 and NT46. So, the initial expansion must produce a string starting with t35, so perhaps NT29 is expanding to something that starts with t35, but from the grammar, NT29 only expands to NT22 NT49. So that would mean when we expand NT29, it becomes NT22 and NT49, each of which can expand further.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t35. But in the grammar, none of the non-terminals except for those with a terminal seem to have a direct production of a single terminal. For example, NT25 \u2192 't73'\u2014wait, that's a terminal production. Wait, in the rules, for NT46 \u2192 't10', etc. So, NT46 can directly produce t10, for example.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is to parse the string recursively by trying to match it against the productions. Let's think of it as a parsing problem using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's try to find a way to split it into two parts that match the productions.\n\nBut wait, the string is 42 symbols long. That might be too tedious by hand, but maybe there's a pattern I can pick up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work my way up from the leaves. The string has t35 as the first symbol, which must come from some expansion of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, none of the non-terminals except the ones that directly produce terminals can produce a single t. So, perhaps the first symbol t35 comes from a non-terminal that eventually expands into it.\n\nWait, but t35 appears at the start. So that t35 must come from a non-terminal production. But in the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t35. So either that's impossible, or perhaps it's an error. Unless t35 is in some other rule that I missed.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't35' as a terminal. Scanning through the rules, I see NT53 \u2192 't31', NT46 \u2192 't10', NT85\u2192't36', etc. Wait, does any NT produce t35? Let me check:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't80'\n\n- NT71\u2192't55'\n\n- NT29\u2192 NT22 NT49\n\n- NT22\u2192 NT53 NT45 etc.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I don't see any that directly produce 't35'. The earliest I see t35 is in the string. So perhaps the first symbol, t35, cannot be produced by any of the NTs. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The rules provided are:\n\nHere are the rules again:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 \u2192 't84' and 't67' (Wait, let's check NT40: the rule is 'NT40 -> NT84 NT67'. Wait, earlier I thought it's 't84' and 't67' but looking again, in the rules I provided, yes, NT40 \u2192 't84' and 't67'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT55 \u2192 't80', etc.\n\nWait, but looking through all the rules, none of the NTs directly produce 't35'. Let's see: looking at the leaves:\n\nIn the list above, I see rules that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't80'\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't73' ?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some end with 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, checking each production:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't96'\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't87' ?\n\nWait, checking NT85: rule says NT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16.

If it is, I have to say \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\". \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe task is to determine if the given string can be generated by the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols (all the lowercase 't's followed by numbers) that I need to check against the possible derivations from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT29 and NT46. So, the string should start with the concatenation of NT29 and NT46. Let me check the string: the first two tokens are t71 and t79. Wait, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string should start with whatever NT29 produces and then whatever NT46 produces.\n\nNow, I need to trace how NT29 and NT46 can produce the starting terms. Let's look at NT29. From the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT8 NT53. So NT29 is replaced by NT8 and NT53.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 is in multiple productions. For instance, NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, etc. In the string, the second token after t71 is t79, so perhaps that's part of NT46. Let me check the grammar: NT46 has multiple productions, including NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, but I'm not sure which one applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to follow a step-by-step approach, building the string from the start symbol and seeing if I can map the tokens accordingly.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1.

Looking at the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't4'. So t4 is produced from NT8. But in the string, after t71 comes t79, not t4. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the productions.

Let me list all NT40's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar: \"NT40 -> 't80'\". There's also \"NT40 -> 't45'\"? No, looking back, no. Only \"NT40 -> 't80'\". Oh wait, no.

The grammar is provided with several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. This form is particularly useful for parsing using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I might not need that here. Instead, I can approach this by breaking down the string into its components and checking if each part can be derived from the given non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the non-terminals (like NT22, NT25, etc.) derive into terminal symbols like 't' followed by a number. For example, NT8 \u2192 't4', NT91 \u2192 't55', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce these terminal tokens, and others produce two non-terminals which would need further expansion.\n\nThe input string is: t94 t10 t20 t34 t35 t49 t20 t53 t53 t56 t55 t95 t31 t79 t74 t71 t22 t34 t25 t10 t21 t35 t25 t8 t25 t21 t87 t37 t94 t10 t79 t79 t79 t18 t8 t22 t71 t86 t25 t20.\n\nEach token in the string is either a 't' followed by a number or seems to be a token from the grammar. The first step is to check if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. If a token corresponds to a non-terminal, I need to see if it can be expanded into that token through the given production rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I can list all the terminals:\n\n- t94 (appears in NT29 \u2192 t53)\nWait, actually, I need to check each production rule.

So, first, I'll list all the tokens in the string:\n\n1. t94\n2. t10\n3. t20\n4. t34\n5. t35\n6. t49\n7. t20\n8. t53\n9. t53\n10. t56\n11. t55\n12. t95\n13. t31\n14. t79\n15. t74\n16. t71\n17. t22\n18. t34\n19. t25\n20. t10\n21. t21\n22. t35\n23. t25\n24. t8\n25. t25\n26. t21\n27. t87\n28. t37\n29. t94\n30. t10\n31. t79\n32. t79\n33. t79\n34. t18\n35. t8\n36. t22\n37. t71\n38. t86\n39. t25\n40. t20\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these tokens can be derived from the grammar. That is, each token either is a terminal or is the result of a chain of productions from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the tokens:\n\nt94: From NT38 \u2192 t94\nt10: NT40 \u2192 t80 and others, but wait, looking at the grammar rules, NT40 is one of the rules that produce 't80'. Wait, no, actually, from the production rules, NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67. But there's a rule NT40 \u2192 't80'? Let me check the list again.\n\nAh yes, here: \"NT40 -> 't80'\". So NT40 directly produces 't80'. But in the string, t10 is present. Where does t10 come from? Looking at the rules, NT46 \u2192 't10' is one of the productions. So 't10' is directly from NT46.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nt20 is from NT85 \u2192 't20'. Looking at the production rules, yes, \"NT85 -> NT51 NT16\", but also \"NT87 \u2192 't20'\". Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules say:\n\n\"NT85 -> NT51 NT16\"\n\n\"NT87 -> 't20'\"\n\nYes, so t20 is from NT87. So that works.\n\nt34 comes from where? Looking at the rules, NT70 \u2192 't54'; wait, no. Let me check each production:\n\nWait, let's take each token and see if they are terminals or can be derived.\n\n1. t94 \u2192 NT38, which is a production rule \"NT38 \u2192 t94\". So yes, NT38 can derive t94.\n\n2. t10 \u2192 NT46 can produce t10 directly because \"NT46 -> 't10'\".\n\n3. t20 \u2192 NT87 can produce it since \"NT87 \u2192 't20'\".\n\n4. t34 \u2192 Wait, NT70 \u2192 't54' is one rule, but where is t34 coming from? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT84 \u2192 't71', and NT70 \u2192 't54'. But 't34' is in the string. So I need to see if 't34' is a terminal or if it's derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, none of the productions directly result in 't34' as a terminal. So 't34' must come from a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-589","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think is a specific type of context-free grammar where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nLet me look at the grammar rules provided. They all seem to be of the form NT followed by two other NTs or sometimes a terminal like 'tXXX'. Each rule is separated by a hyphen. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which means the start symbol S produces the combination of NT29 and NT46. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't4' means the non-terminal NT8 directly produces the terminal 't4'.\n\nThe string I'm given is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. So I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the start symbol S produces NT29 NT46. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Each of these NTs will then produce other NTs or terminals. My approach should be to parse the string from left to right, trying to match possible productions.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, 37 symbols long, it's a bit time-consuming to do manually. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the structure of the string makes sense with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the tree structure of the derivation. Each time I have a non-terminal, it can split into two non-terminals or terminals, adding to the string. So, for example, S splits into NT29 and NT46. Let's look at each:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53', so that's a terminal, right? Wait, no, wait. Looking back, the grammar rules include NT29 \u2192 't53'? Let me check the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the NT29 rule: Yes, NT29 \u2192 't53'\u2014so when we expand NT29, it directly produces the terminal 't53'. Similarly, NT46 can be expanded in multiple ways, sometimes into terminals.\n\nWait, but if NT29 is replaced by 't53', then the first symbol in the string is 't37', which isn't 't53', so that would mean that in the string, the first symbol 't37' can't come from NT29. Hmm, that suggests that the string starts with 't37', which isn't what NT29 produces. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. For NT29, in the given rules: oh, wait, under NT29: it's only defined as NT29 \u2192 't53'. So NT29 can only produce 't53', right? So if the string starts with 't37', that can't come from NT29. That suggests that maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar because the first symbol doesn't match any production from the start symbol.\n\nWait, but maybe S can produce different chains, and the first symbols are built by combining different NTs. Let me think. Wait, S is NT29 NT46. So when S is expanded, it's always producing a string of two NTs (or terminals, depending on their rules). So the first two symbols in the string would be the concatenation of whatever NT29 expands to and whatever NT46 expands to.\n\nBut looking at NT29: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So the first symbol in the string must be 't53'. However, the string starts with 't37', which is different. So that's a problem. So based on this, the string cannot be produced by this grammar because the first symbol is 't37' but the start symbol S always starts with 't53' as the first symbol from NT29.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 'No' because the first symbol doesn't match the production of the start symbol.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's list them out:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n3. NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n4. NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n5. NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n6. NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n7. NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n8. NT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n9. NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n10. NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n11. NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n12. NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n13. NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n14. NT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n15. NT40 \u2192 't80'\n16. NT51 \u2192 't22'\n17. NT25 \u2192 't73'\n18. NT31 \u2192 't49'\n19. NT14 \u2192 't56'\n20. NT91 \u2192 't55'\n21. NT70 \u2192 't54'\n22. NT51 \u2192 't40'\n23. NT45 \u2192 't37'\n24. NT8 \u2192 't4'\n25. NT46 \u2192 't10'\n26. NT87 \u2192 't74'\n27. NT67 \u2192 't87'\n28. NT84 \u2192 't71'\n29. NT29 \u2192 't53'\n30. NT22 \u2192 't96'\n31. NT92 \u2192 't25'\n32. NT85 \u2192 't35'\n33. NT38 \u2192 't94'\n34. NT55 \u2192 't80'\n35. NT87 \u2192 't20'\n36. NT31 \u2192 't8'\n37. NT51 \u2192 't18'\n38. NT87 \u2192 't79'\n39. NT46 \u2192 't55'\n40. NT31 \u2192 't95'\n41. NT46 \u2192 't61'\n42. NT49 \u2192 't86'\n43. NT70 \u2192 't34'\n44. NT84 \u2192 't36'\n45. NT13 \u2192 't31'\n46. NT55 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, some of these rules are duplicated. Like NT46 appears multiple times. Let me check:\n\n- Rule 10: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- Rule 41: NT46 \u2192 t55\n- Rule 46: NT46 \u2192 t55 (duplicate of rule 10?)\n\nWait, no, rules should be unique. Let me check the numbering again.\n\nLooking at the list, I see that rule 10, 25, 46, and 41 are duplicates of the same production in different numbers. Hmm, that might be a mistake in the original input, but I'll proceed as is.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt34 t25 t95 t10 t36 t87 t96 t61 t95 t8 t35 t4 t40 t40 t31 t31 t55 t96 t80 t21 t22 t10 t18 t10 t36 t8 t20 t74 t74 t8 t87 t96 t8 t36 t20 t22 t87 t34 t86 t96 t95.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let's see if each non-terminal in the string can be reduced according to the rules.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t34. Looking at the grammar, t34 is derived from NT70, which is production 23: NT70 \u2192 't34'. So the first thing to note is that t34 is directly produced by NT70.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol t34 comes from NT70. Now, looking at production rule for NT70, it's simply 't34', so we can check off t34 and move to the next symbol.\n\nNext is t25. What produces t25? Looking at the rules, NT92 \u2192 't25' (rule 31). So t25 comes from NT92.\n\nNext is t95. Let's see where t95 comes from. Looking through the rules, I see NT22 \u2192 't96' (rule 30) and 't95' is part of NT22's rules? Wait, no:\n\nLooking again, in the rules, I see NT22 has multiple productions:\n\nRules 11, 12, 13: \n\n11. NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n12. NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n13. NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 again? Or wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let's list NT22's rules as per the given:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 (rule 2)\n\nThen rules 11,12,13:\n\n11. NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n12. NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n13. Wait, no, in the given, it's:\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, at the beginning, the grammar is a list, maybe it's better to compile all rules for each non-terminal. Let me write down each non-terminal and their productions.\n\nStart:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46 (rule1)\n\nNT22 has rules: rule2, rule11, rule12. Wait, the initial list had:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 (rule2)\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 (rule11)\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31 (rule12)\n\nSo NT22 can produce NT38NT70, NT53NT45, or NT92NT31.\n\nThen, for NT22, the other rules are 12 and 11.\n\nWait, so in our string, the third symbol is t95. So after t34 and t25, the third symbol is t95.\n\nt95 is a terminal. Looking at the rules, the only production that directly produces t95 is NT14 \u2192 't56' (rule19), or other rules? Let me check.\n\nWait, rule 40: NT55 \u2192 't21' (wait, no, look again).\n\nWait, looking through the rules, t95 is produced by NT51 and maybe others? Let's see:\n\nLooking for t95 in the rules, I see:\n\nRule 40: NT31 \u2192 't95' (rule 40)\nRule 37: NT51 \u2192 't18' (not t95)\nRule 38: NT87 \u2192 't79' (no)\nRule 46: NT46 \u2192 't55' (no)\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I see:\n\nrule40: NT31 \u2192 't95'\n\nSo yes, NT31 can produce t95.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t25 (which came from NT92) comes t95. So we have NT92 \u2192 't25' and then t95 is from NT31. But how would NT31 be derived? Because NT31 is a non-terminal, we need to see how it's derived.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT31 has productions:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49' (rule18)\nNT14 \u2192 't56' (rule19)\nIs there any rule for NT31 beyond that? Wait, let me check all the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT31 only appears in rule18 and rule40: NT31 \u2192 't49' and NT31 \u2192 't95.'\n\nSo for NT31 to produce t95, it must be an option.\n\nBut in our case, the string is t34 t25"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-594","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that structure since all productions are in one of those forms.\n\nThe grammar is a bit complex with many non-terminals and productions. The string to evaluate is: `t87 t61 t53 t36 t20 t34 t21 t35 t8 t22 t40 t31 t73 t36 t54 t56 t49 t20 t94 t71 t53 t36 t80 t55 t95 t40 t35 t95 t95 t95 t71 t35 t34 t22 t18 t8 t22 t94 t54 t8 t10 t40`.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I think I should work backwards. Starting from the start symbol S and see if I can replace non-terminals step by step to reach the string. Alternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can parse it from the bottom up, expanding non-terminals and ensuring each symbol in the string matches the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT29 and NT46. Let's split the string into two parts: before the first space and after, each part corresponding to the two non-terminals from S. Wait, actually, the productions are S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the entire string is built from NT29 and NT46. So the entire string must be produced by NT29 and NT46 with their expansions.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT46. Let's look at the productions for NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nNT29 \u2192 NT53 NT22\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\nNT13 \u2192 NT31 NT56\nWait, no, looking back, for NT29, is it NT53 and NT22?

Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at all NT rules:\n\nNT51 \u2192 't22'\nNT25 \u2192 't73'\nNT22 \u2192 't96'\nNT92 \u2192 't25'\nNT85 \u2192 't35'\nNT38 \u2192 't94'\nNT55 \u2192 't80'\nNT87 \u2192 't74'\nNT67 \u2192 't87'\nNT84 \u2192 't71'\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\nWait, no, the rule for NT29 is NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT22.\n\nLooking back: NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT22.\n\nSo, NT29 produces two non-terminals, NT53 and NT22.

Wait, in the provided grammar, NT46 has the following rules:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nAlso, later down, NT46 is written again as:\nNT46 -> NT46?\nWait, maybe duplication.\n\nWait, no, perhaps another line says:\n\nNT46 -> 't10' \u2705\nand NT46 -> 't55' \u2705, but that would be conflicting unless they are different positions.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the provided rules are:\n\n...\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\n...\nLooking at NT46, are there rules assigning it to 't10' and 't55'? I think so. Let me count:\n\nEarlier, I saw NT46 -> NT92 NT25, which would translate to... well, perhaps it's better to map each NT to its terminal if possible.\n\nWait, the NT46 seems to have two rules that end with terminals:\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n- NT46 -> 't55'\n\nSo perhaps NT46 can produce either 't10' or 't55' based on different derivation paths. But that would mean both are direct terminals, so depending on which is taken, the string can branch. But wait, the grammar should be in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a production where every rule is either a terminal or two non-terinals.\n\nSo perhaps each production is either two NTEs or a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the provided rules, for example:\n\nNT8 -> 't4' (terminal)\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nSo these are terminals, others branch into NTEs.\n\nWait, but the main string starts with t4 t21. So t4 is NT8, which is the first, then t21, which is another NT.\n\nSo the first part is t4 (NT8) and t21. Let's see, t21 is what? Looking at the NTEs, I don't immediately see something. Wait, in the rules, do any NTE derive to 't21'?\n\nLooking through, I see NT51 -> 't22', but nothing's pointing to 't21'. Wait, but NT22 -> something? Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan the rules for NTEs that produce 't21':\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NTE rules that directly produce 't21'. Hmm, so that might be an issue. Because the string is t4 followed by t21, so if t21 isn't a terminal in any rule, then the string can't be generated, which would mean the answer is 'No'. But that seems odd because the string has several t21 parts.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then the solution would simply be 'No' because t21 isn't a terminal in any rule. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back through the rules:\n\nIs there any NTE rule that ends with 't21'? For example:\n\nLooking at NT45: No. NT49: I don't see that. NT31: 't49'; NT55: 't80'; others like NT25, NT22, etc., don't have 't21'. So none of the NTEs are directly assigned to 't21'. So if the string includes a t21, it's impossible because t21 is not a terminal.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the grammar rules. Perhaps I'm supposed to see that some NTEs can derive into strings that include 't21' indirectly through multiple steps. But I don't think so because 't21' hasn't been assigned anywhere as a terminal by any rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the analysis, and I'm missing a rule that defines 't21' as a terminal. Let me review the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n- NT49 -> NT25 NT87\n- NT16 -> NT38 NT55\n- NT40 -> NT84 NT67\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n- NT51 -> 't22', 't40', 't37', 't56', 't71', 't45', 't87', 't51'? Wait no: looking through each rule, I see that NT51 has rules:\n\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT45 -> 't37'\n- NT87 -> 't74'\n- NT31 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-605","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with non-terminals and terminals, and the string to evaluate consists of a series of terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure because each production either results in two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t74 t54 t25 t80 t80 t40 t86 t87 t31 t73 t34 t54 t71 t86 t79 t61 t36 t95 t21 t56 t55 t20 t74 t96 t74 t79 t49 t35 t21 t35 t95 t40 t21 t20 t71 t53 t61 t54 t20 t80 t56 t86 t56.\n\nWait, I notice a repetition in the string, especially towards the end. Let me count the length\u2014probably not necessary yet, but maybe useful later.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string using the given grammar. Since it's in CNF, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. This process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, resulting in the string.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to build a leftmost derivation tree (parse tree) for the string. Alternatively, I can try to break the string into chunks that correspond to production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure I recall all the steps. Since the grammar is in CNF, CYK is manageable. Wait, the CYK algorithm is used for parsing with productions in CNF, so that's probably a way to go.\n\nBut let me try another approach first. Let's see what the start symbol is. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string must start with NT29 and NT46, which are non-terminals. Each of these will produce more symbols, and so on, until we get to terminals.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols of the string: t74 t54. Let me check what NT74 and NT54 produce. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking up NT74\u2014oh, wait, the given productions don't include NT74. Instead, I see NT74 is not a non-terminal; instead, let me check the productions. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. The grammar includes NT74? Wait, looking back: the productions are given, and I need to see what each non-terminal produces.\n\nWait, let me re-express them:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nWait, looking at all the NT symbols.

Wait, line 36 says NT31 is 't95', line 34 says NT31->'t8'. That can't be correct because a non-terminal can't have two production rules.

The string provided is a sequence of symbols: `t37 t20 t20 t87 t61 t79 t56 t49 t20 t54 t8 t21 t36 t4 t8 t61 t96 t87 t4 t73 t96 t54 t54 t56 t53 t21 t74 t80 t21 t21 t86 t86 t40 t25 t74 t25 t36 t22 t10 t54 t34 t95 t25 t94`.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) has their own productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, most of them split into two non-terminals, except some like NT40, NT51, etc., which go directly to terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding S using these productions.\n\nSince the string is long, building a parse tree might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to match the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can match the entire string by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT29 followed by NT46. Let's break that down.\n\nLooking at NT29: its production is 't53'. So the first symbol in the string should be t53. Checking the string, yes, the first token is t37, which doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, looking back: the first token is t37, but according to NT29's production, it should be t53. That's a mismatch. So the grammar doesn't produce t37, but the string starts with t37. Therefore, this string shouldn't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check NT29 again. Oh, yes, NT29's production is 't53'. So the first token must be t53. The string starts with t37, which is a different token. That suggests that the string isn't produced by this grammar.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there's any possibility of derivation. Maybe there's a way that NT29 could end up being t37 through multiple expansions, but in CNF, each production for a non-terminal is fixed. Since NT29 only maps to 't53', and 't37' is not t53, there's no way for the first token to be t37. Therefore, the string can't be derived from S.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string does not match the grammar's starting symbol S, which starts with NT29, producing 't53' instead of 't37'. \n\nNo\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that I can take advantage of. The string I need to evaluate is quite long, so I should think of a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails.

This structure helps in parsing the string using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to figure it out manually here, I'll approach it step by step.\n\nThe given grammar has several production rules.

NT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait a second, I notice some inconsistencies here. For example, NT55 appears in multiple production rules: rule 5 says NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, rule 15 says NT51 \u2192 't22' (though 15 is a different symbol), and rule 34 also says NT55 \u2192 't80' which conflicts with rule 5. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, looking again: rule 5 is NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, rule 15 is NT51 \u2192 't22', rule 34 is NT55 \u2192 't80'. Wait, that's a problem because NT55 can produce both a string and a non-terminal. That would make the grammar inconsistent. Maybe rule 34 is a typo. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, rule 5: NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\nRule 15: NT51 \u2192 't22'\nRule 34: NT55 \u2192 't80'\n\nOh, wait, perhaps I misread. Rule 5 has NT55 on the left. Rule 34 is another rule where NT55 appears on the right as a terminal. So that's a problem because the same NT55 symbol is both a non-terminal in a production and a terminal. That would violate the structure of the grammar. That should be a red flag because it means the grammar isn't properly defined, which could cause issues.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me check each rule carefully. Number 5 is NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, number 29 is NT55 \u2192 't80', number 33 is NT55 \u2192 't80'? Wait, no, I think I misnumbered earlier.\n\nWait, the user provided all the rules from S to NT46. Looking again, I see that NT55 has production 5: NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, and production 15: NT51 \u2192 't22' is a different NT. Then production 25: NT46 \u2192 't10' is another terminal. Maybe I misread the rules. Let me list all the NTs and their productions.\n\nAlternate approach: Maybe some of these rules are written more succinctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some rules are duplicates or incorrectly numbered. Maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm counting. Let's try listing all the rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n3. NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n4. NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n5.

Hmm, perhaps rule 5 is NT55 -> NT49 NT91, and rule 34 is NT55 \u2192 't80', which would mean that NT55 can produce both a string and another NT.

{"custom_id":"request-626","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step because it's a bit complex, but manageable.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production, and the productions are left- or right- recursive.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, let me see the structure. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46. Each of these is a non-terminal that further breaks down into other non-terminals until at some point they produce terminals like 't8', 't4', etc. So the goal is to see if the given string can be derived from S by expanding these non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe string given is: t55 t96 t87 t71 t31 t86 t74 t40 t73 t34 t87 t56 t61 t40 t34 t4 t37 t36 t71 t36 t10 t94 t87 t20 t4 t10 t49 t96 t71 t86 t8 t49 t79 t35 t94 t79 t8 t87 t54 t95 t55 t31 t49 t36 t56.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens. I notice that each 't' is followed by a number, which suggests that each of these is a terminal symbol corresponding to a production. So each tX is a derived terminal from a non-terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation should replace a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Given that, the number of tokens in the string should follow specific patterns based on the productions.\n\nLet me first list out the productions to make it easier. They are:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 \u2192 't80'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't73'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT91 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT70 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't96'\n\nNT92 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT85 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't80'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't79'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't95'\n\nNT46 \u2192 't61'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't86'\n\nNT70 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, there's a repetition in NT55's productions: NT55 \u2192 't80' and also NT55 \u2192 't80' again. Probably a typo, but perhaps just one of them is correct. So I'll consider each production as given once.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of terminal symbols. To parse the string, I can model it as rightmost derivation because in the context of CNF, leftmost and rightmost derivations are equivalent if the grammar is non-ambiguous. But for this purpose, perhaps building a parse tree would help.\n\nBut manually parsing such a long string is daunting. Alternatively, I can try to process the string backwards, which often helps in CNF where each production can be seen as breaking down into smaller parts.\n\nLet me look at the string again:\n\nt55 t96 t87 t71 t31 t86 t74 t40 t73 t34 t87 t56 t61 t40 t34 t4 t37 t36 t71 t36 t10 t94 t87 t20 t4 t10 t49 t96 t71 t86 t8 t49 t79 t35 t94 t79 t8 t87 t54 t95 t55 t31 t49 t36 t56.\n\nWait a minute, let me count the number of tokens:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 1, 2, 3, ..., let's count:\n\nThat's a lot. Let me split the string:\n\n1. t55\n\n2. t96\n\n3. t87\n\n4. t71\n\n5. t31\n\n6. t86\n\n7. t74\n\n8. t40\n\n9. t73\n\n10. t34\n\n11. t87\n\n12. t56\n\n13. t61\n\n14. t40\n\n15. t34\n\n16. t4\n\n17. t37\n\n18. t36\n\n19. t71\n\n20. t36\n\n21. t10\n\n22. t94\n\n23. t87\n\n24. t20\n\n25. t4\n\n26. t10\n\n27. t49\n\n28. t96\n\n29. t71\n\n30. t86\n\n31. t8\n\n32. t49\n\n33. t79\n\n34. t35\n\n35. t94\n\n36. t79\n\n37. t8\n\n38. t87\n\n39. t54\n\n40. t95\n\n41. t55\n\n42. t31\n\n43. t49\n\n44. t36\n\n45. t56.\n\nWait, that's 45 tokens. That's a lot. Now, considering the grammar is in CNF, each production generates two symbols, but I need to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and each production could generate more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut, perhaps it's easier to note that each non-terminal in the grammar eventually expands into a string of terminals, with each expansion reducing the number of non-terminals. Let's look for the length of the string and see if it's feasible.\n\nIn a CNF grammar, the length of a string after k steps is 2^k. So the maximum possible number of terminals after each step doubles. Since the starting symbol is S, which is a non-terminal, each step would replace a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nOur string is 45 tokens long. To get 45 in binary terms, 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So perhaps, 6 steps or so, but 45 is not a power of 2. Wait, but in CNF, each production can only generate two non-terminals or a terminal. So the number of terminals at any point is N = initial NT after k expansions would be N = 2^k, but each production step can create more non-terminals. But the problem is that the terminal count doesn't directly relate to the same exponent because some non-terminals generate terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to see if the number of terminals is compatible with certain tree structures.\n\nBut 45 is an odd number for a CNF string. Because each step of production in CNF can expand a single NT into two NTs or a terminal. So starting from S:\n\nLevel 1: S \u2192 NT29 NT46 (2 symbols)\n\nEach of NT29 and NT46 can expand into either two NTs or a terminal. So at each step, the number of NTs can increase by one for each terminal produced.\n\nWait, this is getting too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to start parsing the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is binary. The string to evaluate is quite long, so I'll approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT29 and NT46. Looking at the string, it starts with 't34 t53 t10 t96 t4 t55...'. Wait, but NT29 and NT46 should produce something that matches the beginning of the string.\n\nWait, let me see. The first step is to see how the string can be broken down. The first token is 't34'. Let's check the productions for NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT29 -> NT29 doesn't seem to be in the list\u2014wait, actually, I see NT29 -> 't53' from the rules. Wait, yes, in the rules, NT29 directly produces 't53', right? So maybe NT29 can go directly to a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 has several rules. Let's see, NT46 -> NT92 NT25, but also NT46 directly goes to 't10'. So starting from NT46, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the first step, S -> NT29 NT46. So the string must start with whatever NT29 produces and whatever NT46 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't34'. But NT29 produces 't53' or can it go somewhere else? Wait, I'm looking for NT29's productions. In the rules, I see NT29 -> 't53' and also perhaps other rules? Let me check: No, the production for NT29 is directly to 't53', so it can only produce 't53'. So the first part, NT29, would produce 't53', which the string doesn't have as the first token. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting steps. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S produces NT29 and NT46. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the two strings produced by NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't34' which isn't in NT29's production. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps NT29 isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. So NT29 must produce other symbols. But according to the rules, NT29 -> 't53' directly. So that means NT29 can produce the terminal 't53'. But in the string, the first token is 't34', which isn't 't53'. So that would mean that the string can't start with 't34' if it's supposed to be generated by S, because S's productions start with 't53' followed by whatever NT46 produces.\n\nSo unless the string starts with 't53', it shouldn't be generated by S. But the first token is 't34', which doesn't match. That would immediately make the string invalid because the start symbol S's first expansion is NT29 -> 't53', which isn't the first token.\n\nWait, unless I'm mixing up leftmost or rightmost derivations, but the standard in CFG is leftmost, so the first step would be NT29 -> 't53' and NT46 -> 't10', so the first two tokens should be 't53 t10'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't34'. That's a problem. So perhaps the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me double-check the rules for NT29. According to the user, NT29 is defined as NT22 -> ... but in the provided rules, I see 'NT29 -> 't53''. Yes, that's correct. So NT29 directly goes to 't53'.\n\nSo the entire string must start with 't53', then the second part is NT46. Now looking at the string: first token 't34' doesn't match, so perhaps the string isn't generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see if any of the NT rules can produce other sequences. Wait, maybe NT29 can produce more than just 't53'. Let me check again. The rules for NT29 are: the only production is NT29 -> 't53'. So yes, it's a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the only way S generates a string is by NT29 producing 't53' and NT46 producing its terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with 't34', so it can't be generated by S.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the string. The string is given as 't34 t53 t10 t96 t4 t55...', so it's a sequence of t34 followed by other tokens. So the first token is 't34', which would come from some NT production, perhaps.\n\nWait, but in the rules, which non-terminals can produce 't34'? Let's see: looking for any NT rule that produces 't34'. Scanning the rules:\n\nLooking through the NT definitions. For example, NT49 -> 't94', NT25 -> 't73', NT85 -> 't35', and others. It seems that none of the NT rules directly produce 't34' except maybe through production chains, but looking at the rules, 't34' appears in NT74, NT74->'t34', but I don't see any NT rule that produces 't34' as a terminal directly.\n\nWait, I'm looking at the rules, and I see 't34' in several places as part of other productions. For example, NT74 -> 't34 t74'. Hmm, that doesn't produce 't34' directly, but as part of a production. Wait, let's clarify: production rules are of the form NT -> something, so if NT is a non-terminal, its right side can be NTs and terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, the only production that includes 't34' is NT74 -> 't34 t74'. So NT74 can produce 't34' followed by another NT which can be 't74'. Similarly, other rules produce 't34' as part of a chain, but not as a direct terminal.\n\nSo unless there's a NT production that directly produces 't34', which I don't see, the string starting with 't34' isn't possible because the only way to get 't34' is through other NTs that depend on 't74's.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules again, in NT31 -> 't49', and NT51 -> 't40', and other rules that produce 't34' are via other paths, but none directly. So unless we have a chain that starts with a production leading to 't34', which isn't present, the string can't start with 't34'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S could produce something else, but according to the rules, S only produces NT29 NT46. So the string can't start with any other symbol.\n\nTherefore, I'm convinced that the string starting with 't34' can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar provided. CNF grammars have two production rules for the start symbol and each non-terminal can produce two terminals or a non-terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems complex with a lot of rules. Each rule is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> terminal. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT29 NT46. \n\nSo, the string to evaluate is: `t86 t10 t8 t4 t61 t8 t96 t34 t4 t31 t56 t54 t96 t18 t54 t35 t4 t71 t95 t8 t61 t22 t18 t54 t37 t73 t25 t86 t49 t55 t31 t94 t55 t18 t55 t10 t49 t73 t49 t79 t21 t18 t56 t34 t61 t31`.\n\nMy goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the grammar. Essentially, I need to parse the string using the grammar's rules and see if it's possible.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll start by trying to break down the string into parts that might correspond to the grammar's terminals. Since each production in CNF results in exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals), I'll need to consider pairs of symbols from the string.\n\nHowever, without a specific parsing strategy, this could be time-consuming. Perhaps I can look for known sequences or key terms that are generated by the grammar. For example, if a certain 't' followed by a number can only be produced by a specific non-terminal, I can track that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n- NT22 -> 't96'\n- NT46 -> 't55' or 't10' (wait, no: NT46 -> 't10' is under the rule NT46 -> 't10', so t10 is directly produced by NT46. Wait no, in the grammar provided, NT46 has two productions: NT46 -> NT92 NT25 and NT46 -> 't10'. So, 't10' is produced directly by NT46.\n\nSimilarly, NT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT71 -> 't40'\nAnd so on.\n\nI'll start by identifying if the string can be parsed into these terminals by following the grammar.\n\nBut given the string's length, it's quite involved. Perhaps I can start by looking for 't86' as it's the beginning of the string. Is 't86' produced by any non-terminal? Looking through the grammar, I see NT25 -> 't73', NT86 is produced by NT86? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT86 as a production rule. Alternatively, does any rule produce 't86' as a terminal?\n\nWait, looking again: NT86 is on the left. Let me check all rules:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT86 isn't a left-hand side of any rule except perhaps in the string when considering 't86'.\n\nWait, actually, the string starts with 't86', which is a terminal. So, 't86' must be produced by a production rule where it's the right-hand side part of a non-terminal that produces it. Looking through the rules:\n\nYes, here's a rule: NT31 -> 't8' (among others?), but I need to find where 't86' comes from. Wait, maybe NT46 produces 't86'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, is there any rule that has 't86' as a terminal? Looking:\n\nI don't see 't86' directly produced, but I see NT25 -> 't73', which is in the string.\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nIn the string, the first element is 't86'. So, 't86' must be generated by a rule where NTx -> 't86'. Looking through the rules: I don't see any such production. Hmm, that's a problem because if that's the case, 't86' isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. Wait, let me double-check the grammar rules provided.\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\nNT86 isn't listed as a production. So, perhaps 't86' is not in the grammar, meaning the string cannot be generated. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the initial parsing. Let me list all the rules and see if 't86' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n- NT29 -> NT20 NT25 (Wait, NT29 isn't mentioned in the initial problem, but in the grammar, NTT29 is present. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the first production is S -> NT29 NT46. So NT29 is a non-terminal. Then, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n- NT29 -> NT20 NT25 (Wait, no, in the initial problem, NT29 is actually NT29 -> NT20 NT25?

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string we need to check is a sequence of terminal symbols. The string is: t79 t94 t36 t96 t86 t22 t73 t56 t18 t53 t36 t36 t79 t31 t86 t18 t31 t34 t22 t35 t18 t31 t73 t73 t37 t22 t25 t54 t10 t10 t96 t71 t10 t18 t96 t22 t94 t61 t95 t10 t61 t21 t87 t54 t37 t37.\n\nEach word in the string is a terminal symbol, so each must be the result of a production rule that terminates in a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT29 \u2192 't53'. So, when I see 't53' in the string, I can trace back to NT29.\n\nBut each step in the string would require checking if the production for each non-terminal can generate the corresponding terminal. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT29 followed by NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't79'. Let me check if NT29 can produce 't79'. From the grammar, NT29 \u2192 't53'. Doesn't match, so maybe it's part of a longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see the entire sequence.

But in the given grammar, NT55 is shown as:\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT55 -> NT22 NT22\n\nBut looking at the initial question, the grammar is listed as:\n\ngrammar:\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT51 -> 't40'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, that's the full grammar. Now, let's see. The string starts with 't79'. Let me check which non-terminals can produce 't79'. From the list, NT87 -> 't79' and NT87 -> 't20'. So 't79' comes from NT87.\n\nSo the string starts with NT87. Now, since NT87 can be a terminal or a production if it's a non-terminal. But in the grammar, NT87 is listed as producing 't79' and 't20'. So it's a terminal. So the first token is 't79' which is NT87 \u2192 't79'.\n\nNext, the second token is 't94'. Looking for 't94', the only production is NT38 \u2192 't94'. So the next non-terminal is NT38. So the string so far is NT87 -> t79 followed by NT38 -> t94.\n\nSo, the current symbol in the parse is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So after NT87 and NT38, which are both terminals, does that match the start? Wait, no. The start is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the first part is NT29, then NT46.\n\nBut the initial part of the string is 't79 t94', which is NT87 and NT38, which don't form S directly. So this suggests that it's not a direct expansion of S. Therefore, perhaps the string doesn't match S. But wait, maybe S can derive this as well, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to see if S can produce this entire string through a series of derivations.\n\nLet me try to model the entire process.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46 (this is the only rule for S)\n\nSo, the entire string must be derived from NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, the string is: t79 t94 t36 t96 t86 t22 t73 t56 t18 t53 t36 t36 t79 t31 t86 t18 t31 t34 t22 t35 t18 t31 t73 t73 t37 t22 t25 t54 t10 t10 t96 t71 t10 t18 t96 t22 t94 t61 t95 t10 t61 t21\n\nSo, each of these terminals must be produced by NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet's start with NT29.

Each production starts with 'S', and each non-terminal eventually resolves to a terminal string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT29 and NT46. So the string should start with whatever NT29 and NT46 produce. Let me check: the string starts with t36, which comes from NT29 because NT29 -> 't53'? Wait, in the grammar, NT29 is defined as 't53', right? Wait, no: I think I need to check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are given. Let me list the rules again to clarify:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\n\nWait, hold on. Looking at these rules, some of the non-terminals produce terminal strings directly. Others still produce other non-terminals.\n\nI think I'll approach this step by step, trying to parse the string from the start, using leftmost derivation.\n\nThe entire string is: t36 t80 t18 t55 t71 t31 t87 t74 t56 t37 t54 t40 t25 t20 t40 t20 t56 t56 t31 t18 t20 t37 t36 t31 t49 t25 t61 t87 t86 t10 t18 t96 t37 t22 t20 t40 t35 t95 t87 t95 t35 t94 t22 t55 t8 t55 t79.\n\nFirst, S must be NT29 NT46. So the string should start with the production from NT29 and NT46.\n\nChecking NT29: In the grammar, NT29 is defined as 't53' according to NT29 -> 't53', correct? Let's check: the rule is NT29 -> 't53'? Yes, line by line, looking for 't53' under NT29: Yes, under NT22, but wait, I see NT29 -> 't53'\u2014yes, so NT29 produces 't53'. That would mean 't53' is the output from NT29.\n\nSo the first part is 't53'. Then NT46: looking at the rules, NT46 has several options. Let me check all productions for NT46:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nIs there any other option? Yes, from the given rules: NT46 -> 't10' is one option. So NT46 can produce 't10'.\n\nSo if NT29 produces 't53' and NT46 produces 't10', their concatenation would be 't53 t10'. However, the string starts with 't36 t80...', which does not match 't53 t10'. So something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding NT29.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the rules, is NT29 -> 't53'? Yes: \"NT29 -> 't53'\" is present. So NT29 should produce 't53'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't36', which is different. So perhaps the start production is not S? No, wait: S must produce NT29 NT46. So the start of the string should be 't53 t...' but it's 't36 t80...'.\n\nThis suggests that the string cannot be derived from S, as the first symbols don't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the grammar rules. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\n\nNT87 -> 't74'\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nNT14 -> 't56'\n\nNT91 -> 't55'\n\nNT71 -> 't54'\n\nNT51 -> 't40'\n\nNT45 -> 't37'\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nNT87 -> 't20'\n\nNT31 -> 't8'\n\nWait, perhaps I see a conflict here. I thought NT46 could produce 't10', but looking again, the rule is NT46 -> 't10', yes. But if the first token is 't36', and 't36' is not produced by any non-terminal, then this is impossible.\n\nWait, where is 't36' produced? Let me check all the terminals.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules:\n\n't4' from NT8\n\n't8' from NT14\n\n't56' from NT14\n\n't55' from NT46 via another path?\n\nWait, 't36' is mentioned in the string. Looking at the rules, is 't36' ever defined as a terminal? I don't see 't36' in the rules. So perhaps 't36' is not in the terminal symbols. Wait, but let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\n\nNT87 -> 't74'\n\nNT67 -> 't87' (if it resolves)\n\nOther NT25 -> 't73'\n\nWait, none of the NT rules produce 't36'. So how does 't36' appear in the string? That might mean the string is invalid, as 't36' isn't a possible terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce 't36'.\n\nLooking at all the rules again:\n\nWait, NT46 has two options:\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nand earlier, NT46 -> NT92 NT25. So if NT92 or NT25 can produce 't36' indirectly.\n\nBut looking through the rules, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't36'. Wait, but maybe some production can chain to 't36'?\n\nLet me think: looking for any production that ends in 't36'.\n\nLooking back, the production:\n\nLooking at NT31: in some rules, like NT31 -> 't49' or others, but none produce 't36'.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 can be broken down, but I don't see a production that leads to 't36'.\n\nSo if the string has 't36', but 't36' isn't a terminal in the grammar, then the string can't be derived.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in looking at all the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes things a bit easier because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. The string I need to check is a sequence of tokens: `t10 t80 t31 t10 t73 t34 t80 t31 t36 t25 t96 t20 t54 t53 t37 t31 t55 t22 t94 t86 t37 t35 t37 t25 t25 t36 t37 t37 t80 t22 t87 t36 t54 t56 t34 t49 t8 t95 t35 t35 t8 t87 t55 t56 t22 t8 t56`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that since the grammar is in CNF, parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm, which is efficient and suitable for this task. The CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell corresponds to a substring of the input. For each position, it checks which non-terminals can derive that substring using the given rules.\n\nThe steps I'll follow are:\n\n1. **Tokenize the Input**: The input string is already tokenized, so I can list each token as a separate element. The length of the string is 46 tokens. That means the input is 46 characters long, each being part of the grammar's terminals (like 't', followed by a number).\n\n2. **Construct the CYK Table**: I'll create a table with rows representing the length of the substring (from 1 to 46) and columns representing the positions in the input string. For each position 'i' and length 'l', I'll check if the substring from i to i+l-1 can be derived by any production rule.\n\n3. **Initialize the Table**: For each single token, I'll look up which non-terminals can directly produce it. For example, 't10' is produced by NT10 \u2192 't10'. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I have to see which NT rules produce 't10'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10' (from NT46 -> 't10'). So in the initial step, position 1 to 1 (t10) is covered by NT46. Similarly, the other terminals in the string like t80, t31, etc., will have their respective NTs that produce them.\n\n4. **Fill the Table**: For each substring of length 'l' starting at position 'i', I'll check if there's a production rule in the grammar where the right-hand side can be fully covered by the current window. For example, for a substring of length 2, I need to check if any NT production has two non-terminals that can be covered by the current and next token. Wait, no, that's not quite right. I need to consider all possible splits of the substring into two parts and check if there's an NT production that can produce the first part and the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to go step by step:\n\n- The input is 46 tokens long. The table will have 46 rows (for each position) and 46 columns (for the length up to 46). \n\n- For each position i (from 1 to 46) and for each possible length l up to the remaining tokens from i, I'll check all possible splits (k from 1 to l-1), and see if there's a production rule NT \u2192 X Y such that X can generate the first part (tokens i to i+k-1) and Y can generate the second part (tokens i+k to i+l-1).\n\nWait, but in the CYK algorithm, for each position (i, l), we check all possible splits, and for each possible split, see if any production allows the first part and the second part to be generated by the same NT.\n\nBut with the limited time I have, I can't manually fill the entire table. So perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by starting from the top-level rule S \u2192 NT22 NT46. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT22 NT46.\n\nSo the string must start with the production of NT22 and end with the production of NT46. Wait, no\u2014it's S \u2192 NT22 NT46, so the entire string must be a production of S. So the entire string must be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT22 and the second part generated by NT46.\n\nLet me check the string: It starts with 't10', which is generated by NT46 (from NT46 \u2192 't10'). But NT22 is listed as a non-terminal on the left side of multiple productions. Let me see which productions are for NT22.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nSo NT22 can be split into two parts, each generated by NT38 NT70, or NT92 NT31, or NT53 NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, after the first 't10' (from NT46), the next token is 't80', which is generated by NT80 \u2192 't80' (from NT80 \u2192 't80'). Wait, but in the grammar, NT80 is produced by NT46 as per one of the rules: NT46 \u2192 't10' and 't49'\u2014no, wait: Looking again, NT46 appears in the rules as:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25,\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10',\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10' (from the line: NT46 -> 't49'? No, wait let me list them all carefully.)\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nOh yes, in the first line under NT46: NT46 -> 't10'. So NT46 can produce the terminal 't10'.\n\nSo, in the input string, the first token is 't10', which is generated by NT46. But the top-level rule S \u2192 NT22 NT46\u2014so for S, it's NT22 followed by NT46. So if the entire string is generated by S, it must be that the first part is generated by NT22 and the second by NT46.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't10', which is from NT46. So that would mean that NT22 is not generating the first part, but rather NT46 is. That's a problem because S \u2192 NT22 NT46 implies that NT22 should produce the first part and NT46 the second. But 't10' is the first token, which is produced by NT46, not NT22. Therefore, this suggests that the string cannot be derived from S, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but is that necessarily the case? Let me think again.\n\nNo, perhaps I made a mistake. The CYK algorithm allows for breaking down the string into parts. The starting symbol is S, but the algorithm proceeds by considering possible non-terminals that can generate the entire string. So perhaps the string can be divided into more than two parts, each generated by NT22 and NT46.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be split into two parts, with the first part generated by NT22 and the second by NT46.\n\nLet me check the string:\n\nThe entire string starts with 't10', which is from NT46. So for S \u2192 NT22 NT46, the string must start with NT22's derivation followed by NT46's derivation. But the first token is 't10', which is from NT46, not NT22. Therefore, this would mean that the entire string cannot be generated by S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into more than two parts, so that some other path is followed. Wait, but S only has two productions: one is 'something' followed by NT46. So the entire string must be split into two parts, each generated by the right-hand sides of NT22 and NT46.\n\nAnother way: Since the first token is 't10' from NT46, the second part of S must be NT46, so the rest of the string after 't10' should be generated by NT46. But wait, S is NT22 followed by NT46. So the entire string is NT22 followed by NT46.\n\nSo in that case, the first part of the string (excluding the last part generated by NT46) must be generated by NT22. But the first token is 't10', which is part of NT46, not NT22.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a way to structure grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, all the production rules seem to fit that structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t21 t35 t37 t37 t21 t25 t37 t79 t87 t34 t31 t94 t71 t21 t95 t96 t18 t61 t61 t22 t21 t54 t20 t74 t56 t10 t94 t20 t74 t8 t10 t80 t37 t94 t96 t71 t49 t20 t49 t94 t4 t86 t87 t49 t87 t40 t56 t79`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts and ends with various `t` tokens, some of which are familiar from the grammar. For example, I see `t21`, `t35`, etc., which might correspond to non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nMy plan is to parse the string from the start to the end, using the grammar rules to see if I can derive the entire string by expanding non-terminals step by step. Since it's a leftmost derivation in CNF, I'll start with the start symbol S and see if I can expand it down to the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which expands to NT29 NT46 (S \u2192 NT29 NT46).\n\nSo, the first step is to expand S into NT29 and NT46. Now, I'll look for the leftmost `t29` and `t46` in the string. Wait, no, the initial string has a `t21` as the first token. So maybe I should look for the token that starts the string in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT22 and NT25, etc., but I don't see an 'S' directly expanding into `t21` or another `t`. Hmm, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a production rule.\n\nWait, each `t` in the string represents a production of a non-terminal. For example, `t29` would correspond to the non-terminal NT29. So, looking at the string, the first token is `t21`, so I need to see which non-terminal expands into `t21`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT45 \u2192 t37\n- NT49 \u2192 t86\n- NT70 \u2192 t34\n- NT51 \u2192 t18\n- NT91 \u2192 t55\n- NT85 \u2192 t35\n- NT21 \u2192 t56\n- NT55 \u2192 t40\n\nWait, no, actually, the rules are all in the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a. So for example, NT21 is a terminal if it's on the right-hand side of a rule where it's a terminal. But in the grammar provided, I don't see any rule where NT21 appears as a terminal; instead, NT51 expands to t40, but that's different.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, no, the grammar doesn't have any rules for NT21 as a terminal. Did I miss that? Let me scan through all the rules. Hmm, looking through the rules, I see NT38 \u2192 t94, NT55 \u2192 t80, etc., but nothing for NT21. Wait, that might be a problem because the input string has `t21`, so I need to find which non-terminal expands to `t21`.\n\nLooking again, I see NT21 in the production rules? Wait, no, the grammar only has NT51 \u2192 t40, but that's not `t21`. So perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the rules are structured differently.

That\u2019s interesting because in the string, we have `t21` appearing multiple times, so maybe NT55 is expanding to `t21` in some parts and `t80` in others.\n\nSo, the string starts with `t21`, which would correspond to NT55 \u2192 t21. Then, the next token is `t35`. Looking through the grammar, I need to see what non-terminal expands to `t35`.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT87 \u2192 t35.

Alternatively, perhaps NT87 \u2192 t35, but that's separate.\n\nWait, no, the grammar has NT45 \u2192 t37. So `t37` is an explicit terminal from NT45.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal and a single non-terminal. Let me check the grammar rules provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production starts with NT followed by two other NTs. Except for some rules where it goes to a terminal and a single NT. For example, NT40 -> 't80', which is a terminal and a single NT. That's another characteristic of Chomsky Normal Form. So, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t96 t61 t73 t96 t96 t74 t94 t21 t37 t56 t94 t79 t31 t56 t55 t20 t21 t18 t37 t55 t73 t20 t74 t61 t49 t35 t10 t21 t49 t94 t49 t79 t53 t96 t22 t87 t55 t56 t94 t18 t74 t18 t22 t54 t22 t36 t18 t35 t94.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. I think the best approach is to try parsing the string using the grammar and see if all tokens are consumed successfully according to the rules.\n\nFirst, I need to build the parse tree or at least track the productions step by step. The grammar's right-hand sides can have two NTs or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production's right-hand side.\n\nI'll start by looking at the entire string and see if it can be divided into the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46. So the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. That means the string should start with the symbols generated by NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me check the string: the first token is t96.

Or perhaps it's two different rules for NT51. That's a bit confusing, but let's assume each line is a separate rule. So in the grammar, NT51 has two productions: one is 't22' and the other is 't40'.\n\nContinuing:\n\n23. NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n24. NT67 \u2192 NT87\n25. NT84 \u2192 NT71 NT16\n26.

That's a problem because each NT can have multiple productions, including both terminals and non-terminals, but I think the Chomsky Normal Form allows for that, where each rule is either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, now, back to the string. The first token is t96. Let's see which NT can produce t96.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53' \u2192 No\n- NT38 \u2192 't94' \u2192 No\n- NT22 \u2192 't96' (in line 27 and others). Wait, yes: line 27 says NT22 \u2192 't96'. So that's a production where NT22 is replaced by the terminal t96.\n\nWait, so from the grammar, NT22 can produce t96, as well as other combinations. So, the first token t96 could be from NT22 \u2192 't96', meaning we can use this production.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nSo, both NT29 and NT46 need to generate their respective sequences.\n\nFirst, process NT29. NT29 \u2192 't53' (from line 26). So after NT29, we consume 't53'.\n\nThen, process NT46. Let's look at NT46's productions. The first production is NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25. But looking back, line 10: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25. So that's one option. Alternatively, looking at other lines, there are multiple NT46 productions, including others that go to multiple NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, in line 41, NT46"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-668","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of a set of production rules. My goal is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but in this case, I might not need to use any algorithms since I can analyze the grammar and the string manually.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that all the production rules for the non-terminals are indeed in CNF. Each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Some of the non-terminals produce terminals, which are the t's followed by numbers.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of t followed by numbers. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar. I think the best approach is to reconstruct the parse tree or the derivation steps that could lead to the given string.\n\nLet me list the productions again for clarity:\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n3. NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n4. NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n5. NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n6. NT71 -> NT40 NT85\n7. NT40 -> NT84 NT67\n8. NT85 -> NT51 NT16\n9. NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n10. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n11.

NT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in reviewing the productions. Let me check if each production for a non-terminal has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. It looks like most of them do, except perhaps for some that might have been miswritten. But in CNF, each production must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So I need to ensure that each non-terminal on the left produces either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, all production rules seem to fit the CNF structure. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT46 is two non-terminals on the right. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, same. NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, etc. All the way down to the nt46 productions which sometimes produce terminals. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is: t34 t86 t73 t54 t36 t80 t53 t36 t87 t18 t96 t49 t10 t87 t35 t25 t95 t10 t87 t22 t95 t37 t94 t35 t36 t10 t4 t4 t4 t18 t35 t25 t35 t54 t95 t55 t95 t96 t55 t10 t73 t37 t4 t25 t94 t87 t35 t22 t96.\n\nThat's a long string of tokens. It's a list of t followed by numbers, like t34, t86, t73, etc. Each token represents a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step either reduces a non-terminal to two non-terminals or to a single terminal. The string length is 48 tokens. In a CNF grammar, the minimum number of steps (or productions) needed to derive a string of length n is n-1, and the maximum is 2n-1. Since each step can split a non-terminal into two, each production adds one token, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut in our case, each production is either splitting into two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT29 NT46) or splitting into a terminal. The string is just a series of terminals, meaning that starting from S, through a series of productions replacing non-terminals with terminals, we end up with this string.\n\nWait, but the problem is probably more manageable because some of the non-terminals produce terminals, and others produce more non-terminals. So to parse the string, perhaps I need to reconstruct the leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is given, I might want to see if the sequence can be built step by step by the grammar.\n\nBut considering the number of tokens is quite long (48), it's a bit challenging to do step by step. However, I can approach it by trying to match the first symbol of the string and see if I can derive it from the start symbol.\n\nThe string starts with t34. So first, I need to see which non-terminals produce 't34'. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t54 (No, t54 is 70 produces t54, which is 70:54)\n- NT40 \u2192 t84 (No)\n- NT84 \u2192 t71\n- NT67 \u2192 t87\n- NT87 \u2192 t74, t20, t79, t94\n- NT29 \u2192 t53\n- NT22 \u2192 t96, t80, etc.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back through the list, I think I might have missed some.

But looking back:\n\nWait, in the original list provided, production 21 is NT70 \u2192 't54'. That would mean NT70 \u2192 t54. So to get 't34', I need a non-terminal that produces 't34'. Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking again at the list I received:\n\nLooking for a rule where the RHS is 't34':\n\nProduction 43: NT70 \u2192 't34'\n\nYes, that's correct, NT70 \u2192 t34.\n\nSo to start, the symbol 't34' must come from NT70. So the beginning of the derivation would be S \u2192 NT29 NT46.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's a list of production rules in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This should simplify things because each production step expands exactly one non-terminal and doesn't produce any symbols from more than one non-terminal at a time.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which is transformed into NT29 NT46. So S -> NT29 NT46. Then each of these NTs can be further broken down. Each NT is either a terminal (like 't84') or another non-terminal (like NT29, NT46, etc.).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t4 t53 t74 t31 t21 t35 t34 t8 t54 t21 t55 t4 t96 t61 t40 t8 t22 t74 t86 t61 t74 t94 t95 t8 t4 t8 t35 t95 t40 t87 t96 t4 t49 t71 t40 t4 t80 t71 t86 t25 t71 t25 t25 t35 t80 t74 t61 t25 t36`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. I'll approach this by trying to build the string from the bottom up, making sure each part matches a rule.\n\nLet's start by looking at S, which is NT29 NT46. So the string should start with the symbols produced by NT29 and NT46. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, NT29. Let's see the production rules for NT29: looking at the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT29 in the provided list. Wait, no, the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT46, which suggests that NT29 is a non-terminal, but in the rest of the rules, are there any for NT29? I'll scan through the list again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NTs listed are: NT22, NT25, NT29, NT31, NT38, NT40, NT45, NT46, NT51, NT53, NT55, NT70, NT71, NT8, NT84, NT85, NT87, NT91, NT22, etc. Wait, no, the user's grammar shows each NT has a definition. So I need to re-examine each line.\n\nLet me list all the productions again carefully:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT51 -> 't40'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, no, I think in the initial presentation, it's a list that starts with S and each NT is defined. So each line like NT22 -> NT38 NT70 is a production.\n\nSo, S is NT29 and NT46. Since each production has exactly two non-terminals, we can see that during parsing, S would expand into two parts that each become their own parse trees.\n\nGiven that, starting from S, the string should have two components, each corresponding to the two non-terminals after expansion.\n\nSo the first part should be from NT29 and the second from NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't53'. So let's see what could produce 't53'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTs that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT38 -> 't94'\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n- NT92 -> 't25'\n- NT46 -> 't10' (twice)\n- NT22 -> 't96'\n- NT53 -> 't13' and 't55'\nWait, actually, the productions for non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53' (from line 26)\n- NT22 -> 't96' (I think? Wait, no, looking at the initial list, line 12 is NT46 -> 't10', line 29: NT29 -> 't53', and line 46 doesn't exist. Wait, in the grammar provided, each line is a production. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, here's a list:\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n3. NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n4. NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n5. NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n6.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It consists of a series of production rules for non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t-something). The goal is to see if we can derive the string `t53 t10` by expanding the non-terminals into terminals through a series of production steps.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, expands to NT29 NT46. So the string we need to generate starts with NT29 and NT46, but the input string is `t53 t10`, which is a list of terminals. So I'll need to see if S can reduce to `t53 t10`.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in derivation, we expand non-terminals into more non-terminals until we reach terminals. So starting from S, we need to see if we can derive `t53 t10`. Alternatively, the string is a concatenation of two terminals, so likely it's a single step expansion from two non-terminals each becoming one terminal.\n\nBut let's look at the required string: `t53 t10`. That means the two parts are 't53' and 't10'. So the string is two terminals, which could have come from two separate non-terminals each expanding directly into a terminal, or one could have expanded further. Let's check which non-terminals in the grammar produce 't53' and 't10'.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NTs:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n- NT46 -> 't10' (I notice there are multiple rules for NT46, but I have to make sure I look at all of them. Wait, there's also NT46 -> 't92' and others, but I see that one of the rules is NT46 -> 't10'. So NT46 can produce 't10'.\n\nSo if S produces NT29 NT46, and each of those non-terminals directly produces the respective terminal, then `t53 t10` should be a valid derivation.\n\nLet me check:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT29 -> t53\n\nNT46 -> t10\n\nSo indeed, S expands directly to t53 t10.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that all the production rules for NT29 and NT46 lead to t53 and t10 respectively. Looking at NT29: The rule is NT29 -> 't53', so yes, that's a direct production.\n\nFor NT46, one of the rules is NT46 -> 't10', so that's also a direct production.\n\nTherefore, the string `t53 t10` can be generated by the start symbol S by expanding to NT29 and NT46, which then produce 't53' and 't10', respectively.\n\nI think that's correct. There's no ambiguity here because each part of the string matches the terminals directly produced by the non-terminals derived from the start symbol.\n\nSo the answer should be Yes.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got to figure out if the string \"t53 t55\" is generated by the given grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is to two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. S is rewritten as NT29 NT46. So, to produce the string, I need to derive both NT29 and NT46. \n\nLet's look at NT29. From the productions, NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT29. Wait, that seems recursive. Let me check: NT29 produces NT53 and NT29 again. So this would go on indefinitely unless something else happens. Alternatively, maybe I have the production wrong. Wait, in the given grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT29. Hmm. That's problematic because it creates an infinite loop unless NT29 eventually terminates. \n\nBut looking at NT53, it has a production: NT53 -> NT13 NT55. So perhaps NT13 and NT55 can produce terminals. Let me check the productions for NT13 and NT55. \n\nNT13 is rewritten as 't31', which is a terminal. That's good. For NT55, the production is NT49 NT51. Let me check NT49 and NT51. \n\nNT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87. NT25 is rewritten as 't73' and NT87 has multiple productions: 't74', 't20', and 't79'. So NT87 could produce a terminal. Similarly, NT51 has two productions: 't40' and 't18'. Both are terminals. So NT55 can produce NT49 NT87, which can lead to terminals, or NT49 NT51, which also leads to terminals. So NT55 can ultimately become a terminal string. \n\nBut going back to NT29, since it produces NT53 NT29, and NT53 produces NT13 NT55, which eventually terminates. So NT29 would be NT53 followed by NT29, which would collapse into something like NT53 (and then the NT29 after). Wait, that doesn't make sense because NT29 is on both sides. That would mean it's an infinitary derivation unless the process stops. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let's consider that NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT29. Since NT53 can produce a terminal, perhaps after expanding NT29, it can eventually terminate. For example, suppose NT29 is rewritten as NT53 NT29, then NT53 is rewritten as 't31' NT55. Then NT55 is rewritten as NT49 NT51, which is 't73' and 't40'. So overall, this would produce 't31 t40'. But then the other NT29 is still there. Wait, that's the same problem. So it's like a loop that doesn't terminate unless there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should see if there's a way to derive 't53 t55' directly. Let's see. The start symbol S is NT29 NT46. So the string will consist of the expansion of NT29 and NT46. \n\nLooking at the string \"t53 t55\", that's two terminals. Each must come from a production of either NT29 or NT46. But since each is a non-terminal, they need to be expanded into their respective terminals. \n\nLet's check NT29 for the first 't53'. So NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT29. Wait, that's recursive again. But wait, from the rules, NT29 has only one production: NT53 NT29. So to get 't53', we need NT53 to eventually produce 't53', but looking at NT53, the only production is NT13 NT55, which is 't31' and something else. So 't53' can't directly appear as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I was wrong about NT53. Let me check NT53 again. The productions for NT53 are only one: NT13 NT55, right? Because looking through the grammar, yes, NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. So NT53 can't produce 't53' directly; it can only produce 't31' followed by something else. So how can we get 't53' in the string?\n\nOh, this means that NT29 can't produce 't53' because its production leads to 't31' and other things. So that's an issue. Therefore, the first part of the string, 't53', cannot be derived from NT29. \n\nBut wait, is there any other production for NT29? Let me double-check the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see only one production for NT29: NT29 \u2192 NT53 NT29. No other options. So that means NT29 must expand infinitely without producing any terminal, which can't be the case because the string is finite. So that suggests that the string 't53 t55' can't be derived from NT29, meaning the entire string can't be produced by the grammar. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's check NT29 again. It seems that NT29 can only be rewritten into itself and NT53, which leads to a loop. Therefore, the string 't53' can't be obtained from NT29 because that would require a production that eventually results in 't53', but it doesn't seem possible. \n\nSimilarly, let's check the second part of the string, 't55', to see if NT46 can produce it. NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, according to the grammar. NT92 \u2192 NT25 NT87, and NT25 \u2192 't73'. NT87 has productions 't74', 't20', 't79', so that can produce terminals. So if I have NT92 expanding to NT25 NT87, which could be 't73' followed by a terminal, but then NT46 is NT92 NT25, so that would be 't73' followed by something. Wait, let me think through this.\n\nWait, S is NT29 NT46. So the entire string must consist of the expansion of NT29 and NT46. \n\nIf 't53' can't be obtained from NT29, then the entire string can't be derived. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the production for NT29. Maybe it's possible that NT29 can produce 't53' via some other route, but looking back, the only production is NT53 NT29, which leads to another NT53 and so on, which never terminate into a terminal. So yes, NT29 can't produce 't53' directly, and there's no other production for it. \n\nSo the string 't53 t55' can't be generated because the first 't53' is impossible. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

No, wait, in the provided grammar, the rule for NT25 is: NT25 -> 't73'?\n\nWait, no. Let me check the grammar correctly. Wait, the user input included lines like `NT22 -> NT38 NT70`, `NT25 -> NT22 NT14`, etc., but later I see some terminals. Let me look again.\n\nWait, user grammar includes:\nNT25 -> 't73' \u2192 no, wait, in the list, looking for NT25, does it produce a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar lines provided:\n\nWait, the user provided this grammar:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nThen lines like NT22-> NT38 NT70, NT25-> NT22 NT14, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like NT40->'t80', NT51->'t22', NT25->'t73', etc. Oh, yes, there is a rule NT25 -> 't73' somewhere. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking through the lines, yes: \"NT25 -> 't73'\" is one of the rules. So, t25 comes from NT25, which directly becomes 't73'? Wait, no, no. Wait, in the grammar, are the strings 't53', etc., direct terminals? Or are they part of non-terminals? I think in this context, the terminals are the 't' followed by a number and nothing else. So, when a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that would mean in the derivation.\n\nWait, in CNF grammars, each production rule is a non-terminal -> two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals? No, wait, in CNF, all productions are non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals on the right, or a non-terminal and a terminal on the RHS? Or maybe terminals are only single symbols.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But in this case, looking at the grammar provided, it seems all productions are either two non-terminals (e.g., S-> NT29 NT46, NT22-> NT38 NT70, etc.) except for those that end with 't' followed by a number, which I assume are terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT40 -> 't80' would mean that NT40 can produce the terminal string 't80'.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> 't73' means NT25 can produce 't73'.\n\nSo each terminal in the string must be produced by a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal.\n\nNow, the string is \"t53 t25 t73\", which consists of three terminals. So for the entire string to be generated, the derivation must produce these three as a sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Or perhaps not; perhaps all are two non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, except when the RHS has a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa.\n\nWait, no, for example, in the given grammar, \"NT40 -> 't80'\" is a production where the RHS is a terminal and... Wait, no, in CNF, each production of a non-terminal must expand into exactly two non-terminals. So perhaps the grammar provided is actually in a modified form where a non-terminal can produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal, but that would not fit the traditional CNF. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the exact definition. Let me think again. CNF requires that all productions are either A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So if a production has a single terminal, that's allowed, but if a production has multiple terminals, that's not CNF. However, in the given grammar, I see some productions where a single terminal appears as part of the RHS. For example, NT40 -> 't80' would be a production where a single terminal is on the RHS, which is fine in CNF.\n\nBut looking at the problem, the string has three terminals: t53, t25, t73. So each of these must be produced by some non-terminal that can directly produce that terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT25 -> 't73', so that's correct, as 't73' is a terminal. Similarly, NT51 -> 't22' (but that's a terminal as well, but in our string, we have t25, which would require that NT25 directly produces t25. Oh, wait, no, NT25 can produce 't73' but not 't25' directly. Hmm, perhaps I got confused earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nThe string is t53 t25 t73. So each is a separate terminal symbol.\n\nIn the grammar, each expansion is a leftmost derivation of the string, where each step replaces a symbol with its RHS.\n\nSo, let's try to see how to produce \"t53 t25 t73\".\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNow, each NT29 and NT46 must be expanded.\n\nFrom NT29: Looking in the grammar, does NT29 produce anything? Yes, \"NT29 -> 't53'\". So NT29 \u2192 't53'.\n\nThen, NT46: Looking for NT46 in the grammar, I see several lines, such as \"NT46 \u2192 't10'\" and \"NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\", etc.\n\nWait, let me be precise.

{"custom_id":"request-34","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That should help because I can parse the string by looking at the derivations from the start symbol.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string we're given is t53 t25 t96 t56. Each of these tokens is a terminal symbol. So the first step is to see if these terminals can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT53 has a production NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55. Let me write that down. NT13 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be generated by another production. From the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT31 NT49. Now, NT31 and NT49 also need to be expanded. NT31 \u2192 NT14, which is a terminal. So that's good because the string has t14? Wait, wait, the string is t53 t25 t96 t56. The last token is t56, which is a terminal. So wait, I'm looking for t53, t25, t96, t56.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let's approach this more systematically.\n\nThe string to check is \"t53 t25 t96 t56\". Each word corresponds to a step in the derivation. So let's see how each of these could be produced.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t53. In the grammar, I need to find a production that yields t53. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal directly becomes t53. Hmm, let's check each rule:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n- NT13 \u2192 NT31 NT49\n- NT31 \u2192 NT14\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT14 \u2192 't56'\n\nWait, but I'm looking for t53, which is the terminal. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t53. Looking through all rules, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53' \u2192 that's it. So to get t53, we need NT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nSo the first step is that S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and NT29 produces t53, so the first part is done. Now, the second part is NT46, which needs to produce t25, t96, t56. Wait, no. The string is four symbols: t53, t25, t96, t56. So after t53 from NT29, the second symbol t25 comes from NT46, so we need to expand NT46 into t25 and something else, but that can't be because NT46 would split into two parts. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the string is four terminals. Let's break it down:\n\nt53 at position 1\n\nt25 at position 2\n\nt96 at position 3\n\nt56 at position 4\n\nBut the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46, so the string is produced as (NT29)(NT46). So each of these non-terminals should produce sequences of terminals that concatenate into the full string.\n\nSo first, NT29 must produce t53. Then, NT46 must produce t25, t96, t56. But that seems impossible because when you split into NT46, it would have to produce three terms, which can't happen because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the two parts. So the entire string must be t53 followed by t25 followed by t96 followed by t56. But that would mean that S \u2192 NT29 NT46, and then NT29 produces t53, and NT46 produces t25 t96 t56? But NT46 is a single non-terminal, and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So how can NT46 generate three terminals?\n\nThat can't be. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the string is \"t53 t25 t96 t56\", which splits into two parts, each starting with NT29 and NT46.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if t53 t25 t96 t56 can be obtained as (NT29)(something) and (something else). Alternatively, maybe the entire string must be split into exactly two parts, each of which is derived from NT29 and NT46.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the string has four symbols. Let me try to see:\n\nThe first symbols are t53, which comes from NT29, which produces t53. Then, the remaining symbols are t25, t96, t56. So that's three symbols from NT46, but NT46 can only expand into two parts. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the parse tree creates two branches, each producing a part of the string. So the first branch is the left NT29 producing the first symbol t53, and then the second branch starts with NT46. But the entire string must be formed by concatenation, so after t53, the NT46 must produce t25 t96 t56. But how? How can NT46 produce three symbols?\n\nSo perhaps the step-by-step expansion is necessary.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Let's represent the string as the concatenation of two parts: the first part corresponds to the left NT29, which produces t53, and then the second part corresponds to the NT46, which needs to produce the remaining three symbols: t25, t96, t56.\n\nBut how can NT46 produce three symbols? It can't because each production of NT46 is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Each production adds at most one terminal and potentially splits into more non-terminals, but the terminal count would be limited.\n\nSo let me try to see if the substring after t53 can be derived from NT46.\n\nThe substring after t53 is t25 t96 t56.\n\nSo we need to see if NT46 can generate t25 t96 t56.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT46:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT22 NT14, or a terminal when?\n\nLooking at the rules,NT46 \u2192 't10' is a direct production. So when can NT46 produce a terminal? Wait, that's incorrect because looking back, I see:\n\nIn the productions, I have:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't10'\nand\nNT86 \u2192 't71'\nand\nNT87 \u2192 't74'\nand\nNT67 \u2192 't87'\nand\netc.\n\nWait, but looking specifically, does NT46 have a production that ends with a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\nWait, so if NT46 can produce 't10', then that's a terminal. So perhaps the string after t53 is t25 t96 t56, which needs to be generated by NT46. But NT46 can only produce up to three non-terminals at a time, which would result in three symbols, but how?\n\nWait, let me check the steps again.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to see if the string can be generated as two separate parts from NT29 and NT46.\n\nFirst, check if NT29 can produce t53.\n\nIn the productions, NT29 \u2192 't53' directly. So that's straightforward. So that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part is the production from NT46 that gives us the remaining three tokens: t25, t96, t56.\n\nWait, but NT46's direct productions are only 't10' or combinations of non-terminals. So unless NT46 can produce more than one terminal, which it can only do directly if it has such a production. Looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, for NT46, is there a production that results in t25, t96, t56? That doesn't seem possible because 't25' is a direct production of NT46:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT46 has a production \u2192 NT22 NT55, which then would have to be expanded. Wait, let's see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT22 NT55\n\nBut then NT22 might produce another two non-terminals, which would in turn produce more non-terminals, etc. However, the string given is four"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, each production indeed matches this, so that's a good start.\n\nI need to see if I can parse the string using the grammar.

For example, NT25 -> NT22 NT14, but also NT25 -> t73, which is relevant because the string has t25. Wait, no, t25 is a terminal? No, in the string, the tokens are t53, t25, t25, etc. Wait, is t25 a terminal? Because looking up the grammar, I see NT25 -> t73 directly. So t73 is a terminal, but the string has t25, which isn't an explicit terminal in the grammar. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the grammar again. Let me look at all the nt productions and their terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT22 has a production to t96, t53, t45, etc. Wait, I see that NT22 -> t96, NT22 -> t53, NT22 -> t45, and so on. Because looking through the rules, NT22 is defined as:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> t4 (Wait, no, NT49 -> t80)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me note that NT22 has several rules:\n\nNT22 produces t96, t53, t45, t38, etc. So t53 is definitely a terminal that is produced by NT22.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT25, there's a production NT25 -> t73. So t73 comes from NT25.\n\nLooking at NT46: production is either t55 (multiple times). So NT46 can produce t55.\n\nLooking at NT56: In the grammar above, I don't see NT56. Wait, the original grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT46. Wait, perhaps NT56 isn't in the grammar\u2014probably, it's part of the string but not in the grammar, so that would mean the string can't be generated because NT56 isn't present. Wait, let me check: in the string, the last token is t56. If the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that expands into t56, then it's impossible for the string to be generated. Is that the case?\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I don't see any production where a non-terminal expands to t56. All the terminal productions are things like t4, t22, t55, etc. So if t56 isn't a terminal or derived from any non-terminal, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The string is `t53 t25 t25 t49 t56`. So the last token is t56. Since the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that can expand to t56, that production isn't possible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and t56 is obtained through a different production. Let me check the grammar more carefully. Looking through all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT29: t53\n- NT22: t96, t53, t45, t38, etc.\n- NT25: t73\n- NT46: t55, but not t56.\n- Other NTs: NT8: t4; NT46: t10; etc.\n\nNo, I don't see any of the NTs producing t56.

Let me try to figure out how to approach this. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has a start symbol S and several production rules. My string to test is \"t53 t25 t94 t34 t56\". I think the first step is to see if I can derive this string from S using the given rules.\n\nLet me list the production rules again to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\nS -> NT29 NT25\nNT29 -> t53\nNT25 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t53, which I see in the rules. Specifically, NT29 -> t53. So if S goes to NT29 NT25, then to get started, the first part would be NT29. So maybe I can start by replacing S with NT29 NT25.\n\nSo, S => NT29 NT25. Now, NT29 is replaced by t53, so the first token is t53. Next, NT25 needs to be replaced. Let me see the production for NT25.\n\nLooking at NT25's rules:\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT22 has several options:\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, the next token after t53 is t25. So after generating t53, the next part is t25, which suggests that NT25 should be expanding to something that leads to t25.\n\nLet me check NT25's productions again:\nNT25 can go to NT22 NT14 or NT49 NT91.\n\nLooking back, t25 might come from NT25 -> something. Let's see: NT25 is used in the string as t25 after t53. So, let's see if any of the NT25 productions can lead to t25.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT22 and NT14:\nNT22 can go to NT38 NT70, NT53 NT45, NT92 NT31.\nLooking at NT38, I see NT38 -> t94. So if NT22 -> NT38 NT70, and NT38 is t94, then NT70 might be another NT production.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think of this as a parsing problem. Maybe I should try to derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S => NT29 NT25\nThen, NT29 is t53, so that's good. Now, NT25 needs to produce t25 and possibly more tokens.\n\nLooking at NT25's rules:\nOption 1: NT25 -> NT22 NT14\nOption 2: NT25 -> NT49 NT91\n\nLet's explore both options.\n\nFirst, Option 1: NT25 -> NT22 NT14\nThen, NT22 needs to produce something that leads to t25. Looking at NT22's possibilities:\n\nNT22 can go to:\n- NT38 NT70\n- NT53 NT45\n- NT92 NT31\n\nNow, let's see what each produces:\n1. NT38 -> t94, NT70 -> t54 (since NT70 -> t54)\nSo NT38 NT70 would produce t94 t54\n2. NT53 -> t53, NT45 -> t37\nSo NT53 NT45 would produce t53 t37\n3. NT92 -> t25, NT31 -> t49\n\nAh, option 3 gives us t25 t49. But in the string, after t53, the next token is t25. So if NT25 -> NT92 NT31, that would produce t25 followed by something else.\n\nWait, the string is t53 t25 t94 t34 t56. So after t53, it's t25. So perhaps NT25 is expanding to NT92 NT31, which produces t25 t49. But in the string, after t25 is t94, so that's the second token after t53.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's consider that the string is tokenized as t53, t25, t94, t34, t56. So after t53, t25 is next, which implies that the production for NT25 must directly result in t25. So, is there any production for NT25 that directly ends with t25?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT25, it's always a combination of two non-terminals, like NT22 NT14, etc. So NT25 doesn't directly produce a terminal. So that means we have to think of NT25 producing a sequence that includes t25 as one of the elements, which is then followed by another terminal.\n\nWait, no. Because in the string, after t25, the next token is t94, then t34, then t56. So perhaps NT25 is expanding into something that leads to t25 followed by some other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's try to parse the string backward. Since context-free grammars can sometimes be parsed top-down, but it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can see if the string can be broken down using the given rules.\n\nLet me list the string again: t53 t25 t94 t34 t56\n\nFirst, S starts as NT29 NT25. So the first token is t53 (from NT29), then NT25. So perhaps the second part, t25, comes from NT25.\n\nLooking at NT25's productions:\nNT25 can become NT22 NT14 or NT49 NT91.\n\nSo, let's take the path NT25 -> NT22 NT14. Then, NT22 and NT14 need to produce some sequences.\n\nNT22's options are NT38 NT70, NT53 NT45, NT92 NT31.\n\nIf we consider NT22 -> NT92 NT31, then NT92 becomes t25, NT31 becomes t49. But in the string, after t53 (from S) comes t25, then t94, etc., so perhaps there's a way to chain these.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as S => NT29 NT25 => t53 NT25. Then, NT25 needs to produce the rest: t25 t94 t34 t56.\n\nBut wait, that would imply that NT25 is generating the entire sequence \"t25 t94 t34 t56\", which seems a bit long. But let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break down the string into parts based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 -> t53, so the first token is definitely t53, which comes from S -> NT29 NT25.\n\nSo after that, the NT25 must produce the remaining tokens: t25, t94, t34, t56.\n\nBut NT25 itself is a non-terminal, so it has to expand into other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string after t25 is t94, which is a terminal. Let's see if any of NT22 or NT14 produce t94.\n\nNT14's production: NT14 -> 't56' (since in the rules, there's NT14 -> 't56').\n\nWait, that's the last token in the string: t56.

{"custom_id":"request-60","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I'm a bit new to context-free grammars, but I'll give it my best shot. So, the task is to determine if the string `t53 t25 t31 t21 t37 t56` can be generated by the given grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It consists of a series of production rules that generate non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT25, etc.) which can eventually produce terminal symbols (like 't53', 't25', etc.). The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, to generate the string, we'll have to derive S into NT29 and NT46, then each of those into their components, and so on until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components: `t53`, `t25`, `t31`, `t21`, `t37`, `t56`. These are all terminals, so they must be produced directly by some non-terminal production rule. So, each of these should have direct productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll check each terminal in the string and see if it has a production rule.\n\n1. `t53`: Checking the grammar, I see NT29 -> 't53'. So, NT29 can produce 't53'.\n2. `t25`: Looking for 't25', I see NT46 -> 't10' and NT46 is actually NT46 -> NT92 NT25, which then NT92 -> 't25' and NT25 -> 't73'. Wait, that's not directly 't25'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recheck. NT25 has a production NT25 -> 't73' from the given rules. So, NT25 can directly produce 't73' and others. Oh, but in the string, we have `t25`, so is there a rule that produces 't25' directly? No, I don't see a direct production for 't25'; it seems NT45 is NT45 -> 't37', which isn't relevant here. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe let's re-examine the rules. Let me list the terminals and their productions.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT91 -> 't55'\n- NT71 -> 't54'\n- NT8 -> 't4'\n- NT46 has various productions, among them NT46 -> 't55'\n- NT22 has several productions, some of which go to terminals like 't96' or 't45', etc.\n- NT25 -> 't73'\n- NT38 -> 't94'\n- NT87 appears to have some rules, including `t74`, `t20`, `t79`. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT87 -> 't79'\n\nSo, NT87 can produce 't74', 't20', or 't79'.\n\nWait, the string has `t25`. Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for 't25'. So is there a path to 't25'?\n\nLooking back, the production rules:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT92 -> NT25 (since we're looking at NT22 -> NT53 NT45, which then... Wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. Each non-terminal must have a production that can derive into the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string again: `t53 t25 t31 t21 t37 t56`.\n\n- `t53` is directly produced by NT29.\n\n- `t25`: I'm not sure. From the rules, perhaps NT46 can derive into 't10', but that's not 25. Wait, NT22 has a production NT22 -> NT53 NT45. So, if NT53 can produce 't53', and NT45 needs to produce 't25'. Does NT45 have a production for 't25'? Let me check the rules for NT45.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT45 is derived from NT22 (NT22 -> NT53 NT45), and NT45's rules are: NT45 -> 't37'. Wait, NT45 can produce 't37', not 't25'. So how can we get 't25' from NT45?\n\nHmm, maybe NT45 isn't the right path. Let me check other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, after `t53`, the next is `t25`. So, the sequence is `t53 t25`.\n\nIn the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nLet me see the parse tree. Starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53' (as per the rule NT29 -> 't53').\n\nNT46 has a rule NT46 -> 't55', but wait, NT46 also has other rules like NT46 -> NT92 NT25. So is that applicable here?\n\nWait, let's make sure. The initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNow, S is generating NT29 and NT46.

Each of these should correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar, and each must appear in the correct order based on the production rules.\n\nStarting from the initial symbol S, which is S -> NT29 NT46. So, S generates two non-terminals, NT29 and NT46. So the first two parts of the string should correspond to NT29 and NT46, respectively.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT29 and NT46:\n\n- NT29 -> NT38 NT70: So NT29 splits into NT38 and NT70.\n- NT46 has multiple productions: -> NT92 NT25, NT22 NT45, NT22 NT31, NT49 NT87, NT84 NT67, NT92 NT25, NT87 NT74, NT67 NT87, NT84 NT71, NT25 NT87, NT91 NT55, etc. But each path is a series of two NTs. However, for the top-level production, in S, it's NT29 and NT46 as the two parts.\n\nSo, the first part is t53. Let me see what NT29 can expand into. Let's check the production for NT29:\n\nNT29 -> NT38 NT70. So NT29 must come from NT29 \u2192 NT38 NT70. Okay, so t53 should correspond to NT29, which then must be transformed into NT38 and NT70.\n\nWait, but NT29 is a non-terminal. If the token is t53, does NT29 ever produce t53? Let me check the NT38 and NT70 productions.\n\nLooking at NT38: NT38 -> NT55 NT55. So NT38 would expand into NT55 and NT55. Then, checking NT55: NT55 -> NT49 NT91. But looking further, NT49 is NT49 -> NT25 NT87, and NT91 is NT91 -> NT8 NT71. Hmm, do any of these ever produce t53? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial approach is wrong. I should trace each token back from the string and see if they can form a derivation leading to S.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token can be matched by a production in the reverse order. For a context-free grammar, to check if a string is generated, you can use the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, maybe a step-by-step approach will work.\n\nLet me list all the tokens: t53, t25, t31, t86, t55, t37, t56.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string must be derived from NT29 followed by NT46.\n\nNow, NT29's possible expansions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 -> NT38 NT70. So NT29 must split into NT38 and NT70. Therefore, the first part of the string t53 must come from NT38 or NT70, but wait, NT38 and NT70 are non-terminals; NT29 is the parent non-terminal. So the entire string is an expansion of NT29 and NT46.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map each token.\n\nStarting with t53, it's part of the NT29 expansion. So NT29 must generate t53, which comes from its production. Looking at NT38 \u2192 NT55 NT55. Then NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91. Then NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87. Then NT25 could be 't73' or might have other productions, but looking at the rules:\n\nFrom NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT55, which is another non-terminal, or in this case, is it ever a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT25 also is defined as NT13 NT55, but none of its branches are terminals. So maybe NT25 must expand further. Let's check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT25 has production NT25 -> NT13 NT55. But then NT13 is NT13 -> NT31 NT55. Hmm. So NT25 can break down into more NTs, none of which produce t directly. Looking through all the NTs, do any of them produce a terminal like t53, t25, etc.?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT70: NT70 \u2192 't54'.\n- NT51: NT51 \u2192 't22'.\n- NT91: NT91 \u2192 't55'.\n- NT46: NT46 can produce various NTs, and in some cases, like NT46 \u2192 't10' for example, but in the given rules, NT46 is either going to NT92 and others, but in one rule, NT46 is 't10'.\n\nWait, let's check all the NTs for terminals:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT22: has a production for 't96', so NT22 can become 't96'.\n- NT25: has 't73' in one rule: NT25 -> 't73'.\n- NT13: produces 't31'? Yes, NT13 \u2192 't31'. Also NT13 has a production to NT31 NT55, which could expand.\n- NT31: produces 't49', according to NT31->'t49'.\n- NT46: some rules produce 't10', 't25', 't55', etc. For example, when NT22: NT22->'t96' or 't45' or others.\n- NT29: the production is NT38 NT70, so unless these NTs eventually produce terminals, it won't get us further.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with the string and trying to trace back using the productions.\n\nThe string is t53 t25 t31 t86 t55 t37 t56. So in order, the tokens are:\n\n1. t53\n2. t25\n3. t31\n4. t86\n5. t55\n6. t37\n7. t56\n\nWait, that's seven tokens. Let's see, since S is NT29 NT46, so the whole string should be a derivation from S, which is two symbols: NT29 and NT46, which each have to expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nEach of these symbols would need to expand into the respective tokens. Since the total tokens are seven, let's see if NT29 and NT46 can produce these in order.\n\nWait, but each symbol (NT29 and NT46) must expand into a sequence of terminals and other NTs. Since NT29 and NT46 are the roots, each of their expansions would form a sub-string in the overall string.\n\nWait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the entire string as an expansion of NT29 and NT46, each of which is a starting point. So the string must be formed by an expansion where NT29 becomes a sequence leading to the first few tokens, and NT46 becomes a sequence leading to the last few tokens.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire string is a single string, it must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT46, each of which is a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut wait, for context-free grammars, each symbol expands into a string, and the overall string is the concatenation of these. So:\n\n- NT29 expands into a string of terminals and NTs.\n- NT46 expands into another string of terminals and NTs.\n\nTogether, their concatenation should form the given string.\n\nSo, for the entire string to be correct, the concatenation of NT29's expansion and NT46's expansion must be t53 t25 t31 t86 t55 t37 t56.\n\nTherefore, I need to see if there's a way to split this string into two parts: one that can be derived from NT29, and another that can be derived from NT46.\n\nPossible split points after each symbol:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals or non-terminals on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the start symbol, which is S. The grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT46. So, the first step is to see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll note that each 't' followed by a number seems to be a terminal, while the others like NT29, NT46, etc., are non-terminals. So, the string is: T53, T25, T31, T96, T56, T79, T55, T37, T56.\n\nStarting with S, it expands to NT29 NT46. So, the entire string needs to be a sequence of productions starting from NT29 and NT46. Let's check each part:\n\n1. NT29: Looking at the productions, NT29 -> T53. So, the first token should be T53. It is, so we consume T53.\n\n2. NT46: Now, this non-terminal needs to produce a sequence of terminals. Looking at the productions for NT46, I see multiple rules: NT46 -> NT92 NT25, NT22 -> NT92 NT31, NT22 -> NT49 NT87, NT46 -> NT53 NT87, NT31 -> NT45 NT87, etc. Hmm, but in the string, after T53, the next is T25.\n\nWait, after NT29 (which is T53), the next is NT46, which needs to produce a sequence leading to the rest of the string: T25, T31, T96, T56, T79, T55, T37, T56.\n\nWait, no, actually, after NT29 producing T53, the remaining part should be the expansion of NT46. So, the remaining string after T53 is T25, T31, T96, T56, T79, T55, T37, T56.\n\nBut NT46 can go into several things. Let me see which production for NT46 can generate the required sequence.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nIf we take NT46 -> NT92 NT25, then NT92 needs to expand. Let's see NT92's production. Looking back, NT22 -> NT92 NT31 and NT22 -> NT92 NT45, and NT46 -> NT92 NT25.\n\nWait, in the string after T53, the first is T25, which would come from NT25's production. But NT25's productions are NT22 -> NT25 NT14, which means NT25 is non-terminal and needs another expansion. Alternatively, NT25 is a terminal? Wait, no, NT25 is a non-terminal because it's not a terminal symbol. Wait, in the given grammar, all non-terminals end with NT, so T symbols are terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are all in the form of NT followed by numbers, so they are non-terminals. The terminals are everything else, which are 't' followed by a number. So, in the string, we have Ts, which are terminals.\n\nSo, back to S -> NT29 NT46. NT29 -> T53, which matches the first token T53. Now, the next part is NT46.\n\nSo, NT46 can produce multiple things. Let's look again:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nSo, to get T25 as the next token, NT25 must expand to T25. But wait, NT25's productions are:\n\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\n- NT25 -> T73\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT25 can be a terminal or non-terminal. In the given grammar, when I look at NT25's productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT25 -> 't73'\n\nSo yes, NT25 can be a terminal T73. So, if NT25 is T73, but in the string, after T53, the next is T25. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, is NT25 a non-terminal that can expand to T25?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all NT25 productions. Let's see:\n\nThe production for NT25 is:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nand\n\nNT25 -> 't73'\n\nSo, NT25 can only generate T73, not T25. So, after NT25, it must be T73, but in the string, it's T25. That doesn't fit. So perhaps NT46 is expanded differently.\n\nLooking again at NT46, let's see other productions:\n\nNT46 -> NT49 NT56\n\nWait, but in the string after T53, the next token is T25, not T49 or T56. So that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, NT46 -> NT53 NT87\n\nBut that would need NT53 to expand. NT53 is not listed in the productions. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe production for NT53 is:\n\nLooking at all NT53 entries:\n\n- NT55 -> NT29 NT46\n\nWait, no, the productions are listed as:\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nYes, so NT53 can only expand into NT13 NT55. But in the string, after T53 comes T25, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach step by step.\n\nStarting with S, we have S -> NT29 NT46.\n\nNT29 -> T53, so the first token is T53. Consuming that, we're left with NT46.\n\nNow, NT46 can produce several things:\n\n1. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n2. NT46 -> NT22 NT53 (from NT22's production: NT22 -> NT53 NT45 and NT22 -> NT92 NT31, etc.)\n\nWait, no, looking at NT46's productions:\n\nNT46 can go to NT92 NT25, NT22 NT53, or other combinations like NT49 NT56, etc.\n\nBut in the string, after T53, the first token is T25, so in the breakdown, it's T53 followed by NT46.\n\nSo, to get T25, we need NT25 to produce T25. But in the grammar, NT25 can only be 't73' or derived from two non-terminals.\n\nHmm, wait, but the string after T53 is T25. So, how can we get T25 as a terminal from NT25? Because in the grammar, NT25 is only 't73', not 't25'. So, perhaps this path isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe another production for NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46, another rule is NT46 -> NT22 NT53. Hmm, not sure. Or perhaps NT46 -> NT92 NT25, as I thought before.\n\nSo, if NT46 -> NT92 NT25, then the next step is to consider NT92. What does NT92 produce? Looking back, NT22 -> NT92 NT31 and NT22 -> NT92 NT45, and NT46 -> NT92 NT25. So, NT92 is also a non-terminal.\n\nWhat can NT92 do? It's not directly listed in the productions as a terminal, unless it's in the list. Let me check all the NT22 rules:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nWait, looking for NT92, perhaps I missed it. Looking through all the productions:\n\nHmm, the only times NT92 appears is in NT46 -> NT92 NT25 and in NT22 -> NT92 NT31, and NT22 -> NT92 NT45.\n\nSo, NT92 can expand into NT38 and NT70, or NT31, or NT45. So, starting with NT92, let's see.\n\nIn the string, after T53 (from NT29) comes T25 (from NT46's side). Wait, no, S is NT29 NT46, so after NT29 produces T53, NT46 needs to produce the rest of the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56\". \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF is a set of production rules where each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. The grammar provided seems to fit this because each rule looks like \"A -> BC\", except I notice some rules have a mix, like \"NT46 -> NT92 NT25\" which has two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, looking more closely, the right-hand side of each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal.

For example, NT51 is defined as both 't40' and 't22'. That can't be right. Similarly, NT84 is both 't71' and 't87', and NT46 is 't10', 't18', and 't55'. That's a problem because a non-terminal can't have multiple terminal values unless it's a union in the definition, which it's not in standard CNF. So perhaps there's a typo or I misread the grammar. But for now, I'll proceed under the assumption that these are the correct productions, but they might be conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe some of these are meant to be rules, and others are terminal productions. Let me check: some rules are followed by single terminals, others by two non-terminals. So, for example, NT8 \u2192 't4' is a terminal, so it's a production that causes that terminal to appear in the string.\n\nGiven that, the task is to see if \"t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56\" can be generated. So each symbol in the string must correspond to the left-hand side after expansion.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The string is a sequence of symbols, and each symbol corresponds to a step in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT29 NT46. So the string starts with NT29 followed by NT46. So the first part of the string should correspond to NT29 and NT46.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56'. Let me split that into tokens (assuming they are separated by spaces each time a symbol is generated). So the string is t53, t25, t31, t86, t4, t80, t35, t37, t56.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then in the first step, S expands to NT29 NT46. So the beginning of the string would be the first symbols of these non-terminals. But wait, S is producing NT29 and NT46. So each of these is a non-terminal that can be further expanded.\n\nBut the string starts with 't53'. Looking at the grammar, some of these non-terminals expand into 't's. Let me see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53' \u2192 so if NT29 expands to 't53', that would match the first token.\n- NT46 has several productions, but one is NT46 \u2192 't10', but the next token is 't25'. So maybe NT46 is being expanded to 't25'. Or perhaps I need to follow the expansions step by step.\n\nWait, let's try to break it down.\n\nThe string is: t53, t25, t31, t86, t4, t80, t35, t37, t56.\n\nBut the expansion of S is NT29 NT46. So perhaps the first part is NT29 \u2192 t53, and then NT46 is expanded into something that starts with t25. But that would mean the second token is t25, which matches NT46's production. So far, so good.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT29 NT46, then the first symbols are NT29 and NT46. NT29 \u2192 't53', so the first part is 't53'. Then NT46 must be expanded to something, but the second token is 't25'. So does any NT46 production yield 't25'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT46's productions include:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 (two non-terminals)\n\nWait, but there's also NT46 \u2192 't10', 't18', 't55', and 't46' is another terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t53 t25 t31 t94 t54 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. CNF is a production where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or terminals. It doesn't allow epsilon productions or more than two symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's in CNF because each production (like S -> NT29 NT46) is a non-terminal breaking down into two other symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So, that's good.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by this grammar, I need to see if I can derive it by following the productions. The string has multiple 't' terms, which I think are terminals, so the derivation must end when a terminal string is produced.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to match it to the rightmost symbols of the productions. This is similar to how the CYK algorithm works, where you check for possible factors that could generate the string.\n\nLet me list out the string components for clarity:\n- t53, t25, t31, t94, t54, t56, t79, t55, t37, t56\n\nStarting from the right, since CNF uses rightmost derivations. Let's see which parts of the string can correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the last 't56', which production could result in a terminal ending with 't56'? Looking through the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't4', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should look for production rules that have 't56' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT51 -> 't22' and NT56 is not present, but wait, NT51 is 't22' or 't56'? Wait, actually, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't56' in the productions... Hmm, I don't see any production directly resulting in 't56' except maybe through a non-terminal. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the given grammar, there's a line: NT14 -> 't56'. So that's a production where NT14 becomes 't56'. So if I have a part of the string that is 't56', it must have been generated by NT14.\n\nSo, the last symbol is 't56' which is generated by NT14. Now, looking at how NT14 is produced: NT14 -> 't56'. So in the derivation, that terminal is produced directly from NT14. So that's a terminal symbol at the end.\n\nBefore that, the string is ...t37 t56.\n\nLooking for 't37', which production could generate it. Scanning through the grammar: NT38 -> 't94' which isn't helpful, but looking for something that ends in 't37'. Wait, I see NT79 -> 't37'. So NT79 can produce 't37'.\n\nSo the substring 't37 t56' would be part of NT79 -> NT46 NT92 (since NT79 in the grammar is actually...

Let me look for NT79, but I don't see an NT79 production. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake, because in the original problem, NT79 is not present. So maybe the initial parsing was incorrect.\n\nWait, the string provided is `t53 t25 t31 t94 t54 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`. So 't79' is in there. But in the grammar, I don't see a production for a non-terminal that ends with 't79'. Hmm, so unless 't79' is a terminal, which it is, but in the grammar, perhaps that's a typo or I've missed a production.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT87 -> 't74' and NT46 -> 't10', but no NT79 in the productions. So perhaps 't79' is meant to be a terminal, but there's no rule for it. That would be a problem because that would mean the string contains a terminal that's not defined in the grammar, but looking back, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar again to check if 't79' is present.

The grammar has several non-terminals, each of which can be rewritten into two other non-terminals or terminals. The string consists of a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each production is either an non-terminal followed by two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal and a non-terminal. However, wait, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, but some of them become terminals in the expanded form.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several productions result in terminals. For example, NT40 \u2192 't80', NT8 \u2192 't4', NT51 \u2192 't22', etc. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, some of them are A \u2192 a B, but in CNF, all productions must be A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. Oh, no, actually, in some versions, CNF allows for A \u2192 a, but maybe in this case, since some productions directly give terminals, that's consistent.\n\nBut for this problem, the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, so I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S step by step, reducing the non-terminals to terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string again: t53 t25 t31 t94 t54 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56. That's 10 tokens, so the string has a length of 10.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string must start with whatever NT29 produces and be followed by whatever NT46 produces.\n\nLet me first see what NT29 and NT46 produce.\n\nLooking up NT29's production: From the grammar, NT29 \u2192 't53'.

{"custom_id":"request-130","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t53 t25 t31 t31 t80 t37 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each rule's left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. That might help in parsing the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are multiple production rules, some ending with terminals (like 't80', 't22', etc.). The string given consists entirely of terminals, which suggests that it should be a fully reduced form from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the first step is to see if the string can be generated starting from S. That would require the string to begin with the non-terminals generated by NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string: t53 t25 t31 t31 t80 t37 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the string should split into two parts: the first part generated by NT29 and the second by NT46. Let's see what each NT production leads to.\n\nLet's break down NT29 and NT46. From the grammar, NT29 -> 't53', which is a terminal. That means NT29 directly produces t53. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, NT46: The production for NT46 is given as several options, one of which is NT46 \u2192 't10'. Wait, but looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT53\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT49 NT91\nNT46 -> NT31 NT67\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT82\nNT46 -> NT85 NT74\nNT46 -> NT31 NT61\nNT46 -> NT85 NT36\nNT46 -> NT31 NT19\nNT46 -> NT55 NT80\nNT46 -> NT22 NT52\nNT46 -> NT45 NT87\nNT46 -> NT40 NT61\nNT46 -> NT40 NT84\nNT46 -> NT49 NT25\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT87 NT79\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\nNT46 -> NT49 NT91\nNT46 -> NT70 NT85\nNT46 -> NT84 NT36\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT85\nNT46 -> NT31 NT15\nNT46 -> NT85 NT37\nNT46 -> NT31 NT46\nNT46 -> NT31 NT61\nNT46 -> NT49 NT86\nNT46 -> NT70 NT34\nNT46 -> NT84 NT36\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT25\nNT46 -> NT87 NT79\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\nNT46 -> NT49 NT86\nNT46 -> NT70 NT85\nNT46 -> NT84 NT36\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT25\nNT46 -> NT87 NT79\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\nNT46 -> NT49 NT86\nNT46 -> NT70 NT85\nNT46 -> NT84 NT36\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT25\nNT46 -> NT87 NT79\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\nNT46 -> NT49 NT86\nNT46 -> NT70 NT85\nNT46 -> NT84 NT36\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT25\nNT46 -> NT87 NT79\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\n\nWait, that's a lot. But looking again, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me scan the given grammar again to ensure I have the correct NT46 rules.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, for NT46, the rules are:\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT53\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT49 NT91\nNT46 -> NT31 NT67 (Wait, no, in the provided rules, NT46 is written as NT46 -> 't10' but that can't be because in the list, it's shown as:\n\nNT46 is among the NT productions, but looking back, actually, in the given grammar block, for NT46, the last few lines are:\n\nNT46 -> NT40 NT61\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\nNT46 -> NT40 NT84\nNT46 -> NT49 NT25\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT85\nNT46 -> NT31 NT15\nNT46 -> NT85 NT37\nNT46 -> NT31 NT46\nNT46 -> NT31 NT61\nNT46 -> NT49 NT86\nNT46 -> NT70 NT34\nNT46 -> NT84 NT36\nNT46 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT91 NT25\nNT46 -> NT87 NT79\nNT46 -> NT46 NT46\n\nWait, I think I missed some steps earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar as a series of lines starting with S -> NT29 NT46, followed by several other production rules, each with a name (like NT22, NT25, etc.) on the LHS, and RHS a combination of other NTs or terminals.\n\nI think the confusion arises because when parsing, each NT must be resolved step by step until they produce terminals only.\n\nSo, starting with S, which is NT29 NT46. NT29 directly produces t53, as per the rule NT29 -> 't53'. So the first part of the string is 't53'.\n\nNow, the second part is NT46. Looking at the production rules for NT46, we have multiple options. Each of these options is a pair of NTs. For instance, one rule is NT46 -> NT22 NT53. Another is NT46 -> NT22 NT14, and so on.\n\nBut the string after 't53' starts with 't25', which suggests that NT46 must produce a t25 as the next symbol. So perhaps NT46 has a production that can directly produce 't25'. But looking at the grammar, I see that:\n\nIn the provided rules, one of the NT46 productions is NT46 -> 't10'. Wait, no, I need to check. Looking back, in the provided grammar, the lines for NT46 are:\n\n...\n\nNT46 -> 't10' (Wait, no, in the given data, the production 'NT46 -> 't10'' is not present.

{"custom_id":"request-136","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I have a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t53 t25 t31 t73 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56` is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form defines each production as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. Here, the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals, and each production seems to split into two parts, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or even two terminals? Wait, no, wait. Looking at the productions, I see some have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so that's A \u2192 BC. Others have a mix, like NT40 \u2192 't84' NT67, which is A \u2192 aB. So, the grammar can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nBut for this problem, the input string is composed solely of terminals, so only the rules that can terminate with terminals are relevant.\n\nWait, but in the CFG, some non-terminals produce terminals, and some produce other non-terminals. To generate a string, we must reduce the string to the initial symbol S, using the productions in reverse.\n\nSo, maybe I can approach this by building a parse tree from the string. Let's see. The string is `t53 t25 t31 t73 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56`. That's 11 tokens. \n\nI think a good strategy is to look for the longest possible substrings that can match any production ending with a terminal, then backtrack to see if the rest can be handled.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a top-down parsing or bottom-up. Since I'm given the string, maybe a bottom-up approach would work. But that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the way to go since it efficiently parses strings in CNF. But since I'm just doing this manually, let's try to find the productions that can generate the string.\n\nStarting with the leftmost symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t53. Let's see which productions can generate t53.\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53', so NT29 can produce t53.\n- Other productions for t53 are none else, as per the given. So in the grammar, NT29 is the only non-terminal that directly produces t53.\n\nSo, for the first token, we can start by assuming NT29 generates t53. So, the first step is NT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nNow, the remaining string after t53 is t25 t31 t73 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56. So after handling t53, the rest of the string is `t25 t31 t73 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56`.\n\nNext, we need to handle the remaining string, which starts with t25. Looking at which non-terminals can produce t25.\n\nIn the grammar:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't94' which is not relevant.\n- NT22 \u2192 't96'; no.\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'; no.\n- NT49 \u2192 't86' \u2014 not matching t25.\n- NT71 \u2192 't87'; no.\n- NT55 \u2192 't80'; no.\n- NT35 \u2192 hmm, wait, looking through the productions: oh, I see NT38 \u2192 't94', but how about NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, which can produce t53 t45, but that's t53 followed by t45. Wait, but in the remaining string after t25, the next token is t31, which is another terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the approach. Let's focus on each step.\n\nAfter t53, the next part of the string is t25. So, can any non-terminal production produce t25 as the next symbol? Let me see the productions:\n\n- Looking at NT46 \u2192 't10'. Not relevant.\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'; no.\n- NT46 \u2192 't61'; no.\n- NT49 \u2192 't86'; no.\n- NT38 \u2192 't94'; no.\n\nWait, maybe I didn't look through all the productions correctly. Let me list all productions that have terminals on the RHS:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT25 \u2192 NT73\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'; but wait, no. Looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice the NT25 production:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73' \u2014 yes, that exists. So, NT25 can directly produce t73. But in the remaining string, after t25, it's t31, so that can't be. Wait, no, NT22 produces t53 and t45. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me re-express the production rules clearly.

The string is `t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules from S down to various NTs, each eventually expanding into terminals like 'tX' and numbers like 't53'. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string should derive down to all terminals and nothing else.\n\nSince the string is in terms of 'tX' and numbers, I think each of these represents a terminal symbol. But I need to check how these terminals relate to the production rules. So, I'll list out the rules again to make sure I understand the structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, any string generated by this grammar will start with whatever NT29 and NT46 produce. Checking each of these non-terminals, many of them expand into other non-terminals until they eventually reach terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, and then each of those might go further down.\n\nTo parse the string, I can try working backward using the grammar rules. Starting from the end, I look for rules that match the terminal tokens. Let's start with the first token, t53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t53? Scanning through the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 t53? Let me check: NT29 \u2192 't53', yes. So, the first token t53 must come from NT29. So, I can replace t53 with NT29, and now I have NT29 followed by the rest of the string starting from t25.\n\nNext token is t25. Let's see where t25 comes from. Looking at the rules, NT46 \u2192 t25 once? Yes, rule says NT46 \u2192 t25. So, the second token t25 comes from NT46.\n\nNow, the string after replacing the first two tokens is: NT29, NT46, then t31, t96, etc. So the entire string would be NT29 NT46 followed by the rest. Previously, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so that matches the starting part. Now the rest of the string after NT29 NT46 is t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56.\n\nWait, but after S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the next non-terminals would be whatever NT29 and NT46 expand into. So, the string after S would start with whatever NT29 produces and then NT46 produces. So, checking NT29 \u2192 t53, which we've used, but perhaps I should instead look deeper into the possible expansions.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take a step-by-step approach.\n\nThe string is: t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be obtained by starting from S and expanding it according to the rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the first two symbols after expansion must be whatever NT29 and NT46 produce. The string starts with t53, which as per the rules, comes from NT29 \u2192 t53. So, the first part is correct.\n\nNow, after NT29 (t53), we have NT46. The next token after t53 is t25, which according to the rules, comes from NT46 \u2192 t25. So, the first two symbols fit the S production.\n\nNow, the rest of the string after t53 and t25 is t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56. So, the entire string is now parsed as: NT29 (t53) | NT46 (t25) followed by the rest: t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so after S, the next is NT29 and NT46. So, after the first two tokens, I need to see if the remaining part can be generated from NT29 and NT46. Wait, maybe I should process the string step by step, expanding non-terminals as I go along, trying to match the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of this as a parse tree, building it from the start symbol S down to the string, ensuring that each step matches the rules.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to model the process as a stack-based parser or use a recursive descent approach. Since each rule is simple, perhaps I can simulate the parse.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.\n\nGiven S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the entire string should be the expansion of NT29 followed by NT46.\n\nSo, the next step after t53 (NT29) is t25 (NT46). Then, after that, the remaining tokens should come from the expansions of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each non-terminal NT29 can expand into multiple things, not just directly yielding t53. Wait, no. Let's check the rules more carefully.\n\nNT29 is defined as NT29 \u2192 't53', which means it directly produces t53. So, when NT29 is on the stack, it directly becomes t53. Similarly, NT46 \u2192 't25' directly. So, in the initial step, S \u2192 NT29 NT46 would become t53 t25, matching the first two tokens.\n\nThen, we have to process the rest: t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56.\n\nHmm, but wait. The problem is that NT29 can only produce t53, and NT46 can only produce t25. So, the remainder of the string should be directly derived from the expansion of NT29 and NT46. But in this case, after the first two tokens, the remainder is longer, so perhaps the initial expansion is insufficient.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misapplying the parse because I'm only looking at the first tokens. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the production rules and the order in which they're applied. Let me check again.\n\nThe production S \u2192 NT29 NT46 is followed by the string being NT29 NT46 followed by the rest of the string. So, after expanding NT29 and NT46 to their terminals, the next part of the string must come from these non-terminals' expansions.\n\nWait, no\u2014after S expands into NT29 NT46, the entire string should be generated by expanding NT29 to t53 and NT46 to t25, resulting in t53 t25, but the string is way longer, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misunderstood the grammar. Let me think again.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, S \u2192 NT29 NT46 means S can be derived into NT29 NT46, each of which can further be expanded. So, the overall string starts with NT29 and NT46, but each of these may expand into multiple symbols.\n\nBut in this case, NT29 can only directly produce t53, as per the rules, and NT46 can only directly produce t25. Therefore, after S expands to t53 t25, the entire string would be t53 t25, which is only 2 tokens. However, the input string is longer, so I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the production rules. Looking again, I see that NT29 \u2192 't53', yes, but perhaps I should check all rules to see if any of the non-terminals can produce a symbol that would help in the expansion.\n\nLet me list the rules again for better clarity.\n\nI think I should approach this by reverse-engineering, starting from the string and trying to reduce it to S through the grammar rules.\n\nSo, the string is: t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56\n\nLet's process from the end to the beginning, trying to find which non-terminals can produce these tokens.\n\nThe first token is t53.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t80 t37 t56`.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- The start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- Each non-terminal (NT22, NT25, NT91, etc.) seems to be directly or indirectly connected to terminals, with some rules leading further down the chain.\n\nThe string to test is `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t80 t37 t56`. Translating each token as a terminal, let's see how this could be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string must start with the symbols from NT29 and NT46. Each of these can be terminals or further expanded.\n\nLet's see what NT29 and NT46 produce. From the rules:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, but in the string, after NT29's 't53', the next is 't25'. Wait, but after NS29 is 't53', what comes next? S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string should be the concatenation of rules for NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at the string: the first two tokens are 't53' and 't25'. But from the rules, NT46 can produce 't10' or go further if NT46 can produce other non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar rules for NT46.\n\nWait, the grammar for NT46 is:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT31\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 NT71 NT40\n- NT46 can go to 't10' or 't55', but wait, looking closely, 't10' is from NT46 \u2192 't10'. So in the case of NT46, sometimes it's a terminal, sometimes it branches into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me try to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string is `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t80 t37 t56`. Let's split it into individual symbols: t53, t25, t31, t86, t4, t36, t87, t40, t94, t80, t37, t56.\n\nThe string should be generated by the grammar starting from S. So S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Therefore, NT29 must produce t53 and NT46 must produce a sequence that includes the rest. Wait, no. Because NT29 produces t53, which is the first token, and then NT46 should produce the rest: t25, t31, etc., but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the NT46 expansion needs to go through several steps.\n\nLet me map out the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n2. NT29 \u2192 t53 \u2192 t53 (so that's the first token)\n3. Now, NT46 needs to generate the rest of the string starting from t25 onwards: t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t80 t37 t56.\n\nWait, but the string after t53 is t25, t31, etc. So the NT46 must generate t25 followed by t31, etc.\n\nLooking at NT46's rules:\n\n- NT46 can produce 't10' (from NT46 \u2192 't10'), but that's a terminal, so NT46 \u2192 t10 would produce only t10. But in this case, after t53 (from NT29), the next in the string is t25. So maybe NT46 must expand into something that starts with t25.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT46 can expand into:\n\n- NT92 NT25\n- NT22 NT31\n- NT49 NT87\n- NT71 NT40\n\nSo none of them directly produce 't25' but some non-terminals that might produce t25. Wait, NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, so first token is from NT92.\n\nWait, but this could get complicated. Let me try to see if any non-terminals can produce 't25'.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73' \u2192 not helpful.\n- NT53 \u2192 't31' \u2192 no, not relevant.\nWait, perhaps I need to consider each step.\n\nLet me first check if the first part is correct:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT46\nNT29 \u2192 t53\nThus, initial production is t53 followed by NT46. So, after t53, the next part should be generated by NT46, which must derive t25, t31, etc.\n\nBut NT46 can expand into:\n\n- NT92 NT25\n- NT22 NT31\n- NT49 NT87\n- NT71 NT40\n\nIt can't produce t25 directly. So let's see:\n\nIf NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, then after NT46, the string starts with NT92 (which can produce a terminal or non-terminal) followed by NT25.\n\nWait, let me map this. If NT46 expands into NT92 NT25, then after NT29 (t53), we have NT92 and NT25.\n\nSo, next, NT92 would need to produce the rest of the string after t53 and t25.\n\nBut wait, the string after t53 is t25, t31, t86, etc. So if NT46 is NT92 NT25, the next token is whatever NT92 produces, followed by NT25.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT92:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 NT55 NT16\n- NT92 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n- NT92 \u2192 't25' \u2192 Because looking back, the rule is NT92 \u2192 't25'? Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, is there a rule for NT92?\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't25' \u2192 yes, because in the list, I see NT92 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSo, if NT92 \u2192 't25', then NT46 \u2192 NT92 (t25) and NT25. So after NT29 (t53), we have t25 from NT92, and then the production becomes NT25.\n\nSo, the string so far is t53 t25, and then the rest is generated by NT25.\n\nLooking at NT25's rules:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73' \u2192 No, that's a terminal, but the next in the string is t31. So maybe NT25 cannot produce 't31' directly. Wait, looking at the productions for NT25:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't73' \u2192 no\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14 \u2192 That's if it's a non-terminal.\n- NT25 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 't31'\n\nSo, let's explore that. If NT25 can expand into NT53, which then produces 't31'?\n\nBut in the string, after t25 t31 comes t86, which is next. So let's see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 't31' (which is correct so far). Now, we have t53, t25, t31, then what comes next? It's t86, t4, etc.\n\nSo after 't31', the next symbol is 't86'. Let's see how that comes.\n\nLooking at NT31 (wait, but in the grammar, the non-terminal is NT31, which is different from NT21, etc. Wait, perhaps I got confused with the symbols.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the non-terminals have 2-digit numbers, like NT29, NT46, NT22, etc."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the start symbol is the only one that can directly produce a terminal, and all others must produce non-terminals. Let me double-check that.\n\nYes, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. That's right.

Oh, no, the grammar provided has NT53 -> NT13 NT55. So NT53 produces two non-terminals: NT13 and NT55.\n\nThen, both of these non-terminals need to be expanded further. NT13 (which is the same as NT53) can be rewritten into what? Let's see, looking for NT13:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT13 listed as a production except on the right side. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check the entire grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions are of NT22, NT25, etc. I don't see an entry for NT13 except in the rule for NT53: NT53 -> NT13 NT55. But wait, looking through all the productions, I don't see NT53 as a product except when it's being rewritten. So perhaps in the provided grammar, NT53 is a non-terminal that can expand into NT13 and NT55, which themselves might expand into more symbols.\n\nBut for the string starting with 't53', that would mean that 't53' must come from a production where NT53 directly produces 't53'. However, looking through the list, I don't see any production where NT53 is on the left and 't53' is on the right. All productions for NT53 go to non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nIs that correct? So NT53 only produces non-terminals. So 't53' cannot be derived from NT53 because NT53 only expands into other non-terminals. Therefore, 't53' would need to be a terminal in the grammar, but it isn't present because all productions for NT53 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, the symbols are terminals. So if NT53 only expands into more non-terminals and never reaches a terminal, then the string cannot contain 't53' because it's impossible to derive it from the grammar. That would mean the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure. Let me see: Is there any production that expands into 't53'?\n\nLooking at all the productions, I don't see any where a NT directly produces 't53'. The productions all involve non-terminals, so perhaps 't53' is not a terminal symbol in the grammar, meaning it's not part of the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading. Let me check again: NT53 is defined as NT13 and NT55, which themselves might produce 't53'?

NT13 is defined as NT53, which is NT13 and NT55. That's a cycle, which might not resolve unless there's a terminal somewhere.\n\nHmm, perhaps this means that 't53' is not part of the language, because the only way to get 't53' is if there's a production from NT53 to 't53', which there isn't.\n\nSo given that, the string starts with 't53', which the grammar can't produce because NT53 is a non-terminal that only expands into other non-terminals.

Maybe the entire string must be built step by step from the start symbol by expanding each non-terminal until we get all terminals.\n\nLet me start with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string starts with NT29 and ends with NT46. So the first part is NT29, which is 't53', so that's the first token. Then, the second part is NT46. Let's look at NT46's productions. One of them is NT46 \u2192 't10', but in the string, after t53 comes t25, not t10. So that suggests NT46 might have to expand further.\n\nLooking at NT46, other productions are NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 't46', wait no, looking back: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 't10', and others like 't55' and 't61'. Wait, let me correct. Checking the list again:\n\nNT46's productions are:\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT53\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT46 \u2192 NT85 NT31\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT46 \u2192 't61'\n\nWait, okay, so NT46 can produce t10, t55, t61, but also combinations like NT22 NT53 or NT92 NT25, etc.\n\nIn the string, after t53 (from NT29) comes t25. So perhaps the second part of S, which is NT46, must produce something that includes t25 as an intermediate step.\n\nWait, but S is NT29 NT46, which together must produce the rest of the string, which starts with t53 followed by t25. So after NT29 is processed as t53,NT46 needs to produce the rest: t25, etc.\n\nSo NT46 must produce something that, when expanded, starts with t25. Looking at NT46's produces, do any of them lead to t25?\n\nLooking at NT46, when it's a terminal, it can be 't55' or 't61' or 't10'. But can it produce a sequence that includes t25 and t... Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe NT46 has to derive a pair of non-terminals that each can be expanded into a terminal.\n\nLooking more closely, in NT46's productions, I see options like:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT53\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t53 comes t25. So perhaps the second part of S, which is NT46, must produce t25 in the next step somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the parse tree step by step. Let's try:\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n\nSo, the string is t53 followed by NT46's expansion.\n\nNT29 is t53, so the string starts with that. Now, the rest of the string after t53 is t25 t31 t73 t74 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t21 t37 t56.\n\nNow, this remaining part must come from NT46. So what's NT46 capable of producing?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT46 can produce 't10', 't55', 't61', or combinations of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the next token is t25. So if NT46 is to produce t25, but 't25' is not directly a production of NT46. Instead, looking at the non-terminals, for NT25 \u2192 't73', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting myself confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and their possible expansions to see where 't25' comes in.\n\nLooking through the list of non-terminals:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 \u2192 't4' 't70' (since NT38 \u2192 't94'; NT70 \u2192 't54'; but wait, maybe another expansion?)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLet me try to create a mapping for each non-terminal to its possible terminal productions.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT22:\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n\nNT38 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT70 \u2192 't54'\n\nSo NT22 can produce combinations that expand into:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't94' and NT70 \u2192 't54', so the whole thing would be 't94 t54'\n- NT53 \u2192 't53' and NT45 \u2192 't37' \u2192 't53 t37'\n- NT92 \u2192 't25' and NT31 \u2192 't8' \u2192 't25 t8'\n\nSo when NT22 expands, it can produce 't94 t54' or 't53 t37' or 't25 t8'.\n\nLooking at the string after t53, the next part is t25, which suggests that NT22 could be producing 't25 t8' as one of its expansions. But in the string, after t53 comes t25. So perhaps the NT46 is expanding as some combination leading into t25.\n\nWait, perhaps the overall approach is to try to parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals until we reach all terminals.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\nThe string is: t53 t25 t31 t73 t74 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t21 t37 t56.\n\nWe have to see if starting from S, expanding according to the grammar can result in this string.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n   NT29 produces 't53', leaving NT46 to produce the rest: t25 t31 t73 t74 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t21 t37 t56.\n\n2. So NT46 must expand to t25 followed by other tokens.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions, 't25' is present in several places. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31, which produces 't25 t8' as an expansion because NT92 \u2192 't25' and NT31 \u2192 't8'.\n\nWait, so if NT46 expands to NT22 NT53, could that lead to t25? Let's check:\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT22 NT53.\n\nThen NT22 would produce 't25 t8'. So NT22 expands to 't25 t8', and NT53 expands to 't53'. So combining, NT46 produces 't25 t8 t53' ?\n\nWait, but the initial expansion was S \u2192 NT29 NT46. NT29 is 't53', and NT46 would then produce something else. Wait, no. S is NT29 NT46, so after NT29 is processed as t53, the NT46"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, but in the problem, the string is a series of terminals, so perhaps NT46 is directly producing a terminal 't10'.\n\nBut looking again, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nWait, the line is: \"NT46 -> 't10'\", so yes, NT46 can directly produce 't10'.

But looking at the string, after t53, the next token is t25, not t10. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the provided rules, NT46 can produce 't10' or other combinations. So is it possible that perhaps in the production, NT46 is being used differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial parsing is incorrect. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I misread the production rules. For example, in the grammar, NT46 has multiple rules. It may produce 't10', but perhaps other rules.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not exactly sure how yet.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t25 t8 t56 t20 t4 t36 t87 t18 t94 t80 t37 t56`. It's a sequence of terminal symbols, so each of these should correspond to a production that ends in a terminal, right?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can see that many of the non-terminals have productions that lead to terminal symbols. For example, NT8 \u2192 't4', and so on. But some non-terminals are even further broken down: like S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so S generates two non-terminals that each have their own productions.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the given string step by step using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, it's a binary tree structure, so every non-terminal should produce two symbols at each step. Let me see if I can reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\n1. `t53 t25 t31 t25 t8 t56 t20 t4 t36 t87 t18 t94 t80 t37 t56`\n\nI'll start from the left, looking for the first production. The string starts with `t53`, so check which non-terminals produce `t53`. Looking at the rules, NT29 \u2192 't53' because in the grammar, NT29 is defined as `NT22 -> NT22 NT14` no, wait, actually, I need to check each rule. Oh, look, NT53 isn't even in the rules anymore. Wait, let me check the grammar again. Hmm, in the list after NT70, it goes on until NT92 and beyond.

For example, NT51 \u2192 't40' appears twice, as does NT46 \u2192 't55' appearing twice. Maybe that's a mistake, but perhaps I should consider each rule as separate, even if the same non-terminal is defined multiple times.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNow, in the string, the first symbol is t53, which matches NT29's production: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So the first part is matched by NT29 \u2192 't53'.\n\nNow, after that, the remaining string starts with t25. So we need to check what NT25 produces.\n\nLooking at NT25's rules: NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14 and NT25 \u2192 't73'. Hmm, wait, the options are:\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14  \nand then later:  \nNT25 \u2192 't73'?\n\nWait, no, looking back, the initial list of rules:\n\nAfter the grammar rules, they seem to list each production. So I think after 't71' comes other rules like NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91, NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85, etc. Wait, maybe in the original list, each line is a production. So for example, NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, etc.\n\nWait, regardless, looking at NT25: It seems NT25 can produce 't73' directly. So if NT25 \u2192 't73', then when we have a t25 in the string, that could be matched by NT25 \u2192 't73'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the part after NT29 is 't25', but NT25 can be 't73'. Hmm, that doesn't match because the string has 't25', not 't73'. So perhaps my assumption is wrong. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again. Oh, I see, earlier in the list, NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 and NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31. And in the list, there's NT25 \u2192 't73'. Yes, that's correct. So NT25's production includes 't73' as a terminal. But the string has 't25' after 't53', so this wouldn't match. Wait, so that would mean that NT25 can't produce 't25', which implies that perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, maybe I misremembered. For NT25, the productions are:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14  \nand later on, at the end, there's NT25 \u2192 't73'.\n\nSo NT25 can produce 't73' as a terminal. Therefore, when we have 't25' in the string, that can't match NT25 directly. That seems like a problem, so perhaps I was wrong in my initial step. Maybe NT25 in the string is being considered as 't25' but in the grammar, the only terminal for NT25 is 't73', so that would mean that this string cannot be derived from the grammar, leading to a 'No' answer? But that seems too hasty. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the initial assumption of S \u2192 NT29 NT46 is incorrect. Wait, but the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so that must be the starting point. So the string starts with t53 and the next is t25, but according to NT25, the only terminal it can produce is 't73', so maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT25 can be split in some way. Wait, NT25 is defined as NT22 NT14 and also as 't73'. So in the parse, after matching t53 from NT29, the next part is 't25', which doesn't match 't73', so perhaps that's an issue. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look for the sequence t53 t25, so perhaps 't53' is from NT29, and 't25' comes from NT25, but NT25 \u2192 't73', so no, that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps it's not possible, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Maybe the structure is different.

{"custom_id":"request-214","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got a task here where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided, along with the string to evaluate. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented as a series of production rules. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, except for some cases where terminals ('t' followed by numbers) are directly produced from the non-terminals. Each production rule is written with two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. For example, NT40 -> 't80' is a terminal production.\n\nThe string given is: `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t73 t79 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56`.\n\nSince the problem is about generating this string, I need to see if it's possible to derive the entire string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe initial step is to see what the start symbol can produce. According to the grammar, S -> NT29 NT46. So the string must start with the symbols that NT29 can produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT29 -> 't53'. So the first symbol in the string is 't53', which matches.\n\nNext, NT46 produces 't10'. But in our string, the next token after 't53' is 't25'. Wait, that's a problem. According to the grammar, NT46 -> 't10' or other options? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT46 has the production: NT46 -> 't10'. So if NT46 is supposed to be the second non-terminal, but the next token is 't25', that doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Since S -> NT29 NT46, when we derive S, it will produce a string where NT29 generates the left part and NT46 generates the right part. However, in the string provided, the second token is 't25', which corresponds to NT25's production.\n\nBut NT29 -> 't53', so the first part is fixed as 't53', and then we have NT46. For NT46, the only terminal production is 't10', not 't25'. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a chain of derivations beyond NT29 and NT46. Maybe they can expand into other non-terminals that eventually produce the desired terminals. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's explore what NT29 can do. NT29's production is only 't53', so it only produces that terminal. There's no way for NT29 to expand into other non-terminals. Therefore, the first part of the string must be 't53' followed by the expansion of NT46.\n\nSo, NT46 must produce the rest of the string starting from 't25'. But the rules for NT46 show that it directly produces 't10' or other non-terminals. Wait, looking closer: NT46 can produce 't10' directly, or do any non-terminals have a path that leads to NT46 indirectly? No, because NT46's only production is either a terminal or another production that might lead elsewhere, but in this case, it seems NT46 can't lead to 't25'.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Are there any other productions that lead to NT46 beyond the one given? No, the grammar shows that NT46 is only connected via S -> NT29 NT46. So, I think NT46 can only be expanded to 't10' directly.\n\nBut in the string, after 't53', we have 't25', which isn't 't10'. Therefore, this is a mismatch. So it's impossible for the grammar to generate the given string.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed something in the grammar rules. Let me look at all the NT46 rules. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n- No other rules for NT46. So indeed, NT46 can't be any longer; it's a terminal production.\n\nSo, moving beyond that, since S -> NT29 NT46, and both are terminals in the first two steps, the string can't have any other symbols following that initial 't53 t10'. But in the given string, it's 't53 t25', which is a problem because NT46 only produces 't10'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe there's a way for NT29 or NT46 to produce non-terminals that then expand into the required tokens. But for NT29, it's only 't53'. So, no. For NT46, it can't do anything except 't10', so it's incorrect to have 't25' after NT46.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with 't53', which is correct, but then the next token should be 't10', but it's 't25' instead.

I'll have to check each possibility.\n\nThe string to check is: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t96 t56 t79 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56.\n\nLet me break it down from left to right, matching each token to a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nStarting with the first token, t53.

Since the start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT46.\n\nSo the string has 17 tokens. Let's count the number of tokens produced by S. S->NT29 NT46. So each of these can be broken down further.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t53. Since t53 is a terminal, it must match one of the productions of a non-terminal. Looking at the rules, NT53 -> NT13 NT55. So perhaps we can derive t53 by expanding NT53, but wait, no, t53 is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014NT53 is a non-terminal, but in the rules, NT53 -> NT13 NT55, which are non-terminals, meaning when you replace NT53, you get two more non-terminals. But t53 is a terminal, so perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the non-terminal that can produce t53. But looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t53. Hmm, unless one of the non-terminals produces t53. Wait, but in the rules, I see that NT8 -> t4, NT49-> t94, etc. But I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t53. Wait, unless it's through another expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's look again. The rules for NT53 don't produce terminal; they produce NT13 NT55, which are both non-terminals. So t53 must come from a non-terminal that produces t53 directly. But looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal except 't...' tokens. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be matched by some non-terminal's terminal. So for each token in the string, I need to find a non-terminal that can produce it directly or through a series of expansions.\n\nBut looking at the rules, let's list out which non-terminals can generate which terminals:\n\n- NT8 -> t4\n- NT16 -> t38, t55\nWait, no: looking at the rules, NT16->NT38 NT55, which are non-terminals. So NT16 cannot directly produce a terminal. Wait, no, that's not right. The rules for each non-terminal either break down into more non-terminals or into terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT22 -> NT53 NT45, but NT53 itself can be broken down into NT13 NT55, which then can be further broken down, etc. But wait, let's see if any non-terminal can produce a terminal directly.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, many rules have right-hand sides with terminals. For example:\n\n- NT40 -> t80\n- NT85 -> t51 NT16, but that would expand into non-terminals again.\nWait, no: NT85 -> NT51 NT16, which are both non-terminals. So no terminal is generated directly by any non-terminal except where a rule includes a terminal.\n\nLooking back, let's go through the rules again.\n\nLooking for rules where a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT40 -> 't80' : So NT40 directly produces t80.\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16 (both non-terminals, so no terminal)\n- NT51 -> 't22' : So NT51 directly produces t22.\n- NT91 -> 't55' : So NT91 directly produces t55.\n- NT70 -> 't54' : So NT70 directly produces t54.\n- NT14 -> 't56' : So NT14 directly produces t56.\n\nSo these are directly producing terminals.\n\nSo, the tokens in the string need to correspond to these non-terminals expanding into their terminals, or through a series of non-terminals that eventually reach a terminal.\n\nSo, let's list all the terminals that non-terminals can produce directly:\n\nNT40: t80\n\nNT51: t22\n\nNT91: t55\n\nNT70: t54\n\nNT14: t56\n\nNow, the string is:\n\nt53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t96 t56 t79 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56\n\nLet me note that a few of these\u2014t53, t25, t31, t86, t4, t94, t96, t79, t35, t37, t56\u2014are either terminals or need to be generated by non-terminals.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought that NT53 is a non-terminal that isn't directly producing a terminal. Let's re-examine that.\n\nLooking back, in the rules:\n\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\n- NT13 -> NT31\n\n- NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, CNF is where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? Let me first understand the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the start symbol is S, and it directly produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. Both of these need to be expanded further.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't53' ('t' followed by a number, probably terminal symbols)\n- NT46 \u2192 't10' or other 't' terms. Wait, I see multiple entries for NT46. Let me check:\n\nWait, NT46 has \"\u2192 NT92 NT25\" and also \"\u2192 NT49 NT91\" and \"\u2192 NT31 NT46\". Wait, is that correct? Let me list all NT46's:\n\n1. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n2. NT46 -> NT49 NT91\n3. NT46 -> NT31 NT46\n\nWait, that might be a problem. Because in CNF, each production must have two non-terminals or a terminal. Having NT46 produce itself would lead to recursion. So, let me see if this is allowed in CNF. Since it's in CNF, it's okay, but it could complicate things.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a non-terminal A has a production A \u2192 B C, that's fine, but A \u2192 B A would have a terminal on one side and a non-terminal on the other, which is allowed but may cause infinite loops if not handled.\n\nIn this case, looking at the given string, which is a sequence of 't' terms. So maybe all the non-terminals in the string must be terminals. Let's check if all the NT symbols in the string are on the edge, meaning they either directly produce a terminal or eventually expand to one.\n\nLooking at the input string: t53 t25 t31 t31 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t21 t37 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation should replace all non-terminals to terminals. Given that, we can proceed step by step, reconstructing the parse tree to see if the string can be generated.\n\nWe can model this as a parsing problem, starting from S and seeing how it can expand into the string.\n\nSince S is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the string must be split into two parts: the expansion of NT29 and NT46, with their respective sequences concatenated.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 16 't' terms. The first part (NT29) would likely produce some of these terms, and NT46 the rest.\n\nSo let me break the string into two parts. Let's say the first k terms are from NT29 and the next (16 - k) are from NT46. But since both NT29 and NT46 can produce multiple terminals, we need to find if there's a split where each non-terminal produces exactly the respective part.\n\nLooking at NT29: it has a production \u2192 't53'. So NT29 can directly produce t53. Alternatively, if NT29 has more complex productions, we might get multiple terms.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT29 productions, only one production is given: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So NT29 directly expands to t53. So if the first term is t53, NT29 must produce that.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t53, so the first part is t53, then the rest must come from NT46.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is t25 t31 t31 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t21 t37 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions. Let's list all of NT46's productions:\n\n1. NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n2. NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n3. NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT46\n\nBut that third production (NT31 NT46) would mean NT46 can produce NT31 followed by itself, which could lead to infinite expansion unless it eventually terminates.\n\nLooking at the available NT31 productions:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49' or NT46. So NT31 can either be t49 or produce NT46 followed by NT31. Wait, wait: looking at the given grammar, under NT31, it's listed as:\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, under NT31, I see:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't8' (probably a typo based on context)\n- NT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nSo NT31 can produce either t8 or t49. Wait, but in the given list, under NT31:\n\n\"NT31 -> 't49'\"\n\nBut also, under NT31, is there any other production? Let me check:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of productions, each line is something like NT12 -> NT34 NT56 or NTn -> 't'nnn.\n\nLooking for NT31, here's what's given:\n\n- \"NT31 -> 't49'\"\n- \"NT25 -> 't73'\"\n- \"...\" etc.\n\nWait, no other productions for NT31.

So perhaps a typo.)\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, no, under NT46, in the grammar list, the lines are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT46 -> NT31 NT46\n\nBut the line \"NT46 -> 't10'\" seems to be duplicated.

{"custom_id":"request-257","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t71 t87 t18 t94 t96 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. It has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production can be broken down into these components.\n\nThe given grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT22, etc.), each of which can expand into two other non-terminals or a terminal. The string we're checking is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must correspond to the expansion of some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to construct a parse tree for the string, starting from the start symbol S. If I can successfully parse the entire string without getting stuck or mismatching, then the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S -> NT29 NT46. So, the start string must begin with NT29 followed by NT46. Let's check the string:\n\nThe string starts with t53, t25, etc. So, the first part is t53, which should come from NT29.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 -> 't53'. That's a direct production. So the first token t53 is correctly generated by NT29.\n\nNext, the second symbol in the production must be NT46. Let's see what NT46 expands to. Checking the grammar, NT46 has multiple productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> 't10'\nWait, but looking again, the provided grammar shows:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT46 -> 't10'? Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT46, the productions are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the grammar correctly. Let me list all NT46 productions:\n\nLooking back, it says:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT46 -> 't10' ?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the actual grammar provided:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT46 -> 't10'? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me see the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the last line for NT46 is 'NT46 -> 't10''. So I think NT46 has a production to 't10'. So from NT46, it can be a terminal 't10'.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a possible terminal production for NT46. So, in our case, after NT29 (t53), the next symbol is t25, which should come from NT46.\n\nBut NT46 has a production that's a terminal 't10', but in our string, it's t25. Wait, that suggests a problem. Because if NT46 can only produce 't10', and our string has t25 as the second symbol, that can't be. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread NT46's production. Let me check again. The grammar as provided is:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\nNT46 -> NT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, no, perhaps the fourth line is NT46 -> something else. Looking again, perhaps the line breaks are different. Let me recheck:\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\n\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nNT25 -> 't73'\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nNT14 -> 't56'\n\nNT91 -> 't55'\n\nNT70 -> 't54'\n\nNT51 -> 't40'\n\nNT45 -> 't37'\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nNT87 -> 't74'\n\nNT67 -> 't87'\n\nNT84 -> 't71'\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nNT22 -> 't96'\n\nNT92 -> 't25'\n\nNT87 -> 't35'\n\nNT38 -> 't94'\n\nNT55 -> 't80'\n\nNT87 -> 't79'\n\nNT46 -> 't55'\n\nNT49 -> 't86'\n\nNT70 -> 't34'\n\nNT84 -> 't36'\n\nNT13 -> 't31'\n\nNT25 -> 't21'\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Now, looking again, the NT46 has several productions, including 't10' as one of them. So, NT46 can produce 't10', but in the given string, after the initial t53, the next symbol is t25. That would mean NT46 needs to produce t25, but in the grammar, NT46 can produce 't10', which is a terminal, but not t25. So that would be a problem because the parser expects the second symbol, t25, to come from NT46, but NT46's only terminal production is 't10'.\n\nWait a second, so perhaps the start symbol's first production is incorrect?\n\nWait, the start symbol is S -> NT29 NT46. NT29 is a terminal, but let me check. Looking at NT29's production: NT29 -> 't53'. So S starts with 't53', which matches the string's first token. Then the second token is t25, which comes from NT46. But NT46 only produces 't10' and possibly more. Wait, looking again, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the productions for NT46.\n\nLooking again, the productions for NT46 are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT46 -> NT25 NT87\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, so NT46 can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal 't10'. So, if the string's second token is t25, then that must come from a production that produces t25. But none of the NT46's productions produce t25 as a terminal, only as a non-terminal in the RHS. So how does that work? Because in the grammar, NT46's productions either combine non-terminals or produce a terminal, but the terminal is 't10'. So, if after S, we have NT29 (which is t53), followed by NT46, which is supposed to produce t10, but the next token is t25, that's a mismatch. Because t10 is what's produced, but the string has t25.\n\nWait, that suggests that either the start symbol's production is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the parsing works. Wait, perhaps the second symbol in the string is t25, which would mean that the second part of the S production (NT46) must be parsed as t25. But how?\n\nLooking deeper, maybe after NT46, there's a different way to parse it.

{"custom_id":"request-256","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the grammar, every non-terminal seems to have exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for some which produce terminals. So, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT29 and NT46. \n\nLet me list out all the productions to see if there's a pattern or something I can track. Each NT (Non-terminal) has two other NTs as productions, except when they're replaced by terminals like 't8', 't46', etc. So, every non-terminal is a binary tree node that can have two children, eventually leading to a terminal string.\n\nNow, the given string is: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t71 t87 t22 t94 t31 t21 t37 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. To do that, I can parse the string and see if each non-terminal can generate the corresponding part of the string.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components: t53, t25, t31, t86, t4, t71, t87, t22, t94, t31, t21, t37, t56, t74, t55, t37, t56.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can think of each terminal as a leaf node, and the non-terminals as the internal nodes. So, to build the string, I would need to build a tree where each node's children are the next parts of the string according to the grammar.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. The string starts with t53. Looking at the grammar, where is t53 mentioned? Let me see the productions:\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see that NT22 produces t96, t53, t45, or t31. Wait, actually, NT22 has production NT22 \u2192 NT96, NT53, NT45, NT8? No, wait. Each line is A \u2192 B C. So:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\nSo, t53 would be under NT22, specifically via ND22 \u2192 NT53 NT45. Or, wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, let me list each NT and their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, NT92 NT31, NT25, NT45, NT8\nWait, no, each production is two NTs. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n3. NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n4. NT22 \u2192 NT25 NT45\n5. NT22 \u2192 NT13 NT56\nWait, wait. No, each line is A \u2192 B C, so:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT22 appears to have multiple productions:\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT22 \u2192 NT25 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT13 NT56\n\nSimilarly, NT25 has NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, etc. Each has two non-terminals on the right until some reach terminals.\n\nWait, some Nts already produce terminals, like NT8 \u2192 't4', NT29 \u2192 't53', NT46 \u2192 't10', etc.\n\nSo starting from S, it's NT29 and NT46, which produce 't53' and 't10', respectively.\n\nSo the string starts with t53 and t10. But the string given starts with t53, which matches NT29, then the next is t25. Let's see NT29's productions. Looking through the grammar, NT29 is not in any production except NT29 itself? Wait, no, the NTs are listed as:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT29 is mentioned as the left-hand side in some other rules. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT46. So NT22 is produced by NT29 and NT46, meaning NT29 must be on the left side as part of another production. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for NT29's productions: It appears in the production NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, does that mean NT29 is on the left side or the right? In the grammar, all productions are of the form A \u2192 B C, where A is a non-terminal on the left. So, for example, NT22 can be broken down into two other non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, according to the given grammar, which is a CNG, each production is A \u2192 B C, but B and C could themselves be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me double-check each production:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each line is a rule where a non-terminal (on the left) is replaced by two other symbols. Let me list them systematically:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n3. NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n4. NT22 \u2192 NT25 NT45\n5. NT22 \u2192 NT13 NT56\n6. NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n7. NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\nWait, wait, in the original list, lines after S are:\n\nNT22, NT22, NT46, etc. Let me write each as A \u2192 B C:\n\n8. NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n9. NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n10. NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\nWait, no, perhaps I should parse the list correctly. Let me list all the rules:\n\nLooking back: The user provided the grammar as a list of rules, each in the form A \u2192 B C, starting with S.\n\nThe rules are (as per the user input):\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n3. NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n4. NT22 -> NT25 NT45\n5. NT22 -> NT13 NT56\n6. NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n7. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n8. NT22 -> NT53 NT45 --> Wait, no, looking back, in the initial list, after S -> NT29 NT46 comes several lines. Let me list all NT rules:\n\nLooking back, after S, the other rules are:\n\n- NT22 has rules 2,3,4,5: so NT22\u2192 NT38 NT70, NT22\u2192 NT92 NT31, NT22\u2192 NT25 NT45, NT22\u2192 NT13 NT56.\n\n- NT25\u2192 NT22 NT14 (rule 6)\n- NT46\u2192 NT92 NT25 (rule 7)\n\nWhat about NT92? Checking the list, I see that NT92 is in rule 4 of the list: NT22\u2192 NT92 NT31.\n\nWait, no, looking at the original list, I think the rules for NT92 might be in another line, let's see:\n\nAfter NT46\u2192 NT92 NT25 (rule 7), then:\n\n- NT85\u2192 NT51 NT16 (rule ?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each NT and any rules associated with them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to notice that the grammar might have a certain structure, such as a binary tree with certain paths.\n\nBut perhaps I should try to parse the given string step by step.\n\nGiven the string: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t71 t87 t22 t94 t31 t21 t37 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56.\n\nI can write this as a sequence of terminals, and try to find a way to break it down according to the grammar.\n\nThe first part of the string is t53 followed by t25. Where is t53 derived from?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29\u2192't53' (from the user's input: NT29 \u2192 't53').

{"custom_id":"request-271","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. First, I'll take a deep breath and process the information I've been given.\n\nSo, the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string we need to check is a series of t followed by numbers: `t53 t25 t31 t73 t74 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t31 t80 t37 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nHmm, the first step is to understand the structure of the grammar. Let's look at the start symbol S, which directly goes to NT29 NT46. So, the string should be broken down into two parts: one starting with T (or a non-terminal) that eventually produces t53, and another with T that produces t25 and so on. Wait, but the string starts with t53, which is a terminal. Let me look at the productions.\n\nLooking at NT53 -> NT13 NT55 and NT51 -> NT40. Also, NT46 has a production to NT92 NT25 and others. Wait, but the string starts with t53. Since t53 is a terminal, it must come from a production that directly converts into it. Looking at the NT rules, I see NT29->t53 and NT55->t80, but t53 is only from NT53. Wait, looking at the production rules, I see NT53 -> NT13 NT55. Wait, but in the string, the first part is t53, which is a terminal, so that must be derived directly from NT53. Looking for where NT53 goes, I see NT53 -> NT13 NT55. But NT13 is a non-terminal. So that can't be t53 because NT13 isn't a terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT51 -> 't40', which is a terminal. Also, NT22 -> 't96', and other NTs have terminals. So, perhaps the starting point is S -> NT29 NT46. So, the string needs to be split into two parts: one derived from NT29 and the other from NT46.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t53, which must come from NT29. Let's check NT29's productions. The grammar doesn't list any for NT29 except it's being used in S. Wait, wait, wait: the user provided the grammar, and looking through it, I see:\n\nNT29 -> 't53' (since in the list, I see NT29 is converted to a terminal, I think. Let me double-check. Yes, looking again, in the productions, I see NT29 -> 't53', as the last line under NT rules. So, NT29 can be directly converted to t53. That matches the first token in the string, so that's a good start.\n\nNow, the second part of the grammar is NT46. The string after t53 has t25, t31, etc. So, let's look at NT46's productions. I see NT46 can go to NT92 NT25, or NT25 NT87, or NT22 NT53. Hmm, but t25 is a terminal. So, where does t25 come from? Looking at the grammar, I see NT25 is a non-terminal and can be converted to 't56' directly. Wait, no: looking at the list, NT46 -> 't25' is there, but I think I got it wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT25 has a production NT25 -> 't56'? No, wait. Looking at the grammar, under NT rules, I see NT25 -> 't73'. Let me check each line.\n\nLooking at the production list:\n\n- NT71 -> 't85' (line 14)\n- NT46 -> 't10' (line 45)\n- NT92 -> 't25' (line 52)\n- NT25 is used in multiple places: for example, NT22->NT53 NT45, NT22->NT92 NT31, etc., but looking for where NT25 is converted to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, the only terminal is when NT51 -> 't40', NT22 -> 't96', NT91->'t55', NT40->'t84', NT85->'t51', NT51->'t40', etc. It seems I might not have any NT that directly produces t25. Wait, but in the grammar, NT92 can produce 't25', as per line 92->'t25'.\n\nAh, right. So, for NT46, one of its productions is NT46->'t25' (line 46: NT46 -> 't25'), so that's a terminal. But in our case, NT46 is being derived into several parts. Wait, the initial S->NT29 NT46, so the string is two parts: one from NT29 and one from NT46.\n\nWait, no: the entire string is a single sequence of terminals, so it's one string that must result from fully expanding the S into terminals. So, S is NT29 NT46, so the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and NT46. So, the first part is t53, as NT29 gives t53. Then the remaining part is t25, t31, t73, t74, t4, t36, t87, t22, t94, t31, t80, t37, t56, t79, t55, t37, t56.\n\nWait, that's 18 tokens. Let me check how many tokens we have:\n\nAfter t53, the remaining tokens: t25, t31, t73, t74, t4, t36, t87, t22, t94, t31, t80, t37, t56, t79, t55, t37, t56. So, 17 tokens. Wait, that would make the entire string 18 tokens, which is from S being two symbols (each expanded into terminals). Wait, does that mean that the total number of tokens should be even? Because each production introduces two symbols, so each step either keeps the number the same or increases it by one. Initially, S is one symbol. Each expansion step can convert one non-terminal into two, increasing the count by one. So, starting with 1, after each step, it's either same or 1 more. So, in the end, the number of terminal tokens can be any number greater than or equal to 1.\n\nWait, but wait, in our string, we have 18 tokens. So, perhaps each non-terminal expansion doubles the tokens. Hmm, but the initial S is two non-terminals, so when fully expanded, each can produce a number of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps better to model it as a parse tree. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S is NT29 NT46.\n\nSo, the string starts with t53 (from NT29), then continues with NT46's expansion. So, we need to check if the rest of the string can be derived from NT46.\n\nLet's focus on NT46. Looking at its productions:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25 (line 46)\nNT46 can also be NT22 NT53 (line 52)\nOr NT22 NT14? Wait, looking back: line 49 says NT46 -> NT22 NT53 and line 86 says NT14 -> 't56'. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, the grammar has 40 production rules. Let's list relevant ones:\n\nNT46 has several productions:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT46 -> 't25' (line 46)\n- NT46 -> 't10' (line 45)\n- NT49 -> NT87 NT51 (line 87)\nWait, no. Let me go line by line:\n\nLooking for NT46 production:\n\n1. NT46 -> NT92 NT25 (line 46)\n2.

Let me check.)\n- NT31 \u2192 't8'\n- NT51 \u2192 't18'\n- NT87 \u2192 't79'\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT31 \u2192 't95'\n- NT46 \u2192 't61'\n- NT49 \u2192 't86'\n- NT70 \u2192 't34'\n- NT84 \u2192 't36'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT55 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, I think I saw conflicting entries for NT87. Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't74'\n- NT87 \u2192 't20'\n- NT87 \u2192 't79'\n\nThat's three different productions for NT87. Hmm, that might be an inconsistency. Let me verify each production line carefully.\n\nThe grammar provided includes:\n\n- NT87 -> 't74'\n- NT87 -> 't20'\n- NT87 -> 't79'\n\nThat's three different terminals. That's conflicting because a non-terminal can only expand to one symbol or one sequence (in CNF). So, this would be a problem because NT87 can't be a single non-terminal if it has multiple distinct terminals. It suggests that maybe one of these is a mistake, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo. Let me check the exact original list:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\n- NT87 -> 't74'\n- NT87 -> 't20'\n- NT87 -> 't79'\n\nYes, three separate productions. That can't be correct because in a proper CNF grammar, a non-terminal should only have one production. So perhaps one of these is incorrect, or perhaps it's intentional, meaning the grammar is wrong.\n\nBut assuming the user provided the correct grammar, perhaps it's intentional, but that seems wrong. Maybe the correct one is only one of them, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps some are redundant or derived from another production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parser should follow a certain order of production to pick one, but in reality, that would mean the grammar is ambiguous, and it's conflicting. In that case, it's unclear, but perhaps the correct expansion is the one that appears first or is somehow the correct one. But since I have conflicting information, I'll have to proceed with the information given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let's check each line:\n\nLooking through the grammar again:\n\nAfter NT46, which is broken down into NT92 NT25, and so on. Then NT87 appears as:\n\n- NT87 -> 't74'\n- NT87 -> 't20'\n- NT87 -> 't79'\n\nSo three different terminals. That's impossible, so I think there's a mistake in the original list, perhaps a duplicate, but the user provided this, so maybe I should proceed, perhaps ignoring the duplicates or choosing one. Alternatively, perhaps the actual grammar intended only one of these, but given that the user included three, perhaps it's a mistake, but I have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last line was supposed to be NT55 -> 't21' mistakenly written as NT87. But let's proceed, perhaps the correct one is the first, which is 't74' or another. It's unclear. So for now, I'll proceed with whatever the user provided, perhaps 't74' as the primary, or alternatively, perhaps this is a sign that the grammar is invalid, making the string ungrammatical.\n\nBut perhaps the user included this correctly, so maybe the NT87 can be expanded to any of these, but that would make the grammar have multiple possibilities, which could affect parsing. However, since it's a context-free grammar, it can't have multiple different productions for the same non-terminal. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct terminal is 't35' elsewhere? Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's correct, but I should note that as a potential problem, but perhaps continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in copying the grammar, so perhaps I should proceed assuming that it's correctly provided, perhaps the correct expansion for NT87 is one of the three, and perhaps the intended one is the first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a sign that the NT87 is supposed to expand to one of these. For the purpose of this problem, perhaps I should select the production that best fits into the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t25 t8 t56 t79 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56.\n\nWait, looking at the string, at some point it includes t79. So perhaps the NT87 is supposed to expand into t79. Therefore, perhaps the correct production for NT87 is 't79', which allows the parser to proceed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, if that's the case, then I'll proceed with that.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree by expanding the grammar step by step, seeing if the string can be derived.\n\nLet me approach this as a top-down parsing problem, starting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into the terminals in the string.\n\nSo, the first two tokens in the string are t53 and t25.\n\nLooking at NT29 \u2192 't53' (from the production NT29 \u2192 't53') and NT46 \u2192 't10' (from NT46 \u2192 't10'). But wait, the string starts with t53 t25. So NT29 would have to expand to t53, and NT46 would have to expand to t25. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nBut looking at NT46's productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 't80'\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT46 \u2192 't61'\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT46 \u2192 't25'\n\nWait, from the original grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't80'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT46 -> 't25'\n\nOh, yes, so NT46 can expand into any of these terminals: t80, t10, t61, t55, t25.\n\nSo when S is split into NT29 and NT46, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Others like NT31, NT14, etc., but also NT87, NT67, NT84, NT29, etc., are probably non-terminals because they can produce terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, it's getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to go step by step.\n\nNow, looking at the given string:\n\n`t53 t25 t31 t73 t74 t4 t71 t87 t22 t94 t31 t86 t55 t37 t56 t20 t55 t37 t56`\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, all t followed by numbers. Each non-terminal can produce either a terminal or another non-terminal, leading to another production.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation must be such that each step splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is of length 20, that suggests that the initial non-terminal S must produce a string of length 20. Let's recall that in CNF, each step increases the length by 1. So starting from S (which is a single non-terminal), each application of a production increases the length by 1 per non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe a better way is to try to parse the string into the given grammar.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to see if the string can be broken down as per the leftmost derivation.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look for a way to split the string into substrings that match the rules.\n\nLet's think about the grammar and the productions that lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminals, some non-terminals produce them:\n\nNT22 -> 't96'\n\nSo if a NT22 node in the parse tree has a production that leads to 't96', that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> 't73'\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nNT25 -> 't49'\n\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55, which eventually leads to 't38' and 't55', but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nLet me make a list of which non-terminals can produce each terminal:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- t4 comes from NT40 -> 't4'\n- t53 comes from NT29 -> 't53'\n- t25 comes from NT92 -> 't25' (production 30), or perhaps from other productions if possible.\n- t31 comes from NT31 -> 't49' (production 18), and if there's another production for NT31 that leads to a terminal, but from the provided list, I see NT31 -> 't49', which is a terminal.

The grammar and the string are a bit complex, so I need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. The grammar consists of a start symbol S and several production rules. Each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Since it's in CNF, that makes it easier because each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal, which means the parsing can be done with a recursive descent parser or similar methods.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t94 t34 t56 t20 t4 t71 t87 t22 t94 t94 t34 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, some of which are repeated. So, each symbol in the string is either a non-terminal that eventually produces that terminal or a terminal directly.\n\nMy approach should be to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the entire string step by step.

For example, NT22 has two rules: NT22 -> NT53 NT45 and NT22 -> NT92 NT31. This means that NT22 can be replaced by either of these two combinations.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 has two production rules: NT55 -> NT21 and NT55 -> NT49 NT91, but looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT55 is only in one production: NT55 -> NT49 NT91 and also another production? Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the list as given initially might have some duplicates. For example, NT55 -> NT49 NT91 and another rule for NT55. Wait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the initial problem statement:\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n...\nWait, I think in the initial list, under NT55, it's only one production: NT55 -> NT49 NT91. Then later, I see another NT55 -> 't21', which is a terminal production. So actually, NT55 has two production rules: the two non-terminals and the terminal.\n\nWait, no, in the given problem, the last entry is Nt55 -> 't21'. So yes, NT55 can produce either NT49 NT91 or 't21'.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 has two production rules: NT46 -> NT29 NT46 and NT46 -> 't10'\u2014no, wait, no, the initial list has NT46 -> NT92 NT25 and another NT46 -> 't10'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the initial list:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nAh, okay, so NT46 has two production rules: one to NT92 NT25 and another to 't10'. So it's two production rules.\n\nSo, the first step is to build a parse tree starting from S. Let's see what S produces: S -> NT29 NT46.\n\nSo, S is replaced by NT29 and NT46.\n\nNow, each of these (NT29 and NT46) will need to be replaced by their respective rules.\n\nLet me first handle NT29. Looking at the production rules, NT29 can only produce 't53', right?\n\nYes: NT29 -> 't53'\n\nSo, the first terminal symbol in the string is 't53', which matches the NT29 production. So that part is straightforward.\n\nNext, we have NT46. Looking at the production rules for NT46, there are two options:\n\n1. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n2. NT46 -> 't10'\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string after 't53' is 't25'. So, let's check if we can use the second production rule, which directly gives 't10'. But the string here is 't25', so 't10' doesn't match. Therefore, we need to use the first production rule, which requires replacing NT46 with NT92 and NT25.\n\nSo, S -> NT29 (which is 't53') followed by NT46 -> NT92 NT25.\n\nNow, the string after 't53' is 't25', so after 't53', we have NT92 and NT25. Let's process these.\n\nFirst, NT92: According to the production rules, NT92 can produce two things: NT25 and 't25'.\n\nLooking at the string, the next symbol is 't25', which matches the terminal production for NT92. So, NT92 -> 't25'.\n\nTherefore, now the parse tree is:\n\nS -> NT29 (t53) followed by NT92 (t25) and NT25.\n\nThe string so far processed: t53 t25\n\nNext in the string is t31. So, after 't25', we have NT25 left. Let's see how NT25 can produce t31.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT25, the options are:\n\n1. NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n2. NT25 -> 't73'\n3. NT25 -> 't56' (Wait, no, looking back, in the initial list, NT25 has production rules:\n\nNT25 -> NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-315","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. Okay, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's made up of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT22, etc.) is defined in terms of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals seem to be strings starting with 't' followed by numbers, and I notice that some non-terminals have these terminals as their right-hand side. For example, S -> NT29 NT46, which means S can produce any sequence where NT29 is followed by NT46.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t35 t37 t56 t20 t4 t36 t87 t18 t94 t21 t37 t56`.\n\nSo, my goal is to see if this string can be derived from the starting symbol S by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing because each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, my approach should be to start from the start symbol S and see if applying the productions can generate exactly the given string. I might need to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nBut wait, the string consists of a sequence of terminals. So each 't' followed by numbers is an atomic symbol. Let me list them out: t53, t25, t31, t31, t86, t4, t36, t87, t35, t37, t56, t20, t4, t36, t87, t18, t94, t21, t37, t56.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S. Looking at S's production: S -> NT29 NT46. So, the first symbols produced by S must be NT29 followed by NT46. Therefore, the string must start with whatever NT29 produces and then whatever NT46 produces.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t53. So, let's see which non-terminal produces t53. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n\nYes, so NT29 can directly produce t53. That matches the first symbol of the string.\n\nNext, after NT29 is NT46. So the second symbol should be whatever NT46 produces. Let's check the production for NT46:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n\nHmm, but the second symbol is t25, not t10. Wait, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, the string starts with t53, then t25. So, NT46 is supposed to produce t25, but according to the grammar, NT46 can produce either NT92 followed by NT25 or t10. So, to get t25 as the second symbol, NT46 must produce 't25' directly, which isn't one of the options. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no, actually, maybe I need to consider that NT46 could be a non-terminal that can produce another non-terminal on the right-hand side, which in turn produces the terminals. So perhaps I need to break it down further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Let me think. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So for NT46, I can try to see if it can produce t25 as part of a sequence.\n\nLooking at NT46's rules again:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT92 -> NT25 NT45\n\nNT45 -> 't37'\n\nWait, so if I expand NT46, it would produce NT92 followed by NT25. Then, NT92 expands to NT25 and NT45, which then becomes 't37'. So, combining these, NT46 would produce NT25 followed by t37.\n\nBut that's assuming I expand all the way down. Wait, but in the string, the second symbol is t25, not t37. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking up NT46's production. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT46:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, so NT46 can produce 't10' directly. But the string's second symbol is t25, which would require NT46 to produce 't25'. But I don't see that as a terminal. Wait, does any non-terminal produce t25?\n\nLooking through the terminals, yes, NT25 produces 't55'? Wait, wait. Let me check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t25. Let's see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\n- NT25 -> 't55'?\n\nWait no, let me scan all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, 't25' comes up as:\n\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, Hmm, I'm looking for which non-terminals produce t25, but it seems none. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I confused NT with something else. Let me go through each rule where the RHS is 'a':\n\n- NT51 -> 't40'\n\n- NT40 -> 't84'\n\nWait, no, looking through all the rules, it seems that the only terminals are those in the rules. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nt53, t25, t31, t31, t86, t4, t36, t87, t35, t37, t56, t20, t4, t36, t87, t18, t94, t21, t37, t56.\n\nAre any of these non-terminals that produce 't25'? Looking at NT25's production:\n\nNT25 -> 't55'\n\nSo NT25 can produce t55, not t25. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong rule.\n\nWait, looking at NT38's production: NT38 -> 't94'\n\nSo 't94' is there.\n\nWait, looking for t25: does any non-terminal produce t25? Let me see:\n\nLooking through all the 'a' in the rules, t53, t25, t31, t31, t86, t4, etc.\n\nLooking at NT46 -> t10?\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't25' except perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, here's a list of 'a's:\n\n- NT22 -> 't96'?\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, NT is followed by NT or 'a'. For example, NT40 -> 't84'; NT49 -> 't86'; etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, NT22 -> 't96' \u2014 no, that's not a terminal, it's part of a production.\n\nWait, no, the RHS of NT22 is NT38 and NT70, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking at NT46's production, it's only 't10' as a single production, so that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe string starts with t53, which matches NT29 -> 't53'. So, S produces NT29 and NT46. The string starts with t53, which is from NT29, so that's good. Now, what does NT46 produce? Looking at the productions:\n\nNT46 can produce 't10' directly. So if the second symbol is 't10', that's fine. But in our case, the second symbol is t25, not t10. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. That's a problem. Because according to the grammar, NT46 can either be 't10' or two non-terminals. So for the second symbol to be t25, there's no rule in the grammar that allows NT46 to produce t25 directly. So that would make it impossible for the string to be generated."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-319","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t74 t4 t36 t87 t18 t94 t86 t4 t71 t87 t18 t94 t80 t37 t56`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol S. Alternatively, some rules might just produce a terminal immediately. In this case, looking at the grammar provided, most rules on the left (like S, NT22, etc.) produce two other non-terminals, except some like NT40 and NT51 which produce a single terminal (e.g., 't80', 't22'). So the string must be a sequence of terminals expanded from the non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar uses only non-terminals on the left side of the productions and terminals as the terminals, each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal that appears on the right side of some production.\n\nI notice that the string has 21 symbols, so the derivation must result in 20 productions, each expanding one non-terminal into two, making the length double each time, but here it's a specific sequence. Alternatively, I can approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, checking if each terminal in the string can be derived step by step from the start symbol.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols in the string: t53, t25, t31, t96, t56, t74, t4, t36, t87, t18, t94, t86, t4, t71, t87, t18, t94, t80, t37, t56. \n\nI'll start from the beginning and try to match the string by expanding the non-terminals.\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string starts with NT29 and NT46. Looking at the string, the first two terms should be the results of NT29 and NT46.\n\nLooking at NT29's production in the grammar: NT29 \u2192 't53'. So the first terminal should be t53, which matches the first element of the string.\n\nNext, NT46. From the grammar, NT46 is defined as NT25 and NT91. Let's look at NT46's production: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25. But wait, according to the provided grammar, the line is \"NT46 -> NT92 NT25\". Wait, that can't be because looking back, I think I might have mixed up the productions.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar again. The user provided:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nWait, but I thought NT46 had another production, like NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT94 in the beginning, but no, looking again, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nWait, that's only one production for NT46. Earlier in the user's input, there were several entries for NT46:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n- NT46 -> NT25 NT45\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25 (Wait, this might be a typo. Let me re-examine the user's grammar input.\n\nWait, the user's grammar has:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT25 NT45\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25 (again?)\n\nWait, perhaps it's a duplication. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nBut then:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, does NT46 have multiple productions? Let me scan the entire grammar:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar lines:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT46\n\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\n- NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\n- NT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\n- NT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n- NT46 -> NT25 NT45\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nWait, so there are three productions for NT46:\n\n1. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n2. NT46 -> NT25 NT45\n\n3. NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nSo NT46 can produce either [NT92, NT25] or [NT25, NT45].\n\nNow, back to the string parsing.\n\nAfter NT29 (t53), we have NT46. Since S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the next part is NT46, which should be expanded into what?\n\nLooking at the first production for NT46: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25.\n\nSo if we take the first production, NT46 becomes NT92 and NT25. So the next two terminals should be from NT92 and NT25.\n\nLooking at the string after t53, the next is t25. Wait, but according to the first production, it's NT92 and NT25. So NT92 should produce a terminal, and NT25 should produce a terminal.\n\nLooking for NT92 in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n\n- NT92 appears in the production NT71 -> NT40 NT85, etc. Wait, wait, let me check all NT rules.\n\nLooking for NT92, the grammar has:\n\n- I don't see NT92 in the rules, except in the production NT29 -> 't53'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to scan through all non-terminals to see where they resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar includes all the possible productions, but some non-terminals may derive into more non-terminals until it reaches terminals.\n\nLet me try to list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1.

Some, like NT40 and NT51, directly produce terminals ('t' followed by numbers). \n\nThe string to check is: t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t74 t4 t80 t18 t94 t86 t4 t80 t18 t94 t96 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t53 and ends with t56. Looking at the grammar, the starting symbol S seems to generate NT22 and NT46, so S -> NT22 NT46.\n\nLet me break down the string by looking at each terminal and seeing if it matches any production rule that results in a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT40: NT40 -> NT84 NT67, and NT84 -> 't71', NT67 -> 't87'. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT22 has a production that sometimes terminates with 't96', etc. Hmm, maybe I should start from S.\n\nS is NT22 and NT46. So the string must be a sequence of symbols derived from NT22 and NT46.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by breaking it down.\n\n1. t53: Looking at the grammar, NT29 -> 't53'. So NT29 must derive t53. So maybe somewhere in the derivation, NT29 is used.\n\n2. t25: NT25 -> 't73' in one case, but looking further, NT13 -> 't31', but maybe other NT25 productions don't produce t25. Wait, in the grammar, NT25's production is NT22 -> NT13 NT55 and NT22 -> NT92 NT31. So NT22 can produce t13 and t55, but how does that lead to t25?\n\nWait, maybe I should look for NT22 in the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT22: NT22 -> NT53 NT45, NT22 -> NT92 NT31, NT22 -> NT25 NT45.\n\nWait, NT22 is a non-terminal, and from the grammar, it's NT22 -> NT53 NT45 or NT92 NT31 or NT25 NT45. Let me see which of these produce t25 or t92.\n\nLooking at NT53: NT53 -> NT13 NT55, and NT13 -> 't31'. So if NT53 is used, it can produce t31. But I'm looking for t25.\n\nWait, maybe I should find a path where a non-terminal leads to t25. Looking at NT46: NT46 -> NT92 NT25, and NT92 -> 't25'. So NT46 can produce t25 through NT92.\n\nWait, no. Let me see: NT46's production is NT46 -> NT92 NT25 or other ways? Wait, looking back at the grammar, NT46 has multiple productions. Wait, in the given grammar, for NT46, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25 and NT46 -> 't10'. Also, NT46 -> NT87 NT67 and NT46 -> 't55'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, let me reindex:\n\n- S -> NT22 NT46\n\n- NT22 has multiple productions, including NT22 -> NT53 NT45, NT22 -> NT92 NT31, NT22-> NT25 NT45\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT46's productions are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was NT46 -> NT87 NT67, but no, in the given grammar, NT46's productions are:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n\nSo, for NT46, the possible terminal symbols are 't10' and 't55' because look:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't4' ... Wait, let me check:\n\nNo, wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT46: 't10' and 't55'\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT46 has 't10' and 't55' as terminals:\n\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n\n- NT46 -> 't55'\n\nSo NT46 can directly produce 't10' or 't55'. \n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't53', so that doesn't come directly from NT46 unless there's some other rule.\n\nWait, perhaps S is NT22 and NT46. So the string starts with t53, which must come from NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\nNT22 can produce NT53 NT45, NT92 NT31, or NT25 NT45.\n\nLooking for 't53' in NT22's derivatives, since t53 is a terminal, so we need to find if any of the rules for NT22 can produce 't53' directly or through further substitutions.\n\nLooking at NT22's possible rules:\n\n- For NT22 -> NT53 NT45, so this would produce two non-terminals until they are resolved. Then perhaps NT53 could derive a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT53: NT53 -> NT13 NT55.\n\nNT13 -> 't31' and NT55 -> 't80'.\n\nWait, so NT53 would produce NT13 and NT55, which directly produce 't31' and 't80'. Therefore, NT53 can directly produce 't31' and 't80', but 't53' is supposed to come directly from somewhere.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there a rule where NT53 produces 't53'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see an NT53 rule that produces a terminal for 't53'. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me list out all the NTs and their productions.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT22 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45 | NT92 NT31 | NT25 NT45\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14 | NT92 NT31\n\nNT14 -> 't56'\n\nNT92 -> 't25'\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nNT14 -> 't56' (duplicate, probably)\n\nNT70 ... etc.\n\nWait, so for NT22, the production NT25 -> 't56'?\n\nWait, looking at NT14: NT14 -> 't56', yes.\n\nBut when looking at NT25's production, it's NT25 -> NT22 NT14, so to derive 't56', NT14 must produce 't56', so that could be a path through NT25.\n\nBut in our case, the first token is 't53', which is not directly a production from any non-terminal except maybe NT53's production.\n\nWait, NT53's production is NT53 -> NT13 NT55, right?\n\nAnd then NT13-> 't31' and NT55-> 't80', so NT53 produces 't31' and 't80' when both are expanded.\n\nBut the string starts with 't53'. Wait, does any NT produce 't53'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, does any non-terminal directly produce 't53'? I don't see any. So how can the first symbol in the string be 't53' if there's no production that leads to 't53'?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo, but assuming the grammar is correct, I need to find a way.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the NT22's productions. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, perhaps the NT52 was rewritten differently, but the user provided a specific set of NT22 productions.\n\nWait, no, looking again at the given grammar:\n\nNT22 rules:\n\n1."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing, and the parsing tree has a specific structure.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production is S -> NT29 NT46. So, the first step is to see what NT29 and NT46 produce, and so on, until I get down to the terminals. The string starts with `t53`, which I notice appears in a few NT productions. For example, NT53 -> NT13 NT55. Wait, but I also see NT29 -> 't53', so that's a direct terminal. Hmm, but in the string, the first term is t53, so that would come from NT29, which means NT29 must be the first part of the parse.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Starting from S, which becomes NT29 NT46. So the first two tokens in the parse should be t53 and t4 (from NT46 -> 't4'), but wait, looking at the string, the first two tokens are t53 and t25. Wait, this doesn't match. Oh, no, that can't be. Because S -> NT29 NT46, so the first two tokens should be whatever NT29 and NT46 produce. \n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t53. So NT29 must produce t53. Looking at NT29's productions: NT29 -> 't53' directly. So that's correct. Then what about the second part? The next token is t25, which should be the output of NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions: There are several, like NT46 -> 't46'?

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is a set of production rules for non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals or into terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number). My task is to see if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT46. That means the first step is to expand S into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. So, I'll split the string into parts that correspond to these two non-terminals.\n\nThe entire string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, so let's parse it as a list: [\"t53\", \"t25\", \"t31\", \"t73\", \"t74\", \"t4\", \"t80\", \"t22\", \"t94\", \"t31\", \"t31\", \"t80\", \"t37\", \"t56\", \"t74\", \"t55\", \"t37\", \"t56\", \"t74\", \"t55\", \"t37\", \"t56\"]\n\nNow, S -> NT29 NT46. So, the first part is NT29, and the second is NT46. Each of these non-terminals will expand into sequences of terminal tokens. Let's take them one by one.\n\nStarting with NT29:\nNT29 appears in the grammar as NT29 -> 't53'.\nWait, looking through the rules, yes, NT29 is 't53'. So that's straightforward. So NT29 in the string corresponds to \"t53\".\n\nNext, NT46 in the grammar has multiple productions.

{"custom_id":"request-350","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar seems a bit complex with a bunch of production rules, and the string I have to evaluate is quite long. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit this form because each non-terminal on the left side of the rules expands into two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the derivation starts with NT29 and NT46. Each of these will need to be expanded following their respective rules until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t73 t79 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t96 t56 t20 t4 t80 t18 t94 t73 t74 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nWait, the string is separated by spaces, so each t followed by a number is a terminal symbol. Non-terminals are probably represented by sequences of NT and numbers, like NT29, NT46, etc.\n\nNow, I think the strategy here is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a top-down parsing approach, specifically the CYK algorithm, but maybe a more straightforward approach would be to see if the string can be constructed by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a tree, starting from S and trying to build the string by expanding non-terminals until I match all the terminals in the given order.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and see their production rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, NT49 NT91, etc.\nWait, no, looking back, actually all the NT rules only have two non-terminals on the right. For example, NT22 is defined as \u2192 NT38 NT70. Wait, but in CNF, each production can only have one non-terminal on the left. So each production is either a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo the first step is to write down all the non-terminals and their production rules. Let me list them:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n3. NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, NT49 NT91, etc. Wait, no, looking at the rules, it seems that NT25 has multiple rules. Wait, no, all rules are the same, so for example, NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14, another NT25 \u2192 NT49 NT91? Or maybe each NT has a single production rule with two parts. Wait, I think there's a mistake here. Wait, no, looking back, the rules are all of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has multiple rules for each NT. For example, NT22 has two rules: NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 and NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 and another NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the provided grammar, for example, the first few lines are:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nWait, but then later lines like:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nWait, that suggests that each of these is a separate production rule for NT22. So each NT can have multiple production rules. That complicates things because now, during parsing, each non-terminal can be expanded in multiple ways, and we have to consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user provided the grammar, and I have to determine if the given string is generated by it. So perhaps the best way is to create a parsing tree where I break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string has 21 symbols (t followed by numbers). Since S \u2192 NT29 NT46, each of these must expand into a substring of the given string. Wait, the order matters because the production is ordered. So first, NT29 must generate a substring that starts at the beginning, and NT46 must generate the rest.\n\nWait, but since the string is a flat list of terminals, the order must be preserved. So perhaps I can model this as the start symbol S generates exactly the string, with each symbol in the string corresponding to the terminals in the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can think recursively. Starting from S, S generates NT29 followed by NT46. So the string must start with whatever NT29 produces, followed by whatever NT46 produces.\n\nSo let's see. NT29 \u2192 't53', because looking at the rules, for NT29, I think one of the rules is NT29 \u2192 NT22 NT46, which then would expand to more non-terminals. Wait, wait, actually, from the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking back, for NT29:\n\nI think one of the rules is NT29 \u2192 NT22 NT31. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, let me look again. The rules are given as:\n\n- NT29 is defined as per the provided lines. Looking at each line, some start with NT29, NT25, etc. But it's a bit tricky because some are productions and others are assignments.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each NT and their production rules:\n\nWait, I see lines like:\n\n- NT29: NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70, but perhaps more importantly, I need to list all production rules for each NT.\n\nWait, let me parse the provided grammar:\n\n1.

Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the grammar into its components. The top-level symbol is S, which is derived into NT29 NT46. So, the string we're checking should start with \"t53\" because NT29 is \"t53\" based on the productions. That matches the start of the string.\n\nNext, the second part after NT29 is NT46. Looking up NT46, it has multiple productions: one is NT92 NT25. Let me see which path to take. I'll choose the first one to keep going.\n\nNow, NT92 leads to NT25 (from NT92 -> NT25) and NT82 -> 't80' but that's not the case here. Wait, NT92's productions include NT25 and also a lead to 't25'. So NT92 can be directly 't25' or transition to NT25.\n\nTaking 't25' next, which is fine because the next part of the string is \"t25\".\n\nNow, the second part is NT25, which has productions like NT22, NT45, etc. Let's see the options:\n\n- NT22 leads to 't96' or 't37' or something else? Wait, looking back, I think NT22 -> NT53, but Wait: Looking at the grammar, NT22 has several productions, but looking for the specific part here. NT22 can produce 't96' if that's one of its options. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT22 -> 't96' in the production NT22 -> 't96'. So, actually, each production can end with a terminal unless it's part of a longer derivation.\n\nWait, no, NT22's productions are:\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nAlso, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't96', but that seems like a single terminal. Wait, wait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes, there are lines like NT22 -> 't96', so it can produce 't96' directly.\n\nSo, taking 't96' as the second output. But wait, the next token in the string is \"t31\". Wait, no: let me step back.\n\nWait, the string after \"t53 t25\" is \"t31 t86 t4 t71 t87 t18 t94 t73 t20 t4 t71 t87 t40 t94 t86 t4 t36 t87 t35 t37 t56\".\n\nSo after NT25, which is \"t25\", the next part is \"t31\".\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, NT25 can produce 't73' directly. So NT25 is \"t73\", but the next token is \"t31\". Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nLet me backtrack. After NT25, we have the options:\n\nNT25 can produce 't73' directly or go through other productions.\n\nIf I take 't73' first, then the next token is \"t31\", which doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps NT25 is NT29 NT46 again.\n\nWait, no, let me think differently. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's start over.\n\nThe string begins with \"t53 t25\". NT29 is \"t53\", so that's good. NT46 comes next, which is \"t25\". Now, the next part is NT25, but wait, in the grammar, NT25 can produce 't73' directly. But the string after \"t25\" is \"t31\", so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing NT25.

Start with S -> NT29 NT46.\n   - So the string starts with \"t53\" (NT29) and \"t25\" (NT46). So the first four tokens are \"t53 t25\", matching the start.\n\n2. Now, the next symbol is NT46, which has productions like NT92 and NT25, etc.\n\nLooking back: NT46 has options like \"t10\", \"t25\", \"t46\", etc. Wait, actually, from the grammar, NT46 has productions like NT22 -> 't46'? No, let's check:\n\nActually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't46'? No, the options are:\n\nLooking for where NT46 is on the left side. For example, I see NT46 -> 't4'?

{"custom_id":"request-369","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by breaking this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. The goal is to see if the string `t53 t25 t31 t73 t20 t4 t80 t18 t94 t31 t73 t20 t4 t80 t22 t94 t80 t37 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which initially expands to NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with the expansions of NT29 and NT46. Let me check the grammar for how NT29 and NT46 are defined.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\nNT29 -> 't53' (since in the rules, NT29 appears on the left in a production that results in a terminal, so it's directly 't53'.\nSimilarly, NT46 has multiple productions, but one of them is NT46 -> 't10'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the second token is t25. Let me see the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT22 has a production NT22 -> NT53 NT45, among others. Also, NT25 -> 't73'.\n\nBut looking back, the initial S is NT29 NT46. So, the initial expansion is t53 (from NT29) and then NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions, one of them is NT46 -> 't10', another is NT46 -> 't55'. In the string, the next token after t53 is t25. So, that's not matching. Hmm, so perhaps I need to see if NT46 can derive t25 somehow.\n\nLooking at NT46, let's see all its productions:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT25 NT31\n\nNT46 -> NT49 NT87\n\nNT46 -> NT14 NT46\n\nNT46 -> NT87 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT31 NT16\n\nNT46 -> NT55 NT55\n\nOther NT46 -> 't10'\n\nWait, but none of these directly produce 't25'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I need to consider if there's a way that NT46 can expand into t25 through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the overall approach: parse the string from left to right, checking each part against the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if all the terminals in the string can be derived from the grammar's terminals and non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me list the entire string: t53 t25 t31 t73 t20 t4 t80 t18 t94 t31 t73 t20 t4 t80 t22 t94 t80 t37 t56 t74 t55 t37 t56.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe initial expansion is S = NT29 NT46. So, the first symbol must be from NT29, which expands to 't53', the next symbol from NT46.\n\nWait, according to the grammar, NT29 -> 't53', so the first token is 't53', which matches the string.\n\nNext, the second token is t25. So, we need to see if NT46 can yield 't25' as the second token.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, let's see what NT46 can expand into. The possible two-symbol expansions for NT46 include:\n\n- NT92 NT25\n- NT25 NT31\n- NT49 NT87\n- NT14 NT46\n- NT87 NT55\n- NT31 NT16\n- NT55 NT55\n- and the terminal 't10'\n\nSo, from NT46, if I choose the production NT46 -> NT25 NT31, then the second symbol would be NT25, which can expand to 't73'. But the second token in the string is 't25', not 't73'. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps another path. Maybe using the production NT46 -> NT92 NT25, which would mean the second symbol is NT92, which then needs to expand into 't25'. Let me check how NT92 is defined.\n\nLooking for NT92 in the grammar, I see NT92 occurs in a production: NT92 appears as part of NT46 -> NT92 NT25, but also as a production under NT92:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't see a production for NT92 except as part of another production. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar as provided has:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nSo, NT92 is a non-terminal, but it doesn't have any productions listed except as part of other rules. That would mean that NT92 might be a dead end unless it's a terminal. But in the provided rules, is NT92 a terminal or a non-terminal?\n\nWait, the grammar only shows productions where NT92 appears on the left. So, in the given rules, NT92 is a non-terminal with no productions, which would make it a symbol that can't be expanded further. But in the string, we have t25 as the second symbol, which suggests that NT25 must expand to t25. So, perhaps there's a rule for NT25 -> 't73' or something else.\n\nWait, looking back, yes, the grammar says NT25 -> 't73'. So, perhaps NT25 expands directly to t73. That makes sense.\n\nBut in the case of NT46 expanding to NT92 NT25, the second token would be the expansion of NT92, which can't be done unless NT92 is a terminal. But if NT92 is a non-terminal with no expansion, then that production path is blocked.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to explore other possibilities.\n\nWait, another production for NT46 is NT46 -> NT55 NT55. So, that would produce two t55's. But in the string, after t53, the next is t25, which doesn't fit t55, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the second token is t25. So, perhaps the NT46 needs to expand into t25 as the second symbol somehow. Let me think if any production for NT46 produces a terminal followed by another terminal.\n\nWait, in the initial productions, I don't see any two-terminals for NT46. All NT46 productions after the first element are two non-terminals, except one that goes to 't10'.\n\nSo, if NT46 must expand to 't10', but in the string, the second symbol is 't25', that doesn't match. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in choosing the initial productions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to re-examine the possible paths. Maybe through different expansions.\n\nLet me outline the string step by step, trying to map each token to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, NT29 must expand to 't53', which matches the first token. So that's fine.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t25, which must be the expansion of NT46\u2019s second element. So, looking at NT46, which can expand to various non-terminals, we need one where the second expansion is 't25'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25: So the second element is NT25, which can expand to 't73'. But in the string, the second token is 't25', which would require NT25 to be 't25'. But according to the grammar, NT25 \u2192 't73'. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Maybe I need to consider the order. NT46 could expand into non-terminals first, and then those non-terminals could expand further.\n\nSo, for example, if NT46 is reduced to NT25 NT31, then the next step would be to expand NT25 to 't73' and NT31 to 't94'. But that would lead to 't73 t94', which isn't what we have. Alternatively, is there a way for NT46 to produce 't25' as a terminal directly?\n\nLooking at NT46's productions again, none of the two-symbol expansions result in the second symbol being 't25', except if NT25 is a terminal. But in the grammar, NT25 is defined as 't73"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-395","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t53 t25 t31 t25 t95 t56 t79 t4 t80 t22 t94 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t94 t54 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, I notice that some rules have terminals, like `NT8 -> 't4'`. So this might complicate things a bit because I'm not sure if every rule is in CNF. Wait, no, in CNF, any production can have one or two non-terminals. Wait, actually, I think in standard CNF, productions have exactly two non-terminals, but maybe the given grammar allows for one non-terminal (since some rules may produce a terminal and a non-terminal). Hmm, perhaps I should check that.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT46: this is two non-terminals, which is fine.\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70: again two non-terminals.\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14: two non-terminals.\n- NT91 -> NT8 NT71: two.\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91: two.\n- NT71 -> NT40 NT85: two.\n- NT40 -> NT84 NT67: two.\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16: two.\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55: two.\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25: two; but wait, here NT46 is connected to NT92 and NT25, which are both non-terminals. So all the rules seem to have two non-terminals except maybe some terminals.\n\nWait, no, I see that some rules produce a terminal. For example, `NT8 -> 't4'`, which is a terminal, so this seems like mixed. That might not be strictly CNF, but perhaps the user provided it as is, which might have some rules with terminals. But for the purposes of this problem, I should proceed, perhaps assuming that all the way down, the terminals are the end symbols.\n\nNow, the challenge is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe approach I'm thinking is to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, perhaps I can use a recursive descent parser or the CYK algorithm, but manually simulating this could be time-consuming given the length of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree or see if the string can be broken down step by step according to the rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t53 t25 t31 t25 t95 t56 t79 t4 t80 t22 t94 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t94 t54 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure, perhaps I can start by identifying the top-level production. The start symbol is S, which is `NT22 NT46` according to the grammar (S -> NT22 NT46). Wait, actually, looking at the first rule, it's S -> NT29 NT46, but that's conflicting because earlier I thought S is NT22 NT46. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nThe first production is S -> NT29 NT46.\n\nBut later, looking at the rules, I see NT22 is another non-terminal, but it's not clear which one is the actual start symbol. Wait, in the given grammar, all the rules are for NT symbols, and S is the starting symbol. So S is NT22 NT46? Or is it NT29 NT46? Wait, no. The first production is S -> NT29 NT46. So S is the start symbol, and it goes to NT29 and NT46.\n\nBut let's double-check: NT29 is defined as `-> 't53'`, and NT46 as `-> 't10'`. So S -> NT29 NT46 would produce the terminals 't53' and 't10', making the initial symbol generate 't53 t10'. But our string starts with 't53', followed by 't25', etc. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I've confused the productions. Let me re-express the grammar rules as per the user's input:\n\nThe grammar has the following productions:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT46\n- NT22 -> NT38 NT70\n- NT25 -> NT22 NT14\n- NT91 -> NT8 NT71\n- NT55 -> NT49 NT91\n- NT71 -> NT40 NT85\n- NT40 -> NT84 NT67\n- NT85 -> NT51 NT16\n- NT53 -> NT13 NT55\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT22 -> NT53 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT92 NT31\n- NT49 -> NT25 NT87\n- NT16 -> NT38 NT55\n- NT40 -> 't80'\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n- NT31 -> 't49'\n- NT14 -> 't56'\n- NT91 -> 't55'\n- NT70 -> 't54'\n- NT85 -> 't35'\n- NT38 -> 't94'\n- NT55 -> 't80'\n- NT87 -> 't74'\n- NT67 -> 't87'\n- NT84 -> 't71'\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n- NT22 -> 't96'\n- NT92 -> 't25'\n- NT86 -> 't56'\n- NT70 -> 't34'\n- NT84 -> 't36'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, now I realize that some rules produce terminals, like `NT40 -> 't80'`, `NT51 -> 't22'`, etc. But looking at other rules, like `NT25 -> NT22 NT14` and others that don't produce terminals.\n\nSo, each time a non-terminal produces a terminal, it's an atomic step, but other times, it's a step where two non-terminals expand further.\n\nBut given the string, the first symbol is 't53'. Let me see where 't53' comes from. Looking at the rules, 't53' is a terminal, produced by NT29. So the first step would be NT29 -> 't53'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't53', which comes from NT29. Then, the next token is 't25', which must come from the other part of S's production. So S is NT29 NT46, so the second part is NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions: in the initial list, there's `NT46 -> NT92 NT25`, but also `NT46 -> 't10'`. Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, looking again: in the provided grammar, for NT46, it's defined as `NT46 -> NT92 NT25` and also `NT46 -> 't10'`?

But since I'm not familiar with implementing CYK right now, maybe I can approach it another way.\n\nLet me see the productions again:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71\n- NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91\n- NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n- NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n- NT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n- NT40 \u2192 't80'\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't73'\n- NT31 \u2192 't49'\n- NT14 \u2192 't56'\n- NT91 \u2192 't55'\n- NT70 \u2192 't54'\n- NT51 \u2192 't40'\n- NT45 \u2192 't37'\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n- NT46 \u2192 't10'\n- NT87 \u2192 't74'\n- NT67 \u2192 't87'\n- NT84 \u2192 't71'\n- NT29 \u2192 't53'\n- NT22 \u2192 't96'\n- NT92 \u2192 't25'\n- NT85 \u2192 't35'\n- NT38 \u2192 't94'\n- NT55 \u2192 't80'\n- NT87 \u2192 't20'\n- NT31 \u2192 't8'\n- NT51 \u2192 't18'\n- NT87 \u2192 't79'\n- NT46 \u2192 't55'\n- NT31 \u2192 't95'\n- NT46 \u2192 't61'\n- NT49 \u2192 't86'\n- NT70 \u2192 't34'\n- NT84 \u2192 't36'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT55 \u2192 't21'\n\nWow, that's a lot. So some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT22 might produce certain terminals depending on the production.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to see if we can break down the string step by step, checking if each part can be matched by a production.\n\nLooking at the string: `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t40 t...' etc.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The first word is 't53'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n\nSo, 't53' is the terminal output of NT53, which means NT53 must derive into 't53'. To do that, NT53 must expand into NT13 and NT55, which then each derive into their respective terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, but NT53 is a non-terminal and needs to be part of the derivation. So starting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nLet's see what the first part 't53' corresponds to. Since nt53 \u2192 't53' is not present, but according to the given grammar, looking at productions for nt53:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n\nSo NT53 must derive into NT13 and NT55. Then, each of those must derive into specific things. So to have 't53', NT53 must first be expanded to NT13 NT55.\n\nSo, the first token is 't53' which comes from NT53, which is expanded into NT13 and NT55. Now, what do NT13 and NT55 produce?\n\nLooking at NT13: The only production is NT13 \u2192 NT31. So NT13 must expand into NT31.\n\nThen, NT31 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at NT31:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT49\n- NT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, or is it? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\nNT31 has entries:\n- NT31 \u2192 NT49\n- NT31 \u2192 't49'\n- Also, NT31 \u2192 't95' ??? Wait, let me check the original grammar.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55\n- NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67\n- NT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So the given grammar can help me derive the string by expanding symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be reduced back to the start symbol S by applying the inverse of the grammar's productions. That is, starting from S and seeing if we can replace non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals in a way that results in the string.\n\nLet me look at the string:\n\nt53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t31 t94 t54 t56 t20 t4 t80 t40 t94 t86 t55 t37 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56\n\nThat's 24 tokens, so I need to break it down into the non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by noting that each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that must correspond to the derivation steps.\n\nLet me see if I can parse the string from left to right, replacing non-terminals with their possible replacements.\n\nLooking for the first symbol, t53. Checking the grammar, I see NT29 \u2192 t53. So t53 can be derived from NT29.\n\nSo NT29 would be the first non-terminal, followed by the rest. Let me check what NT29 can produce. Wait, in the grammar, NT29 is on the left side of the production NT29 \u2192 t53, but looking further, I see that NT29 is also in other productions? Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT29 on the left except for NT29 \u2192 t53. So NT29 can only produce t53. So in the string, the first token is t53, so the string must start with NT29.\n\nSo now, I can replace NT29 with t53, and the rest of the string is t25 t31 ... etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT29 is only defined as t53. So I can't replace NT29 with anything else, only t53.\n\nSo after replacing NT29 with t53, the next part of the string is 't25 t31 ...'.\n\nNow looking at t25, I check the grammar. NT25 can be derived from NT22 and NT14, or from NT49 and NT87. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT25 -> NT49 NT87\n\nWait, no, let me check again. Wait, the grammar seems to have multiple entries. For example, NT25's productions are listed as:\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT25 -> NT49 NT87\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking carefully, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\nNT49 -> 't86'\nNT70 -> 't34'\nNT84 -> 't36'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT55 -> 't21'\n\nWait, that's a lot. So for NT25, the productions are:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14\nNT25 \u2192 NT49 NT87\n\nLooking at each of these, I see that NT25 can become either NT22 NT14 or NT49 NT87.\n\nLooking at the string after t25: the next token is t31. Let's see if t31 is an option.\n\nWait, in the string after replacing t53 with NT29, we have t25 t31..., so the next part is t31.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT31: one production is NT31 \u2192 t49. So t31 is derived from NT31, which in turn is NT31 \u2192 t49. So t31 can be replaced with t49.\n\nSo right after t25, t31 becomes t49. So now, the string has:\n\nt25 \u2192 NT25, then t31 \u2192 t49.\n\nBut wait, the original string is t25, t31, ..., so after replacing t31 with t49, I can see how the rest might fit.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to start building the parse tree from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t53. As I noted, that's from NT29.\n\nSo NT29 \u2192 t53.\n\nThen, the next part is t25. Looking at NT25's productions: NT25 can produce NT22 NT14 or NT49 NT87.\n\nIn the string, after t25, the next tokens are t31.\n\nIs there a way to derive t31 from one of these options?\n\nLet me check what can be produced after NT25.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\nNT22 can produce NT38 NT70 or other things like 't96' (from NT22 \u2192 't96').\n\nSimilarly, NT14 produces 't56' directly.\n\nBut in our string, after t25 (NT25), the next token is t31, which needs to be produced by NT31, which is a terminal 't49' (from NT31 \u2192 t49). Wait, no, in the grammar, NT31 \u2192 't49'? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49'\n\nYes, so NT31 can produce t49. So in the string, the third token is t31, which is 't31' as a terminal. Wait, no, wait: the third token is t31. But in the grammar, NT31 can produce 't49', but can it also produce 't31'? Wait, no, that can't be.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar for NT31 is listed as:\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nWait, so NT31 can only produce 't49', not 't31'. Oh, so there's a conflict here. The string has 't31' but according to the grammar, NT31 can't produce 't31'; it only produces 't49'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's 't31 t86 ...', so the third token is 't31'. But according to the grammar, NT31 can only be 't49'. Which means that the third token 't31' can't be derived from NT31.

In the grammar, NT31 \u2192 't31'? Or is there a mistake in the list provided? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't49' \u2014 according to the list above, line NT31 \u2192 't31' \u2014 wait, no. The line says 'NT31 -> 't49''. Wait, no, in the grammar, it's written correctly as:\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nBut in the initial provided list, under NT31, it's written: NT31 -> 't49'. So the third token is t31, which doesn't match any production's terminal. But according to the grammar, NT31 can produce 't49' or 't8'? Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong lines.\n\nWait, here's the exact part:\n\nNT31 -> 't8' \u2014 no, checking the user's grammar:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT31 -> 't31' \u2014 no, actually, line says NT31-> 't49'?\n\nWait, in the user's input, under NT31, the production is:\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nBut the string has a token t31. So that's a problem. Wait, but that suggests that the third token should be 't49', but the string has 't31'.\n\nWait, hold on, looking back at the user's production:\n\nWait, in the user's data, in the 'NT31' line: It says 'NT31 -> 't49''. But in the string to check, the third token is 't31'. So that would mean that the third token 't31' doesn't match any terminal production in the grammar, except for NT31, which is supposed to produce 't49'.\n\nWait, that seems like a contradiction. So, either I'm interpreting something wrong, or perhaps the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, let me check the other lines again. Maybe I missed NT31's production.\n\nLooking through the user's grammar data:\n\nThe part is:\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nSo yes, only 't49' is the terminal for NT31. So in the string, the third token is 't31', which is not equal to 't49'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated, because it's a dead end.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps. Because in the grammar, there are other non-terminals that can produce 't31', but perhaps I'm not considering it correctly.\n\nWait, let me walk through the breakdown step by step again.\n\nAfter generating 't53 t25' from NT29 and NT46, the next token is 't31'. But according to the grammar, NT31 can only produce 't49'. Therefore, the third token should be 't49', not 't31'. This already indicates that the string can't be generated because the third token doesn't match any production's terminal.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed a production where NT31 produces 't31'. Let me check again:\n\nIn the user's grammar, looking for NT31:\n\nNT31 -> 't31'? No, the user's list says 'NT31 -> 't49''. So no. Therefore, the string has a token that doesn't match any production's terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let me re-examine the entire string step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t18 t94 t31 t80 t37 t56 t79 t4 t80 t22 t94 t73 t20 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56`\n\nSo, the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which gives 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have the special symbol \u03b5 (epsilon) which represents the empty string. However, looking at the provided grammar, the start symbol is S, and it's rewritten as NT29 NT46. \n\nThe string to analyze is `t53 t25 t31 t94 t54 t56 t20 t4 t80 t22 t94 t94 t54 t56 t74 t4 t36 t87 t18 t94 t96 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56`.

Let me create a list where each non-terminal has all its production rules:\n\n- S: NT29, NT46\n- NT22: produce NT38,70 or NT53,45 or NT92,31\n- NT25: produce NT22,14 or NT49,87 or NT92,55\n- NT31: produce NT94,16 (but wait, no, let me check. From the given, NT31's only production is in rule 31 and again in 30: NT31->t8 and another rule which says NT31->t8? Wait, let me look again. \n\nLooking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT31 is in rules 30 and 31:\n\n30. NT31 -> 't95'\n\n31. NT31 -> 't8'\n\nSo NT31 can produce either 't95' or 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, NT46 appears in multiple production rules:\n\nFrom rules 10,29,34,36: NT46 can be NT92 and NT25, or NT31 and NT46 (wait, no, rule 10: NT46 -> NT92, NT25. Rule 36: NT46 -> t61. Wait no, rule 36 says NT46 -> 't61'. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait no, rule 10 is NT46 -> NT92 NT25, rule 29 is NT46 -> NT31, etc. So NT46 can be split into two non-terminals depending on the production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list all non-terminals with their possible productions:\n\n- S: NT29, NT46\n\n- NT22: NT38,70; NT53,45; NT92,31\n\n- NT25: NT22,14; NT49,87; NT92,55\n\n- NT31: 't95'; 't8' (because rules 30 and 31: wait, rule31 seems to be NT31->t8, but looking at the original list:\n\nIn the given grammar, NT31 has two productions: NT31->t95 (rule30) and NT31->t8 (rule 31). Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar as given lists:\n\nNT31 -> 't95' (rule30)\n\nand NT31 -> 't8' (rule31). Wait, but that's conflicting. How can a non-terminal produce two different terminal symbols? Because in a context-free grammar, a non-terminal can produce either of its alternatives, but both leading to terminal might be the same, but here, NT31 can produce 't95' or 't8', which are different. So perhaps both are valid. So yes, NT31 can output either 't95' or 't8'.\n\nWait no, in the given grammar, rule30 says NT31-> t95 and rule31 says NT31->t8. So in fact, the non-terminal NT31 can generate either 't95' or 't8'. So the production NT31 can expand to either t8 or t95.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals:\n\nNow, proceeding to see each step.\n\nThe string provided has the following tokens:\n\nt53, t25, t31, t94, t54, t56, t20, t4, t80, t22, t94, t94, t54, t56, t74, t4, t36, t87, t18, t94, t96, t56, t79, t55, t37, t56.\n\nWe need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by using the productions.\n\nGiven the process is top-down or bottom-up, and the grammar is in CNF, the parsing can be done using the CYK algorithm, but given that the string is quite long, perhaps instead I can attempt to parse it step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: try to build the parse tree by starting from S and seeing if we can derive the string.\n\nBut that's going to be complicated manually. Perhaps a better approach is to see if each of the string's elements can be traced back via the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps reconstructing the parse tree is time-consuming, so maybe a better approach is to see for each symbol in the string where it can come from.\n\nEach symbol, whether a terminal or non-terminal, has a specific origin.\n\nThe left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which here is S (as the start).\n\nSo, all 't...' are terminals, and the others are non-terminals.\n\nThe string to parse is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if each terminal can be derived by some production.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, symbol by symbol.\n\nFirst, the entire string is: t53 t25 t31 t94 t54 t56 t20 t4 t80 t22 t94 t94 t54 t56 t74 t4 t36 t87 t18 t94 t96 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56.\n\nIt's 30 tokens.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. I see that the start symbol is S, and from S, we have S -> NT29 NT46. This means S can only be derived into NT29 and NT46 connected by a space (since the rule doesn't have a terminal, I guess it's just the combination of the two non-terminals, but I should check the rules for NT29 and NT46 to see if they produce terminals.\n\nLooking at each production rule, I see that many of them are followed by 't' and a number, which I assume is a terminal symbol. So each NT rule may expand into two non-terminals or a combination until we reach a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given is: `t53 t25 t31 t73 t74 t4 t80 t22 t94 t96 t56 t74 t4 t80 t18 t94 t96 t56 t20 t4 t80 t18 t94 t21 t37 t56`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens! I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards, starting from the given string and trying to reduce it using the productions. This is similar to the CYK algorithm for CFG parsing.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order: t53, t25, t31, t73, t74, t4, t80, t22, t94, t96, t56, t74, t4, t80, t18, t94, t96, t56, t20, t4, t80, t18, t94, t21, t37, t56.\n\nHmm, that's 25 tokens. Since S -> NT29 NT46, which are two non-terminals, the entire string must consist of exactly two parts derived from NT29 and NT46. So, I should check if the string can be split into two parts, each of which can be derived from NT29 and NT46 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, if the string is too short or can't be split into two, the answer would be No. But 25 tokens seem a bit long, so maybe NT29 and NT46 can expand into multiple tokens each.\n\nI need to see what NT29 and NT46 can derive.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT29 -> NT53 NT25 (from the grammar) as per the line: NT29 -> NT53 NT25, right?

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is: `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t80 t18 t94 t31 t73 t20 t4 t71 t87 t40 t94 t94 t54 t56 t79 t55 t37 t56 t20 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions either expand into a non-terminal or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT29 NT46.\n\nSo, the string starts with t53, t25, etc. Since the string is in terms of terminals separated by spaces, each space represents a token, so each 't...' is a terminal symbol, and the NT... are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the non-terminals expand into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT29 \u2192 t53, and NT25 \u2192 t73. So, each non-terminal eventually resolves to a terminal string.\n\nTo check the string, I can try to parse it using the grammar, maybe as a top-down or bottom-up approach. But since the grammar is CNF, a recursive descent parser might be suitable, although I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is already a sequence of terminals, I can check if each non-terminal can generate that sequence.\n\nThe first symbol is t53. Looking at the grammar, NT29 \u2192 t53, so NT29 must derive t53. So, the first part must be NT29.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is t25. Looking at NT22's productions, NT22 can go to NT53 (which is t53) and NT45 (t37), or NT92 and NT31, which are t25 and t8, respectively. Hmm, let's see. Let me map out all the non-terminals and their productions to terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT46\n- NT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70 (which is t94 and t54)\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14 (so t53 and t56)\n- NT91 \u2192 NT8 NT71 (t4 and t71)\n- NT55 \u2192 NT49 NT91 (t80 and t4)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85 (t38 and t35)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT84 NT67 (t71 and t87)\n- NT85 \u2192 NT51 NT16 (t31 and t94)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT13 NT55 (t31 and t80)\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 (t25 and t73)\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 (t31 and t37)\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31 (t25 and t8)\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87 (t73 and t74)\n- NT16 \u2192 NT38 NT55 (t94 and t80)\n- NT40 \u2192 t84 (t71)\n- NT51 \u2192 t40 (so t80)\n- NT25 \u2192 t73 (so it's either a production to NT25\u2192 t73 or other)\nWait, looking back, some entries like NT51 \u2192 t40, which is t80. So NT51 is directly a terminal.\n\nWait, I think I need to correct my approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, for the string, each part should correspond to a step where the non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, each of which must also expand, until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 ... etc. But actually, the first symbol is t53, which comes from NT29. So, the first non-terminal must be NT29, which is the left-hand side of the S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nNow, let's see. S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string must start with the expansion of NT29 followed by the expansion of NT46.\n\nNT29 \u2192 t53. So the first symbol is t53, which is correct.\n\nNow, NT46 can be broken down. Looking at the grammar, NT46 has several productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 t84 NT87\n- NT46 \u2192 t71\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT46 has multiple options. Let's find which of these can produce t25 as the next symbol.\n\nWait, the second symbol is t25, so after t53 (from NT29), the next part is t25, which comes from NT46 as part of one of its productions.\n\nSo, looking at NT46's productions, which can derive a string that starts with t25.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25: so NT92 and NT25. But NT25 \u2192 t73. So NT46 would produce t73, but the next symbol is t25, so this can't be the case because NT25 \u2192 t73, which is t73, not t25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, let's clarify: the entire string is a concatenation of the terminals generated from the non-terminals. So, for S \u2192 NT29 NT46, the string starts with NT29 expanded and then NT46 expanded.\n\nNT29 is a non-terminal that produces 't53' directly, so the first symbol is t53. Then NT46 must produce a string that starts with t25, as the second symbol is t25.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions, let's see:\n\nNT46 can produce:\n\n1. NT92 NT25: which would be NT92 followed by NT25. NT25 \u2192 t73, so the next symbol after NT92 is t73, but in the string, it's t25. So this path won't work.\n\n2. NT22 NT14: NT22 can go to t53 and t56 (from NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, but NT53 is t53, NT45 is t37, which is 37, but that's not the case). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, earlier I might have made a mistake. Let's re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the grammar:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14: So if NT25 expands, NT22 can expand into certain options, but NT14 \u2192 t56.\n\nWait, so when NT25 is expanded, if it goes to NT22 NT14, then NT22 needs to produce something, and NT14 is t56. But the next symbol is t25, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps another option for NT46.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25: as above, not matching.\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14: then, NT22 could produce a terminal or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nWe have the string starting with t53 t25. So S \u2192 NT29 NT46, which must expand to t53 followed by whatever NT46 produces.\n\nNT46's options:\n\n1. NT92 NT25: NT92 can expand to t25, and NT25 can expand to t73. So the production would be t25 t73. But the second symbol is t25, so that would require t25 followed by t73, but the string starts with t53 followed by t25. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, no, wait: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 would produce t25 (from NT92 \u2192 t25) followed by t73 (from NT25 \u2192 t73), making the entire string t25 t73. But the string starts with t25, so that's not the case. So perhaps not.\n\n2. NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT14: NT22 \u2192 various, and NT14 \u2192 t56. So the second part would be whatever"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-435","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes rules easier to handle.\n\nThe given string is: `t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t25 t95 t56 t20 t4 t71 t87 t40 t94 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t86 t55 t37 t56`\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT46. So, S -> NT29 NT46. That means the string should be a concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT46.\n\nLet me see: the first part should come from NT29 and the second from NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t53. Let's see what NT29 can produce. From the grammar, NT29 -> 't53' according to the rule NT29 -> 't53'. So that's matched.\n\nSo after NT29, we move to NT46. The next tokens should be part of NT46's expansion.\n\nWait, no, after S -> NT29 NT46, the string should be NT29 followed by NT46. So the string is a list of terminals that should be the result of expanding NT29, then expanding NT46, and concatenating them.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nT1: t53 (from NT29 => t53)\nT2: t25\nT3: t31\nT4: t86\nT5: t4\nT6: t36\nT7: t87\nT8: t40\nT9: t94\nT10: t25\nT11: t95\nT12: t56\nT13: t20\nT14: t4\nT15: t71\nT16: t87\nT17: t40\nT18: t94\nT19: t86\nT20: t4\nT21: t80\nT22: t22\nT23: t94\nT24: t86\nT25: t55\nT26: t37\nT27: t56\n\nNow, from NT29, it directly expands to t53, so that's the first token. So now, the remaining tokens (from t25 onwards) should come from NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46's productions in the grammar: NT46 can expand in several ways. For instance, NT46 -> NT92 NT25, or NT46 -> 't10', or others, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me make this clearer. The start is S -> NT29 NT46, so the string starts with NT29 (which gives t53) and then NT46.\n\nSo the remaining part of the string is T2 to T27, starting from t25, t31, etc., which should all be part of NT46's expansion.\n\nLet me write out what NT46 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT46 has several productions:\n- NT46 -> NT92 NT25\n- NT46 -> 't10'\n- NT46 -> NT85 NT16\n- NT46 -> NT49 NT87\n- NT46 -> NT71 NT40\n- NT46 -> NT31 NT45\n- NT46 -> NT31 NT55\n- NT46 -> NT46 (wait, is that a rule? No, looking again, it seems I might have misread. Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking back, grammar rules are only for non-terminals. The string includes several expansions, like NT46 -> 't10', which is a terminal. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the rules are defined as:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nWait, actually, I realize that some non-terminals, like NT46, have multiple productions, some are terminal and some are compound. So, perhaps I need to track how to expand NT46 into the given terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string starts after t53 with t25, which is the first token after NT46. So let's see: after t53, the next is t25, which could be NT46 expanding to 't10', but t25 is not 't10'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me start fresh.\n\nThe string is: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t25 t95 t56 t20 t4 t71 t87 t40 t94 t86 t4 t80 t22 t94 t86 t55 t37 t56\n\nS produces NT29 NT46. NT29 -> t53, so the first token is t53, which matches. Now, the next token is t25, which is the start of NT46's expansion.\n\nSo let's see: NT46 can expand to several options. Let's list all the possible NT46 productions:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT46 -> NT85 NT16\nNT46 -> NT49 NT87\nNT46 -> NT71 NT40\nNT46 -> NT31 NT45\nNT46 -> NT31 NT55\nNT46 -> NT46 (Wait, I might have missed this earlier.

So any string derived from this grammar should start with tokens from NT29 and NT46. The string given starts with t53, t25, t31, etc. I'll need to check if these tokens can be directly derived from the grammar or if they can be broken down into the correct non-terminals.\n\nI think I'll approach this by parsing the string step by step, starting from the beginning and trying to match the productions. Each step will involve reducing symbols on the string until I either reach the start symbol S or determine it's impossible.\n\nLet's look at the string: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t31 t73 t79 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t21 t37 t56 t79 t4 t80 t22 t94 t80 t37 t56.\n\nBreaking it down, the first token is t53, which in the grammar corresponds to NT29 \u2192 't53' as per the production NT29 -> 't53'. So the first part is straightforward: NT29 is replaced by t53.\n\nNext, after t53 is t25, which I think comes from NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT25, but looking at the grammar, NT25 has a production NT25 \u2192 't73', right? Wait, no. Looking at the productions, NT25 can go to 't73' or other non-terminals, but in the initial step, perhaps NT29 is followed by NT46.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the string starts with NT29 followed by NT46, which should produce t53 followed by something. So after t53, the next token should come from NT46.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT46 has several productions: some are other NTs, but notably, NT46 \u2192 't10' is there. So perhaps the second token after t53 is t10, but in the given string, it's t25. Hmm, maybe I need to step back.\n\nWait, looking more closely, the grammar for NT25 is NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14 or other options, but also NT25 \u2192 't73' which is when it's directly a terminal. So perhaps after NT29 (t53), NT46 is another non-terminal, and looking at the string, the second token is t25.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t53 it's t25, not t10. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider how the string is parsed. Since S is NT29 NT46, so the string should begin with t from NT29, which is t53, followed by t from NT46.\n\nLooking at NT46, one of its productions is NT46 \u2192 't10', but there's also a production NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25. So perhaps NT46 can produce t10 directly, or it can go through other non-terminals.\n\nIn the string, the second token is t25, which suggests that after t53, maybe NT46 produces t25, but looking at NT46's productions, I don't see a production that directly gives t25. The possible options are NT92 and NT25 as two separate non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT46 can be broken down into NT92 and NT25. So after t53, NT46 can be split into NT92 and NT25. Then, each of those can be further broken down.\n\nSo let's try this approach:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string starts with t53 (from NT29) and then follows with NT46.\n\nSince NT46 is now a non-terminal, we need to derive it. The production for NT46 includes 't10', but that's only one of the options. Looking at the grammar, NT46 can also be NT92 NT25. So perhaps NT46 \u2192 NT92 followed by NT25.\n\nSo the string after t53 is now followed by NT92 and NT25. Therefore, the next token should be t from NT92, then the following token from NT25.\n\nLooking at the string, the next token after t53 is t25. So that doesn't fit because NT92, if it produces a terminal, is one of its productions: NT92 \u2192 't25'. So perhaps the second token after t53 is 't25' from NT92.\n\nSo that would mean that the production for NT46 is 't25' via NT92 \u2192 't25' and NT25 is perhaps another non-terminal, but wait, we have NT25 in the grammar, and it has several options, including 't73' or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe string is: t53 t25 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t31 t73 t79 t4 t36 t87 t40 t94 t21 t37 t56 t79 t4 t80 t22 t94 t80 t37 t56.\n\nLet me number the tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t53\n\n2. t25\n\n3. t31\n\n4. t86\n\n5. t4\n\n6. t36\n\n7. t87\n\n8. t22\n\n9. t94\n\n10. t31\n\n11. t73\n\n12. t79\n\n13. t4\n\n14. t36\n\n15. t87\n\n16. t40\n\n17. t94\n\n18. t21\n\n19. t37\n\n20. t56\n\n21. t79\n\n22. t4\n\n23. t80\n\n24. t22\n\n25. t94\n\n26. t80\n\n27. t37\n\n28. t56\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT46.\n\nToken 1: t53 (from NT29 \u2192 t53). That's correct.\n\nNow, NT46 needs to be derived, and the next token is t25, which is from NT92 \u2192 t25 because one of NT46's productions is NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, which could then produce t25. But wait, if NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, then the next tokens should be the results of deriving NT92 followed by NT25.\n\nLooking at the string, after t53 is t25. Wait, but if NT46 \u2192 t25 via NT92, then the first token after t53 should be from NT92, but in the string, it's t25, not from NT92.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46, so the string is [NT29] [NT46]. NT29 \u2192 t53, so the first token is t53. Now NT46 can produce either 't10' or split into NT92 NT25.\n\nIf NT46 \u2192 't10', then the second token would be t10, but in the string it's t25. So that can't be the case. Therefore, NT46 must be split into NT92 and NT25. So NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25.\n\nNow, we have the string starting with t53, then NT92 NT25. But wait, NT92 can produce t25 directly, so that would mean that after t53 comes t25 from NT92, but wait, in that case, after t53, the next token is t25, which is correct if NT92 produces t25. So that would consume the t25 as the second token.\n\nBut then what comes after?

{"custom_id":"request-448","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and I've got a specific string to evaluate. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has productions where every non-terminal symbol (on the left side) expands into exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right, except for the base case where a non-terminal can produce a single terminal symbol. Wait, actually, in CNF, every production must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the provided grammar, most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, except for a few, like NT8 -> 't4', which is a terminal. So that's consistent with CNF since each production is either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t31 t31 t86 t55 t37 t56 t20 t4 t80 t40 t94 t94 t34 t56 t20 t55 t37 t56 t74 t4 t71 t87 t35 t37 t56`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, but that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step by tracking the non-terminals that can derive each part of the string, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's start by looking at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29, which in turn produces NT46 and NT29. So S -> NT46 NT29.\n\nWait, no, the production is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So S produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46. So any valid derivation from S must first split into these two.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't53'. Let's see which rule produces 't53'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't53' in the production rules: I see several. For example, NT29 -> 't53', NT46-> 't55', but others... Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking for 't53' as a production. Looking through the right-hand sides:\n\nNT29: 't53', yes. NT22: 't96', NT92: 't25', NT85: 't74', etc. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I don't see 't53' except in NT29 and another NT29. Wait, the user said the grammar has:\n\nNT29 -> 't53', yes. So 't53' is the production from NT29.\n\nSimilarly, elsewhere, like NT71: 't87', etc.\n\nSo the first token is 't53', which must come from NT29. So let's see, in the grammar, NT29's productions are:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nThat's the only production for NT29. So the first part of the string is 't53', which is produced by NT29.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT46. Now, the next part of the string is 't25', which is the second symbol. Let's see what's producing 't25'. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT46: 't10', but wait, let's check more carefully.\n\nLooking for 't25', I see:\n\nIn the grammar: NT46-> 't54'? No, wait, let's see:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe rules for NT25: 't73' (from earlier). NT92: 't25'. NT22: 't96', 't25' via NT22. Wait no, NT22 has rules like NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, etc.\n\nWait, actually, the string starts with 't53 t25'. So 't25' is the second token. Which non-terminal can produce 't25'? Looking through the production rules:\n\nNT46: Not seeing it. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for RHS that has 't25':\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45, but 't25' comes from NT22 perhaps indirectly. Wait, wait, let's find the direct productions that generate terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, 't25' is the production for NT92 (because NT92 \u2192 't25') and NT22 \u2192 't96', so that's not 't25'. Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's list all the production rules for each NT:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT25 \u2192 NT73\n- NT25 \u2192 NT22 NT14?

Similarly, NT87 -> 't74', etc.\n\nSo, for 't25', the only direct production is NT92 \u2192 't25'.\n\nWait, but from the grammar, NT22 can produce 't96' and 't25' via NT22 \u2192 NT49 NT31 or another path. But in the provided grammar, looking for 't25' as a terminal production: it's only produced by NT92 \u2192 't25'.\n\nWait no, looking at all the grammar's RHS where a terminal appears:\n\nLet me go through each line:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46: so S's production is two non-terminals. Not our primary concern since the string starts with 't53'.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT38 NT70: no terminals here; only non-terminals.\n\nNT25 \u2192 ...

The grammar's right-hand sides for non-terminals can only produce two terminals or another non-terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can build a parse tree bottom-up or top-down. Probably, using the CYK algorithm might be the safest, but since I'm a bit rusty, maybe I can do a simpler approach by checking if the string can be derived by tracing through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT46.

Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, let's list all the rules and see which ones produce terminals:\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT46\nSo S's left side produces two non-terminals.\n\n2. NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45: Do these produce terminals? Looking at the rules, perhaps not. Wait, but under NT22, there's another production: NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45 and another rule? Let me see the exact grammar.\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules, I think many of them produce other NTs. The only direct terminals are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't38'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't8' 't4'? Wait, no, NT40's production is 'NT40 \u2192 NT85 NT55', which are non-terminals. Wait, no terminals under NT40?\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't38'\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT85 NT55 (non-terminal), so no terminals.\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT53 \u2192 NT22 NT55 (but NT22 may produce terminals)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.

So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check whether the given string is in the language defined by this grammar. Hmm, I remember Chomsky normal form has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t80 t18 t94 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t25 t95 t56 t79 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t86 t55 t37 t56`.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's a bunch of rules where each non-terminal on the left side can be replaced by a combination of other non-terminals or maybe a terminal. The terminals are like 't8', 't4', etc., and the non-terminals are strings like S, NT22, NT25, etc.\n\nI should probably try to parse the string backward because with CNF, using the CYK algorithm might be a good approach. But since I'm not too familiar with the exact steps, I'll try to see if each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't53'. Let me see which production rules produce 't53'. Scanning through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> 't53'\n- NT46 -> 't55' (but that's not 't53')\n- NT13 -> 't31' (not relevant here)\nWait, no, I see NT29 is 't53'. So, 't53' comes from NT29, which is itself derived from S\u2192NT29 NT46. So, to have 't53' at the beginning, the first production should be S\u2192NT29 NT46, and then each of these NTs produce the following tokens.\n\nSo, the first part after NT29 is 't25', 't31', 't96', etc. But wait, NT29 is 't53', and then I need to have a production that can split into two parts, perhaps. Let me think step by step.\n\nWait, no, the string is a single string, so S must produce this entire string. So, S must expand into a sequence that, when you parse it, results in the string. Let's break down the string:\n\nThe string starts with t53. So, that comes from NT29. Then, what comes next, t25? Let me see what rules produce t25. Looking back, I see:\n\n- NT92 \u2192 't25'? Wait, no, let me check the grammar lines.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT92 NT31\n- NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87\n- NT22 \u2192 others\nWait, looking at NT71 \u2192 NT40 NT85\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each non-terminal and what it produces.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to trace the possible derivation.\n\nStarting with 't53', that's NT29. So, S \u2192 NT29 NT46, meaning the entire string must be NT29's expansion followed by NT46's expansion.\n\nSo, the string after t53 is 't25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t80 t18 t94 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t25 t95 t56 t79 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t86 t55 t37 t56'.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because S is NT29 followed by NT46. So the entire string must be the expansion of NT29 followed by the expansion of NT46.\n\nSo, the first part, 't53 t25 t31 t96 t56 t79 t4 t80 t18 t94 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t25 t95 t56', should correspond to NT29, and then the second part should correspond to NT46.\n\nWait, that can't be because 't25 t25...' would be a long string, but the string is divided in two. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a single string, so S produces it directly, so S must expand into the entire string through a series of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to look for sequences of terminals that can be generated by each non-terminal.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt53, t25, t31, t96, t56, t79, t4, t80, t18, t94, t86, t4, t36, t87, t22, t94, t25, t95, t56, t79, t4, t36, t87, t22, t94, t86, t55, t37, t56.\n\nHmm, that's 31 tokens. Let me see if they can be grouped appropriately.\n\nI know that Chomsky normal form has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string starts with 't53', that's from NT29, which is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So the entire string must be NT29's expansion followed by NT46's expansion.\n\nSo the first part (from t53) must be the expansion of NT29, and the second part must be the expansion of NT46.\n\nNow, let's see what NT29 can produce. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't53' (from the given rules). Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking again at the user's rules, I see:\n\nWait, the user listed the grammar as:\n\nS->NT29 NT46\nNT22->NT38 NT70\nNT25->NT22 NT14\nNT91->NT8 NT71\nNT55->NT49 NT91\nNT71->NT40 NT85\nNT40->NT84 NT67\nNT85->NT51 NT16\nNT53->NT13 NT55\nNT46->NT92 NT25\n...\nWait, I'm sorry, this is getting too confusing. Let me see, perhaps the key is to note that each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals. Since the string is a series of terminals, all non-terminals must have been expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for possible paths that can generate the string. Let's try to identify which non-terminals correspond to which parts of the string.\n\nWait, I know that NT22 can produce 't96' or 't31' (from the rules: NT22\u2192NT53 NT45 and NT22\u2192NT92 NT31). Looking at the string, after 't53' comes 't25'... Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the string is a concatenation of terminals, each corresponding to a non-terminal expansion. So, the whole string is a sequence of terminals, meaning that each step must consume two non-terminals into one terminal or a pair.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should try to split the string into possible pairs that could come from the productions.\n\nWait, if the string is long, and each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, then the length of the string (number of terminals) must be equal to the number of steps taken in the derivation. But since the string has 31 terminals, the number of steps would be 30, meaning the string must be generated by a rightmost derivation that starts with S (which generates two non-terminals) and then each step combines two into one.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the string as a series of steps where each step combines two non-terminals into a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe I can approach this more methodically. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t53, which comes from NT29. So the first pair is NT29, which must be produced by S. S is NT29 followed by NT46.\n\nSo after t53, the next part of the string is t25, t31, etc., but wait, perhaps that's not right. Maybe after NT29 is expanded, then NT46 is expanded, which is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should write down the entire string as per the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of productions. Each non-terminal (like S, NT22, etc.) can be replaced by other symbols. The terminals are the strings starting with 't', like 't54', 't22', etc. The string I need to check is a sequence of these terminals: `t53 t25 t31 t31 t21 t37 t56 t20 t4 t80 t18 t94 t31 t80 t37 t56 t20 t4 t71 t87 t22 t94 t86 t4 t80 t40 t94 t21 t37 t56`.\n\nI think I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing is about breaking down the string into parts that match the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. So, the string must start with the expansion of S. The first production for S is S -> NT29 NT46. So, S is two non-terminals: NT29 and NT46.\n\nEach of these non-terminals will need to be expanded. Let me see the productions for NT29 and NT46.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT29 -> 't53' (a terminal)\n- NT46 -> 't10' (a terminal)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because S's production is S -> NT29 NT46, which would mean S generates the concatenation of NT29 and NT46. So, the first part of the string should correspond to NT29, and the second to NT46.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t53, which matches NT29 -> t53. The second token should be the expansion of NT46, which is 't10'. But the second token is t25, not t10. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe each step of the production is applied, and the string is a flat sequence, not a tree. So, perhaps the initial expansion is S -> NT29 NT46, which becomes [t53] followed by the expansion of NT46.

{"custom_id":"request-493","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, first, let's break down the problem. I think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar. If I can derive the string from the start symbol S, then the answer is yes; otherwise, it's no.\n\nThe grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the string must start with whatever NT29 and NT46 produce.\n\nLet's look at the string: `t53 t25 t31 t73 t20 t4 t80 t40 t94 t31 t86 t4 t36 t87 t22 t94 t96 t56 t74 t4 t80 t22 t94 t21 t37 t56 t74 t4 t80 t35 t37 t56`.\n\nWe'll process each token step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT29 NT46. So, the first two tokens should be whatever NT29 and NT46 produce.\n\nLet's see NT29: Looking at the grammar, NT29 is a terminal and it's 't53'. So, first token is t53. So that's good.\n\nNext, NT46: The grammar for NT46 has several options. Looking at the production rules, the options are: NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25, NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT45, NT46 \u2192 NT22 NT53, NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT31, NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT87, NT46 \u2192 NT85 NT55, NT46 \u2192 NT84 NT67, NT46 \u2192 NT29 NT87, NT46 \u2192 NT31 NT87, NT46 \u2192 NT87 NT22, NT46 \u2192 NT71 NT87, NT46 \u2192 NT87 NT4, NT46 \u2192 NT61, etc. Wait, looking back, it says NT46 has multiple options, like NT46 \u2192 NT40, NT46 \u2192 NT46? No, I think I need to correct that. Wait, the user input seems a bit messy, but for NT46, according to the given rules: NT46 can go to various other NTs and at the end, some are terminals.\n\nLooking specifically, at the end of the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 \u2192 't46'? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the grammar lines for NT46 are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT25 NT45\n\nNT46 -> NT22 NT53\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT46 -> NT49 NT87\n\nNT46 -> NT85 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT46 -> NT29 NT87\n\nNT46 -> NT31 NT87\n\nNT46 -> NT87 NT22\n\nNT46 -> NT71 NT87\n\nNT46 -> NT87 NT4\n\nWait, actually looking at the user input, the NT46 rules are spread out, but the last one for NT46 is 't55' via NT85 \u2192 NT74 NT16, but I need to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nThe lines are:\n\n...\nNT46 -> 't46'? Wait, wait, in the user's input, the lines are:\n\nHere's the full grammar:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\nNT40 -> 't80'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT25 -> 't73'\nNT31 -> 't49'\nNT14 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't55'\nNT70 -> 't54'\nNT51 -> 't40'\nNT45 -> 't37'\nNT8 -> 't4'\nNT46 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't74'\nNT67 -> 't87'\nNT84 -> 't71'\nNT29 -> 't53'\nNT22 -> 't96'\nNT92 -> 't25'\nNT85 -> 't35'\nNT38 -> 't94'\nNT55 -> 't80'\nNT87 -> 't20'\nNT31 -> 't8'\nNT51 -> 't18'\nNT87 -> 't79'\nNT46 -> 't55'\nNT31 -> 't95'\nNT46 -> 't61'\n\nWait, now I see that for NT46, the rules are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25 (from line 2: NT46 -> NT92 NT25)\nNT46 -> NT25 NT45 (line 10: NT25 -> NT45 is another rule, but wait, no, wait, line 22 is NT49 -> NT25 NT87, which is different.\nWait, I think I need to parse the grammar correctly. Looking through the lines, each entry is either a rule for an NT producing other NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, compiling all the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\nS -> NT29 NT46\n\nNT22 -> NT38 NT70\n\nNT25 -> NT22 NT14\n\nNT91 -> NT8 NT71\n\nNT55 -> NT49 NT91\n\nNT71 -> NT40 NT85\n\nNT40 -> NT84 NT67\n\nNT85 -> NT51 NT16\n\nNT53 -> NT13 NT55\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT22 -> NT53 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT92 NT31\n\nNT49 -> NT25 NT87\n\nNT16 -> NT38 NT55\n\nNT40 -> 't80'\n\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nNT25 -> 't73'\n\nNT31 -> 't49'\n\nNT14 -> 't56'\n\nNT91 -> 't55'\n\nNT70 -> 't54'\n\nNT51 -> 't40'\n\nNT45 -> 't37'\n\nNT8 -> 't4'\n\nNT46 -> 't10'\n\nNT87 -> 't74'\n\nNT67 -> 't87'\n\nNT84 -> 't71'\n\nNT29 -> 't53'\n\nNT22 -> 't96'\n\nNT92 -> 't25'\n\nNT85 -> 't35'\n\nNT38 -> 't94'\n\nNT55 -> 't80'\n\nNT87 -> 't20'\n\nNT31 -> 't8'\n\nNT51 -> 't18'\n\nNT87 -> 't79'\n\nNT46 -> 't55'\n\nNT31 -> 't95'\n\nNT46 -> 't61'\n\nSo, for NT46, the production rules are:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT25 (line 1)\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT25 NT45 (line 10)\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT92 NT31 (line 22)\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT49 NT87? Wait, line 14 is NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT87, not NT46.\n\nWait, wait, line 22 is NT49 producing NT25 NT87, which is a production for NT49, not NT46. So, for NT46, looking at the user's grammar, I think NT46 has the following productions based on the lines:\n\nLooking carefully, NT46's production rules are:\n\nNT46 -> NT92 NT25\n\nNT46 -> NT25 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
