First, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and how it generates strings. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals) on the right.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S, and according to the first rule, S -> NT43 NT61. So, to generate any string, the parser must start with NT43 and NT61, and each of these will eventually be expanded into terminal symbols.\n\nLet me write down the production rules again for clarity:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, there's a problem here. The NT43 rule is defined twice: once as NT43 -> NT83 NT77 and another as NT43 -> 't40'. Similarly, NT3 is defined with two rules: NT3 -> 't82', NT3 -> 't87', and another NT3 -> 't82'? Wait, no, let me check again. Actually, for NT43, I see the first production is NT43 -> NT83 NT77, and the second is NT43 -> 't40'. Similarly, NT3 is defined as NT3 -> 't82', NT3 -> 't87', and another from NT3 -> 't82'. Hmm, but in context-free grammars, a non-terminal can't have multiple rules for the same symbol unless it's in the same group. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT43 has two productions: one to NT83 NT77 and another to 't40'. So that means NT43 can be either NT83 NT77 or the terminal 't40'. Similarly, NT3 has two productions: NT3 -> 't82' and NT3 -> 't87', but then another NT3 -> 't82' \u2013 wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, after NT56, and before NT61, the NT43 rule is listed twice: NT43 -> NT83 NT77 and NT43 -> 't40', with an extra NT3 -> 't82' and another NT3 -> 't87' perhaps mistakenly listed twice. Hmm, maybe a typo, but in any case, perhaps I can proceed assuming that each non-terminal is correctly defined.\n\nBut to make progress, let me consider that the production of NT43 is to NT83 and NT77, or to 't40'. Similarly, for NT3, it's 't82' and 't87'. So, let's see.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is \"t42\". To generate this, the start symbol S must expand into NT43 and NT61. Let's see where those go.\n\nFirst, S -> NT43 NT61. So, NT43 and NT61 will each produce sequences that, when combined, form \"t42\".\n\nLooking at NT61's production: NT61 -> 't33'. So, NT61 directly produces 't33', which is part of the string. But our target string is \"t42\". So, the 't33' is part of the first half of S's expansion (NT43) and the second half is NT61 -> 't33'. But wait, let me clarify: S expands to NT43 NT61, each of which is on the left side. So, both NT43 and NT61 will produce strings, and their concatenation is the resulting string. Since our target is \"t42\", perhaps that's the result of NT43 producing 't42' and NT61 producing an empty string? But no, because in CFGs, each symbol must be expanded into terminals exactly. So, if S produces NT43 NT61, both of which must be expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, but S is followed by NT43 and NT61, which are two non-terminals, so each must be expanded into a string of terminals, and their concatenation is the overall string.\n\nSo, the target string is \"t42\". Let's consider if it's possible for NT43 to produce 't42' and NT61 to produce an empty string? But no, because NT61 can't produce an empty string since all productions produce at least one symbol (they can only go to terminals or other non-terminals, but in this case, NT61 can't expand to an empty string; it can only produce 't33').\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT61: NT61 -> 't33'. So, it can only produce 't33', which is length 1. So, S produces NT43 and NT61, which are each expanded into terminals. So, the total length of the string generated by S is 2. Our target is \"t42\", which is length 1, so that's impossible because the shortest string produced by S is length 2. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each step again.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT43 and NT61.\n\nNT61 -> 't33', which is a terminal. So, the second part is always 't33'.\n\nThen, NT43 must be expanded into a terminal. Let's see the possible productions for NT43. It can either expand into NT83 NT77 or into 't40'. So, NT43 can produce 't40' directly (a terminal) or NT83 NT77, which would then expand further.\n\nWait, but our target string is \"t42\", which is different from 't40' and 't33'. So, if S's expansion is NT43 (which could be 't40') and NT61 ('t33'), the resulting string would be 't40' followed by 't33', which is 't40t33' (length 2). But our target is 't42' (length 1), so that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can produce something else? But wait, no, because S only expands into NT43 NT61, each of which must expand into terminals. So, the only possible way is for NT43 to produce 't40' (so the string would be 't40t33'), which is not 't42'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way for NT43 to expand into more symbols that result in 't42' when combined with something else, but it seems that NT43 can only produce 't40' or NT83 NT77, but NT83 and NT77 have their own productions. So, let's explore that.\n\nIf NT43 expands into NT83 NT77, then those two must each expand into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT83: NT83 -> 't47' or 't27'. So, when expanded, it's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 -> 't42'. So, if NT83 is 't47' and NT77 is 't42', then NT43 would produce 't47' followed by 't42' (length 2: 't47t42'), but that's not our target.\n\nWait, if NT83 -> 't47' and NT77 -> 't42', then the combination would be 't47t42', which is still length 2, not matching the target 't42' (length 1).\n\nAlternatively, if NT83 is 't27', and NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT43 NT61. So the string we're looking for, `t3`, needs to be derived from a series of these productions.\n\nLet me write down the productions to get a clearer picture:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT3 -> 't87'\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT59 -> 't2'\n- NT83 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n- NT82 -> 't0'\n- NT76 -> 't74'\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait a minute, I see that NT43 appears twice in the productions. There's one that goes to NT83 NT77 and another that says NT43 -> 't40'. So I need to remember that when processing the strings.\n\nSince the string is `t3`, which has two terminals, I need to see if any of the production rules can derive this in two steps or through combinations.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: The start symbol S generates NT43 NT61. So the string needs to be the combination of derivations from NT43 and NT61.\n\nStep 2: Let's look at NT43. From the rules, NT43 can either go to NT83 NT77 or be 't40'. But our target is `t3`, so we need to see how to get from here. If NT43 is a terminal, it can't produce `t3` directly, except if it's 't40', but `t3` is different.\n\nWait, no. Let me check. There are two production rules for NT43: one that produces NT83 and NT77, and another that produces 't40'. So NT43 can either be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 only has one production: NT61 -> 't33'. So NT61 always produces the string `t33`, which is a terminal. If our target string is `t3`, then the part from NT61 in S's expansion (NT43 NT61) must produce `t3` and `t33`, respectively. But our target is just `t3`, not `t33`. That suggests that maybe `t33` is part of the derivation, but we don't want it in the final string. Hmm, that might cause a problem. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The original start symbol S produces NT43 NT61, which would expand to something like (from NT43) and (from NT61). So if NT61 is 't33', then the string from S would have to be (something) followed by 't33'. However, our target string is `t3`, which doesn't include 't33'. That might already suggest that the string isn't generated, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me try to see if `t3` can be derived from any of the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are all the strings that appear on the right-hand side when a rule is expanded directly without non-terminals. For example, NT3 can be 't82' or 't87'. Similarly, NT43 can be 't40' or further expand.\n\nSo, 't3' is a terminal, so I need to find a production that gives exactly 't3' somewhere in the derivation.\n\nLooking at all the terminal rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't82' or 't87'\n- NT16 -> 't3' (there's a production NT16 -> 't3')\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n- Others produce different terminals, but let's note that NT16 can derive 't3'.\n\nSo if I can get a derivation that ends up with 't3' before any non-terminals, that might be a path.\n\nBut the problem is that the grammar starts with S -> NT43 NT61, which means the entire string is the concatenation of derivations from NT43 and NT61. So if NT43 eventually produces a string that ends with 't3' and NT61 produces nothing else, but that's not possible because NT61 is a terminal.\n\nWait, NT61 goes to 't33', so if S is NT43 NT61, then any derivation from S will result in a string that is the concatenation of what NT43 produces and 't33'.\n\nSo unless NT43 somehow can produce an empty string, which it can't because all its productions either produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S can only produce NT43 NT61, so the overall string has two parts: one from NT43 and one from NT61. NT61 is fixed as 't33', so the entire string from S must end with 't33'. However, the string we're checking is `t3`, which doesn't include 't33', so that suggests it's impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a way to have one of the non-terminals expand into 't3' and NT61 expand into 't33', but that would make the overall string something like (expansion of NT43) + 't33'. So unless (expansion of NT43) is empty, which it can't be because it's a string of non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me list out the terminals to see if any of the NTs derive 't3':\n\nLooking back at the rules, NT16 can derive 't3'. So NT16 -> 't3'. Then, to get `t3`, we need to have a production that eventually results in NT16 -> 't3'.\n\nSo maybe we can have S -> NT43 NT61. If NT43 expands into something that includes NT16, which then produces 't3', and NT61 produces 't33', but that would put `t3` followed by `t33`, which isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, if NT43 somehow produces something that has 't3' as part of it, but then NT61 is 't33', so the entire string would be something like 't3t33', but that's not the string we're checking.\n\nWait, perhaps the string `t3` is derived from a different start symbol, but S is fixed. So maybe it's impossible.\n\nBut perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another approach: the string `t3` is just a single terminal, so in the derivation, we need to have S generate 't3' as a single production, but the grammar starts with S -> NT43 NT61, so that's two symbols, which when fully expanded would be two terminal strings concatenated. Therefore, `t3` can't be generated because it's only one terminal.\n\nWait, that might be it. Because S generates NT43 and NT61, so the string is two parts. The only way to have a single terminal is if one of the non-terminals expands into that terminal and the other doesn't contribute anything, but in this case, NT61 is 't33', so the entire string from S would be (some string) + 't33', which can't be `t3`.\n\nTherefore, the string `t3` cannot be generated by this grammar because it's a single terminal, and the grammar starts by splitting it into two non-terminals that produce at least two terminals, thus requiring the string to be longer than one character"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, S breaks down into NT43 and NT61. Let's see what each of those can do.\n\nLooking at NT43, I notice it has two options: NT43 can become NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47. Wait, let me check that again.

Or maybe I misread\u2014no, it's separate rules. So NT43 is rewritten into three different options: NT83 NT77, NT83 NT79, and NT83 NT47.\n\nWait, that can't be right because Chomsky normal form typically allows each rule to have two non-terminals on the right. Maybe some rules are missing or incorrectly written in the problem, but since the user provided the grammar, I have to work with it as is.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT47\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT61: NT61 -> 't33'. So that's a terminal.\n\nNow, the string we have to evaluate is \"t3 t33\". So it's two tokens separated by a space: \"t3\" and \"t33\".\n\nWait, but in the grammar, when a rule leads to a terminal, like NT61 -> 't33', that's straightforward. So the second part of the string, \"t33\", matches NT61 directly.\n\nBut we need to get the first part, \"t3\", from NT43. Let's see how NT43 can generate \"t3\".\n\nLooking at the rules for NT43, each of the options breaks it down into two non-terminals. For example, if NT43 becomes NT83 NT77, then each of those can further break down.\n\nLooking at NT83: The rules for NT83 are NT83 -> NT86 NT79 and NT83 -> NT86 NT47. So each of these produces two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT86: NT86 -> NT82 NT76. Then NT82 breaks into NT62 NT0, NT76 into NT74, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a bottoms-up approach: trying to see if \"t3\" can be generated from NT43.\n\nSo, NT43 must expand into a sequence that eventually leads to a terminal \"t3\". Let's see the possible paths for NT43.\n\nOption 1: NT43 -> NT83 NT77\nThen both NT83 and NT77 need to produce terminals that can form \"t3\".\n\nLooking at NT83: Each production of NT83 leads to two non-terminals again.

This seems like a long chain and I don't see any immediate terminals except perhaps at the end of some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each non-terminal and see if they produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59 (which could then lead to NT27's terminal, which is t25)\n- NT3 -> 't82' or 't87' or 't42' (based on multiple rules)\n- NT43 can produce various combinations, some of which might reach a terminal.\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9, where NT9 is 't82' or 't79', etc.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to get \"t3\" from NT43. So perhaps through the production paths for NT43.\n\nLet me see:\n\nNT43 can be NT83 NT77, NT83 NT79, or NT83 NT47.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I only see the three options for NT43 as:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT47\n\nWait, no, actually looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT47\n\nSo that makes NT43's three options:\n\n1. NT83 NT77\n2. NT83 NT79\n3. NT83 NT47\n\nSo each of these is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nNow, if any of these can produce 't3', we can follow through.\n\nLooking at NT47: There's no rule for NT47 in the provided grammar, which suggests that NT47 is a terminal. Or perhaps I missed it. Wait, the grammar rules are the ones provided above. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided NT43 and NT83 rules, I don't see a rule for NT47 except as part of NT83's productions. So in the production NT43 -> NT83 NT47, assuming that NT47 is a terminal because there's no rule for it, so it produces 't47'?\n\nWait, wait. Actually, in the user's grammar, under NT83: there's a rule NT83 -> NT86 NT79 and NT83 -> NT86 NT47. The NT47 here, is it a terminal or non-terminal? Since there's no rule for NT47, I think it's a terminal symbol. So, the production NT83 -> NT86 NT47 would result in something like NT86 (which is NT82 NT76) and 't47'.\n\nWait, this could get complicated. Let's try to see if any production from NT43 ends up producing 't3'.\n\nLooking for any path that NT43 can take to ultimately produce 't3'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the terminal symbols in the grammar. Let's list all the terminal symbols to see what can be produced.\n\nTerminal symbols are everything that are leaves in the grammar, i.e., appear as rules without any further breakdown. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n\n- NT3 -> 't82', 't87', 't42'\n\n- NT43 -> 't40' (I think? Wait, in the list provided by the user, near the bottom, we have NT43 -> 't40').\n\nWait, wait. Looking back at the user's grammar rules, it's a bit messy, and some of the NTs have inconsistent rules. For example, under NT43, the user has:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT47\n\nSo three options for NT43.

Because in the user's message, under the large list, it ends with:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, yes, at the very end of the user's grammar:\n\n...-> 't42'\n\n...-> 't87'\n\n...-> 't42'\n\n...-> 't29'\n\n...-> 't42'\n\n...-> 't21'\n\n...-> 't3'\n\n...-> 't82'\n\n...-> 't42'\n\n...-> 't27'\n\n...-> 't6'\n\n...-> 't36'\n\nAnd after that, under NT43 again:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nSo that's another production for NT43, directly to 't40'.\n\nWait, so NT43 has the following options:\n\n1. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\n2. NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\n3. NT43 -> NT83 NT47\n\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-14","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string \"t33 t74\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars consist of a set of production rules, and the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way these rules are structured. In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a single terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to follow CNF, as all the rules are either non-terminals or single terminals.\n\nThe string I need to test is \"t33 t74\", which consists of two tokens: \"t33\" and \"t74\". Since these are terminal symbols, I need to check if the grammar can derive this exact sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The top-level rule for S is S -> NT43 NT61. So, to derive the string, the first step is to expand S into NT43 and NT61. This gives us two parts: the left part (NT43) and the right part (NT61). Each of these can be further expanded.\n\nLet's start with NT43. The production rules for NT43 are:\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\nNT43 -> NT45 NT28\nNT43 -> NT77 (I think there might be a duplicate rule here, but I'll note that)\nNT43 -> NT79\nWait, looking back, it seems NT43 has two different productions: NT83 NT77 and NT83 NT79, and another to NT79. Hmm, but in the initial rules, I see NT43 has five options. So, for now, let's consider each possibility.\n\nSo, if NT43 expands to NT83 and NT77, let's see what those can produce. NT83 has rules:\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\nSo, NT83 can become either NT86 NT79 or the terminal 't27'.\n\nNow, looking at NT77, the production is:\nNT77 -> NT27 NT42\nAnd NT27 is:\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT42 is:\nNT42 -> 't42'\n\nSo, putting that together, NT77 becomes 't25' and then NT42 becomes 't42', so NT77 -> 't25 t42' or perhaps 't25 t42 t42'? Wait, no: NT77 is NT27 NT42. NT27 expands to 't25' (as NT27 is 't25'), and NT42 is 't42', so NT77 becomes 't25 t42'.\n\nSo, if NT43 is NT83 and NT77, then NT83 can become 't27' or 't21' (wait, no, NT83's rules are NT86 NT79 and NT47. Wait, let's recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me list the rules correctly.\n\nThe grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, hold on. Oh no, I think I misread the grammar earlier. There are multiple NT43 entries. Wait, looking again:\n\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT45 NT28\n- ... and another NT43 -> NT77? No, perhaps there was a duplicate or misnumbering.\n\nWait, perhaps the user entered the grammar with multiple rules for the same non-terminal. So, for NT43, there are several production rules. Let me list them properly:\n\nNT43:\n- NT83 NT77\n- NT83 NT79\n- NT45 NT28\n- NT77 (maybe)\n- NT79\n- ... I'm a bit confused now because there's a potential duplicate. Wait, let's count the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT45 NT28\n\nNT43 -> NT28 -> ... (Wait, no, wait the list is:\n\nNT43 is defined as:\n\n1. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\n2. NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\n3. NT43 -> NT45 NT28\n\n4. NT43 -> NT28 ... Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar as given by the user is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, no, actually, each NT is defined by a rule. So, for example, NT43 has multiple production rules. Let me list them correctly:\n\nNT43 has the following production rules:\n\n1. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\n2. NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\nWait, but in the user's message, after NT43 -> NT83 NT77, there's another NT43 -> NT45 NT28, and then in the list, another NT43 -> NT83 NT79, NT43 -> NT79, etc. That's confusing. I think the user might have a formatting issue, perhaps. Let me try to transcribe correctly.\n\nLooking at the user's provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\n- NT83 -> NT47\n\nWait, but then it's followed by other rules. Wait, I might be overcomplicating. Perhaps the user intended each NT to have multiple production rules, and perhaps the same NT appears multiple times in the list of productions. For example, NT43 has several rules, including sometimes referring back to itself. That's possible in some grammars, but it can complicate parsing.\n\nBut regardless, the important point is that I have to track all possible derivations. However, given the string \"t33 t74\", the last symbol is t74. Looking at the production rules, I see that NT76 -> 't74', so if during derivation, I have NT76, it produces 't74'.\n\nNow, looking back, S -> NT43 NT61. So S expands into NT43 and NT61.\n\nNT61 has a rule: NT61 -> 't33'. So that part is straightforward. So, the first part is 't33', and the second part is NT43.\n\nWait, no: S is NT43 and NT61, so when S is expanded, it becomes NT43 NT61. So to derive the string, both NT43 and NT61 need to derive their respective parts.\n\nSo the string is \"t33 t74\". So the first part, 't33', comes from NT61, which directly derives 't33' (from the rule: NT61 -> 't33').\n\nThe second part, 't74', must come from NT43 somehow. But let's see. NT43's possible expansions are:\n\n1. NT43-> NT83 NT77\n\n2. NT43-> NT83 NT79\n\n3. NT43-> NT45 NT28\n\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t74 t27 t27` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the string, it's `t74 t27 t27`. Each part is separated by spaces, so I can think of this string as a sequence of three tokens: t74, t27, t27. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of applications of the productions in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. The first production from S is S -> NT43 NT61. So, the first step is to expand S into NT43 and NT61. The string's first token is t74. Looking at the productions, I see NT83 -> t83, but that's not matching. Also, NT76 -> t74. So NT76 can become t74. But I don't have NT76 yet. Wait, looking through the productions, the left-hand side (LHS) of some rules produce terminals. Let me list those:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT83 -> t83\nNT83 -> t47 (Hmm)\nNT76 -> t74\nNT0 -> t42\nNT27 -> t25\nNT56 -> t27\nNT32 -> t56? Wait, NT32 -> NT56 NT9, but NT56 -> t27. So NT32 eventually becomes t27. So maybe some path leads to t27, but how does that get combined?\n\nWait, the string is t74 t27 t27. So first token is t74. From the grammar, I see NT76 -> t74. So if I can have NT76 as the first non-terminal, and the rest follows, that works. So looking at S -> NT43 NT61, I would need to see if NT43 or NT61 can lead to t74 somewhere, but that doesn't seem straightforward.\n\nWait, S -> NT43 NT61, so the first step is to produce NT43 NT61. So the string would start with something derived from NT43 and something from NT61. The first token is t74, which comes from NT76. So maybe NT43 can be involved. Let me see the productions for NT43.\n\nNT43 has two productions: NT83 NT77 and NT83 NT40. Both are using NT83 and another term. NT83 can produce t83 or t47. Hmm, t83 is t plus 83, but we have t74 in the string. Does any other non-terminal derive to t74? Yes, NT76 -> t74.\n\nWait, so NT83 isn't directly giving us t74. What about NT76? How does NT76 get derived? Looking at the grammar, NT76 is derived from NT43: NT43 -> NT83 NT77. Let me check NT77: NT77 -> NT86 NT27. NT86 is from NT82: NT86 -> NT82 NT76. NT82 is NT62 -> NT45 NT32. NT45 is NT28 -> NT3 NT40 (wait, no, NT45 is NT28 -> NT3 NT40? Wait: NT45 -> NT28 NT3. Hmm, but NT28 is NT27 NT59. Wait, let's recast this.\n\nI think it's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Let me start from the end tokens and see if they can fit into some productions.\n\nThe string is t74 t27 t27. So from left to right: t74, then t27, then t27. So let me see if each part can be built up.\n\nFirst token: t74 comes from NT76. So where does NT76 come from? Looking at the grammar, NT76 is not a terminal; it must be derived from something. Looking for NT76 in the production list, I don't see it. Wait, does any production have NT76 on the left? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through all the LHS of the productions, I don't see NT76 being produced. Wait, that can't be right. Did I miss it? Let me go through each production. \n\n productions include NT86-> NT82 NT76. So NT86 is a non-terminal that produces NT82 and NT76. But NT76 is not on the LHS of any production, so how does NT76 get derived? Oh wait, perhaps there's a typo. Wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nHere's the grammar provided:\n\nLooking for NT76: I don't see NT76 being produced. The only production that mentions NT76 is NT86 -> NT82 NT76, but that seems unproductive because NT76 isn't on the left side of any production. That means NT76 can't be derived, which is a problem because the first token is t74, which comes from NT76. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated because it's relying on a non-terminal that doesn't exist in the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check all the productions again for any that produce NT76. Scanning through, I see NT86 -> NT82 NT76, but that's not producing NT76. So, actually, NT76 doesn't have any production, it's only on the RHS of NT86. So this is a problem because you can't derive NT76 from anything else. Therefore, you can't get t74 because it requires NT76, which is unproductive.\n\nSo, the first token t74 depends on NT76, which can't be derived from any other non-terminal, making it impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the productions. Let me make sure I didn't miss NT76. The productions are:\n\nNT77 -> NT86 NT27\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\nNT82 -> NT0\nNT3 -> 't82'\n... and so on.\n\nSo NT76 is on the RHS of NT86. But since there's no production for NT76 on the LHS, it can't be part of any derivation. Therefore, any use of NT76 would mean that the grammar can't generate it.\n\nSo, since the first symbol is t74, which requires NT76, which isn't a valid non-terminal in the grammar, the string can't be generated. Hence, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-41","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check whether a specific string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, but for generating strings, I need to work backward\u2014like a reverse process.\n\nThe grammar provided has several non-terminals on the left side (like S, NT9, NT59, etc.), and the right sides of these productions either split into other non-terminals or are terminals. The target string is `t42 t87 t40 t0`. Since it's a sequence of terminals, I need to see if I can derive this string from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's look at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. That means the string generated by S starts with NT43 followed by NT61. Each of these is a non-terminal, so I'll need to replace them with their respective productions.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, NT43 \u2192 NT83 't40', NT43 \u2192 't40'. Wait, one of them is 't40'. Oh, but I need the string to be t42, t87, t40, t0. So for NT43, if I take the production NT43 \u2192 't40', that only gives me 't40' as part of the string, which is part of the string we need. So that works for the third element, 't40'. But then I need to see how the other parts of the string connect.\n\nWait, the entire string is four terms: t42, t87, t40, t0. So starting from S, which gives NT43 NT61, each of those needs to produce a part of the string. Let me try to see how each can contribute.\n\nLooking at NT43, since it can either split into two non-terminals or produce a terminal. For the string we have, after the third 't40', we need a 't0'. Let me look at where 't0' comes from. Looking through the productions, NT0 \u2192 't42' comes into play. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT82 \u2192 't0', and NT76 \u2192 't74', but I'm not seeing NT0 \u2192 't0' directly. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't0' which is correct. And looking for where 't0' comes from elsewhere, I think I might have misspoken. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT82 \u2192 't0', so when NT82 is replaced, it yields 't0'. So to get 't0', we need to have NT82 somewhere. But in the start symbol S, NT61 is part of S. Let me check the productions for NT61. From the grammar, NT61 \u2192 't33' (from one production) and NT61 \u2192 NT82 NT82. Wait, hold on. NT61 has the rule NT61 \u2192 't33'? Or is it NT61 \u2192 't33'? Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT61 are: NT61 \u2192 't33'? Wait, actually, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33' doesn't seem to be present. Let me check:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of lines, each line being a production. So I should list them:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 't40'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n\nAnd so on. Wait, no, looking correctly:\n\nWait, the actual productions are:\n\nLet me list them properly:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\n2. NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n\n3. NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n\n4.

{"custom_id":"request-38","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t47 t33 t27 t82` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. The grammar is given in a production table format where each line shows a non-terminal symbol on the left and its production rules on the right. The initial symbol is S, so the derivation starts from S.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string can be derived from S by expanding it using the grammar rules until only terminal symbols (tokens like 't47', 't33', etc.) remain.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t47 t33 t27 t82`. Let's write it as a sequence of tokens: t47, t33, t27, t82.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be formed through any left or right derivation steps.\n\nLet's start by looking at the initial symbol S. According to the grammar, S produces NT43 NT61, so the first step is S => NT43 NT61.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT43 NT61. Now, each of these needs to be expanded into the correct terminals.\n\nLooking at NT43, its production rules are:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT45 NT3\n- NT43 -> NT43 NT29 NT16 (Wait, no, looking again, the rules for NT43 are written as NT43 -> NT83 NT77, NT43 -> NT45 NT3, etc. So actually, it's multiple production options, but some might be recursion, like NT43 -> NT43 NT29 NT21, which seems complicated.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 produces 't33' directly, as per the grammar. Because NT61 -> 't33'. So the second part is straightforward: NT61 becomes t33.\n\nWait, no, NT61 is 't33', but in the initial step S is NT43 NT61, so the first part is NT43 and the second is NT61, which becomes 't33'. So the first part is NT43 and the second is 't33', so the entire string after this step would be NT43 t33, right? But the target string starts with t47, which is not an NT but a terminal, so I must explore whether NT43 can produce a terminal that, when combined with other productions, can lead to the target string.\n\nWait, but NT43 is a non-terminal, so it can't be a terminal. So the first token in the string is t47, which suggests that NT43 must produce t47. Let me look at the production rules for NT43.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT43, the options are:\n1. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n2. NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n3. NT43 -> NT86 NT79\n4. NT43 -> NT45 NT3\n5. NT43 -> NT43 NT29 NT21\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce t47 as a terminal. Wait, actually, I need to see if any of these can eventually derive to t47 through further expansions. Let's look at each of these options.\n\nTake option 1: NT43 -> NT83 NT77. Now, NT83's productions are:\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT83 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT83 -> NT83 NT79\n- NT83 -> NT47\n\nWait, I see that NT83 has a production NT83 -> NT47. So, if NT83 can directly produce t47, that's a pathway. Let me retrace:\n\nNT43 can go to NT83 NT77 (option 1). Then, NT83 can produce NT47 as a terminal. But wait, in the leftmost derivation, I would first expand NT43 to NT83 NT77, but can NT83 produce t47 directly?\n\nLooking at NT83's rules, yes, there's NT83 -> 't47'. Wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's check the production rules for NT83 carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT83, the lines are:\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT83 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT83 -> NT82 NT62\n- NT83 -> NT79 ??? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, no, let me check the given grammar again. The grammar provided is:\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, no, under NT83, there are two production rules:\n\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n\nOh, okay, so NT83 can directly produce t47. That's a terminal. So that's a key point. So, if NT43 can produce NT83, and NT83 can produce t47, then that's part of the way.\n\nSo, let's outline the possible steps:\n\n1. S is initial: S\n2. S -> NT43 NT61\n3. NT61 -> 't33' (so after derivations of NT61, the first part of the string will include 't33')\n4. NT43 can be expanded in several ways, but one of them is NT83 NT77.\n\nSo, considering the leftmost derivation:\n\n- S => NT43 NT61\n- NT43 => NT83 NT77 (let's pick this production)\n- So now, the string is NT83 NT77 followed by 't33' (since NT61 is 't33')\n\nBut wait, in derivation, after expanding S to NT43 NT61, we can choose to expand NT43 before NT61. So perhaps it's better to first expand NT43 as far as possible before dealing with NT61.\n\nAlternatively, in leftmost derivation, the leftmost non-terminal is expanded first. So let's try expanding S step by step:\n\nS => NT43 NT61\nNow, the leftmost symbol is NT43, so we can expand that.\n\nNT43 can expand into multiple options, but let's choose one that can lead to t47. So let's pick NT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nSo now, the string is NT83 NT77 NT61. But wait, NT61 can be expanded to 't33', so:\n\nAfter expanding NT61: NT83 NT77 't33'\n\nSo the string so far is NT83, NT77, 't33'\n\nBut the target string is 't47 t33 t27 t82'\n\nSo the first token should be t47, but in the current expansion, the first token is NT83, which is a non-terminal. That's a problem because it's not a terminal yet. So I need to expand NT83.\n\nLooking at NT83, we have a production NT83 -> 't47'.\n\nSo expanding NT83, we get 't47' as the first token.\n\nSo now, the string is 't47', followed by NT77, 't33'\n\nSo the next symbol after 't47' is NT77.\n\nWait, but the target string is 't47 t33 t27 t8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But looking again:\n\nLet me list them properly:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n- NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n- NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT68 \u2192 't21'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT56 \u2192 't27'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3'\n- NT59 \u2192 't2'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't47'\n- NT82 \u2192 't0'\n- NT76 \u2192 't74'\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo, it's more accurate to say that each line represents a production rule for the non-terminal on the left. So for NT43, there are two rules: one where it goes to NT83 NT77, and another where it goes to 't40'.\n\nWait, but in standard Chomsky normal form, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So for NT43, we have NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'. Similarly, NT3 appears twice with 't82' and 't87'. That's a bit confusing, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe first step is to see if the given string can be derived from S. The string is: `t6 t47 t42 t36 t47`. Let me count the tokens: t6, t47, t42, t36, t47. That's five symbols. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S directly expands into two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61.\n\nLet me see what each of these can produce. NT61 has a single production: NT61 \u2192 't33'. So NT61 is a terminal. So from S, the first step is to produce NT43 followed by 't33'. Now, the string we have is t6 t47 t42 t36 t47. So, if S starts with NT43 NT61, and NT61 is t33, but the string starts with t6, which is 't6'. So this suggests that the first token in the string, 't6', must come from NT61. But wait, that can't be because NT61 \u2192 't33'. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the entire string must be derived from NT43 followed by NT61. Since NT61 \u2192 't33', the last part of the string should end with t33. But the given string ends with t47, not t33. Hmm, that suggests a contradiction because NT61 always produces 't33'. So if the string we're testing is t6 t47 t42 t36 t47, the last token is t47, which can't be from NT61. Therefore, this string cannot be derived from S.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar and the string. Maybe there's another way for NT61 to produce something else, but in the given grammar, NT61 has only one production: \u2192 't33'. So it seems that S produces NT43 followed by 't33', and thus the string derived from S would have 't33' as the last symbol, but the string ends with 't47'. That suggests that the string is not in the language generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a deeper structure. Let me see if any other non-terminals can produce 't47'. Let's look through all the productions. I see NT83 appears twice: once \u2192 't27' and another \u2192 't47'. So NT83 can produce either t27 or t47. That might be relevant. Also, looking at NT82, it produces t0, and NT79 \u2192 't36'. So perhaps the string can be built by having some non-terminals expand into these.\n\nBut let's go back. The initial step is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the two parts are NT43 and NT61. The string is five symbols. So let's see how that would break down. The entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT43 and NT61. Since NT61 \u2192 't33', that suggests that the last symbol should be t33, but our string ends with t47. Therefore, that's a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, but maybe the way the string is structured, the two parts (NT43 and NT61) are themselves composite structures. Since NT43 can produce a string that, when combined with NT61's t33, equals the given string.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is t6 t47 t42 t36 t47.\n\nWe need to see if this string can be generated by S. Let me consider how S can split into two parts: the expansion of NT43 and NT61, which would each produce parts of the string.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the total string is the concatenation of the string generated by NT43 and the string generated by NT61.\n\nWe know that NT61 \u2192 't33', so the second part of the string (the latter half) must be 't33'. But in the given string, the last token is 't47', which contradicts that. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by S.\n\nWait, unless the initial production allows for the string to have more symbols. Wait, maybe there's a way for NT43 to produce a certain string that, when followed by DT61's 't33', forms the given string. But since the given string ends with 't47', not 't33', that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar because the last token"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar seems to have a mix of NTs and terminals (like 't33', 't42', etc.). My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is the first production rule:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61.\n\nSo, S expands directly into NT43 and NT61. To form a string with terminals, both NT43 and NT61 must generate terminals. Let's look at their productions.\n\nLooking at NT61: the production for NT61 is 't33'. So that's straightforward. So NT61 can produce 't33'.\n\nNow, what about NT43? There's a production for NT43 => NT83 NT77. So to produce a terminal, we'd need NT83 and NT77 to produce terminals themselves.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions:\n\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT83 -> NT47 (Wait, is NT47 a terminal? The given grammar doesn't show NT47 as having a production. So if NT83 can produce NT47, but since that's not given, probably NT47 is a terminal? Or is there a mistake? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT47 having a production. So if NT83 can produce NT47, I'm assuming NT47 is a terminal? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be another NT? Hmm, wait, the user provided the grammar, and in the list, NT83 is followed by NT86 and NT79, then it's a separate entry for NT83 -> 't47'?\n\nNo, wait, actually in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nAh, okay, so NT83 has two productions: one that produces NT86 and NT79, and another that produces 't47'. So NT83 can either be NT86 NT79 or 't47'. So, in our case, the NT43 => NT83 NT77. So for NT43 to produce terminals, we'd need both NT83 and NT77 to produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT83, one production is 't47', so we can use that. For NT77, let's see: NT77's production is 't42'. So both NT83 and NT77 can directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, in production S -> NT43 NT61, if we take NT43 => 't47' (from NT83 -> 't47') and NT61 => 't33', then S would produce 't47 t33'. But our target string is longer, so that's not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look further. Maybe the grammar allows for more steps. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t82 t21 t33 t42 t36.\n\nThis has 5 symbols, so the parse tree would have to have a structure that can split into 5 parts, possibly through a sequence of productions.\n\nLet me see if I can find a derivation path that leads to t82 t21 t33 t42 t36.\n\nFirst, let's look for possible ways to get t82, t21, etc.\n\nt82 is produced by NT82. NT82 has two productions: NT82 -> NT86 NT76 or NT0. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT82:\n\nFrom the list, I think I see:\n\n- NT82 -> 't0' (from line NT82->'t0')\nWait, checking the grammar, looking for NT82: there is a line NT82->'t0' and another NT82->'t74'.\n\nWait, no, I see:\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\nNT82-> 't0' and NT76->'t74'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT33 is not in the grammar, so that's probably not relevant.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT9: goes to NT68 and NT16; those might be non-terminals, so we don't look here.\n- NT28: goes to NT27 and NT59.\n- NT43: goes to NT83 and NT77.\n- NT59: goes to NT68 and NT79.\n- NT28: NT27 and NT59.\n- NT62: goes to NT45 and NT32.\n- NT45: goes to NT28 and NT3.\n- NT56: goes to NT29 and NT21.\nWait, NT56 -> NT29 NT21. Hmm, so NT56 needs both NT29 and NT21 to be terminals.\n\nLooking back, NT29's production: NT29 can go to NT42, but that's an NT. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT29's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar: NT29 -> NT42, which is a terminal as there's no further production. So NT29 can produce 't42'.\n\nSimilarly, NT21's production is 't6', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, NT29 can produce 't42' and NT21 can produce 't6'.\n\nSo, if NT56 -> NT29 NT21, then NT56 can produce 't42 t6' because both NT29 and NT21 can produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT77: NT77->'t42' as per the production.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nOur target string: t82 t21 t33 t42 t36.\n\nLet's try to match this. t33 is a terminal and comes from NT61.\n\nSo the string starts with t33, which is the last element, fifth. So perhaps we can parse the string from left to right, but considering that context-free grammars can parse in any way, maybe using recursive approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S.\n\nS -> NT43 NT61.\n\nSo, NT43 needs to be expanded, and NT61 is 't33'.\n\nBut to produce more symbols beyond 't33', perhaps NT43 needs to produce more.\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 can produce 't47' or NT86 NT79.\n\nIf we choose 't47', then NT77 can produce 't42', so NT43 becomes 't47 t42'.\n\nSo, S would expand to 't47 t42 t33', which is three symbols, not matching our target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing a different expansion.\n\nWait, but in NT43's production, NT83 can be either 't47' or NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t2 t6 t36 t27 t40 t40` is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar is given with all the productions written in that form, which is helpful because it simplifies the analysis.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t2, t6, t36, t27, t40, t40. Since the string has six tokens, the corresponding parse tree must have a structure that produces six terminals. In CNF, the leftmost derivation is used, so each production step contributes directly to the terminal sequence without any intermediate symbols.\n\nThe given grammar starts with the start symbol S. Let's see what S can produce. From the given grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nSo, S is a non-terminal that must generate NT43 and NT61. Let's list out the productions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at NT43, it has two rules:\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT43 \u2192 NT40\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the initial S is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So both NT43 and NT61 must be expanded to terminals or further non-terminals. Let me check the productions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT43 has two productions: one to NT83 NT77 and another to NT40.\nWait, but looking back, I think that might not be the case. Let me re-examine the grammar. The user provided the productions in a way that might make it confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that each entry is like S \u2192 NT43 NT61, etc. So, each production rule's right side consists of two non-terminals. For example, NT43 has the following productions:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT43 \u2192 NT40\n\nWait, no, actually, looking more carefully, I think I misinterpreted it. Let's parse it properly.\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, actually, some of these entries have the right-hand side as a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT61 has a production NT61 -> 't33', meaning it directly produces the terminal t33. Similarly, NT43 has a production NT43 -> 't40' and also another production NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So that's two rules: one terminal and one binary production.\n\nThe key point is that when a non-terminal can produce a terminal, it's a leaf node in the parse tree. So, to build the string `t2 t6 t36 t27 t40 t40`, we need to see if the start symbol S can derive this through a series of steps that match each terminal in order.\n\nLet's break down the string into its individual tokens: [t2, t6, t36, t27, t40, t40]. So we need a leftmost derivation where each step matches these terminals in order.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNow, NT43 and NT61 are both non-terminals. So we need to expand them into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT61: it has a production NT61 \u2192 't33'. So NT61 can directly produce 't33'. That's the first terminal in the string: 't33'? Wait, the string starts with 't2', but NT61 produces 't33', so that's a mismatch. Hmm, that suggests a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check again. The string is `t2 t6 t36 t27 t40 t40`. So the first symbol is t2, but NT61 is producing 't33', which is t33, not t2. So if the first symbol produced is t33, that doesn't match t2. So perhaps NT61 isn't producing t33; maybe I need to look deeper into the productions for NT61.\n\nWait, looking back, NT61's rule is:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nSo NT61 can only produce 't33' directly. So that suggests that the first symbol derived from NT61 would be 't33', but in our string, the first symbol is 't2', which doesn't match. So maybe S can't produce the given string because NT61 can only produce 't33'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing other productions. Let me check the entire grammar again for NT61. It seems that NT61 only has one production: NT61 \u2192 't33'. So that means when we expand NT61, the first symbol must be 't33'. But in the string, it starts with 't2', which is different.\n\nThat suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol would be 't33' instead of 't2'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the NT61 rule has another production that I'm not seeing, but in the user's provided grammar, NT61's rule is only NT61 \u2192 't33'. So that's the only way. So, that can't generate t2 as the first symbol. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nHowever, maybe I'm missing something else. Let's think deeper. Maybe there's a way that NT61 expands into a combination that includes t2 somewhere else. But since NT61 directly produces 't33', that's the only way. There's no way for NT61 to produce 't2' unless another path exists, but without seeing other rules, it's not.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the string starts with 't2', but NT61 can only generate 't33', so the overall string starts with the wrong symbol, making it impossible for the grammar to generate it.

{"custom_id":"request-56","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the string `t0 t2 t82 t47 t6 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string is a possible sequence of terminals derived from the start symbol S. The string is `t0 t2 t82 t47 t6 t3`. Let me break this down from left to right, trying to find possible paths in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the string: `t0 t2 t82 t47 t6 t3`.\n\nI'll reverse the process by starting from the end and see if I can trace back to the start symbol S. This is called the CYK algorithm approach but simplified since I'm not writing a parser.\n\nLooking at the last token `t3`. In the grammar, there's a production for NT3 \u2192 't82' and another NT3 \u2192 't87' and also NT3 \u2192 't42'. Wait, the given string has `t82`, which matches NT3 \u2192 't82'. So maybe the last symbol comes from NT3 \u2192 't82'. So the production would be NT3 \u2192 t82.\n\nNow, let's go back. The string before that is `t6`. Looking for NT6 \u2192 t6. In the grammar, there's NT61 \u2192 t33 and NT62 \u2192 NT45 t32. Wait, no NT6 production. Hmm, that might be a problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t6, wait no, wait the grammar as given:\n\nNo, looking again, is there an NT6? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 t42\n- NT77 \u2192 t42\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT68 \u2192 t21\n- NT0 \u2192 t42\n- NT56 \u2192 t27\n- NT16 \u2192 t3\n- NT59 \u2192 t2\n- NT83 \u2192 t27\n- NT83 \u2192 t47\n- NT82 \u2192 t0\n- NT76 \u2192 t74\n- NT21 \u2192 t6\n- NT79 \u2192 t36\n\nWait, but I don't see an NT6, NT16, etc. Oh, wait, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, the NT rules are all starting with NT, like NT3, NT59, etc. Let me list all NT rules to see if there's an NT6.\n\nLooking through the given NT rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't82' (twice)\n- NT29 \u2192 t42\n- NT77 \u2192 t42\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT68 \u2192 t21\n- NT0 \u2192 t42\n- NT56 \u2192 t27\n- NT16 \u2192 t3\n- NT59 \u2192 t2\n- NT83 \u2192 t27\n- NT83 \u2192 t47\n- NT82 \u2192 t0\n- NT76 \u2192 t74\n- NT21 \u2192 t6\n\nAh, I see NT21 \u2192 t6. So in the string, the token `t6` could come from NT21 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo after reversing, the string so far is `t3 t6 t47 t82 t2 t0`. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. When reversing, the string is processed from end to start, so the last token is `t3`, then `t6`, then `t47`, etc. So the order is `t3, t6, t47, t82, t2, t0` when considered in reverse.\n\nBut I think I should approach it differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step from the start.\n\nThe entire string is `t0 t2 t82 t47 t6 t3`.\n\nI start with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string must begin with NT43 \u2192 ... and NT61 \u2192 ...\n\nFrom the grammar, NT61 \u2192 't33'. But the string starts with `t0`. So does any NT61 production yield `t0`? Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT61 \u2192 't33', which is a terminal. So NT61 contributes `t33`. But the string starts with `t0`. That's a mismatch. Unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. The grammar's S is NT43 NT61. So S produces NT43 followed by NT61. So the entire string must be the concatenation of whatever NT43 generates and NT61 generates.\n\nIn our string, the first part is `t0`, but NT61 \u2192 t33. So maybe the first production is not S \u2192 NT43 NT61 but something else. Wait, no, S must produce NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo perhaps the entire string must be split into two parts, one generated by NT43 and the other by NT61. Let's see. The string is 6 tokens long: `t0 t2 t82 t47 t6 t3`. Maybe NT43 generates the first part and NT61 the second part.\n\nWait, but NT61 must generate `t33`, so the second part of the string can't be generated by NT61 unless it's actually `t33`. Hmm, but our string is `t0 t2 t82 t47 t6 t3`, which ends with `t3`, which matches the production NT3 \u2192 't82' and also NT3 \u2192 't87' and 't42'. Wait, but I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that the string is generated by S \u2192 NT43 NT61 is correct, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT43's derivation and NT61's derivation.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: left part for NT43 and right part for NT61. The total tokens must be split such that NT43's production length plus NT61's production length equals 6.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules for NT61. The production for NT61 is \u2192 't33'. So NT61 contributes one token, `t33`. Therefore, the string must end with `t33`? But the string ends with `t3`. Therefore, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, so perhaps S \u2192 NT43 NT61 cannot produce the given string because NT61 must produce `t33`, which doesn't match the last `t3`. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another production for NT61. Looking back, in the grammar, I only see NT61 \u2192 't33'. So unless the production is different, which it isn't, S \u2192 NT43 NT61 can't generate a string ending with `t3`. So the string can't be generated, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing some NT rules where terminal symbols appear elsewhere. Let me check all the NT rules to see if any produce `t3`.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't82' (twice)\n- NT29 \u2192 t42\n- NT77 \u2192 t42\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT68 \u2192 t21\n- NT0 \u2192 t42\n- NT56 \u2192 t27\n- NT16 \u2192 t3\n- NT192 \u2192 whatever, but none here.\n\nWait, wait, I see NT16 \u2192 't3'. So if NT16 can produce `t3`, which is in the string as the last symbol.\n\nBut earlier, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and NT61 must produce `t33`, which would end the string with `t33`, but the given string ends with `t3`. Therefore, it's impossible.\n\nUnless NT16 can also produce other terminals or maybe some other production.\n\nWait, NT16 has the production \u2192 't3'. So does NT68, NT27, etc. But the problem is that in S \u2192 NT43 NT61, NT61 must produce `t33`, but the given string ends with `t3`. Therefore, it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way that the NT61 production could chain or produce more symbols to reach `t3`? But the production for NT61 is only \u2192 't33', which is a single terminal. So no, NT61 can't produce anything else.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-73","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string `t27 t42 t25 t36 t74 t40 t47` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way of structuring context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production. In this grammar, I see that every rule seems to be either producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So, yeah, it's in CNF.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the derivation starts with S, and each rule splits into two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t27 t42 t25 t36 t74 t40 t47`. Let's parse this into a sequence of terminals: t27, t42, t25, t36, t74, t40, t47.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar uses a series of non-terminals, I'll probably have to look at the production rules to see how the terminals can be derived.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n- NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n- NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT68 \u2192 't21'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT56 \u2192 't27'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3'\n- NT59 \u2192 't2'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't47'\n- NT82 \u2192 't0'\n- NT76 \u2192 't74'\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, I see that there are two rules for NT83: one produces 't27' and another 't47'. So, NT83 can be a terminal or another non-terminal. Interesting.\n\nThe string is seven terminals long. Let's count the steps needed. Since each application of a production splits into two, the derivation tree will have a height that's logarithmic with the length of the string. But perhaps for this string, we can find a way to break it down.\n\nLet's start from the string and see if we can reverse-engineer how it could have been generated. Each terminal must be a result of a production rule ending in that terminal.\n\nStarting with the first token, t27. Looking at the rules, NT27 \u2192 t25 (but that's a terminal, but we have t27). Hmm, wait, let's check the NT27 rule: NT27 \u2192 't25'? Wait, no, checking the list, I see NT27 \u2192 t25. So that's an immediate terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t27. So how does t27 come about? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT27 directly as a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT27 \u2192 t25. So, how to get t27? Wait, perhaps t27 is a terminal symbol. Wait, but I don't see any rule that starts with NT27 and produces t27. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't25' (so, a production that leads to t25; that's one rule)\n- NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25' (another rule, but perhaps that's all)\n\nWait, wait a second. Looking at the production rules, NT27 has two options:\n\n1. NT27 \u2192 't25' (terminals)\n2. Does it have another production? Wait, in the initial rules, I think it's just one rule: NT27 \u2192 t25. Wait, the user provided:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n\nThat's it? So NT27 can only go to t25. So how does the string have t27? That's puzzling because t27 isn't a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking back at the user-provided rules: the last rules are:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 't36'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't47'\n- etc.\n\nWait, but for NT27, according to the rules, it's only:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't25' \u2014 so if the string has t27, that terminal can't be produced by this grammar. That's conflicting. So perhaps the string can't be generated because t27 isn't in the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but looking at the entire list of production rules, I only see terminals as part of the NT productions. Let me check all terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- t27\n- t42\n- t25\n- t36\n- t74\n- t40\n- t47\n- t0\n- 't21' (from NT68)\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar's terminals are these symbols, meaning that any terminal in the string must be part of these. So, in the string `t27 t42 t25 t36 t74 t40 t47`, t27 is present. But in the production rules, do any non-terminals produce t27?\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT83 has two rules: production to t27 and t47.\n\nSo, NT83 can produce t27 and t47. But other NTs don't directly produce t27 except NT83.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t27. So how does that come about? If the start symbol is S \u2192 NT43 NT61, each of those must be derived from some productions.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nSuppose we have the string as a series of terminals, and we need to reverse-engineer how they were produced.\n\nThe string is [t27, t42, t25, t36, t74, t40, t47].\n\nStarting from the first symbol, t27:\n\nWe need to find a production for NT (some non-terminal) that can produce t27. From the rules, looking at NT27, it only produces t25. Wait, no\u2014looking again, NT27's rule is NT27 \u2192 t25. So t27 isn't directly a terminal here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check each rule again.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any rule that directly produces t27 as a terminal except NT83 \u2192 t27. But in our string, t27 is the first symbol, so how would that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps the entire derivation starts with S, so S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nWe need to see if the string can be generated from NT43 NT61, with each step expanding the non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string, mapping it to potential derivations.\n\nLet's consider the string as a sequence of terminals, and we want to see if it's derived from S by substituting non-terminals with their terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the start symbol S, which splits into NT43 and NT61.\n\nLet's see what NT43 and NT61 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nWait, so NT61 produces t33, which is a terminal. So the right side of NT61 is t33.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT43 t33.\n\nThus,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t47 t82 t82 t87 t82 t87 t87 t82`, and the grammar consists of a bunch of productions. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, to get S, I need to expand NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at NT43's production: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So, I need to expand those. NT83 has two options: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or NT83 \u2192 t27. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT27 NT3 or NT77 \u2192 t42. Wait, but the first option for NT83 can be further expanded. Let's note the possibilities.\n\nLet's track down the entire expansion path for S.

So, each step, I have to choose which production to take for each part.\n\nWait, but the key is that each non-terminal must eventually be replaced by terminal strings. So, each step from a non-terminal should eventually lead to a terminal symbol, either directly or through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string given: it alternates between t47, t82, t87, etc. So, I'm thinking about whether the terminals in the grammar can produce these tokens.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- NT43 starts with NT83 and NT77. Let's see what NT83 can produce.\n\nNT83 can be either NT86 NT79 or t27. Wait, but if it's t27, that's a terminal. But in the string, we have t47. Hmm. So, does NT83 ever expand to t47?\n\nWait, checking the productions for NT83: in the given grammar, NT83 \u2192 t27 or t47 (I think I see two options).

Because in the user's message, it's written as:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\n\nSo yes, NT83 can directly produce 't47' as one option. Okay, so NT83 has a production to 't47'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at other non-terminals:\n\nLooking for other terminals:\n\n- NT62 can produce 't0' and NT82 can produce 't0' or 't42'.\n\nWait, but in any case, let's see the production steps.\n\nLet me outline S's production: S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nSo, to generate the string, we need to have the entire string generated by expanding NT43 and NT61.\n\nFirst, expand NT43. The production is NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nSo, NT43 expands into NT83 NT77.\n\nThen, let's expand NT83: it can be either t47 or other things. For the first t47, we'll probably have to choose the production that gives t47, because the string starts with t47.\n\nSo, NT83 \u2192 t47.\n\nBut wait, for NT83, the options are:\n\n1. NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 (this is one production)\n2. NT83 \u2192 t47 (second production)\n\nSo, in the expansion, when we have NT83, we can choose between these two options. In this case, since the string starts with t47, we'd choose the second production, making NT83 become t47.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014no, that's not quite right. Because in context-free grammars, each production is an immediate replacement. So, when expanding NT83, you can only choose one production, but in the string, the first token is t47, so that suggests that NT83 must have produced t47. So that would be a possible path.\n\nSo, after expanding S to NT43 NT61, then NT43 \u2192 t47. So, the first symbol is t47.\n\nNow, the string is t47 followed by t82, t82, etc.\n\nSo after the first t47, we have t82s and t87s.\n\nNow, let's expand NT61.\n\nNT61's production is \u2192 't33'.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial production for NT61 is: NT61 is defined as 't33' \u2014 according to the grammar, NT61 \u2192 't33'. So, expanding NT61 gives t33. But in the string, we have t47 as the first symbol, so that would mean the next symbols must come from a different path.\n\nWait, but the given grammar in the user's message says:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nHmmm, but the string starts with t47, which cannot come from 't33'. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so if S \u2192 NT43 NT61, then NT43 produces t47, and NT61 produces t33. But that would make the string start with t47 t33, but the given string starts with t47 t82 t82 t87... So unless I've misanalyzed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grammar definitions. Let me confirm.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nAnd NT83 \u2192 t47 OR NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because NT83 would have a recursion. Because NT83 can produce NT86 and NT77, one of which can lead to another NT83? Hmm, I'm not sure.

{"custom_id":"request-79","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is \"t40 t6 t21 t36 t33 t3 t33 t2\", and the grammar has a bunch of productions. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The goal is to see if we can derive the string by expanding the start symbol S step by step, following the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which immediately expands to NT43 NT61 according to the first production: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals (NT43 and NT61) needs to be expanded. Let's take NT43 first. Looking through the productions, NT43 has two options: NT83 NT77 or it's a terminal. Wait, let me check again: the productions for NT43 are actually two options? Wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me go through the productions properly.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT43 can go to NT83 NT77, and also from the initial problem statement, there's another production: NT43 \u2192 't40'. Oh, so NT43 is a non-terminal that can be either NT83 NT77 or the terminal 't40'. Similarly, NT61 has the production NT61 \u2192 't33'. So, the derivation should branch here.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and then expanding NT43 and NT61.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT61. From the grammar, NT61 \u2192 't33', which is a terminal. So, that's straightforward; NT61 becomes 't33'.\n\nNow, NT43 can either be expanded into non-terminals or be 't40'. So, to form the string, if we take NT43 \u2192 't40', then the string so far would be 't40' followed by 't33', so 't40 t33'. But the given string starts with 't40 t6 t21 t36 t33...', which suggests that after 't40', there's 't6', then 't21', etc. So, perhaps not, unless NT43 is expanding into non-terminals that further expand into those terminals.\n\nWait, but NT43 has another production: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So, perhaps the correct path is to expand NT43 into NT83 NT77. Let's try that.\n\nSo, now we have S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 NT83 NT77 NT61.\n\nNow, each of these NTs (83,77,61) needs to be expanded. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT83's productions: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or 't27'. The string has 't40 t6 t21 t36 t33 t3 t33 t2' so after 't40', we have 't6', which is a terminal.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can't get to 't6' from NT83 if it goes to 't27'. So, perhaps we need another path. Alternatively, perhaps I need to backtrack and see if there's a better way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards from the string. Let me see if I can parse the string using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t40 t6 t21 t36 t33 t3 t33 t2.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, grammar rules don't chain together in a way that would place these in that order unless each step is properly formed.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, which allows each production to only have two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the derivation is a binary tree, with each step expanding non-terminals into two parts.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT43 NT61. After expanding NT61 to 't33', the string starts with 't33'. But the given string starts with 't40', which comes from NT43 \u2192 't40'. So, if NT43 is 't40', then the first part is 't40', followed by 't33' from NT61. Then the string would be 't40 t33...', but the input string has 't40 t6...' as the first two elements. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the string. Wait, no, the given string is \"t40 t6 t21 t36 t33 t3 t33 t2\". So, it starts with 't40', so that would mean that NT43 must expand to 't40'. But that would make the first part 't40', then NT61 is 't33', so the next part is 't33', but the given string has after 't40' comes 't6', then 't21', 't36', etc., which don't match 't33'. So, perhaps the string is not generated by the grammar because it doesn't start with 't40 t33'.\n\nWait, but maybe the NT61 expansion is different. Let me check NT61's productions again. Yes, NT61 \u2192 't33', so that's a terminal. So, NT61 will produce 't33', meaning that the second part must be 't33'. Therefore, the string starts with 't40' followed by 't33', but the given string has 't40' followed by 't6', which is different.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't40 t6 t21...', perhaps that's not compatible. Unless, maybe NT43 expands into NT83 NT77, and then those expand into other symbols that lead to 't6 t21...'. Let me try that.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 NT83 NT77 NT61.\n\nNow, each of NT83, NT77, NT61 is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT83: NT83 can be 't27' or NT86 NT79.\n\nSimilarly, NT77: NT77 can be 't42' or NT27 NT21.\n\nWait, but the given string has 't6', which is a terminal, so we need to see if any of these non-terminals can expand into 't6'.\n\nLet me check all non-terminals to see if any produce 't6'. From the given grammar:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can go to 't6', but from the rules I think only NT27's production is NT27 \u2192 't25'. So, there's no 't6' terminal in the productions. Hmm, that's a problem. Because 't6' could not come from any of the productions as a terminal. So, perhaps the string is invalid because it includes 't6' which isn't produced by any non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again to ensure I didn't miss anything. Looking through the productions, each NT is either a combination of two NTs or a terminal. The terminals given are: 't40', 't6', 't21', 't36', 't33', 't82', 't76', 't77', 't86', 't27', 't0', 't59', 't16', 't83', 't43', 't79', 't9', etc. So, 't6' is a terminal, but looking at all productions, none of the non-terminals produce 't6'. Therefore, 't6' cannot appear in any generated string from this grammar. So, the given string must be invalid because it contains 't6', which isn't present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal symbol ('t6') that is not part of any production rule.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Here's what I have:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n- NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n- NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- ... (and so on for all the other rules)\n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals are defined multiple times with slightly different rules. For example, NT43 has two productions: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47. Hmm, that might get a bit tricky, but I think it's correct as is.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t33 t42 t87 t40 t2 t2 t87 t6 t6`. Let me parse this. The string is a sequence of terminals, and in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so each step in the parse should reduce a node in the parse tree by reducing a node each time.\n\nI think the standard approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, like recursive descent or using the parser's table. Since I'm not fully comfortable with building the entire parse table, maybe I can try to manually expand the string step by step.\n\nLet me start with the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, in the parse tree, S will have two children: NT43 and NT61.\n\nThe string starts with 't33', which I suspect is the expansion of NT61. Looking at the rules, NT61 \u2192 't33'. That's direct. So the first part is matched: 't33' consumes the first token, and the next part must be NT43. Looking at NT43's rules: it can be either NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47. Wait, both are two non-terminals, so NT43 can only contribute two more symbols each time. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAfter 't33', the string continues with 't42', 't87', 't40', 't2', 't2', 't87', 't6', 't6'. So, after NT61, we have NT43. Let's see how NT43 can be expanded. Looking at NT43's rules:\n\n1. NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n2. NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47\n\nSo, in this case, NT43 is expanded into two non-terminals each time. Let me pick the first one for now: NT83 NT77.\n\nWhat are the symbols after 't33'? The next is 't42'. So, after 't33', the next symbol is 't42'. So, I need to expand NT43 into NT83 NT77. Let me see if the next two symbols are 't42'... Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the entire process as building a parse tree. S is the root, with NT43 and NT61. NT61 is 't33', so I consume 't33' and go into NT43.\n\nNow, NT43 is either NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47. Let's say we take the first option. So, NT43 expands to NT83 NT77. So, we now have to process NT83 and NT77. \n\nThe next symbol after 't33' is 't42', but wait, after 't33', the string is 't42 t87 t40 t2 t2 t87 t6 t6'. So, after 't33', the next is 't42'. But in the first case, we have NT83 NT77. So, the production is: NT83 followed by NT77. So, when we expand NT43 into NT83 NT77, our next tokens should be 't42' and whatever comes next.\n\nSo, let's look at NT83. What's the expansion for NT83? The rules are NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 NT27 NT47. Let's choose the first option for now: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nSo, now we're processing NT86 and NT79. The next token is 't42'. Let's see. So after NT83, it's NT86, which is followed by NT79. Let's check NT86's rule: NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. So, NT86 expands into NT82 NT76.\n\nNow, we have NT82 and NT76. The next token is 't42', so let's process NT82. Wait, NT76? Let's see the rules for NT76: it's a terminal 't74'. So NT76 \u2192 't74'. Similarly, NT76 is a leaf. So, when we expand NT76, it's 't74', which is a terminal. So that's a problem because our current position after processing 't42' might not align correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Maybe I should try a different expansion path.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's model the parse as a queue, processing each token step by step using the grammar.\n\nQueue starts as: [t33, t42, t87, t40, t2, t2, t87, t6, t6]\n\n1. S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, we process NT61 first.\n\n   NT61 \u2192 't33' \u2192 matches the first token. Now queue becomes [t42, t87, t40, t2, t2, t87, t6, t6], and we move to NT43.\n\n2. NT43 can be expanded into either NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47. Let's pick NT83 NT77.\n\n   Now, queue becomes [t42, t87, t40, t2, t2, t87, t6, t6]. We need to process NT83 and NT77 in order.\n\n3. Process NT83. Its first option is NT86 NT79.\n\n   So, NT83 expands into NT86 NT79.\n\n   Queue now: [t42, t87, t40, t2, t2, t87, t6, t6] becomes [t86, t79].\n\n   Wait, no, that's not right. The queue after NT61 is processed is [t42, t87, t40, t2, t2, t87, t6, t6]. So, after NT83 expands to NT86 NT79, we consume 't86' and 't79'.\n\n   But the next token is 't42', which doesn't match 't86' or 't79'. So, that path doesn't work.\n\n   Maybe I took the wrong initial expansion for NT43.\n\n4. Let's try the other expansion for NT43: NT83 NT47.\n\n   So, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47.\n\n   Now, the queue after NT61 is [t42, t87, t40, t2, t2, t87, t6, t6]. Now, we have to process NT83 first.\n\n5. NT83 expands to NT86 NT79. Wait, same problem as before. The next token is 't42', which doesn't match NT86 or NT79.\n\n   Maybe NT83 expands differently. Let's consider the other production for NT83: NT83 \u2192 NT27 NT47.\n\n6. So, NT83 \u2192 NT27 NT47.\n\n   Now, we need to process NT27 and NT47.\n\n   Queue after NT61: [t42].\n\n   Processing NT83's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t3 t0 t0 t82 t47 t40 t47 t40 t6`. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and that should help me parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the rules here fit that because they only have two non-terminals on the left and one or a terminal on the right.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's initially at NT9 and NT61 according to the first rule S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Wait, actually, looking again, the rule is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S directly produces two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo I need to see if the string can be split into the combination of these two non-terminals. The string is 9 tokens long: t3, t0, t0, t82, t47, t40, t47, t40, t6.\n\nI think the first step is to parse from the top-down, trying to match the start symbol's productions. Since S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the string must be the result of NT43 producing some part followed by NT61 producing the rest.\n\nSo let's try to see if the string can be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT43 and the second by NT61.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t6. I see that in the rules, NT68 \u2192 t21 and NT0 \u2192 t42, so maybe t6 is part of a larger sequence. Wait, the rule NT27 \u2192 t25, and NT16 \u2192 t3, and NT59 \u2192 t2.\n\nWait, let me list the rules again to see which non-terminals produce what terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t82, t87, t42. Hmm, in the rules provided, NT3 has several options: NT43->'t40', etc. Or perhaps it's a typo. Wait, the rules as given:\n\nLooking at the rules, each line is a production for a non-terminal. For example, NT83 \u2192 t27, t47, etc. So for example, NT43 can be t40 if it follows a certain path. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 t25, NT16 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals and what their immediate productions can produce.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check the string and see if it can be parsed by trying to split it into the first production steps.\n\nLet me split the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT43 NT61.\n\nSo we need the left side of S to produce the first part and the right side to produce the rest.\n\nLet's look at the string:\n\nt3 t0 t0 t82 t47 t40 t47 t40 t6\n\nMaybe the NT61 part would produce the last token, but NT61 \u2192 t33, which isn't a terminal as per the first rule. Wait, no: looking at the rules, the last production is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. NT61's production is just 't33', right? Because in the rules, NT61 \u2192 't33'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules given, the line is \"NT61 -> 't33'\". So yes, NT61 directly produces 't33'. So the last token in the string should be 't33'. But the given string ends with t6, not t33. So this is a problem. That suggests that the string is impossible because the last token must be t33 for NT61, but the string ends with t6.\n\nHmm, that's a red flag. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because the last token is t6, but according to the grammar, the only production for NT61 is 't33'. So that would mean the last token must be t33. Therefore, the answer should be No. But let me be careful because maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse further. Perhaps the NT61 part is part of a larger derivation that could produce multiple tokens. But looking at the rules, NT61 \u2192 't33' and that's it. There are no productions for 't33'. So 't33' is a terminal that can't be further decomposed. Thus, NT61 will produce exactly 't33'.\n\nLooking back at the given string, the last token is t6. So the string's last element is t6, which must come from NT61, which only produces t33, not t6. Therefore, the string can't be produced by this grammar because the last token is wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the string again.\n\nThe string is: `t3 t0 t0 t82 t47 t40 t47 t40 t6` \u2192 let's count:\n\n1. t3\n\n2. t0\n\n3. t0\n\n4. t82\n\n5. t47\n\n6. t40\n\n7. t47\n\n8. t40\n\n9. t6\n\nSo nine tokens. So the last token is t6, which is supposed to come from NT61's production, which is 't33'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the way the string is split. Maybe the splits occur at different points. Let's see.\n\nSuppose that NT43 and NT61 each produce multiple tokens. For example, N1 produces the first four tokens and N2 produces the last five. But we need to see if that's possible.\n\nStarting with NT61: it can only produce 't33', so exactly one token. Therefore, the part after NT43 must start with the second token and end before the last token. So the string split would be: NT43 produces t3, t0, t0, t82, t47, t40, t47, t40, and NT61 produces t6. But that's impossible because NT61 only produces 't33', which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the split is such that NT61 is the rightmost part, producing a single token, so the string before that must end with the last token t6. But that's not possible because NT61 can't produce t6, it can only produce t33.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the rules. Let me check again.\n\nIn the given rules, for example, NT29 --> 't42', NT3 --> 't82', 't87', 't42'; NT27 --> 't25'; NT68 --> 't21'; NT0 --> 't42'; etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread NT61's production. Let me re-examine the given rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nYes, here it is: \"NT61 -> 't33'\". So NT61 can only produce the single token 't33', which isn't present in the given string as the last token is t6.\n\nTherefore, the string ends with 't6', which isn't possible because the only production for NT61 gives 't33', which would have to match, but it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string ends with 't6', which is impossible since NT61 must produce 't33'. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, but in the productions, there's no rule for NT3, so that production can't be correct.

The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is `t2 t42 t87 t25 t42 t21 t87 t21 t87 t33`.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse the grammar correctly. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT43 NT61. So S is broken down into two non-terminals.\n- These non-terminals then produce other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and NT83 can further break down into NT86 NT79, and so on.\n- The string we have is a sequence of terminals: t2, t42, t87, t25, t42, t21, t87, t21, t87, t33.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived by applying the production rules step by step, starting from S and breaking down each non-terminal into terminals or other non-terminals until we only have terminals left, matching the input string exactly.\n\nI'll start by trying to trace the derivation process. Let's consider the string:\n\nt2 t42 t87 t25 t42 t21 t87 t21 t87 t33.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t2. Looking at the grammar, where does t2 come from? Scanning all production rules, I see NT27 \u2192 t25, NT83 \u2192 t27, and NT45 \u2192 t28. Wait, that's not directly t2. Wait, looking again: \n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT43 has rules like \u2192 NT83 NT77 and \u2192 t40\n- NT3 \u2192 t82 and t87, and others\n- Wait, looking for a rule that produces t2 directly. Scanning all the right-hand sides, I don't immediately see any production that directly gives t2 on the right side. Hmm, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check again: The rules as given are:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nWait, that's two productions for NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t82 and NT3 \u2192 t87. So NT3 can be t82 or t87.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t2:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production directly giving t2 as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me go through each rule carefully:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t25 (so t25 comes from NT27)\n- NT68 \u2192 t21 (so t21 comes from NT68)\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and also NT83 \u2192 t27 (since NT83's rules include \u2192 t27)\nWait, no, looking back, NT83 has \u2192 NT86 NT79 and another rule is NT83 \u2192 t47. So, NT83 can produce t47 as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 \u2192 t42.\n\nOk, so to have a t2 in the string, perhaps there's a mistake because I don't see any production rule that directly produces t2. That means either I'm missing something or the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I need to trace back through the productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking for where t2 might come from\u2014maybe it's part of a longer sequence. But in the given string, t2 occurs as the first symbol. So, it needs to be directly derived from a non-terminal that has a production leading to t2, which seems not to be present in the grammar. So that would mean it's impossible for t2 to appear in the generated string.\n\nThat would immediately mean the answer is No because the first symbol isn't possible to derive.\n\nBut wait, maybe I overlooked a production. Let's list all productions:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t82, t87\n- NT43 \u2192 t40, and breakdown further into NT83 NT77, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me re-examine the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT3's productions:\n\nYes, it seems there are two: NT3 can be t82 or t87.\n\nWait, but where does t2 come from? Scanning all the right-hand sides, I don't see any 't2' terminal. Only t25, t21, t40, t82, t87, etc. So, t2 isn't directly produced by any production rule. Therefore, t2 cannot appear in any string derived from this grammar because there's no production that gives t2 as a terminal symbol.\n\nTherefore, the given string starts with t2, which isn't possible.

So perhaps t36 is part of a non-terminal's production.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a non-terminal that when expanded, includes t36. Let's check.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79. But does t86 or t79 get mapped to t36? No, from the given rules, NT86 \u2192 t74, and NT79 \u2192 t36.

NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76, and NT79 \u2192 t36.\n\nWait, let me correct that. So, when NT79 is expanded, it produces t36.\n\nSimilarly, NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76, and NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT3, which would produce t21 and t25.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have t21, which is NT68's expansion.\n\nOK, perhaps a better approach is to try to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t36 t47 t21 t36 t87 t40 t87 t25 t0 t47 t33\n\nBut each of these terms corresponds to either a terminal or an NT expansion.\n\nLet me see: Each t is a terminal generated by an NT.\n\nSo, the string can be split into 11 terms, each of which must be the result of a production. But since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the left-hand side of the productions are single non-terminals, meaning that each term must be derived from a single NT. So, the entire string must be a sequence of derived terminals, each from an NT.\n\nWait, but how do the non-terminals connect? Because the grammar builds up the structure. For example, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the derivation starts with S, which splits into NT43 and NT61. Then each of these would split into their own terms, perhaps.\n\nWait, but each NT can produce multiple symbols, which would correspond to one or more terms in the string.\n\nWait, no. In context-free grammar, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or one terminal. So, if I have NT43, it could expand into multiple NTs and terminals, which in turn expand further until only terminals are left.\n\nSo, the string can be thought of as the concatenation of the terminals produced by each expansion of the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to try building the derivation tree from the given string.\n\nLet me see.

Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT82 is not a production, let's check:\n\nWait, the grammar rules provided include:\n\n- NT82 is not defined as a non-terminal. Wait, no, the grammar is the productions:\n\nFrom the provided rules, NT82 is:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76.\n\nWait, that is, NT86 can produce NT82 and NT76.\n\nWait, no, the grammar shows:\n\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76 : so, NT86 can be substituted with NT82 and NT76.\n\nBut looking for NT82: does it appear as a rule in any production? No, in the given grammar, I only see NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. So NT82 is not a non-terminal; perhaps I made a mistake or misread.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all the production rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar again:\n\nS \u2192 NT83 NT61\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT76 \u2192 't74'\n\nWait, so NT86 can produce NT82 and NT76. So in this case, NT82 is a non-terminal. Because it's on the right-hand side of a production.\n\nBut wait, in the definitions, looking for NT82: is there a production for NT82? Let me scan the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for NT82, I don't see one. The closest is NT82 in NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32 and other places, but NT82 isn't a non-terminal but a terminal. Because in the string, it's one of the terminal symbols.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for each rule in the grammar, check if the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nFrom the given, the rules are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT83 NT61 (NT83 and NT61 are non-terminals)\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT79 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nWait, no, let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT68 NT79?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading.

The string is `t25 t0 t6 t0 t87 t6 t2 t74 t2 t0 t27 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF since all rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which means the entire string should be derived from these two non-terminals. So, the first step is to see if both parts can generate sequences that match the given string segments.\n\nLooking at NT43 and NT61, I need to expand each to see what terminals they can produce. \n\nStarting with NT43: The rules for NT43 are \u2192 NT83 NT77 and \u2192 NT45 NT28. Let's see their expansions:\n\nNT43 can go to NT45 NT28. NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3, and NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59. Each of these has sub-productions as well. Let's try to find a path where NT43 can produce a terminal part.\n\nWait, maybe instead of expanding each non-terminal step by step, I should look for any production that directly leads to a terminal. For example, NT27 \u2192 't25' directly. So if I can reach NT27 in a path, that's a possible terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 can become NT83 NT77. Then NT83 can go to NT86 NT79 or NT83 \u2192 t47. So if I choose the production NT83 \u2192 t47, that would be a terminal. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 t42, which is another terminal.\n\nSo, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 \u2192 t47 t42. So from NT43, I can get t47 t42. But wait, I need the string to start with t25, which comes from NT27. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the string starts with t25, which is derived from NT27. So I need to see if NT43 can produce something that starts with t25. Let's see:\n\nNT43 can reach NT45 NT28. NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3, and NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59. From here, NT27 \u2192 t25. So one possible path is NT43 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT27 \u2192 t25. So that would generate t25.\n\nBut the string starts with t25, which is good. Now, after t25, what comes next? Let's look at the string: t25 t0 t6 t0 t87 t6 t2 t74 t2 t0 t27 t6. So after t25, we have t0.\n\nSo after NT27 (which gives t25), the next part in the grammar would come from the other NT in NT43 \u2192 NT45 NT28. We have NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3. So after t25, the next element is t0? Wait, but let's see what NT28 does.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59. NT27 \u2192 t25, so that's t25 again. But in the string, after t25 is t0. So this seems off. Maybe I'm missing an alternative path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider expanding NT43 differently. Let's try NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. Let's see what they produce.\n\nNT83 can go to NT86 NT79, and NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, and NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32. Let's see: NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3, NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59. NT27 \u2192 t25, NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79. NT68 \u2192 NT61, which is part of the initial S, but not a terminal. Wait, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any terminals in the production of NT83: NT83 \u2192 t47 or t42? Wait, looking back, the rules for NT83 are:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 NT47. Oh, yeah, in the last lines, it's written as NT83 -> t42 and also -> t47. Wait, no, in the rules, it's written as:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\n\nWait, looking back: the user wrote:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\nAnd also NT83 -> t42? Wait, I need to double-check.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules, under NT83, it's:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\nAnd also: NT83 -> t42 is there? Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOh, yes, in the rules, it's:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\nAlso, under NT77: NT77 -> t42.\n\nWait, but no, under NT83, it's only two rules: \u2192 NT86 NT79 and \u2192 t47. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, in the given rules, under NT83: \n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\n\nYes, so only two options, and t47. So NT83 can't produce t42 directly. Wait, perhaps under NT82, which is part of another production.\n\nWait, the string after t25 is t0, so perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar, but maybe it's better to build the parse tree.\n\nLet's try to see the string: t25 t0 t6 t0 t87 t6 t2 t74 t2 t0 t27 t6.\n\nSo that's 12 tokens. Since the initial S produces NT43 NT61, which then becomes two parts. Let's split the string into parts that could be generated by NT43 and NT61.\n\nBut let's try to see the possible way. For NT61, according to the grammar, NT61 \u2192 't33'. But in the string, after t25, the next is t0. So if NT61 can't generate 't33', that would be a problem, unless I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. The initial S is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the entire string must be generated from NT43 followed by NT61. Therefore, the string should be the concatenation of what NT43 generates and what NT61 generates.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: the first half (maybe) generated by NT43 and the second by NT61, but the exact split isn't known. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is formed by NT43's expansion followed by NT61's expansion.\n\nWait, but the string is `t25 t0 t6 t0 t87 t6 t2 t74 t2 t0 t27 t6`. So maybe NT61 can only produce the latter part, ending with t6, but let me check what NT61 can generate.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT61: NT61 \u2192 't33'. So NT61 can produce only 't33'. But in the string, the last token is 't6'. So that can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar, because the last part (the last token 't6') would have to come from NT61, which only produces 't33'. \n\nWait, that might be the key point. Let's check: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the entire string should be the concatenation of NT43's expansion and NT61's expansion. If NT61 can only produce 't33', then the last token must be 't33', but the string ends with 't6'. Therefore, the string is not possible.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The string is 12 tokens. NT43 expands to some sequence, and NT61 must expand to the remaining tokens. But since NT61 can only produce 't33', the last token must be 't33', but it's 't6', which is different.

The string is `t40 t25 t0 t47 t74 t2 t87 t3 t36 t82 t0 t27`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT9, NT59, etc.) and terminals (like t40, t25, etc.). The terminals are the actual symbols that appear in the strings generated by the grammar, while the non-terminals are like placeholders that get replaced by sequences of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe given string has a total of 12 tokens, all of which are terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let's see some key production rules:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77 or NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT61 is fixed to 't33', so that's helpful.\n- NT25 -> 't25' (assuming there's a production rule for that)\n- Other NTs have two non-terminals each, like NT9 -> NT68 NT16, etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t25 as the second token. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule for NT25 -> t25. So maybe I need to figure out where t25 comes from. Is there a rule that leads to t25? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding; maybe the non-terminals like NT25 are part of the larger productions.\n\nHold on, in the given string, the second token is t25, which is directly a terminal. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminals produce t25. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t25. The production for NT27 is NT27 -> 't25'. So maybe t25 comes from NT27 via the production NT27 -> 't25'.\n\nWait, so if we have a non-terminal NT27, and one of its productions is t25, then in the string, t25 must be preceded by symbols that can derive to NT27. So how does that fit into the longer string?\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the derivation. The string starts with t40. Looking at the grammar, NT43 can produce 't40' directly, as per the rule NT43 -> 't40'. So maybe S starts with NT43. Since S -> NT43 NT61, and NT61 -> t33, so the first part of the string would be t40 followed by t33. But in the given string, the second token is t25, not t33. Hmm, that's a conflict. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. The given string is `t40 t25 t0 t47 ...`, so starting with t40, which would come from NT43. Then NT61 is fixed to t33, but the string after t40 is t25, which is something else. That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the string isn't starting with S directly? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe S derives into NT43 NT61, and both of those are non-terminals. So the string's first part is t40 (from NT43) and then t33 (from NT61). But the string starts with t40 followed by t25, so that would require t25 to come from somewhere else. Unless perhaps it's a different path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT43 can go through another production. Looking back, NT43 -> NT83 NT77 or NT43 -> 't40'. If instead of taking t40, NT43 takes NT83 NT77, then both of those are non-terminals, and we can expand further.\n\nSo let me try that. S starts by expanding to NT43 NT61. NT43 expands to NT83 NT77, and NT61 is t33. So the first part would be NT83 NT77 followed by t33. But in the given string, the second token is t25, not the beginning of another NT. Hmm, this might not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is t40 followed by other symbols, but I'm getting confused. Let me list out the entire string: t40, t25, t0, t47, t74, t2, t87, t3, t36, t82, t0, t27.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT43 NT61. NT43 can go to 't40' or NT83 NT77.\n\nIf we choose 't40' for NT43, then the next symbol should be whatever NT61 produces, which is t33. But the string after t40 is t25, not t33. So that path isn't matching.\n\nSo perhaps we need to choose the other production for NT43: NT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nSo now, NT83 and NT77 are non-terminals, each of which can produce other non-terminals or terminals. Let's expand NT83 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions: it can be NT86 NT79 or 't82'. Similarly, NT77 can be NT86 NT42 or 't42'. Wait, no, let me check the grammar again:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79 or NT83 -> 't47'.\n\nAh, right, in the grammar, NT83 can produce either 't47' or a combination of others. So if I take NT83 -> 't47', then the first symbol in this part would be t47. But in the string, after t40 comes t25, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, NT83 expands to NT86 NT79. Let's see what NT86 and NT79 produce.\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76 or 't0'.\n\nNT79 -> NT76 NT42 or 't36'.\n\nWait, in the given grammar: NT86 is defined as NT82 NT76 or 't82'? Wait, looking back:\n\nNo, let's check:\n\nThe grammar list:\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT79 -> NT76 NT42 or 't36'.\n\nSo, let's go step by step. If S is NT43 NT61, and NT43 is NT83 NT77.\n\nThen NT83 is first.\n\nLet's explore NT83 possibilities:\n\nOption 1: NT83 -> 't47': then the string would have t47, but the string starts with t40, so no.\n\nOption 2: NT83 -> NT86 NT79.\n\nSo first, NT86 is expanded, then NT79.\n\nNT86 can be NT82 NT76 or 't82'. So if NT86 is 't82', then after t47 would come t82, but the string is t40, t25, etc. So perhaps NT86 is NT82 NT76.\n\nSo NT86 -> NT82 NT76.\n\nThen, NT82 can produce 't0' or other options? Looking at the grammar, NT82 has a production: NT82 -> 't0' or NT82 is something else? Wait, no. Checking the given grammar, NT82 is defined as NT62 NT0.\n\nSo NT82 is a non-terminal, and it's defined as NT62 NT0. Hmm, but then NT62 is 't25' or something else? Wait, no, the productions for NT62 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production for NT62 is NT62 -> NT45 NT32 or NT62 -> 't25'.\n\nWait, NT62 produces either NT45 NT32 or 't25'. So in this case, NT82 is NT62 NT0.\n\nSo NT82 can be either NT62 NT0 or other?\n\nWait, no, wait. NT82 is a non-terminal, which can produce NT62 NT0 or 't0'?

Wait, the productions for NT43 are:\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT83 NT47\nWait, actually, looking again, the user provided the grammar, and I need to parse those correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar provided is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, so for NT43, there are two productions:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47\n\nWait, that's not right; looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nand\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT47\n\nWait, actually, I think it's:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47\n\nYes, so the two possibilities are NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 or NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 has a production to a terminal: NT61 -> 't33'.\n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which is two non-terminals, NT43 and NT61. So the initial expansion is [NT43, NT61], each eventually deriving into terminal sequences.\n\nSince NT61 directly goes to 't33', that part is easier. So the NT61 part is just 't33'.\n\nNow, the NT43 part is more complex. Since NT43 can either go to NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47.\n\nLet me think about each possibility.\n\nFirst possibility: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nSo, expanding NT43 into NT83 and NT77. Now, NT83 can expand in several ways. Looking at its productions:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or NT83 \u2192 't27' or NT83 \u2192 't47'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT83 has:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT83 NT77? Wait, no. Looking again, I think NT83 has:\n\nNT83 \u2192 't86' NT79?\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The grammar as given:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nWait, correction: looking at the grammar again, NT83 has:\n\nNT83 -> nt86 nt79\n\nand that's it? Or are there more? The user provided:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT83 NT77?

Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and breaking down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is defined as S -> NT43 NT61. So the entire string must be derived from NT43 followed by NT61. Let me check the string structure. The first token is t36, and going through the rest, I see that it's a sequence of terminals. So both NT43 and NT61 must be able to derive sequences that result in the given string.\n\nI'll break down NT43 and NT61 separately.\n\nStarting with NT43. The productions for NT43 are:\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT43 \u2192 NT45 NT3\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT67 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT0 NT27\n- NT16 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- Wait, no, let me correct that. Looking back, NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3, NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out the possible derivations. Let me try to see if NT43 can generate a part of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t36, which is the last part of NT3->'t82', but let me see.\n\nWait, the starting point is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string should be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT43 and NT61.\n\nThe entire string has 13 tokens, so perhaps the derivation is S \u2192 NT43 NT61, each non-terminal expanding into a certain number of tokens that add up to 13. Let me check how many steps each NT can generate.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to work backwards. Let me parse the string to see possible splits into parts that match the endings of the productions.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t42 t82.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT82: NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, and NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32, NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9, etc. Hmm, but let's see what NT82 can produce in terms of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build possible derivation trees.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider building the parse tree from the string.\n\nThe string is: t36 t33 t36 t21 t21 t42 t47 t40 t2 t87 t33 t42 t82.\n\nLet's try to split this string into parts that correspond to the possible productions.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be a result of S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the string is split into two parts: the first part from NT43 and the second part from NT61.\n\nLet me check if the entire string can be split at some point where the first part is generated by NT43 and the second by NT61, with the two parts concatenated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is the concatenation of two parts: one from NT43 and one from NT61.\n\nLet me look at NT43: it can be expanded as NT83 NT77, NT83 as NT86 NT79, and so on. Alternatively, it can derive a terminal 't40' directly.\n\nIf NT43 must produce a string ending with t40, but in our string, the end of the NT43 part is t42, but looking at the string, the entire NT43 part is up to t42, but wait, the string continues beyond t42 into the NT61 part with t82.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find out how each non-terminal can derive a sequence that leads to the string when combined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string ends with t82, which is part of NT82. Let me trace back from 't82'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT82: NT82 \u2192 NT86 NT76, but NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76, which seems recursive. Wait, perhaps NT86 splits into NT82 and NT76. Hmm, maybe that's going into an infinite loop. Alternatively, maybe there's a way for NT86 to derive to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT86: It can go through NT82 and NT76, and then how?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at each non-terminal and see how they can derive to the string.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parser. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the recursive descent parsing method.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t36 t33 t36 t21 t21 t42 t47 t40 t2 t87 t33 t42 t82.\n\nLet's start with the first token, t36. Looking at the grammar, t36 occurs in several non-terminals:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t6 (so not matching t36)\n- NT43 \u2192 t40\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT56 \u2192 t27\n- NT83 \u2192 t42 via NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79, then NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76; NT82 \u2192 ...

Also, 't33' is produced by NT61.\n\nSo, let's try to split the string into parts that can be generated by NT43 and NT61.\n\nThe entire string is:\n\nt36 t33 t36 t21 t21 t42 t47 t40 t2 t87 t33 t42 t82.\n\nWait, that's 13 tokens. Since S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the string is a concatenation of the strings generated by NT43 and NT61.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given inCNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and a single non-terminal or terminal on the right. That should help because for each step, each symbol can expand into two symbols, which is easy for a parsing approach.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t42 t27 t21 t74 t74 t40 t21 t33 t21 t3 t74 t87 t82 t36`.\n\nI notice that there are 14 tokens, all of which are either terminals or likely non-terminals based on the grammar rules. Let me recall that in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, I should parse the string from left to right, breaking it down into chunks that match the grammar rules. Each production can only produce two symbols at a time, so each step in parsing should consist of a single production rule applied.\n\nLet's break down the string into pairs or triplets where applicable. But wait, each production in CNF only has two non-terminals on the left, so each step would reduce a pair of symbols into a single non-terminal. However, terminals can't be split further, so each terminal in the string must be derived directly from a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some symbols are terminals. Let me list the terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, terminals are: t42, t27, t21, t74, t40, t33, t3, t87, t82, t36. \n\nNon-terminals include S, NT9, NT59, NT43, NT83, NT28, NT62, NT45, NT56, NT16, NT86, NT82, NT32, NT61, NT3, NT29, NT77, NT27, NT68, NT0, NT56, NT16, NT59, NT83, NT83, NT82, NT76, NT21, NT79, NT27, NT68, NT0, NT56, NT16, NT59, NT83, NT83, NT82, NT76, NT21, NT79.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Let's make sure I have them all correctly. The grammar rules are:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nWait, that last line seems redundant. Let me correct that. It's likely a typo. Probably, it's meant to be NT83 -> something else, but it's repeated. Perhaps it's a mistake. I'll proceed assuming that NT83 has two productions: NT83 -> NT86 NT79 and NT83 -> NT83 NT47. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe NT83 is not a terminal and has two productions. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT83 NT47\n\nSo yes, NT83 can either produce NT86 NT79 or NT83 NT47. That's a bit tricky.\n\nBut in any case, the terminals are the ones that appear directly in the string, like 't42', 't27', etc.\n\nNow, the given string is 14 tokens long, each separated by spaces. So it's a single string without any spaces\u2014wait, actually, in the question, the string is given as `t42 t27 t21 t74 t74 t40 t21 t33 t21 t3 t74 t87 t82 t36`, but I think they're separated by spaces for readability. So it's a single string consisting of the 14 tokens:\n\n['t42', 't27', 't21', 't74', 't74', 't40', 't21', 't33', 't21', 't3', 't74', 't87', 't82', 't36']\n\nSo the parsing process would start with S, which expands into NT43 NT61. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStep 1: Start with S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nSo S expands to NT43 NT61. Now, NT61 must expand to a terminal. Looking at NT61 \u2192 't33'. So the rightmost symbol is 't33'.\n\nNow, going back, NT43 can expand into either NT83 NT77 or, if it's allowed, maybe another production. Wait, in the grammar, NT43's productions are:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77 and NT43 -> 't40'. Oh, I missed that earlier. So NT43 can be a terminal 't40' or produce NT83 NT77.\n\nGiven that the first token in the string is 't42', which is a terminal, but in the string, the first symbol after S is 't42'. So let me see:\n\nWait, the string starts with 't42', which is a terminal. But according to the grammar, NT43 can be either NT83 NT77 or 't40' or 't43' (if that's a terminal). Wait, in the string, the first part is 't42 t27 t21 t74 t74 t40 t21...'\n\nWait, no, the string given starts with 't42', which is a terminal. So perhaps the string starts with NT43 being a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT43 can be 't40' or can produce NT83 NT77. But in the string, the first symbol is 't42', which suggests that NT43 might be replaced by a different path. Wait, but in the initial expansion, S produces NT43 NT61. So perhaps NT43 needs to expand into NT43's productions, which could be either NT83 NT77 or 't40' or another way.\n\nWait, am I missing a production for NT43 beyond the two non-terminals? Let me check again. In the grammar, NT43's productions are:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, that's it. So, from the grammar, I can see that NT43 has two productions: one that produces two non-terminals and one that produces a single terminal.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is 't42'.

{"custom_id":"request-165","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t33 t3 t0 t82 t87 t82 t2 t21 t33 t36 t40 t27 t6 t21\". \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, or possibly just a single non-terminal leading to something else. However, looking at the grammar provided, it seems every production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, except I notice that some productions like S->NT43 NT61 have two non-terminals. \n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either A->BC, A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, the productions usually fit this except for those that have a terminal and a non-terminal together. Let me check. For example, NT43 has two productions: one to 't40' and another to 't47' and another to 't40', which I think might mean multiple rules for the same non-terminal, which is allowed because in CNF, yes, you can have multiple productions for the same non-terminal.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. The first thing is to parse this string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, so the entire string should be rewritten using the productions until we get to the string.\n\nLet me try to map the string to the grammar. The string is t33 t3 t0 t82 t87 t82 t2 t21 t33 t36 t40 t27 t6 t21.\n\nI'll write this as: t33 t3 t0 t82 t87 t82 t2 t21 t33 t36 t40 t27 t6 t21.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from S. S->NT43 NT61. So the first step is that S is split into two non-terminals, NT43 and NT61. So the first part is NT43 and the second is NT61. So the string should start with something compatible with NT43 and end with something compatible with NT61.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t33. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t33. Looking through the productions, NT3->t82, NT29->t42, NT76->t74, NT0->t42, NT3->t82 again. Oh wait, looking back, I think NT16 has a production NT16->t3, which is not t33. NT68: nt68 doesn't produce t33. Hmm, NT0->t42, so no. NT9: nt9->nt68 nt16. Hmm. \n\nWait, looking for NT43, I see that NT43 has two productions: one is NT43->t40, another is NT43->t47, and another is NT43->t40 again. So NT43 can produce t40 or t47. But the first token is t33, so that's confusing. Wait, does NT33 exist? Or maybe I made a mistake. Looking back at the productions: I don't see any NT33, but I see NT43 and NT3 in different productions. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting NT3->t82. But the starting token is t33, not t3. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce t33. Looking through the given productions, I don't see a direct production for t33. Maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT9: it's NT68 NT16. Not t33. NT59: NT68 NT79. NT43: produces t40 or t47. NT83: produces t86 or t47, etc. Wait, I think I might be looking at some of the productions correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the first non-terminal NT43 can produce something that starts with t33? Or maybe not, because the productions for NT43 don't include t33. Let me check again. The productions for NT3 are to t82 and t87, but t33 is another token.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe the NT43 can produce a sequence that leads to t33 later. Alternatively, perhaps the NT43 can produce something that resolves to t33 through other productions. Let me try to see.\n\nThe first token is t33, which could be the result of NT3->t82 or NT3->t87, but I don't see how that would end with t33. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string should be divided into parts that match the grammar. Since S is NT43 NT61, perhaps we can split the string into two parts, each part being a production of NT43 and NT61 respectively.\n\nLet me try that: the string is 14 tokens long. So the first part for NT43 should translate into 7 tokens, and NT61 should also produce 7 tokens.\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, each rule splits into two non-terminals, so each production would generate two parts. The string is a single sequence, so it might be that each step of the derivation alternates between the two non-terminals, and the sequence is a concatenation of the symbols produced by each derivation step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a parse tree. Let me try to see if the string can be parsed into the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the way to go, but I'm not sure I can apply it correctly here.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's start with S: it expands to NT43 and NT61. So the string should be two parts generated by NT43 and NT61, respectively.\n\nLet me see if the string starts with something matching NT43 and ends with something matching NT61.\n\nThe first part is t33 t3 t0 t82 t87 t82 t2. The second part is t21 t33 t36 t40 t27 t6 t21.\n\nWait, but NT61 is a production that goes to 't33'. So the end of the second part is t21 t33 t36 etc., but NT61's production is 't33'. So perhaps that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split is different. Maybe I should check all possible splits.\n\nBut this could take a while. Alternatively, let's consider the first token t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does any non-terminal directly produce t33? From the given rules, I don't see any NT33. But NT3 does produce 't82' and 't87', but not t33. So perhaps t33 has to come from a more complex derivation.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the rules, NT43 can produce t40 or t47. So perhaps the entire string starts with NT43 generating parts that eventually result in t33. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because if NT43 can only produce t40 or t47, then the start would need to generate t33 somehow else. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a production where a non-terminal eventually produces t33, but looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT33. So maybe t33 isn't in the language, making the answer 'No'. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me look through all the productions that produce t as terminals. Some terminals appear in the productions:\n\nt33 appears in NT83->t83, but NT83's productions are to 't86' or 't74' or to 't47'. So t33 isn't directly produced by anyone, except maybe indirectly.\n\nWait, no, looking at the given productions, the only terminals are t33, t3, t0, t82, t87, t40, t27, t6, t21, t74, t76, t47, t86, t36, etc. So the first token is t33. Since no NT directly produces t33, unless it's part of a longer production that eventually leads to t33, which I don't see.\n\nIf no NT can produce t33 directly, then the string can't be generated because the first symbol t33 can't come from any production in the grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the productions. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking through the productions:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My task is to determine if the string is generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It starts with S, which seems to be the start symbol. The grammar consists of a bunch of production rules, each starting with 'NT' followed by a number except for the top-level rule, which is S -> NT43 NT61. Then each of these NTL... rules (like NT9, NT59, etc.) seems to break down into more components until some of them become terminals, represented by 't' followed by a number, or some non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t3 t25 t36 t36 t2 t0 t25 t25 t36 t82 t42 t82 t0 t21 t21.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, the string must have a derivation starting from S and ending with the given string. To figure this out, I think I should work backwards from the string, collapsing the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me list the string components again for clarity: t3, t25, t36, t36, t2, t0, t25, t25, t36, t82, t42, t82, t0, t21, t21.\n\nI need to see if each non-terminal in the string can be replaced by the corresponding production rules.\n\nStarting from the end of the string, I see t82 followed by t82 and t0. Looking at the grammar, there's a rule NT82 -> t0. Wait, but NT82 only has one production: NT82 -> t0, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT82. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT82. The closest I have is NT86 -> NT82, NT76, and NT82 -> t0. So NT82 can be expanded to t0. That means the last part of the string (t82 t42 t82 t0) would collapse as follows:\n\n- The first t82 would come from NT82, which can be 't0'.\n- The second t82 would also be 't0'.\n- The t42 comes directly from a terminal.\n- The last t0 is from the terminal t0.\n\nWait, but the actual string has t82 followed by t42 followed by t82 followed by t0. So if both t82s are 't0', then the part becomes t0 t42 t0, but in the string, it's t82 t42 t82 t0. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the replacements work. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree from the string. Each of these terminals corresponds to non-terminals in the grammar, so I have to see if I can find a path of productions that leads from the start symbol S to these non-terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The string starts with t3. Looking at the grammar, I see NT34 might not exist because the grammar has NT3 -> 't82' and also NT3 -> 't87'. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, under NT3, there are two rules: NT3 -> 't82' and NT3 -> 't87'. Wait, that's not right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT3, there are two entries: ND3 -> 't82' and ND3 -> 't87'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nWait, is that accurate? Let me look more carefully. The grammar lines are:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't43'?\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nSo NT3 can be either 't82' or 't87'. Hmm, but in the string, the first symbol is 't3', which would correspond to NT3. So either 't82' or 't87', but the string is 't3', so that doesn't match. Wait, no, the actual string starts with t3, but in the grammar, NT3 can be 't82' or 't87', not 't3'. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the grammar structure.\n\nWait, maybe the NT numbers in the grammar are different from the string. For example, in the string, we have t3, which should correspond to NT3. But looking at the grammar, I see NT3 has two productions: NT3 -> 't82' and NT3 -> 't87'. So if the string starts with t3, that would require that NT3 is rewritten into t3. But in the grammar, NT3 isn't a terminal; it can only produce 't82' or 't87'. So that can't be right.\n\nWait a second, maybe the string symbols like t3 are not terminals. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence of production steps where some nodes are non-terminals and others are terminals.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The string is given as a series of symbols: t3, t25, t36, etc. Each of these symbols represents either a terminal or a step in the leftmost derivation.\n\nSince S is the start symbol, we need to see if we can parse the string starting from S. Let's consider the structure of the string.\n\nThe string has 15 symbols, so the parse tree might be quite large. Let me try building the parse from the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write out the entire expansion step by step.\n\nLet me start with the start symbol S:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nEach of these, NT43 and NT61, must be expanded into sequences of symbols. Let's expand NT43:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nEach of these have their own expansions. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst NT43:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\nSo S becomes NT83 NT77 NT61\n\nNow, expand NT83:\nNT83 has two options: NT83 -> NT86 NT79 or NT83 -> t47\nBut in the string, the first few symbols are t3, so perhaps NT43 is expanded in a way that produces t3 somewhere. Wait, but according to the grammar, NT43 can be 't40' or something else. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, under NT43, there is:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nAnd also, one of the entries is NT43 -> 't40', but no\u2014looking back, the grammar is as follows:\n\nAfter S -> NT43 NT61, the next rules are:\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\nNT82 -> NT0\nWait, no, looking back, I think I might have misread some lines.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens connected by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that S and a bunch of other symbols like NT9, NT59 are non-terminals, and the rest seem to be terminals (like 't33', 't82', etc.), which are atomic symbols in this case.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t36 t3 t47 t74 t47 t25 t27 t21 t27 t87 t2 t27 t36 t6 t42`. So, it's a sequence of 15 terminals.\n\nMy goal is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step doubles the number of symbols, except for terminals which stay as they are. So, to get the string length I, the number of steps needed would be log2(I+1). Let's see: 15 symbols would require log2(16) = 4 steps, since each step doubles the number from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8, but wait, actually, I think the number of steps is 4 because 2^4 = 16, so 16 symbols in the derivation tree, but the string here is 15, which is close. Maybe my calculation is off, but perhaps the string can still be generated.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the count might not perfectly fit, but I'll proceed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT43 NT61. So the first step is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Therefore, the string must start with NT43 NT61 \u2192 t... If NT43 and NT61 can be expanded into t... strings.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the expansion begins with S generating NT43 and NT61, each of which can be terminals or non-terminals. So each of NT43 and NT61 might produce a sequence of terminals. Let me see the productions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT43 can be either NT83 NT77 or NT40 (from the given rules: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'). Similarly, NT61 \u2192 NT21 or 't33'.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or NT83 \u2192 t47\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT83 has two productions: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 t47. Similarly, NT43 has NT83 NT77 and can also produce 't40'. So, NT43 has multiple options.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 \u2192 NT21 or 't33'.\n\nSo, let's see what the start is:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nEach of these can be either non-terminals that expand into sequences or terminals.\n\nOur string starts with t36, which is a terminal. So we need to see if the first parts of NT43 and\/or NT61 can produce t36.\n\nWait, but NT43 is a non-terminal; it can produce either NT83 NT77 or t40. If it produces t40, that's just one terminal, which is shorter than our starting t36. So that might not help. Therefore, perhaps NT43 has to expand into a longer sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if t36 appears in the expansions somewhere.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminal symbols are:\n\nt36, t3, t47, t74, t25, t27, t21, t87, t2, t27, t36, t6, t42.\n\nLooking for t36 in the terminals, it's present. So let's see where that comes from.\n\nLooking through each rule, I notice:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t82\n- NT3 \u2192 t87\n- NT3 \u2192 t82\n- NT3 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t47?\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nWait, the rules are written as:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT3 -> 't42'\n\nWait, the initial list of NT3 -> 't82', 't87', 't42'\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar's last part is:\n\nHere are the production rules for NT3:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT3 -> 't42'\n\nSo, NT3 can produce t82, t87, or t42. So the token 't36' is not among these. So how do we get t36? Let me check all the rules for NTs.\n\nLooking at NT36: no, wait, does any non-terminal produce t36? Looking through the production rules, I don't see any production that leads directly to t36. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through all the grammar rules.\n\nThe production rules are a bit long. Let me look for any production that results in 't36'.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t82, t87, t42.\n\nHow about NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16.\n\nLooking elsewhere:\n\nWait, NT68 \u2192 't21' maybe? Not seeing t36 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since t36 isn't a direct production of any non-terminal, unless it's derived through a chain.\n\nWait, looking through each rule, perhaps through some non-terminal, maybe NT27?\n\nLooking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 't25'.\n\nHmm, maybe NT25 can do something else, but in the given rules, NT25 is 't25'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.\n\nThe string starts with t36, so at the first step, the first symbol is t36. Looking through the grammar rules, the only way a non-terminal can produce t36 is if there's a production rule for that NT that includes t36. But looking at the given rules, none of the NTs directly produce t36.\n\nWait, that's odd. So perhaps this string cannot be generated, because there's no rule that produces t36. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing a production for another non-terminal that can produce t36. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through all non-terminals:\n\nNT9, NT59, NT43, NT83, NT28, NT62, NT45, NT56, NT16, NT86, NT82, NT32, NT61, NT3, NT43, NT77, NT27, NT68, NT0, NT56, NT16, NT59, NT83, NT82, NT76, NT21, NT77, NT68, NT27, NT61, NT3, NT43.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals lead to t36 via longer expansions.\n\nLet me check NT27: NT27 \u2192 t25, which then may expand into something else. Let's look at NT25, but from the given grammar rules, I don't see NT25, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. The rule for NT27 is only \u2192 t25. So NT27 is not a non-terminal that can produce t36, unless t25 is somehow part of a longer expansion.\n\nBut even so, 't25' is not in the string provided. The string has t27, though, which is a separate token.\n\nWait, maybe I shouldn't have assumed that all the symbols are terminals, but they could be.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT3 can produce t82, t87, t42, but in our string, the symbol before the last is 't6', so maybe not directly connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the string contains 't36', which is nowhere in the grammar. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the rules given:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n2. NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n3. NT43 \u2192 t40\n4. NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n5. NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n6.

{"custom_id":"request-185","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is produced by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar, ending with \"Yes\" or \"No\". Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Importantly, there are no \u03b5 productions (productions that generate the empty string) and all productions have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can check if it fits CNF. Let's see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61: This is of the form A \u2192 BC, so that's fine. Both NT43 and NT61 are non-terminals.\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16: Again, A \u2192 BC, correct.\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79: Same here.\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77: Also A \u2192 BC.\n\nContinuing through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals are transformed into terminals. For example:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40': Wait, that would mean that the non-terminal NT43 is replaced by a single terminal symbol 't40'. But in CNF, a production can only have two non-terminals or a terminal. However, a production like A \u2192 a (where a is a single terminal) is allowed in CNF because it's considered to have one terminal, not two. Wait, actually, CNF requires that every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So producing a terminal as the only symbol is not allowed because that would be A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal, which is a production with zero non-terminals, but that's allowed in CNF as a base case for terminal symbols. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact rules.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production must have two symbols on the right-hand side, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or both terminals? No, no\u2014I think in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. But wait, that can't be right because terminals are not part of the grammar rules. So perhaps, in CNF, each production can either have one terminal and one non-terminal, but wait no\u2014Chomsky normal form requires that the productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, in the given grammar, some of the productions are A \u2192 a, which is acceptable in CNF. For example:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40': This is A \u2192 a, which is allowed.\n\nBut then earlier, I thought about NT43 --> NT83 NT77, which is A \u2192 BC, so that's fine. So the grammar seems to fit CNF because all non-terminal productions result in either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, but some of the rules in the grammar have more than two non-terminals on the right side. For example, looking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16, which is two, so that's fine. What about the productions like NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79: Also two. So actually, in the given grammar, all productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which is correct for CNF. So I think the grammar provided is indeed in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t21 t25 t87 t21 t42 t40 t36 t3 t74 t0 t87 t0 t27 t0 t82 t82. Let me write that down for clarity.\n\nBreaking it down, the string is a sequence of terminals: t21, t25, t87, t21, t42, t40, t36, t3, t74, t0, t87, t0, t27, t0, t82, t82.\n\nWait, the problem is that the string is a linear sequence of terminals, and we need to check if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, resulting in this string.\n\nTo solve this, perhaps I can try to parse the string from the start, working backwards or forwards through the productions to see if each part can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the string should have a derivation where each production step replaces exactly two non-terminals with either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for a string of length n, the derivation would consist of n-1 steps.\n\nBut the string here is:\n\nt21 t25 t87 t21 t42 t40 t36 t3 t74 t0 t87 t0 t27 t0 t82 t82\n\nThat's 16 terminals, so the derivation would have 15 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for sequences of terminals that match the right-hand sides of the productions to see if they can form this string.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language, but since this is a more manual process, I can try to see if I can find a leftmost or rightmost derivation.\n\nLet me see if I can map the terminals in the string to the productions.\n\nFirstly, let's see for the entire string, maybe we can find where it starts. But for context, the start symbol is S. S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the start directly produces two non-terminals. Therefore, the first step would expand S into NT43 and NT61, so the string must start with a terminal that can be derived from NT43 and the next from NT61, or something like that. Wait, but in the string, the first terminal is t21.\n\nWait, let's look at the productions involving the terminals given in the string.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t0 (two times)\n- NT87 \u2192 t2 (twice)\n- NT21 \u2192 t6\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT05 \u2192 wait no. Wait, looking through the productions, I need to find where 't21' is produced.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule that outputs 't21':\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t6: So that's a production.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't27':\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t25.\n\nAlso, let me check if 't42' is a production. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t42\n- NT40 \u2192 t40? Wait, no, looking at NT43: NT43 \u2192 't40'.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write out all the productions to see where each terminal comes from.\n\nLet me list all the productions where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT68 \u2192 't21'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nWait, that's only some of them.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step because I'm still a bit new to this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So looking at the grammar provided, every production seems to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which is two non-terminals, so that fits the A \u2192 BC part. There are also rules that directly produce terminals, like NT43 \u2192 't40'.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is \"t42 t6 t27 t36 t87 t82 t74 t42 t42 t0 t74 t21 t87 t42 t33 t74\". That's a list of terminals. To see if this string is generated by the grammar, I guess I need to apply the productions in reverse, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can derive this string step by step.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, which makes parsing a bit more systematic. Maybe I should build a parse tree to see if the string can be generated. Since each production has at most two non-terminals, and each terminal is a single symbol, the parse tree might look like a series of expansions where each step either replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT43 NT61. So the string should start with the symbols derived from NT43 and NT61. Let me look at the string: it starts with 't42', so perhaps NT43 expands to something that starts with 't42' and NT61 contributes 't6' as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at the production rules: NT43 has a rule \u2192 't40' and another \u2192 't42'. But wait, NT43 can be used in multiple ways. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar defines NT43 as either NT83 NT77 or \u2192 't40' or \u2192 't42'. Wait, in the given grammar, NT43 is defined as:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n          -> 't40'\n          -> 't42'\n\nSo, in the grammar, NT43 can produce either two other non-terminals or the terminal 't40' or 't42'. Similarly, each non-terminal either splits into two non-terminals or directly goes to a terminal.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string should be the concatenation of the symbols derived from NT43 and NT61.\n\nGiven the string starts with t42 t6..., it's possible that NT43 produces t42 and NT61 produces t6. Let me check the possible expansions.\n\nFirst, NT61: looking at the grammar, NT61 \u2192 't33'. Wait, no, NT61 has a production \u2192 't33'? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT59 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT83 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT83 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT76 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLooking specifically, NT61: in the provided grammar, does NT61 produce a terminal?\n\nLooking again, the lines:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: the last lines are:\n\nNT61 -> 't33' (actually, looking back, the original grammar seems to have multiple entries for some non-terminals. So, for example, NT3 is 't82' in two places, and so on.\n\nSo yes, NT61 has a production that goes directly to 't33'. So that means in the string, if NT61 contributes a 't6', that would require NT61 to first produce t6. Wait, let me check: No, NT61 only has a production to 't33'. So that can't be. But in the string, the second symbol is 't6'. So perhaps I've made a mistake in how I'm looking at the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me go back and list all the NT productions carefully to avoid confusion.\n\nHere's the complete list of productions provided:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\nNT3 \u2192 't82'\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT3 \u2192 't87'\nNT29 \u2192 't42'\nNT77 \u2192 't42'\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\nNT68 \u2192 't21'\nNT0 \u2192 't42'\nNT56 \u2192 't27'\nNT16 \u2192 't3'\nNT59 \u2192 't2'\nNT83 \u2192 't27'\nNT83 \u2192 't47'\nNT82 \u2192 't0'\nNT76 \u2192 't74'\nNT21 \u2192 't6'\nNT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nSo now, correcting earlier mistake, NT61 only has one production: \u2192 't33'. So how can the string have 't6' as the second symbol? That seems impossible unless I've misread.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see the string again: it's \"t42 t6 t27 t36 t87 t82 t74 t42 t42 t0 t74 t21 t87 t42 t33 t74\".\n\nSo, the string is 16 symbols long.\n\nNow, starting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. The string begins with 't42', which would mean NT43 must expand to 't42' somewhere. Let's see the productions for NT43 in the grammar: NT43 can be 't40' or 't42'. So, possible.\n\nSo, NT43 can produce 't42' directly. So the first symbol 't42' would come from NT43 \u2192 't42'. That uses up the first symbol.\n\nThen, NT61 must produce the next symbols. NT61 \u2192 't33' only. But in the string, the second symbol is 't6', not 't33'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check if there's another way for NT61 to produce 't6'. Looking through the productions, the only one for NT61 is \u2192 't33'. So perhaps 't6' is coming from a deeper expansion, not directly from NT61.\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, the string starts with t42, which is from NT43, and then the next symbol would have to come from NT61. But NT61 only produces t33. So that's inconsistent.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that NT61 is the only component after NT43. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is structured as the concatenation of the expansions from NT43 and NT61. So the first symbol comes from NT43, then the next symbols from NT61, or possibly, NT61 can produce more than one symbol. Wait no, since it's a sequence, each rule for NT61 either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So the production would have to generate symbols one after another.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parser trying to derive the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parser can proceed step by step, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nSo starting with S, we know S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string we want is the concatenation of the expansions of NT43 and NT61.

{"custom_id":"request-197","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is quite complex with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers. The string is: `t40 t40 t87 t87 t40 t42 t82 t42 t25 t42 t36 t25 t47 t87 t3 t42 t42`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form for context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This helps in parsing because it simplifies the structure of the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the rules are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, which fit the CNF since they produce two non-terminals. Some rules directly produce terminals like S \u2192 NT61 't33' or NT3 \u2192 't82'. So, it's in CNF except for those terminals; wait, in CNF, terminals are leaves, so that's correct.\n\nMy goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string starts with t40, which I need to trace back to S via the production rules.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the string should start with the first symbol produced by NT43. Looking at the string, the first token is t40. Checking the rules for NT43, I see NT43 has two rules: one producing NT83 NT77 and another producing t40. Since the string starts with t40, that corresponds to the direct rule NT43 \u2192 t40.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t40, so maybe the first part is derived from that. So, the first symbol t40 comes from NT43's production. Let's outline the possible derivation.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't's and numbers. Starting from S, which becomes NT43 NT61. Each of these non-terminals will produce sequences, and the entire string is the concatenation of their productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, matching the terminal symbols to the rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t40. Which NT can produce t40? From the rules, NT43 has a rule NT43 \u2192 t40. So, the first part of the string t40 comes from NT43.\n\nNext, after t40, the next symbol is another t40. So, after NT43, the next symbol comes from NT61. So, NT61 should produce t40. Looking at NT61's rules, there's NT61 \u2192 't33'. That doesn't produce t40, so this doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is constructed. Since the string is the concatenation of all the symbols produced by each NT, perhaps S \u2192 NT43 NT61 leads to a string that is the concatenation of what NT43 generates and what NT61 generates. So, the string should be divided into two parts: the first part from NT43 and the second from NT61.\n\nLooking at the string: `t40 t40 t87 t87 t40 t42 t82 t42 t25 t42 t36 t25 t47 t87 t3 t42 t42`.\n\nWait, that's 18 symbols. Let's count the symbols. It's an 18-symbol string.\n\nGiven S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the string length is 18, so each NT must produce a certain number of symbols. Let me think about how the NT43 and NT61 can produce the respective parts.\n\nNT43 has two production rules: NT43 \u2192 t40 or NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. The string starts with t40, which matches the direct rule, so NT43 \u2192 t40. That gives us one symbol, but looking deeper, perhaps NT43 uses the longer production to get more symbols.\n\nWait, maybe the string after the first t40 is from the other part of NT43's production. Let's see: if NT43 uses NT83 NT77, then NT83 and NT77 would generate t40 and something else. Let's explore that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial t40 comes from NT43, but perhaps the other symbols come from NT61. This is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's model the string as the concatenation of the derivations from NT43 and NT61. So, the first part is what NT43 produces, and the second part is what NT61 produces.\n\nSo, the total string is:\n\nt40 t40 t87 t87 t40 t42 t82 t42 t25 t42 t36 t25 t47 t87 t3 t42 t42.\n\nLet's count how many symbols are in each part. Suppose NT43 produces 'k' symbols and NT61 produces 'm' symbols, so k + m = 18.\n\nLooking at the symbols:\n\nFrom the grammar, let's list the production rules that lead to terminals:\n\nNT43 \u2192 t40 or NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 \u2192 t27 or t47.\n\nNT43 \u2192 t40 is one rule, and the other is NT83 NT77. So, if NT43 uses the direct rule, it's one symbol. If it uses NT83 NT77, then it's two rules. So, the symbol count could be 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly, for NT61:\n\nNT61 \u2192 t33 or... looking at the rules, NT61's production is NT61 \u2192 't33', so directly produces one symbol t33. Wait, but in the string, the second t40 is after the first, but the NT61 should produce t33. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because NT61 \u2192 t33, but the second symbol is t40, which is not t33. So, maybe I'm wrong about NT61's production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar:\n\nNT61 has either 't33' or is it? Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT61 \u2192 't33' and also NT62 \u2192 't33'? Wait, no, NT61 is only \u2192 't33' in one rule. So, NT61 can only directly produce t33. Therefore, the second symbol after t40 should be t33, but in the string, the next symbol after t40 is another t40. That can't be. So, that suggests that the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT61 is part of a longer production, but that doesn't seem to be the case as NT61 only has one production rule that leads directly to t33.\n\nThis suggests that the given string cannot be generated by the grammar because after the first t40 from NT43, NT61 must produce t33, but the string has another t40.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me re-examine the grammar rules for NT61.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT61: 't33'\n\nWait, so NT61 only has that one rule. So, after NT43 produces t40, the next token should come from NT61, which is t33. But the string after the first t40 is t40 t87... which doesn't start with t33. That seems like a contradiction. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the second token should be t33, not t40.\n\nWait, but maybe NT61 can be further expanded. Let me check if NT61 has any rules besides producing t33. In the grammar, looking through all the rules, I only see NT61 \u2192 't33'. So, NT61 cannot be expanded further; it stops at t33. Therefore, the string must have t33 right after the first t40 from NT43. But it doesn't; the next symbol is t40. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the structure wrong. S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT43's production and NT61's. So, the string must be NT43-generated part followed by NT61-generated part.\n\nGiven that, if NT43 uses the t40 rule, then the next should be t33, but it's not. Alternatively, maybe NT43 uses the longer production: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nSo, if NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-193","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That's good because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze the structure of the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, and the grammar's production rules are mostly two non-terminals on the left and two terminals on the right, except for some that produce a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which is two non-terminals, so that fits CNF. But when I look down, some of them produce a single terminal, like NT56 \u2192 't27', so those are the \u03b5 productions. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the string given is: `t47 t2 t40 t87 t6 t25 t25 t25 t33 t33 t3 t6 t40 t47 t82 t25 t6`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens. The string is space-separated, so each token is a 't' followed by a number. Let me list them out:\n\n1. t47\n2. t2\n3. t40\n4. t87\n5. t6\n6. t25\n7. t25\n8. t25\n9. t33\n10. t33\n11. t3\n12. t6\n13. t40\n14. t47\n15. t82\n16. t25\n17. t6\n\nThat's 17 tokens. The grammar's S starts with NT43 NT61. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61, each of which is a non-terminal. Each of these non-terminals can produce substrings of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nI think I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the top and breaking down each part.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the first two non-terminals. That means the string should start with whatever NT43 produces and then whatever NT61 produces. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT43 has two productions: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'. Also, NT61 \u2192 't33'. So NT61 is straightforward; it directly produces 't33'. But NT43 can either produce 't40' directly or go through NT83 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t47, which doesn't immediately match 't40' or the next possible option. Let's see. NT43 can produce t40 directly, but the first token is t47. So maybe NT43 is taking the longer path through NT83 and NT77.\n\nWait, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So that would produce two more non-terminals, NT83 and NT77. Let me check what these produce. NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 't27'. Hmm, t27 isn't in the beginning of the string. Alternatively, NT83 can produce 't27' directly. Wait, the string starts with t47, which isn't matching any direct production from NT83 or NT77. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's look again. S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the string must start with NT43's expansion followed by NT61's expansion. Since NT61 \u2192 t33, the string must end with t33. Checking the end, yeah, the last token is t6, so that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, the string ends with t6, which is not t33. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.\n\nWait, let me look again. The string is `t47 t2 t40 t87 t6 t25 t25 t25 t33 t33 t3 t6 t40 t47 t82 t25 t6`. The last few tokens are t25, t6. Oh, wait, the last token is t6, so that's a problem because NT61 \u2192 t33, which isn't t6. So either my analysis is wrong, or there's a mistake. Let me reevaluate.\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the string isn't exactly 17 tokens, let me recount. The user wrote the string as: t47 t2 t40 t87 t6 t25 t25 t25 t33 t33 t3 t6 t40 t47 t82 t25 t6 \u2013 that's 17 tokens. Yes, 17. But NT61 \u2192 t33 would require the last token to be t33, but it's t6. Alternatively, maybe the parsing is deeper, meaning that after NT43, the expansion of NT61 could involve more non-terminals. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT61 only has one production: NT61 \u2192 't33'. So it can't produce anything else. That would mean that the string must end with t33, but the given string ends with t6. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the very last token is t6, which isn't t33.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong about the last step. Let me think again. The string's last token is t6, which would have to come from NT61. But according to the grammar, NT61 only produces t33. So unless there's an error in my understanding, the string can't end with t6. Thus, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me go through the string again, perhaps there's a different breakdown.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. The string starts with t47, so we needNT43 to derive t47. Looking at NT43's productions: NT43 \u2192 't40' or 't43 production paths which might result in t47.\n\nWait, wait, the grammar, let me re-examine it because I might have misread some of the productions. Let's list all the NT and their productions.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT43 can be 't40' or NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 can be 't27' or NT86 NT79\n\nWait a minute, there's a possible conflict here. NT83 can produce 't27' or go further. But in the string, the first token is t47, which doesn't match 't27' or 't40'. So maybe I made a mistake earlier in the breakdown.\n\nWait, is there a way for NT43 to produce something else? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nSo NT43 can either produce 't40' or expand into NT83 NT77. So if NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, then the expansion would involve NT83 and NT77. Let's look at NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or 't27'\n\nSimilarly, NT77 \u2192 something, perhaps NT27 NT3 (look at NT27 it's NT27 \u2192 't25').\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to build the string step by step, assuming that NT43 takes the path through NT83 and NT77.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 (NT83 NT77) (NT61)\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo the first part would be NT83 NT77, followed by t33.\n\nWhat does NT83 produce? NT83 \u2192 't27' or NT86 NT79\n\nBut the string starts with t47, so 't27' is not matching. Alternatively, perhaps NT83 produces a longer string that includes t47? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT86: NT86 \u2192 't82' or NT82 NT76.\n\nBut NT86 can't produce t47. Hmm. So perhaps that's not the path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a production. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0. So NT82 can produce 't0' or more.\n\nWait, perhaps the path is that NT83 is expanded first.\n\nLet me write this down step by step:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-201","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit new to CFGs, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nSo, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each non-terminal on the left has exactly two. The string given is a series of terms connected by spaces, so each space splits the string into components: `t6`, `t74`, `t47`, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string using the grammar. I'll approach this from the start symbol, S, and see if I can derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the productions, S -> NT43 NT61. So, S expands to two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61. Both need to be expanded into terminals.\n\nLet me look at NT43: from the productions, NT43 can go to NT83 NT77, or directly to 't40'. Similarly, NT61 has a production NT61 -> 't33'. So, if I take the straightforward approach for NT61, it's 't33', which would only contribute one token. But the string I'm evaluating has more tokens, so maybe NT43 needs to be expanded further.\n\nWait, let's check the string again: the tokens are t6, t74, t47, t82, t42, t36, t0, t3, t42, t36, t0, t25, t87, t2, t82, t25, t21, t27. That's 18 tokens, which is an even number. In CNF, each production contributes one or two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals should be such that the derivation alternates correctly. Since each step either keeps the same count or increases by one, but in this case, the number of tokens is 18, so maybe the derivation required has 18 tokens.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's try to build the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT43 NT61.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT43's expansion and ends with NT61's. Since NT61 -> 't33', the last part should be 't33'.

Could it be that the NT61 production is different? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT61's production: the user wrote `NT61 -> 't33'`. So unless there's another production I'm not seeing, that's fixed. So the last token should be t33, but it's t27. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion.

NT43's productions:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77 or 't40' or perhaps another way? Wait, in the initial grammar, the user listed several NT productions. Let me list all of them to be thorough.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait a second, I see that NT43 has two productions now: NT43 -> 't40' and NT43 -> 't47'. Because earlier I thought there might have been two entries, but now I'm seeing two. Or perhaps I misread, maybe it's only one. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT43: the initial list provided by the user says NT43 -> 't40' and then later also NT43 -> 't47'. So that's a problem because each non-terminal can have only one production. Wait, but in a CFG, a non-terminal can have multiple productions. So perhaps I misread the initial grammar.\n\nLooking again: the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nThen later:\n\nNT43 -> 't47'\n\nSo that suggests that NT43 can produce both 't40' and 't47' and maybe more. Hmm, no, that can't be right. Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, looking at the initial grammar, line 2 starts with S, then NT43 has two productions:\n\nFirst, NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nSecond, NT43 -> 't40'\n\nThen another line for NT43: 't47'.\n\nWait, that can't be right in a CFG as written because it's adding another production for NT43. So the user probably intended that NT43 can produce either NT83 NT77 or 't40' or 't47'? But that would make three productions for NT43, which may not be intended. Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the way the user presented it. Alternatively, maybe the second occurrence was meant to be a different non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the second NT43 line was intended to be another NT, like NT34 or something. But as it's written, it's showing two different productions for NT43.\n\nThis is confusing.

Let me check again.\n\nThe grammar is as follows (user provided):\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT47\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nWait, so NT61 is a terminal: 't33'.\n\nWait, but then S \u2192 NT43 NT61 would be NT43 followed by NT61. But in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. But here, S \u2192 NT43 NT61 is a production, but NT61 is a terminal, which seems incorrect because in CNF each production should have two non-terminals. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, looking more closely, wait: the user provided the following productions:\n\nHere are all the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't87'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT59 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT83 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT83 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT76 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, so for NT61, the only production is 't33'. So that's a terminal. Therefore, in S \u2192 NT43 NT61, one of the symbols is a terminal. But in CNF, productions can only have non-terminals on the left. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61 is an issue because NT61 is a terminal (per the production NT61 \u2192 't33'). So that probably can't be right. Maybe the grammar isn't strictly in CNF?\n\nBut assuming it's given, let's proceed.\n\nSo S is the start symbol, and S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string, according to S, needs to be two tokens from NT43 and one token from NT61 (which is 't33').\n\nBut looking at the string: it starts with t74, which is not 't33', so it seems like maybe the NT43 is generating certain sequences and then NT61 is 't33'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Let me see the string: it's a list of terminals. Each terminal is a token. So the string is a sequence of tokens: t74, t6, t25, t42, t25, t82, t87, t21, t2, t6, t36, t36, t21, t87, t3, t40, t25, t25.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation starts with S, which is NT43 NT61, meaning two parts: left and right.\n\nSo first, let's consider that NT61 is 't33', which is not present in the string (since the string starts with t74). Wait, no, the string is: first token is t74, which is generated by NT74. But looking at the non-terminals, I don't see a NT74. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding which non-terminals correspond to which terminals. Let me list all the terminals present in the string and check if they are among the productions.\n\nLooking at the string's tokens: t74, t6, t25, t42, t25, t82, t87, which are 8 tokens. Then more t21, t2, t6, t36, another t36, then t21, t87, t3, t40, t25, and another t25. So the terminals are t74, t6, t25, t42, t82, t87, t21, t2, t36, t3, and others.\n\nWait, let's see the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT43 has productions to NT83 followed by either NT77 or NT47, and also itself to 't40' and 't42'.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nNT43 is the non-terminal, and its productions:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nand\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT47\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT43, there are two rules. Wait, the user wrote under NT43: NT43-> NT83 NT77, NT43-> NT83 NT47. So in that case, NT43 can produce either NT83 followed by NT77 or NT47.\n\nBut looking at the options for NT43, the rules are:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nand also a self-loop? Or is there a production that ends NT43 as a terminal?\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nand\n\nNT43 -> 't42'\n\nSo NT43 can go to 't40' and 't42'. Wait, but then why is it a non-terminal? That would be a production that produces a terminal, but in CNF, productions can have terminals, but each production must have exactly two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user's grammar is given as:\n\nNT43-> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43-> NT83 NT47\n\nBut later, under certain non-terminals, such as NT43, it is assigned to 't40' and 't42', which are terminals. So perhaps those are different entries. Maybe a mistake in the problem, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial list provided is a mix of some productions and others, leading to confusion.

Wait, but the initial symbol is S, which is NT43 and NT61.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for where NT43 can produce t40 or something else. Alternatively, maybe we need to consider NT43 and NT61 separately.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3, which is produced by NT43 as per the rules. Let me see the rules for NT43: it can go to NT83 NT77 or directly to 't40'. So, perhaps the production is NT43\u2192 t40. But then t3 wouldn't match.

So, the only way for NT43 to produce a terminal is 't40' directly. So, if the string starts with t3, it can't be derived from S directly, which starts with NT43 NT61.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check the grammar structure again. The start is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, S starts with NT43, which can be broken down into NT83 NT77 or 't40'. If the string starts with t3, which isn't the output of either production of NT43, then perhaps the string can't be generated by this grammar.

I'm a bit new to context-free grammars, but I'll try my best to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I see the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one terminal on the right, except possibly the start symbol. Wait, the start symbol here is S, and its production is NT43 NT61. So, S produces two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t21 t40 t3 t36 t25 t33 t87 t21 t42 t0 t33 t33 t27 t0 t21 t42 t3 t33 t6`\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to use the top-down parsing method, which involves starting from the start symbol and trying to derive the string step by step. Alternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I might also try to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by non-terminals in the grammar, step by step, possibly in reverse (bottom-up), but I think top-down makes more sense here.\n\nWait, in top-down parsing, we start from S and try to expand the non-terminals to match the terminals of the string. But the string is long, so maybe I should break it down systematically.\n\nLet me list the productions again to make it clear:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't87'\n\nWait, no. Looking closer, in the given context-free grammar, some of the productions for NT3 have two different terminals. Let me check:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't87'\n\nHmm, that seems problematic because a non-terminal can't produce two different terminals. Or can it? Wait, perhaps it's a typo. No, in the provided list, it's written as:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nWait, that would mean NT3 can only produce one of those terminals, but it's listed twice. That seems incorrect. Maybe it's supposed to be one production for NT3. Let me check the original grammar provided again.\n\nWait, in the original grammar, under NT3, it's written as:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nSo, that must be an error because a non-terminal in Chomsky Normal Form can't have two different productions with different terminals unless it's a typo. Let me check the other entries to see if any other non-terminals have similar issues.\n\nLooking further, I see NT56 has:\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nSo, NT21 is a production that results in 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT86: NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n\nAnd so on. So it seems that only NT3 has two different productions resulting in different terminals.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nNT3 is defined as:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nAre both of these correct? If so, that's a problem because a non-terminal in a context-free grammar in CNF can only have one production. So maybe I made a mistake. Wait, looking back, I see that in the initial grammar list, under NT3, it's listed as:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Perhaps one of these is a typo. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, in the initial user message, under NT3, there are two entries:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nThat's probably an error. It's more likely that either one of them is incorrect or it's a duplicate. Hmm. I think in the problem, it's intended that NT3 has only one production. Perhaps the intended production was only one of them. Alternatively, maybe this is a typo, and one of them should be another non-terminal. But as it stands, having two different terminal productions for the same non-terminal is impossible, so perhaps this is an error in the problem, and I should proceed assuming that, for example, NT3 can't produce both, so the grammar as written is invalid. But since the user presented it, perhaps I should check if it's possible that NT3 has only one production. Alternatively, maybe one of them is intended to be a non-terminal, but looking at the user's grammar, that doesn't align. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\nHere is the grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nWait, maybe the 'NT3' in the first line is a typo? Or maybe in the context, NT3 is supposed to produce either 't82' or 't87' but not both. So perhaps it's an error in the problem statement, but perhaps for the sake of solving, one of them is correct, and the other is just a duplication. Maybe the correct one is NT3 -> 't82' and the other should be removed, or vice versa. Alternatively, perhaps one is a typo, and it's supposed to be another rule. But without more information, perhaps I should proceed, assuming that NT3 can only produce one or the other, but that would make the grammar invalid because of conflicting rules. So maybe this problem has a typo, but perhaps I should ignore one of them and proceed, perhaps by treating the non-terminal as having a single production. But this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct NT3 production is 't82' because it's earlier, but I'm not sure. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me proceed assuming that this is a mistake and that NT3 only has one production. But since both 't82' and 't87' are given under NT3, I think this is an error, but perhaps in the actual problem, it's only supposed to have one. Let me proceed as though one of them is correct, perhaps 't82' and 't87' is a typo, perhaps the correct is only one.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that in the given problem, perhaps the first NT3 -> 't82' is correct, and the second is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the second is supposed to be something else, but since I can't know, I'll proceed as though there's a mistake, and perhaps try to see if the string can be generated with NT3 -> 't82' or 't87'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a typo, and the problem should have NT3 with only one production. Since the user included both, perhaps that's part of the issue. But for the sake of solving, perhaps I should treat NT3 as only having one of them. Alternatively, maybe NT3's other production is incorrect, and perhaps it's supposed to be NT3 -> 't87', or the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct production is NT3 -> 't82', which would mean the second entry is a typo. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, with that in mind, moving forward.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt21 t40 t3 t36 t25 t33 t87 t21 t42 t0 t33 t33 t27 t0 t21 t42 t3 t33 t6\n\nHmm, the string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers.

{"custom_id":"request-221","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by the grammar. The string is \"t42 t36 t27 t3 t42 t36 t6 t27 t6 t40 t40 t74 t74 t74 t2 t3 t6 t25 t47 t2\". Hmm, that's a lot of symbols, but let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form has production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT43, NT9, etc.) is rewritten as two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But looking at the given grammar, I see some rules that have terminals on the right-hand side, which might make things a bit complicated. Wait, Chomsky normal form typically requires each production to have either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and a terminal. So some of these rules might not be in proper CNF because some have two terminals. I should note that as it might affect parsing.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t42, t36, t27, etc. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since it's in CNF, the derivation should have depth equal to the length of the string minus one, which is 20, so the parse tree should have 20 levels.\n\nLet me look at the top-level rule: S -> NT43 NT61. So the start symbol S is rewritten into two non-terminals, NT43 and NT61. Each of these can be further expanded. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the entire string must be generated by expanding these non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nI'll start working from the top. The first non-terminal is NT43, which needs to generate some part of the string. Let's check NT43's production. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT40 (but looking at the provided rules, I don't see NT43 -> 't40' but rather it's another production in NT43 -> NT43? Wait, no. Let me clarify. Looking again, in the provided rules:\n\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> 't40' (wait, I must have misread earlier. Wait, no, looking back: In the user's message, under the grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\n\nBTW, I'm trying to be careful because the user has a specific set of rules, so I have to refer precisely to them. Let me go through each rule line by line.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, now I see. There's a rule NT43 -> 't40' and another production for NT43 -> NT83 NT77. So that means NT43 has two productions: one that produces two non-terminals, and another that produces a single terminal 't40'. Similarly, I need to check other NT symbols to see if any have such mixed production.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nNT3 -> 't82', NT3 -> 't87', NT29 -> 't42', NT77 -> 't42', NT27 -> 't25', NT68 -> 't21', NT0 -> 't42', NT56 -> 't27', NT16 -> 't3', NT59 -> 't2', NT83 -> 't27', NT83 -> 't47', NT82 -> 't0', NT76 -> 't74', NT21 -> 't6', NT79 -> 't36'.\n\nSo, some non-terminals produce terminals (like NT3 -> 't82'), others produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string we need to validate is a sequence of t42, t36, etc. Let me list the string as a list for clarity:\n\nt42, t36, t27, t3, t42, t36, t6, t27, t6, t40, t40, t74, t74, t74, t2, t3, t6, t25, t47, t2.\n\nThat's 19 symbols, but I count it as 19 elements because the count is a bit confusing. Wait, the string is written as a sequence separated by spaces, so from t42 up to t2, that's 19 tokens. So the derivation should produce 19 symbols.\n\nBut in a CFG under CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So for a string of length n, there are n-1 productions. Wait, actually, the depth of the parse tree is n-1 for a string of length n.\n\nSo, let's start analyzing the grammar.\n\nThe top symbol is S, which expands to NT43 NT61.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string must come from NT43 and NT61. So looking at the string, the first two symbols are t42, t36.\n\nSo NT43 should generate t42 and NT61 should generate t36. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions:\n\n- NT43 -> 't40' (only if the non-terminal is replaced by that terminal immediately, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals, which would mean NT43 is expanded into two non-terminals, generating two more symbols in that step, or if it's a single terminal, it's expanded in that step).\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production step for a non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals. So for NT43 to produce a terminal, that terminal must be the entire string. But since our string is longer, this is not possible. Therefore, maybe I need to adjust my understanding.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions have right-hand sides (RHS) consisting of two non-terminals or one non-terminal plus a terminal? Or perhaps I'm getting confused with another form. Wait, in standard Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So some non-terminals produce terminals in a single step.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, that's the case. For example:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n\nThese are terminals.\n\nSo, in this case, some non-terminals can produce a terminal in one step. So the initial approach was correct.\n\nSo, for the first symbol in the string, t42, which is the terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't42' in one step. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can directly produce 't42'?\n\nLooking through the 'a -> t...' rules:\n\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n\nSo, if a non-terminal NT29, NT77, or NT0 can produce 't42', then in one step, they can give 't42'.\n\nSimilarly, 't40' can come from NT43.\n\nSo, let's try to work through this.\n\nThe string starts with t42, t36, t27, t3, t42, etc.\n\nLet me build a possible parsing tree.\n\nStarting with S -> NT43 NT61.\n\nThis gives two symbols: the first from NT43 and the second from NT61.\n\nBut the string is t42, t36, which would mean the output must be t42 followed by t36. So either NT43 produces t42 and NT61 produces t36, or the NT43 produces parts of the string and NT61 does the rest.\n\nWait, but in a CFG, each production corresponds to a symbol in the string. So the order must be that NT43's expansion provides the first part, and then NT61 provides the rest. But given the length, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into sections where NT43 and NT61 produce their respective"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

No, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at the problem again, the grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait a minute, this can't be right because NT43 is a single rule. No, I think I misread. Let me check each line:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT3 -> 't87'\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT59 -> 't2'\n- NT83 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n- NT82 -> 't0'\n- NT76 -> 't74'\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Each production should have exactly one right-hand side. Oh, I see now. The user made a mistake in listing the grammar. Looking at it, for NT43, there are two production rules listed:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> NT43 -> 't40' and 't42' as separate, but that's not how it's written. It seems that the user tried to list all the productions, but for NT43, the last few lines under NT43 are:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT43 -> 't42'\n\nBut that's not correct. Actually, in the problem statement, the grammar for NT43 is only one production NT43 -> NT83 NT77. So perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps NT43 has multiple production rules, which would make the grammar ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps in the user's original problem, the NT43 has the rules:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nand also\nNT43 -> 't40'\nand also\nNT43 -> 't42'\n\nBut that's impossible because in Chomsky normal form, all non-terminals must produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-228","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to decide if the string is in the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing, but for our purposes, I just need to know that the given grammar is indeed in CNF, and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. So yes, it's definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t42 t25 t0 t74 t42 t42 t87 t3 t27 t2 t36 t42 t0 t74 t27 t47 t40 t74 t6 t87 t0`.\n\nI need to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived from S by expanding according to the rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the first two symbols in any string generated by this grammar must be the results of expanding NT43 and NT61.\n\nWait, but looking at the given string, the first symbol is 't42'. Let me check the productions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT43 can produce either NT83 or NT77 (since looking closely, I see:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77  \nBut wait, earlier I thought there might be confusion, but actually, in the grammar provided, the line says:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77  \nSo NT43 expands to NT83 and NT77. Then, NT83 produces NT86 and NT79, which in turn expand further. But for the string, the first symbol is 't42', which would require a production that directly produces 't42'.\n\nWait a second, looking through the productions, I see rules where non-terminals directly go to terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so S starts with NT43 and NT61. Let's check the productions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT76 \u2192 NT74\nWait, actually, let me list all the productions with terminals to see if any directly produce 't42'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT56 \u2192 NT27 NT21, and further down NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT79 \u2192 't74'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27' or 't47'\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT83 has two productions:\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79  \n- NT83 \u2192 NT47 (since the lines say:\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\nSo, NT83 can produce either NT86 and NT79 or 't47'\n\nWait, no, I might have misread. Let me parse this correctly. The user provided a long list of grammar rules, each on a separate line, continuing with some rules like:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nWait, so NT83 has two productions: producing NT86 and NT79, or producing NT47. But NT47 is a non-terminal, right? Because in the list, NT47 isn't mentioned as producing a terminal. So that's a terminal? Or perhaps it is.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT47. Scanning the list, I don't see a production for NT47. So perhaps NT47 is a terminal because it's not on the left-hand side of any production. Because in the grammar, each production is of the form NT... \u2192 either two NT's or a terminal. So if a symbol is never on the left-hand side of any production, it's a terminal.\n\nSo, looking through all the rules, the NTs on the left are: S, NT61, NT43, NT9, NT59, NT45, NT56, NT16, NT86, NT82, NT32, NT61, NT3, etc.\n\nSo, in the grammar, we'll list NT47 as a terminal if it's never on the left. From the given rules, I don't see NT47 appearing on the left, so yes, it's a terminal symbol, meaning it produces a literal string.\n\nSo, now, back to the string. The first token is 't42'. Where does 't42' come from? Let's see which non-terminals produce 't42':\n\nLooking through the grammar, 't42' is produced by NT29 and NT77. So either NT29 or NT77 can produce 't42', which is the first symbol in the string.\n\nBut S starts with NT43 and NT61, so the start symbol's expansion begins with NT43 followed by NT61, each of which expand further.\n\nSo the first symbols must be the expansions of NT43 and NT61. Let's see what they produce.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (from the grammar line: NT43 -> NT83 NT77)\nNT61 \u2192 't33'? Wait, looking at the grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nWait, yes, the line says:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nSo NT61 produces 't33'. So the first two symbols in the string must be expansions starting with NT43 (which is NT83 NT77) and then NT61 which produces 't33'.\n\nBut our string starts with 't42', which is a terminal, not a combination like 't83 t77' as would come from NT43's production. Therefore, that's a problem because S's first expansion is NT43 NT61, which will start with the expansion of NT43. But the string begins with 't42', which is derived from either NT29 or NT77, but NT29 and NT77 are not the starting points of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe S is not directly the starting symbol. Wait, wait, in the given grammar, S is the start symbol, so the first thing produced is the S's right-hand side. Since S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which are both non-terminals, the first symbols in the generated string must be the first symbols produced by expanding NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo when NT43 is expanded, it's into NT83 NT77, which would mean the first two symbols in the string would have to be the left-hand sides of NT83 and NT77's productions until terminals are reached. But the string starts with t42, which is a terminal, so the expansion process would have to produce 't42' as the first symbol, meaning that the leftmost non-terminal must expand into t42 directly, which is only possible if there's a production for a non-terminal that starts the expansion with t42.\n\nWait, perhaps S is the start symbol, but I could have a non-terminal A such that S \u2192 A B, and A \u2192 t42 something. But looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which are both non-terminals. NT43 is NT83 NT77, which are also non-terminals. NT61 is a terminal 't33', so the string would start with t33, followed by the expansion of NT83 and NT77.\n\nBut our string starts with t42, not t33, which suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar. But wait, maybe there's a different derivation where the start leads to t42 in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol can't produce t42 directly because S starts with NT43 NT61. So the only way to get a t42 as the first symbol is if one of the non-terminals in the expansion produces t42 as a terminal. But since S is the start symbol, and it's S\u2192NT43 NT61, both of which expand into non-terminals and terminals, the first symbol would be the start of one of those.\n\nNT61 directly produces 't33', not t42. NT43 produces NT83 and NT77, which may then produce further terminals.

NT76 -> 't74'\n30. NT21 -> 't6'\n31. NT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, some of these might be conflicting, especially NT43 having two rules: one is 't40' and another 't47'. Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT43 -> 't47'\n\nThat's a problem because a non-terminal can only have one definition. So, the grammar as given has a conflict for NT43. It can't produce both 't40' and 't47'. This inconsistency might be a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's a mistake, but maybe in the actual problem, only one production is present. Since the user wrote two lines for NT43, that might be an error. Maybe only one of them is correct. Hmm, perhaps I should ignore that for now or proceed assuming it's a mistake and only one is active.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended for NT43 to have two productions, but in that case, the parser might require choosing one or the other, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the grammar is ill-formed. But since I'm supposed to work with this, I might have to assume that perhaps only one of the NT43 productions is correct, or else the grammar is invalid.\n\nBut since the user provided the grammar, I have to work with it, even if there are inconsistencies. Maybe one of the lines is a typo. Let me check the lines again:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Line 4: NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- Line 16: NT43 -> 't40'\n- Line 17: NT43 -> 't47'\n\nYes, so both lines 16 and 17 define NT43, which is not possible in Chomsky Normal Form. Therefore, the grammar provided is invalid, but perhaps the user intended only one of them. Maybe line 17 is correct and line 16 is a typo for NT3. Alternatively, perhaps only line 16 is active. But this could cause problems when parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that NT43 has two productions, which would be unusual but possible in an unrestricted grammar, but not in Chomsky Normal Form where each production is of the form A->BC or A->a.\n\nTherefore, this grammar might have an error, making it invalid. However, since the problem states that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, I must assume that the productions are correct. Therefore, perhaps the user intended line 16 or 17 to be a typo, but it's unclear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should try to proceed by making assumptions. Alternatively, since the two NT43 productions lead to different terminals, the string may require choosing which path to take.\n\nBut perhaps focusing on the given string, let's see. The first symbol is `t0`, which comes from NT0 -> 't42'. Wait, no, looking at the list, NT0 is transformed into 't42' by line 22: NT0 -> 't42'. So the first symbol is `t0`, which can't directly match any production, except as the result of NT0 expanding to 't42', but that's not matching `t0`. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait no, perhaps the NT0 can produce 't42', so `t0` must be generated from a non-terminal that can produce 't0'. Checking the list, let's see. Looking through all the productions, does any non-terminal produce 't0'?\n\nLooking, NT82 -> 't0', so if a non-terminal can produce NT82, then it can produce 't0'. Looking further, NT28 -> NT27 NT59. Let's see if any of those produce NT82.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial NT in the string is `t0`, which would require that it's the result of a derivation step that produces 't0'. But according to the productions given, the only way to produce 't0' is from NT82, as per line 11: NT82 -> 't0'. So perhaps the initial token `t0` must come from a production that includes NT82.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the first token is `t0`, which must be generated directly, but the only way `t0` is generated is if a non-terminal produces it.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT1: S\nNT2: S\nNT3: [multiple rules, lines 9,17,18]\nNT4: [multiple rules, lines 5,16,17]\nWait, perhaps it's confusing.

Looking at the grammar, I see that NT27 -> t25, so t25 must come from NT27 in the grammar. That means the first part of the string could be the expansion from S starting with NT27.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol, S -> NT43 NT61. That's two non-terminals, so the string should be a combination of these two. Let me see which part of the string can be derived from each.\n\nStarting with NT43: According to the grammar, NT43 -> NT83 NT77. Then, NT83 has two options. Looking at the rules, NT83 can either go to NT86 NT79 or NT83 -> NT47. Wait, that seems cyclic because NT83 is on both sides. Hmm, perhaps I should take the first option, NT83 -> NT86 NT79.\n\nSo NT43 expands to NT83 NT77, which then expands to NT86 NT79 NT77.\n\nLooking back at the first few tokens: t25 is NT27, but NT43 is not directly expanding to t25. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me map each non-terminal to their terminal expansions:\n\n- NT0 -> t42\n- NT1 -> t3\n- NT2 -> t56\n- NT3 -> t82, t87, t3 (wait, NT3 appears in two rules: NT29 -> t42, NT68 -> t21, NT3 -> t82, NT43 -> t40, and another NT3 -> t87. There's some overlap here, so I need to be careful. Wait, let me re-examine.)\n\nLooking through the rules, I see some inconsistencies. For example, NT3 has two rules: NT3 -> t82, and NT3 -> t87. Additionally, another rule says NT3 -> t82. So perhaps some non-terminals have multiple possible terminals, leading to ambiguity. Let me list each non-terminal and their possible terminal outputs to simplify.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT0 -> t42\n- NT1 -> t3\n- NT2 -> t56\n- NT3: has rules NT3 -> t82, NT3 -> t87, and appears in NT27 -> t25, which conflicts because NT27 is supposed to produce t25, but looking at the grammar, NT27 is not a variable but NT27 is a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the non-terminals. Let me clarify each:\n\nLooking back, the grammar is as follows:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, that's the actual grammar. So, each non-terminal either expands into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. So, some non-terminals have multiple expansions.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier when interpreting NT3. Actually, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo, each non-terminal is on the left. So NT43 has two rules: NT43 -> NT83 NT77 and NT43 -> NT83 NT40.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, the last line is NT43 -> 't40'. So that's an expansion into a terminal. Similarly, NT3 -> 't82' and 't87', etc.\n\nSo, correct mapping:\n\nNT43 can produce either NT83 NT77 or t40.\n\nSimilarly, for NT83, it can go to NT86 NT79 or NT47 or t27 or t47.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT83 has two options: NT86 NT79 and NT47. Because the lines for NT83 are:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nSo from NT83, we get either two non-terminals or a terminal. Similarly, NT27 -> 't25'.\n\nLet me correct the mapping:\n\nEach non-terminal can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals:\n\n- NT43: NT83 NT77 or t40\n- NT83: NT86 NT79 or NT47\n- NT86: 't0' (wait, looking at the grammar: NT86 is not directly a terminal in the provided list. Wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76 (from line: NT86 -> NT82 NT76)\n\nWait no, checking again, NT86 is on the left in a production.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or maybe a start symbol on the right? Wait, actually, Chomsky normal form has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So in this case, all the rules seem to follow that.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t42 t40 t36 t82 t47 t27 t2 t2 t3 t21 t47 t47 t74 t47 t2 t27 t42 t36 t82 t82 t47 t74`.\n\nFirst, I need to check if each symbol in the string is present in the grammar or can be derived from it. The string consists of the terminals 't' followed by numbers. Let me see the right-hand sides of the grammar rules to see which terminals they produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some of the productions end with terminals. For example:\n- NT68 -> t21\n- NT27 -> t25\n- NT3 -> t82 (twice)\n- NT43 -> t40\n- NT83 -> t42\n- NT43 -> t27\n- NT77 -> t42\n- NT21 -> t6\n- NT79 -> t36\n- NT59 -> t2\n- NT82 -> t0\n- NT83 -> t47 (twice)\n- NT82 -> t82 (twice)\n- NT74 is not a terminal; let me check: where does 74 come from? Hmm, no, looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal producing t74. Wait, 74 is in NT74? Let me check if there's a production for NT74. Looking at the rules, I see NT83 -> t47, but where does NT74 come from? I don't see any rule that produces NT74, so that's a problem. The string has a t74, but there's no production for that, so either I'm missing it or it's a no-go.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar provided. Scanning through each production:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT3 -> 't87'\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT59 -> 't2'\n- NT83 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n- NT82 -> 't0'\n- NT76 -> 't74'\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo, the symbols in the string are t42, t40, t36, t82, t47, t27, t2, t2, t3, t21, t47, t47, t74, t47, t2, t27, t42, t36, t82, t82, t47, t74.\n\nLooking at each terminal symbol:\n- t42: appears in NT43, NT3, NT56, etc.\n- t40: NT43 -> t40\n- t36: NT79->t36\n- t82: NT82->t82, and also NT3->t82 (twice)\n- t47: NT83->t47 (twice)\n- t27: NT27->t25, wait, t25 isn't in the string. Wait, in the string, do I have t25? No, I have t25? Let me check: in the string, after 't27 t2 t2 t3', I have t21, then t47, etc. So 't27' is present in the string, but in the grammar, NT27 produces 't25', but that's not in the string. Hmm, that might be an issue. Did I miss any non-terminals that can produce t25?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 -> t25. So in the string, there is a t27, but the production for NT27 is to 't25', so maybe that's a problem. Because in the string, t27 appears, but it's not derived from any rule that leads to 't25'. Unless I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, maybe t25 isn't directly used, but perhaps that's a mistake. Or maybe t27 is present as a terminal. Wait, in the string, I see 't27' once. Let me see if 't25' can be derived elsewhere, but I don't see any production for 't25'. So that could be a problem because the string has 't27' but the grammar requires it to come from 't25'.\n\nWait, but in the string, I'm seeing 't27' as a terminal, which would only be present if there's a production that directly produces it. But looking through the production rules, NT27 -> 't25', so 't25' is the only terminal in that rule. There's no production that leads to 't27' as a terminal, unless I'm misunderstanding. So having 't27' in the string would be impossible unless there's another production that leads to it. Since that's not the case, it might mean that the string is invalid. Alternatively, perhaps the string has a typo, but I can't assume that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Let me list each terminal in the string and see if they have a production:\n\n1. t42: in the grammar, NT3 -> t82 (twice), but there's a rule NT83->t42. So that's okay.\n2. t40: NT43 -> t40, okay.\n3. t36: NT79->t36, okay.\n4. t82: NT82->t82, and also NT0->t42, so okay.\n5. t47: NT83->t47 twice, okay.\n6. t27: NT27->t25, but t25 isn't present in the string. Wait, so does that mean the string is invalid? Because we have 't27' in the string, but the only production for NT27 is to 't25', and there's no way to get 't27' as a terminal. So perhaps the string is invalid. But that's conflicting with my initial thought. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S->NT43 NT61. So each non-terminal expands to two non-terminals until it becomes a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t42 t40 t36 t82 t47 t27 t2 t2 t3 t21 t47 t47 t74 t47 t2 t27 t42 t36 t82 t82 t47 t74.\n\nLooking at the 't27's: after the first t27, then another later. Let's see how t27 could be derived. NT27->'t25', so t25 would be the result, but the string has t27 as a terminal. That's a problem because you can't get t27 from the grammar unless there's a production that produces t27. Since there isn't one, that would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, do I have any other way to derive t27? Let me check the entire grammar. No, looking through the rules, only NT27->'t25', and no other NT has t27 as its terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-251","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, the first thing I remember is that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar provided, I think it's indeed in CNF because all the rules have either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t47 t33 t33 t3 t0 t82 t3 t0 t36 t87 t21 t6 t33`.\n\nWait, wait, looking back, the string is: `t47 t33 t42 t3 t0 t82 t3 t3 t0 t33 t27 t36 t3 t40 t40 t0 t40 t27 t36 t87 t21 t6 t33`. Hmm, okay, I have to process this step by step.\n\nSo, the idea is to parse the string according to the given grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use a parsing strategy like leftmost derivation or recursive descent. But given that the grammar might be ambiguous, I need to consider all possible derivations that could lead to the string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level rule: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the first two symbols after S are NT43 and NT61. Let me break down NT43 and NT61.\n\nNT43 has a production: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, or can it also produce 't40'? Wait, looking at the rules: NT43 has two options: NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't82', but in the string I don't see any 't82's except a couple of times.\n\nWait, the string starts with t47, then t33, then t42, t3, etc. So the first non-terminal is NT43, and according to the rules, NT43 can be NT83 NT77 or 't40'. But the first token is t47, which doesn't match either of those. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the rules again for NT43. The provided grammar has:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nSo, NT43 can produce either NT83 and NT77 or the terminal 't40'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't47', not 't40', so that doesn't fit either. So if NT43 must either be 't40' or a combination of NT83 and NT77, but the string doesn't start with 't40', then that production can't be used. So, does that mean that the string is invalid because the first symbol can't be derived from NT43?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake because sometimes non-terminals can be part of a larger context. Let me make sure. The top-level symbol is S, which must produce NT43 NT61, which are both non-terminals. So, the first two symbols after S must be the results of NT43 and NT61.\n\nBut NT43's first symbol is t47, which doesn't align, unless there's a way to derive it from NT43. Since NT43 can only produce 't40' or NT83 NT77, neither of which starts with t47, it's impossible to derive 't47' from NT43.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t47, which doesn't fit the first two symbols (NT43 and NT61) because NT43 can't produce t47, so the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are other non-terminals that can derive to t47. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly or indirectly produces t47 except perhaps through some chain. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nNT83 -> t42\nNT83 -> t47\nWait, wait, I see that NT83 has two options: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or t47. Oh, so NT83 can produce t47 directly.\n\nSo, if I have a symbol t47, it would come from NT83's production NT83 \u2192 t47.\n\nTherefore, in the string, if there's a t47, that must come from NT83. But wait, the first non-terminal is NT43, which in this case must produce something, but in the string, the first token is t47, which is part of NT83, not NT43.\n\nThis suggests a possible error because S must produce NT43 and NT61, so the first two symbols should be the first symbols of NT43 and NT61.\n\nBut let's look at the string more carefully. The string is: t47 t33 t42 t3 t0 t82 t3 t3 t0 t33 t27 t36 t3 t40 t40 t0 t40 t27 t36 t87 t21 t6 t33.\n\nWait, I just re-examined the string and realized that the first token is t47, which would need to come from NT43. But since NT43 can only produce t40 or NT83 NT77, and neither starts with t47, which is the result of NT83. So, that's an immediate contradiction.\n\nWait, but perhaps the entire string isn't starting with NT43 NT61, but perhaps somewhere in the middle. No, because the top-level production is S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and we're starting from S, so the entire derivation must start with NT43 NT61.\n\nTherefore, the first two symbols must be from NT43 and NT61. Since the first symbol is t47, which can't come from NT43, the entire string is invalid.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and see how strings are formed. Let me list out the productions again for clarity:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40' (Wait, there's a duplication here. The initial production for NT43 is NT83 NT77, and then later it's shown as NT43 -> 't40'. But that can't be correct unless the latter is an alternative. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So, perhaps NT43 has two productions: one to NT83 NT77 and another to 't40'. Maybe that was a mistake in the initial statement. I'll have to check that.)\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT43 has two rules:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT40 (or 't40')?\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Normally, each non-terminal has only one production unless specified as an alternative, but in the initial list, I think the last line for NT43 was an error. The original statement had NT43 -> 't40', which might not be correct because the first line says NT43 -> NT83 NT77. So perhaps that's a typo, and I think only the second line is correct. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the initial input, under the \"Grammar\" section, the last few entries have some inconsistencies. For example:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Probably, the last line was intended as another production for another non-terminal. Similarly, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nWait, that's confusing. So NT83 has two rules: one is NT86 NT79, and the other is 't47'? That doesn't make sense. Probably, the last few entries are typos, and the actual productions are the ones listed before. So maybe I need to focus on the ones given correctly first.\n\nI think I should focus on the first part where the NTs are split into other NTs and terminals. Each production seems to be a combination of left-hand side as a non-terminal and right-hand side as a sequence of two NTs or a terminal.\n\nFor example, the first few:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nWait, so all the productions except the terminal ones are of the form A->BC, where B and C are non-terminals. The terminal ones are when the right-hand side is a single terminal like 't33', 't82', etc.\n\nThe goal is to see if the given string can be generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals: t40 t27 t25 t0 t87 t47 t36 t82 t47 t87 t82 t47 t40 t74 t40 t21 t40 t25 t21 t25 t21 t74 t87.\n\nFirst, note that the string starts with t40. From the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t40? Looking at the productions, I don't see any production that directly outputs t40. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> 't40' (but earlier in the initial setup, I think that was duplicated incorrectly. Wait, looking again, perhaps that was an error because NT43 also has the earlier production to NT83 NT77. So, perhaps it's only that production and others, and not the 't40' unless that's from another rule, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the user presented the productions. It might have been an error where an extra line was added incorrectly. Let me try to compile the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the initial setup, perhaps the correct productions are up to:\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40' (this seems to be a separate entry but earlier listed as NT43 -> NT83 NT77, so maybe this is an error.)\n\nWait, that can't be both. So I think the correct productions are:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nAnd maybe some others? Because I think the initial setup had more.\n\nBut the exact grammar is a bit confusing because some lines repeat or are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list all the productions as per the user's input, even if there are some that seem duplicate or inconsistent. So the user provided:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nThat's a lot. Now, looking for which non-terminals produce t40.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT43 is defined as NT83 NT77, and in another rule, it's 't40'. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, that is, does NT43 have two productions: one to NT83 NT77 and another to 't40'?

{"custom_id":"request-259","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar rules and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a start symbol S which directly expands into NT43 NT61. That means the entire string should start with NT43 and NT61. Let me break down each part.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with 't25 t0 t33 ...' I think I need to match each part to the grammar rules step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT43 NT61. So after S, the next part should be NT43 and then NT61. Let me see NT43. There are two options for NT43: NT83 NT77 and NT43 -> 't40'. Oh, actually, wait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So for NT43, it's either NT83 NT77 or the terminal 't40'.\n\nLooking at the string, after S we have 't25 t0 t33 ...'. So the first part is 't25'. Does NT43 produce 't25'? Looking at the rules, NT27 -> 't25' yes, but NT43 can't directly produce 't25' because NT43 is either NT83 NT77 or 't40'. So wait, maybe NT43 is the first part, and within that, each symbol is another expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string as a sequence of symbols. Let me write down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t25, t0, t33, t27, t33, t40, t33, t33, t40, t47, t33, t40, t21, t74, t82, t21, t25, t27, t25, t74, t27, t3, t25, t2.\n\nWait, that's quite long. Let me see, the string is \"t25 t0 t33 t27 t33 t40 t33 t33 t40 t47 t33 t40 t21 t74 t82 t21 t25 t27 t25 t74 t27 t3 t25 t2\".\n\nSince the start symbol S is NT43 NT61, the string should start with NT43 and then NT61. Let's see if that holds.\n\nLooking at NT43: the productions for NT43 are NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'. So NT43 can either be a terminal 't40' or a combination of NT83 and NT77. Since the string starts with 't25', which is a terminal, but NT43 only directly produces 't40' or a combination, perhaps the 't25' is part of a larger expansion from NT43 or another rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me see more carefully.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't25', but the NT43 rule is either NT83 NT77 or 't40'. So 't25' can't be directly derived from NT43 unless there's a way to break it into smaller steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT43 is part of a larger tree that eventually produces 't25'. Let me see if there are any other symbols in the grammar that produce 't25'.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT27 \u2192 't25' is one option. Also, NT68 \u2192 't21', NT86 \u2192 't82', etc.\n\nWait, so NT27 produces t25. So perhaps the expansion somewhere leads to NT27, which then becomes t25.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, after the initial t25, there's t0, t33, t27, etc.\n\nSo maybe the NT43 branch leads to NT83 and NT77, which in turn produce other non-terminals, which eventually lead to t25, t0, etc.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking at the first t25. To get t25, perhaps it's NT27. So from NT43, one of its parts is NT27.\n\nLooking back, NT43 can be NT83 NT77 or t40. So maybe NT43 is broken into NT83 and NT77. Now, I need to see what NT83 and NT77 can produce.\n\nNT83 has two options: NT86 NT79 or t47.\n\nIf NT83 is t47, then that part is done. If it's NT86 NT79, then each of those would expand further.\n\nLooking at the string, after t25 comes t0, which is NT0, and the production for NT0 is 't42' but wait, the given rules state NT0 \u2192 't42'? Or is it another rule? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, from the rules given, there's NT68 \u2192 't21', NT0 \u2192 't42'? Let me check the given grammar:\n\nYes, for example, NT86 \u2192 't82', NT82 \u2192 't62' 't0' etc. Wait, looking through the given rules, let me compile a complete list.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all the production rules for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 | 't40' ?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under 'NT43 ->', the options are:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nYes, so NT43 can expand to 't40' or to NT83 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t25, which isn't 't40', so the NT43 must expand to something that eventually produces t25. So, maybe NT43 is split into NT83 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or 't47'.\n\nSo if NT83 is t47, that would match the first t25? No, because t25 is t25, not t47.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread something. Wait, the string is 't25 t0 t33 t27...'. Let me index it with their positions.\n\nPosition 0: t25\n\n1: t0\n\n2: t33\n\n3: t27\n\n4: t33\n\n5: t40\n\n6: t33\n\n7: t33\n\n8: t40\n\n9: t47\n\n10: t33\n\n11: t40\n\n12: t21\n\n13: t74\n\n14: t82\n\n15: t21\n\n16: t25\n\n17: t27\n\n18: t25\n\n19: t74\n\n20: t27\n\n21: t3\n\n22: t25\n\n23: t2.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo let's try parsing the string step by step.\n\n1.

If it's 't40', then the first symbol would be t40, but it's t25, so NT43 must be NT83 NT77.\n\nSo, we have ND43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNow, each symbol in NT83 and NT77 must produce the corresponding symbols in the string.\n\nSo, inside NT83 and NT77, the symbols are:\n\nFor NT83, it could be 't47' or NT86 NT79.\n\nFor NT77, let's see what it expands to. Looking at the rules, is there a production for NT77?\n\nWait, looking through the rules provided, I see:\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 is in the production for NT43 -> NT83 NT77, but that's the rule.

Wait, maybe the user mistakenly repeated NT43's rules, but in reality, it's only one production for NT43: NT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nBecause when I check the user's grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT45 NT3\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because NT45 is defined elsewhere. Wait, looking again, it's:\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nSo, perhaps NT43 only has one rule, NT43 -> NT83 NT77, and maybe the user mistakenly listed it twice, but in reality, it's just one. So let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, back to the problem. The first symbol is t42, which is a terminal. But in this grammar, terminals are at the leaves of the parse tree, so the initial production S generates two non-terminals, NT43 and NT61. But in the first step, the first two symbols would be generated by NT43 and NT61, which are non-terminals. So the first symbols in the string must correspond to the leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t42, which is a terminal symbol. So the first step must involve the leftmost symbol of the string being generated by a terminal production. Therefore, let's see what symbols in the grammar directly derive to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some symbols directly go to terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT43 -> 't40' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check the user's grammar again.)\n\nWait, the user's grammar has:\n\nNT43 -> 't40' (Is that correct? Because looking back, I think it's a mistake.)\n\nWait no, in the user's list, the rows are the productions, each line representing a rule.\n\nSo, for example, the first line is S -> NT43 NT61.\n\nThen:\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nWait, that can't be correct because a non-terminal can't produce a terminal in two different ways, right? Or can it? Maybe in the user's grammar, this is a mistake.\n\nWait, looking carefully, the rules for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nSo that's two separate productions for NT3, one to 't82' and another to 't87'. That's allowed in context-free grammars, though unconventional.\n\nBut in this case, we have to consider both possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT43 -> 't40' and 't43' (Wait, looking back, let's see: \n\nWait, for NT43, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nBut earlier, NT43 also had a production: NT43 -> NT83 NT77. So that would mean NT43 has two productions: one to NT83 NT77 and another to 't40'.\n\nWait, that's conflicting because a non-terminal in a grammar should have a fixed set of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the grammar, but for the sake of solving the problem, I'll proceed as is.\n\nSo, moving back. The string starts with t42. Let's see where t42 comes from.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT29 -> 't42', and that's one option. So t42 could come from NT29. Also, NT43 has as a production NT45 NT3, but that would produce more non-terminals, so that's unlikely to directly produce t42.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t42 could come from NT29, as NT29's production is NT29 -> 't42'.

{"custom_id":"request-268","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes it easier to analyze because every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. \n\nThe string given is `t27 t6 t74 t3 t36 t40 t3 t0 t74 t33 t3 t21 t25 t21 t27 t74 t27 t25 t2 t0 t6 t33 t0 t87 t40`. I'll start by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S directly produces NT43 NT61. So the start is `NT43 NT61`, and each of these non-terminals will need to be expanded into terminals and\/or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT43, the production is `NT43 -> NT83 NT77`. So, NT43 expands into NT83 and NT77. Next, I check what each of these produces.\n\nNT83 has two productions: `NT83 -> NT86 NT79` and `NT83 -> NT47`. Let's follow both branches separately.\n\nFirst branch:\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 expands to NT82 NT76, and NT79 goes to NT36. So now I have NT86 and NT79. Let's expand each.\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. NT82 is `NT82 -> NT0`, and NT76 is `NT76 -> t74`. However, wait, NT76 produces `t74`, which is a terminal. So NT82 is `t0`? No, wait, looking at NT82's production: `NT82 -> t0`. So NT82 expands to `t0`, and NT76 to `t74`. So the first branch from NT86 becomes `t0` `t74`.\n\nNow, NT79 \u2192 NT36, which is a terminal. So that's `t36`. So putting it together: NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76 \u2192 `t0` `t74`. NT79 \u2192 `t36`. So the first part from NT83 in this branch is `t0 t74 t36`.\n\nWait, but NT83 can split into NT86 and NT79. So perhaps I should parse the entire string as a tree, but maybe I can process the string step by step.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial string starts with `t27 t6 t74 ...`. Let me try to match it step by step.\n\nLet's approach the string starting from S, which is NT43 NT61. Both of these need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT43's production: `NT43 -> NT83 NT77`. Then, NT83 can be either `NT86 NT79` or `NT47`.\n\nAssuming the first option, NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79. So, NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76, which then becomes `t0` `t74`. NT79 \u2192 `t36`. So the first part is `t0 t74 t36`.\n\nAfter that, NT77 \u2192 `NT27 NT3`. NT27 \u2192 `t25`, NT3 \u2192 `t3`. So NT77 becomes `t25 t3`.\n\nSo the expansion from NT43 would be `t0 t74 t36 t25 t3`.\n\nThen, looking at NT61: `NT61 \u2192 't33'`. So the initial string should start with `t0 t74 t36 t25 t3 t33`. But the given string starts with `t27 t6 t74 t3 t36 t40 t3 t0 t74 t33 t3 t21 t25 t21 t27 t74 t27 t25 t2 t0 t6 t33 t0 t87 t40`. So the initial expansion doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that NT83 has another production, `NT83 -> NT47`. Let's see what NT47 produces. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT47 as a terminal or a production. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking all productions.\n\nLooking back, after NT83, the productions are `NT83 -> NT86 NT79` and `NT83 -> NT47`. But there is no production for NT47; that's not in the given grammar. So this is invalid. The grammar probably doesn't have NT47 as a terminal because it's only listed in the productions. So this branch might not exist.\n\nTherefore, perhaps NT83 must expand to `NT86 NT79`, which we saw leads to `t0 t74 t36 t25 t3`. Then, NT61 \u2192 t33, as before.\n\nBut the given string doesn't start with this sequence, so maybe I took the wrong initial productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the alternative expansion for NT43, but the only alternative is NT83 NT77. So no, that's the only possibility.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parsing. Let's think in terms of how the string must be structured. The string starts with `t27`, which must be generated by some production.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT27 \u2192 `t25`, which isn't `t27`. So how could `t27` appear in the string? Maybe if some non-terminal produces `t27` as a terminal. Looking at the NT list, I see NT27's production is `t25`, which is a terminal. There's no NT directly that produces `t27` except perhaps for other NTs.\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar includes NT16 \u2192 `t3`. NT3 \u2192 `t82` and `t87` and `t40`. NT21 \u2192 `t6`, `t21` \u2192 `t6`, so perhaps `t21` is a terminal. Wait, no: in the grammar, NT21's production is `t21` as a terminal. So NT21 \u2192 `t21`.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT21's production is `t21`, which is just itself, meaning it produces a separate symbol. That's possible, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the grammar as given includes `NT21 -> t21` and also `NT21 -> t6`. Wait no, looking back:\n\nNo, here's the grammar provided:\n\nThe production for NT21 is `NT21 -> t21` but is there another? Let me check:\n\n- `NT21 -> t21`? Wait, yes, in the grammar, the line is `NT21 -> 't21'`. So NT21 can only produce `t21`, which is a terminal. So how did I get `t21` in my earlier analysis? I think I made a mistake there. \n\nSo, earlier I thought NT27 \u2192 t25, which is a terminal. NT16 \u2192 `t3`. So when I thought that NT16 expands to `t3`, but in fact, NT16 is defined as `t3`, so it's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step to see if the string can be derived.\n\nLet me list the grammar productions again for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 | NT47\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 \u2192 t0\n\nNT76 \u2192 t74\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n\nNT27 \u2192 t25\n\nNT3 \u2192 t82 | t87 | t40\n\nSimilarly for NT3 \u2192 t87? Wait, my bad, let me list all.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT3's productions:\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87'\n- NT3 \u2192 't40'\n\nSo NT3 is a terminal that can expand to three options, any of these terminals.\n\nLet me re-approach this. Starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 \u2192 t0 (terminal)\n\nNT76 \u2192 t74 (terminal)\n\nSo from NT83 via the first production, we have t0 t74. Now processing NT77:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n\nNT27 \u2192 t25\n\nNT3 \u2192 can be t82, t87, or t40.\n\nSo from NT3:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So it can produce a non-terminal pair or a terminal.\n\nThis might get a bit complex. Let me also note the productions for NT43 and NT83:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79 or 't27' or 't47'.\n\nWait, so NT83 can go to two non-terminals or two terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT82 has a production to 't0'.\n\nAlright, now the string to evaluate is:\n\nt3 t2 t82 t2 t33 t6 t3 t27 t0 t82 t47 t33 t36 t0 t82 t27 t27 t40 t82 t2 t3 t25 t25 t6 t0.\n\nSo I need to see if this string can be generated step by step by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the string. Each part is separated by spaces, so we can treat it as a sequence of tokens. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the string: t3, t2, t82, t2, t33, t6, t3, t27, t0, t82, t47, t33, t36, t0, t82, t27, t27, t40, t82, t2, t3, t25, t25, t6, t0.\n\nThat's 26 tokens.\n\nNow, the grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT43 NT61. So each derivation will eventually involve replacing S with NT43 and NT61, which then need to be expanded further until we get terminals.\n\nEach application of a rule replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and non-terminal, but I think in this case, each production is two non-terminals, as most of them are in the form A->BC, and some are A-> terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, most are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, but NT3 and NT16 also have productions going to terminals. So in the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals, which are the ones with productions ending with a terminal string.\n\nSo, the overall approach would be to see if the string can be generated by expanding S through applying the productions step by step until we get to all terminals.\n\nAlternatively, we can approach this by parsing the string from left to right, trying to match the productions. Since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, the parsing can be done with a method like Earley's algorithm, which handles all possible reductions.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to see if each part of the string aligns with the productions of the grammar.\n\nLet me also note that in the given grammar, S starts with NT43 NT61, so the entire string must be a combination of these two non-terminals expanded.\n\nSo perhaps let's decompose the string into parts that could stem from NT43 and NT61.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the structure of the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to simulate the parsing process.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and non-terminals:\n\nTerminals: t3, t2, t82, t2, t33, t6, t3, t27, t0, t82, t47, t33, t36, t0, t82, t27, t27, t40, t82, t2, t3, t25, t25, t6, t0.\n\nNon-terminals: NT9, NT59, NT43, NT83, NT28, NT62, NT45, NT29, NT77, NT27, NT68, NT0, NT56, NT16, NT25, NT79, NT32, NT3.\n\nWait, wait a second, looking more carefully, some non-terminals appear in the productions but their productions are either terminals or other non-terminals. So I should make sure that all non-terminals are accounted for.\n\nFirst, S is NT43 NT61.\n\nEach of these can be expanded into more non-terminals or terminals, until they reach terminals.\n\nNow, let me think about how to parse the string step by step.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, 26 tokens, this might take a while, but let's try to break it down.\n\nLet's think about the production rules and see which parts of the string can be derived from each non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the entire string, perhaps we can split it into parts that could result from NT43 and NT61.\n\nNT43 can produce NT83 NT77. Let's see if the first four tokens t3 t2 t82 t2 can be generated by any of NT83 or NT77.\n\nWait, let's see NT83: it has productions NT86 NT79, or 't27', or 't47'.\n\nSo if the first production is t83 -> t47, then t47 is one token, but our first token is t3.

{"custom_id":"request-284","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CFG). Hmm, okay, first, I should probably understand what the grammar looks like and how it can generate strings. \n\nThe grammar provided is a bunch of production rules, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and a combination of non-terminals and terminals on the right. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has either one non-terminal or two (either both non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal). \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers and some 't's and numbers interleaved. The string is: `t87 t42 t21 t3 t74 t21 t33 t87 t40 t0 t36 t21 t74 t21 t6 t36 t33 t87`.\n\nFirst, I remember that the way to determine if a string is generated by a CFG is usually through parsing or using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar isn't given in any standard form like Chomsky or Greibach, maybe I can construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards by seeing how the terminals can be derived from the non-terminals. Let me start by listing all the production rules again to see how the non-terminals might be deriving into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't82' (twice)\n- NT43 -> 't40' (twice)\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT59 -> 't2'\n- NT83 -> 't27' and 't47'\n- NT82 -> 't0'\n- NT76 -> 't74'\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT79 -> 't36' etc.\n\nSo, a lot of these non-terminals have productions that result in terminals. For example, some have direct terminal strings, others are combinations. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT43 and NT61. Looking at the string, the first part is 't87', which might come from one of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol's first production: NT43 and NT61. NT43 can produce various combinations, and NT61 is a terminal 't33'. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT61 -> 't33'. So for S, the first production would be NT43 NT61, which would derive into (derivations of NT43) followed by 't33'.\n\nIn the string, the first few terminals are t87, so that probably comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about which non-terminals can produce 't87'. Looking at the production rules, some non-terminals have 't87' as a result. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT83, it has 't87' as a production (twice: NT83 -> ... -> t27 and t47). Wait no, looking carefully:\n\nNT83's productions are: NT86 NT79, and also directly t87 and t47. So NT83 can produce t87 or t47. But let me check:\n\nWait, looking at NT83: NT83 -> NT86 NT79 | NT27 NT82? No, wait, in the grammar, NT83 is defined as NT83-> NT86 NT79 and also NT83-> t87 and NT83-> t47.\n\nSo NT83 can produce t87, t47, or combinations of NT86 and NT79.\n\nIn our string, the first terminal is 't87', which could come directly from NT83. So NT83 might be the first non-terminal in a derivation from S.\n\nBut S itself is NT43 NT61, which is two non-terminals. So perhaps to derive the string, we have to have S derive some sequence that starts with something that can produce 't87'.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string has:\n\nt87 t42 t21 t3 t74 t21 t33 t87 t40 t0 t36 t21 t74 t21 t6 t36 t33 t87\n\nThat's a long string, 20 tokens. Let's see the tokens in terms of numbers and 't's.\n\nSince some of these are 't' followed by a number, that likely corresponds to NT productions that produce terminal symbols, while others might correspond to non-terminals that need to be parsed further.\n\nFirst, perhaps the string starts with 't87', which comes from NT83. Let's try that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT43 NT61. If ND61 \u2192 't33', that's the last token of the string. Wait no, the string ends with t87, which is 19 tokens, so maybe not. Wait, let me recount the string:\n\nCount: 1: t87, 2: t42, 3: t21, 4: t3, 5: t74, 6: t21, 7: t33, 8: t87, 9: t40, 10: t0, 11: t36, 12: t21, 13: t74, 14: t21, 15: t6, 16: t36, 17: t33, 18: t87.\n\nWait, 18 tokens total.\n\nWait, in the context of S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the S's two non-terminals each produce sequences, so maybe the string is built from the concatenation of two derived sequences from NT43 and NT61.\n\nSince NT61 directly produces 't33', and that's the last part of the string (t87 is somewhere in the middle). Wait, perhaps the string is structured as the concatenation of two parts: one from NT43 and one from NT61. So let's split the string into two parts, the first part from NT43 and the second from NT61.\n\nBut I need to find where to split. Looking at the string, suppose the first part is from NT43 and the second from NT61. But I need to see if the string can be divided such that both parts are derivable from their respective non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by NT43 producing a certain part and NT61 producing another. But the string has multiple 't's, so the NT43 part may involve non-terminals.\n\nLet me see if the first part of the string can be produced by NT43.\n\nLooking at NT43: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, which is a combination of two non-terminals. NT83 can produce t87, t47, and also combinations. NT77 is another non-terminal, which has a production that is t42.\n\nWait, let me list all possible production rules:\n\nFrom NT77 \u2192 t42.\n\nSo in NT83 NT77, the possible terminal outputs would be t87 followed by t42, or t47 followed by t42, depending on the choice of NT83's production. Or maybe other combinations if NT83 has other productions.\n\nSo if NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, then that could produce (something from NT83)'s terminal outputs plus t42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t87, t42. That could fit if NT43 expands to NT83 NT77, which then becomes t87 t42.\n\nSo then from NT43, we have t87 t42 as the start, and that would come from NT83 producing t87 and NT77 producing t42.\n\nThen, after that, what comes next is another part"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S directly produces NT43 NT61. So, the initial parse would involve these two non-terminals. The string we're testing begins with `t87 t27 t47 t27 t42 ...`, which correspond to terminals. The first step is to see if the start symbol S can produce the leading symbols of the string.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the production starts with NT43 and NT61. So, the string should start with the concatenation of the leftmost symbols of NT43 and NT61. I need to find what NT43 and NT61 produce.\n\nLooking at NT43, it has two productions:NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'. Since 't40' is a terminal, one possibility is that NT43 directly produces 't40'. Similarly, NT61 \u2192 't33' is another terminal production.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string starts with 't87', which is not 't40' or 't33'. So maybe NT43 is producing a sequence that includes 't87' as part of it through a chain of productions.\n\nLet me check NT43's productions:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nSo, starting with NT43, it can either go to NT83 and NT77, which are themselves non-terminals. Looking at NT83:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 't47'\n\nSo NT83 can produce either NT86 and NT79 or 't47'. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 't42'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't87 t27 ...'. So possibly, I need to find a chain of productions starting from N terminals that result in 't87' at the first position.\n\nBut looking at NT87, I don't see it in the grammar. Only NT43, NT83, etc. So perhaps there's a typo, but no, the grammar provided doesn't have an NT87 \u2192 't87' rule. Wait, I should check all NT's.\n\nWait, the NTs given are: NT87, NT27, etc. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a rule NT83 \u2192 't47' and also NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79. Similarly, NT86 can go to NT82 and NT76, and so on.\n\nWait, but NT83 can produce 't47' as a terminal. So, perhaps 't87' is not directly present in the grammar, which suggests that maybe the string can't be derived because 't87' isn't a terminal symbol in the grammar's productions.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first symbol is 't87', so for the string to be generated, there must be a way for the grammar to produce this 't87' as part of the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to see if the initial symbols can be produced, or if the start S cannot produce the first 't87' because S produces NT43 and NT61, which don't directly produce 't87'.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nSo, the first symbols to be derived are NT43's symbols followed by NT61's symbols.\n\nNT43 can either be NT83 NT77 or 't40'\n\nSimilarly, NT61 is 't33' directly.\n\nSo, the first symbols would be either:\n\nIf NT43 is 't40', then the first part is t40 followed by t33, which is 't40 t33'\n\nBut the string starts with 't87', so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if NT43 is NT83 and NT77, then NT83 \u2192 either NT86 NT79 or 't47'\n\nIf NT83 chooses 't47', then the string starts with t47, which doesn't match 't87'.\n\nIf NT83 produces NT86 and NT79, then NT86 produces NT82 and NT76. NT82 can produce NT62 and NT0, and NT62 \u2192 NT45 and NT32. NT45 \u2192 NT28 and NT3. NT28 \u2192 NT27 and NT59. NT27 \u2192 't25'. Similarly, NT32 \u2192 NT56 and NT9. NT56 \u2192 NT29 and NT21. NT29 \u2192 't42'. NT79 \u2192 't36'.\n\nSo, following this path, NT43 would produce t25, ..., but I'm getting lost in the deep end of the recursion here. Let me try to map the symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol in the string 't87' is incorrect because NT87 isn't present in the grammar as a terminal production. Or maybe I misread the grammar rules.\n\nWait, let me go through all the NT rules again:\n\nNT87: Looking at the rules, I don't see a rule for NT87. So perhaps NT87 is a typo, and it's supposed to be NT83 or something else.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT43 can directly produce 't40'. So S produces 't40' and 't33', which would be 't40 t33', but the string starts with 't87 t27 ...'.\n\nSo, that suggests that the string cannot be produced by this grammar because the first symbols don't match any possible production from NT43 and NT61.

{"custom_id":"request-296","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is doing. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol. Some of the rules seem to produce terminal symbols like 't42', 't25', etc., which I'll call leaves. Others produce other non-terminals, which will need to be broken down further.\n\nThe string given is: t42 t25 t36 t74 t82 t21 t25 t6 t0 t27 t33 t33 t82 t25 t47 t27 t47 t21 t21 t87 t40 t47 t33 t82 t87 t6 t0.\n\nThat's quite a long string with 30 symbols. Each symbol should come from the grammar.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar to see if I can find a derivation path that leads to the entire string. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or the CYK algorithm could work, but I'm not using a computer, so I'll try to simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse-engineer the string to see if it can be broken down into the production rules. Starting from the end, but that might get complicated. Instead, maybe I'll try to match the string to the grammar step by step.\n\nLet me see which parts of the string are terminal symbols. Since all symbols are 't' followed by numbers, they're all terminal symbols because there are no non-terminals left in the string. So the goal is to check if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT43 NT61. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61. Let's see what NT43 and NT61 produce.\n\nLooking at NT43's rules, it's interesting. Wait, in the given grammar, NT43 appears on both sides of a rule and as a left-hand side. Let me look again:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77, and also NT43 -> 't40' (I think I missed that earlier). Similarly, NT3 has two rules: one to 't82' and another to 't87'. But looking at the string, I don't see any 't87's. Hmm. So in the string, I have t42, t25, etc., but not all possible ts.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT43 -> 't40' and NT3 -> 't82' and 't87'. Since the string includes 't40' and other 't's, perhaps the derivation path goes through NT43 in this case.\n\nWait no, the string starts with t42, t25, etc. Let me check the string positions.\n\nThe string is: t42 t25 t36 t74 t82 t21 t25 t6 t0 t27 t33 t33 t82 t25 t47 t27 t47 t21 t21 t87 t40 t47 t33 t82 t87 t6 t0.\n\nSo the first symbol is t42. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t42?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT56 -> 't27', NT27 -> 't25', NT86 -> 't82', NT0 -> 't42', and NT82 -> 't0'. But also, NT82 has 't25' in rule NT21 -> 't6'? Wait, no\u2014each rule is a production on the left and two on the right. Wait, no, in CNF, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nSo for NT21, the rules are NT21 -> 't6', but looking back at the grammar, the actual rules are:\n\nNT21 -> 't6' (I think), yes.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar list, each line is A -> BC or A-> a, since it's in CNF.\n\nLooking for t42, which could come from NT27 -> t25, etc. Let me find where t42 comes from. Looking at the list:\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nSo that's one way: NT0 can produce t42.\n\nBut to find the first symbol t42, it must come from a production that starts with NT0.\n\nWait, in the grammar: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S is two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61.\n\nEach of these needs to produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet me think about the structure.\n\nThe string starts with t42. So the first non-terminal in the derivation tree would have to expand into t42 as the first symbol. Since t42 is the first symbol, the entire derivation starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nSo the first symbol comes from NT43 or NT61. Let's see what comes first in the string. The first symbol is t42, which is the result of one of the non-terminals expanding into t42. Looking through the grammar, I only see NT0 \u2192 't42'. So is t42 being output by NT0, which is a non-terminal.\n\nSo perhaps a non-terminal is NT0, but how does it get expanded?\n\nWait, the string is t42 t25... So the first t42 would have to come from NT0, which means that some non-terminal must expand into NT0. But looking back at the grammar, the only place t42 appears is in NT0 \u2192 't42'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the list:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n\nYes, so to get t42, the non-terminal must be NT0. So we need to find where NT0 is derived from.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT0 is a non-terminal, and it can only produce 't42'. So perhaps earlier in the derivation, something produces NT0.\n\nWait, the overall structure is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string is two parts: the first part comes from NT43 and the second from NT61, or vice versa. But in the string, the first symbol is t42, so perhaps the first non-terminal in S's expansion is NT43, which needs to produce t42.\n\nBut looking at the rules for NT43:\n\nLooking through the given productions, NT43 is defined as:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nAnd in other rules, there's NT43 \u2192 't40'.\n\nSo NT43 expands into either NT83 NT77 or t40.\n\nBut to get a t42 as the first symbol, we might need to have something before NT43, but wait, S is NT43 NT61. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the first part is NT43, which needs to produce a string that starts with NT43's symbols, but the string's first symbol is t42. So let's see: can NT43 produce a t42?\n\nLooking at the rules, no. NT43 can either be 't40' or expand into NT83 NT77.\n\nWait, so perhaps this is a problem. Because the first symbol in the string is t42, which can only be produced by NT0. But for S to produce t42 as the first symbol, S must be expanded into a form where the first symbol is from NT0. But S is NT43 NT61, which are separate non-terminals. So each must produce their own parts of the string.\n\nSo unless NT43 or NT61 can produce NT0, the t42 comes from NT0, which S can't reach directly because S only expands into NT43 NT61, not NT0.\n\nSo perhaps this string can't be generated by this grammar because the first symbol t42 requires the production of NT0, which is not directly reachable from S. But maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that the expansion is not directly S, but perhaps through other steps. Let's think about how the parsing works. The string starts with t42. That must come from a production where either NT43 or NT61 expands into t42.\n\nLooking at NT43's rules, they don't produce 't42'; they produce either 't40' or NT83 NT77. So NT43 can't start with t42. What about NT61?\n\nLooking through the rules for NT61, in the given grammar:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo NT61 can only produce 't33'.

The string is: `t82 t74 t33 t3 t82 t40 t3 t47 t3 t40 t6 t27 t42 t36 t74 t2 t74 t42 t74 t27 t27 t21 t33 t42 t21 t33 t74`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals which are the 't's and numbers. The start symbol is S.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't82' and the grammar has a production '68 \u2192 t21', wait, actually, looking at the given productions, I need to spot any production that leads to 't's.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nFor example, 'NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76', which then '82 \u2192 t0' and '76 \u2192 t74'. So NT86 can produce t0 t74.\n\nBut the string starts with t82. So let's see if any non-terminal can directly derive t82.\n\nLooking at NT82: in the grammar, is there a production for NT82? Hmm, wait in the provided productions, I see 'NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0' and 'NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32', and so on. So NT82 isn't a terminal; it's further broken down. But the string starts directly with t82, which must come from an NT that has a production to that.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see 'NT82 \u2192 t0' is not present. Instead, looking back, I see 'NT86 \u2192 t82 t74' because '86 \u2192 t82' and '76 \u2192 t74'. So NT86 can produce t82 t74.\n\nSo maybe the start symbol S can go to NT43 NT61. Let's see NT43: checking the productions, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and NT83 can go to t27 or t47. Wait, in the provided productions, NT83 has two options: '83 \u2192 t27' and '83 \u2192 t47'. Similarly, NT77 can produce t27 or t42. So that's a bit complex.\n\nBut let me think step by step. The string starts with t82, so perhaps the first part is derived from NT86, which is derived from NT82? Wait, no, NT86 can produce t82 t74, but the string starts with t82, so maybe it's from NT86.\n\nWait, no, the string is 't82 t74 t33...'. So 't82 t74' would come from NT86, which is a non-terminal. So the string's start could be NT86, but then what's next.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S is a concatenation of NT43 and NT61. So NT43 is likely contributing part of the string, and NT61 another part.\n\nLooking at NT61, from the grammar: NT61 \u2192 't33' or... wait, in the productions, I see NT61 \u2192 't33' is not listed. Wait, looking back: Yes, it's listed. 'NT61 \u2192 't33''. So as a production, NT61 can directly produce 't33'. Similarly, looking at NT43, it can go into t40 or something else?\n\nWait, no, actually in the given productions, there are several NT43 entries. Let me check again. The productions for NT43 are: '\u2192 NT83 NT77' and '\u2192 NT43 \u2192 't40' in one line. Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nHere are the productions for NT43:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\n... and somewhere else:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, I notice that under NT43, there's a production '\u2192 t40' as well as '\u2192 NT83 NT77' and '\u2192 t43 \u2192 't82'? Wait, no, maybe it's a typo. Let me make sure.\n\nNo, checking again: \n\nThe grammar as given is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, so for NT43, the productions are:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT82 NT79\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, no, actually the last line says 'NT43 -> 't40'', which is a terminal. So NT43 can directly produce 't40' as well as composite productions.\n\nSo the string starts with t82. That suggests that the first part is 't82', which comes from NT86 \u2192 t82 t74, which would require NT86 to be a non-terminal.\n\nBut how do we get to NT86 starting from S, which is NT43 NT61. So maybe NT43 produces t82 via a production that eventually leads to t82, and NT61 directly produces t33.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t82, so perhaps the first element comes from NT43, which has a production that directly gives t82. Let me check: in the productions for NT43, there's no 't82' option, but there is NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and later NT83 has its own production.\n\nWait, in NT83, there are two options: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 't47'. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps I can build the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t82 t74 t33 t3 t82 t40 t3 t47 t3 t40 t6 t27 t42 t36 t74 t2 t74 t42 t74 t27 t27 t21 t33 t42 t21 t33 t74.\n\nLet's divide it into parts as per possible productions. Since the start is S = NT43 NT61.\n\nSuppose NT61 \u2192 't33', so the first 't33' is accounted for by NT61.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t82 t74 comes right after t33. So perhaps the sequence is S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33', so that's the first token.\n\nNow, the second token is 't82', which could come from either NT61 or NT43, but since NT61 just gives 't33', the next token must come from NT43.\n\nSo let's look at NT43.\n\nFrom NT43, we can have several productions. One is '\u2192 t40', another is '\u2192 NT83 NT77', '\u2192 NT86 NT79', etc.\n\nWait, the second token is 't82', so does any production of NT43 directly produce 't82'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (composite, so that would lead to other non-terminals)\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT86 NT79 (composite)\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT28 NT59\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nNo, no direct production for 't82' here. Wait, maybe through a chain. For example, if NT43 goes to NT86 NT79, which then NT86 can go to 't82 t74', and NT79 can go to 'something.\n\nWait, let me think: if NT43 \u2192 NT86 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-299","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of non-terminals and productions. The string to evaluate is: `t3 t87 t2 t42 t0 t33 t3 t36 t0 t0 t82 t0 t6 t25 t6 t47 t21 t36 t27 t21 t33 t0 t40 t47 t87 t3 t0 t6`.\n\nHmm, first, I should probably look at the grammar to understand the structure and terminals involved. \n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S is the start symbol, and it's directly followed by the two non-terminals NT43 and NT61. Each of these non-terminals must be expanded into a combination of other non-terminals and maybe terminals. \n\nLooking at the rules, I can see that many non-terminals are broken down into two parts, like NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT16, and so on. There are a few non-terminals that directly produce terminals: for example, NT3 \u2192 't82', NT43 \u2192 't40', etc. \n\nMy first thought is that the string given is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if it can be derived by expanding the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain. \n\nLet me try breaking down the string into parts that might correspond to the expansions. The string is: \n\nt3, t87, t2, t42, t0, t33, t3, t36, t0, t0, t82, t0, t6, t25, t6, t47, t21, t36, t27, t21, t33, t0, t40, t47, t87, t3, t0, t6.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Maybe it would help to write it out as nodes in a tree structure, but that's probably too time-consuming manually. Instead, perhaps I can start from the top-level symbols and see if they can produce this string when expanded.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string must start with NT43 followed by NT61, but both will expand into sequences of non-terminals and so on until terminals.\n\nLet's look at NT43. From the rules, NT43 can be either NT83 NT77 or 't40'. But we don't have any other options for NT43. So it's either an NT83 and NT77, both of which must expand further.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar rules, NT43 has two options: NT83 NT77 or 't40'. Hmm, but in the CNF, each production is a single non-terminal, so the rule is written as NT43 -> NT83 NT77, which is a binary split. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal turning into two symbols, each of which can be a terminal or a non-terminal. So NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 would mean that NT43 can be replaced by NT83 and NT77, each of which could be terminals or further expanded non-terminals.\n\nLooking again, NT43 can be either NT83 NT77 or 't40'. Wait, no, 't40' is a terminal, so that suggests that sometimes NT43 stops at 't40'. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nand\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nSo NT43 can produce either NT83 and NT77 as two separate non-terminals, or it can produce the terminal 't40'.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't82' and 't87', etc.\n\nBut wait, how does that work? If a non-terminal can produce two options, one being a non-terminal and another a terminal, then the expansion would require that when that non-terminal is encountered in a parse, it can either produce the next symbol as a terminal or continue expanding as a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, because in a context-free grammar, each production replaces a single non-terminal with a sequence of symbols (terminals and non-terminals). So when you have NT43 -> NT83 NT77, that would imply that NT43 is replaced by NT83 and NT77. Each of those could then be further expanded. Alternatively, if it's written as NT43 -> 't40', that's a terminal, so in that case, NT43 would just produce 't40'.\n\nBut then, how does this work with the fact that NT43 can be either a non-terminal or a terminal? That's a bit confusing because in typical CNF, non-terminals are only expanded into other non-terminals or terminals, but not a mix. Oh, but wait, no, actually, in CNF, a non-terminal can only expand into either two non-terminals or one terminal. So NT43 as a non-terminal can sometimes expand into two non-terminals (like NT83 and NT77), or into a single terminal.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is a non-terminal on the left side, and the right side is exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So perhaps the rules where a non-terminal is immediately a terminal are not possible in CNF. Let me check that.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, the grammar must have productions where each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, each being either a terminal or a non-terminal. So, for example, S -> NT X, where NT is a non-terminal and X is either a non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, that would mean each production only produces one non-terminal and one terminal, or two non-terminals. So a production like NT43 -> 't40' might not be allowed in CNF because 't40' is a single terminal symbol, but according to the structure, it should split into exactly two symbols. Wait, perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production's right-hand side must consist of exactly two symbols, which can be a terminal or a non-terminal. So a production NT43 \u2192 t40 is not following CNF because on the right side, it's a single terminal. So perhaps in the given grammar, I miscounted. Wait, looking at the given rules:\n\nWait the rules for NT43 are: \n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nand \n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nHmm, that means that when you have NT43, it can produce two non-terminals (like NT83 and NT77) or a single terminal. But that's conflicting with the definition of CNF because, in CNF, the right-hand side must consist of exactly two symbols (terminals or non-terminals). Therefore, the rule NT43 -> 't40' is invalid for CNF. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe it's a multi-symbol production, but no, the user presented it as individual rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar as presented, each production seems to be a non-terminal on the left and a series of right-hand sides separated by '->'. Oh, perhaps the user is actually providing a set of productions, where each is a production for a non-terminal. But in the provided grammar, some seem to be multi-symbol productions, like NT43 -> NT83 NT77, which is fine, as it's two symbols. But then the grammar also has:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, that can't be right because in CNF, each production must be exactly two symbols on the RHS. So, 't40' is a single symbol, making that production invalid for CNF. Therefore, perhaps that's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to write it differently.\n\nWait, maybe all the productions are allowed because in some cases, the productions can have a single terminal, but in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So 't40' as a single terminal would not be allowed in a production's RHS if the LHS is a non-terminal, as it would produce a single symbol, which would mean that the production is producing a single terminal, which is not allowed in CNF. So perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nWait, but moving on, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that some productions produce a single terminal. But in any case, perhaps the user intended to present them all in two-symbol productions, except for some terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the rules should be as given, regardless of CNF.\n\nWait, but regardless, perhaps this is a mistake, but perhaps the user had another format. Maybe the user intended to present it as the first rule having two non-terminals and another rule producing a terminal. So perhaps NT43 can produce either NT83 NT77 or 't40', which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That means the first step is S => NT43 NT61.\n\nSo the string should start with the expansions of NT43 and NT61.\n\nNT43 has two productions: one to NT83 NT77, and another to 't40'. Wait, but in the grammar, NT43 is defined as NT83 NT77. There was a typo earlier? Looking back: Yes, the original NT43 \u2192 't40' is actually given as NT43 -> 't40'. Oh wait, no, the user initially listed some entries where NT43 was duplicated. Wait, looking at the initial grammar:\n\nUnder the original user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nBut wait, the user listed NT43-> 't40' twice. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nWait, the initial grammar has:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nBut in fact, in the list provided, it's:\n\n\"NT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT40 NT3\nNT43 -> 't40'\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Wait, in the initial list, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, perhaps the NT43 has two 't40's, which is a mistake. Or maybe a duplication. It's confusing.

That can't be right because if NT43 has multiple productions, but in the given grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, that's a mistake because NT43 cannot have two different production rules as separate lines unless they're alternative productions. So perhaps it's a typo, and the real rule is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be another production, but perhaps it's a mistake and should be something else, like NT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nThat can't be right. It's unclear, but perhaps it's a typo, and the correct rule for NT43 is that it can either expand to t40 or to t77, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing NT43.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed, assuming that the intended production is either t40 or something else.

{"custom_id":"request-309","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Sometimes, the start symbol might appear on the right-hand side of a rule, and in that case, a new start symbol S' can be introduced with the rule S' \u2192 S. However, looking at the given grammar, it seems that all production rules either end in terminals or other non-terminals, except for S which directly produces NT61. But I need to check each production to ensure they fit the CNF.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT61 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n- NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n- NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT68 \u2192 't21'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT56 \u2192 't27'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3'\n- NT59 \u2192 't2'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't47'\n- NT82 \u2192 't0'\n- NT76 \u2192 't74'\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, I see that some non-terminals have two production rules, like NT83 and NT3 each having two. But in CNF, each non-terminal should have only one production rule, right? Or wait, no, each non-terminal can have multiple productions as long as each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So maybe the multiple rules are fine as long as each rule is either B\u2192C or B\u2192a.\n\nLooking at NT83:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT83 \u2192 NT47\n\nWait, NT47 isn't defined in the grammar. That seems suspicious because if a non-terminal is defined with a production that refers to a symbol not present in the grammar, it would be invalid. Looking back, the non-terminals listed are S, NT9, NT59, NT43, NT83, NT28, NT62, NT45, NT27, NT68, NT0, NT56, NT16, NT86, NT82, NT32, NT3, NT29, NT77, NT21, NT79. There's no NT47, so that production is invalid. So perhaps that's an error, but maybe I'm misreading. Let me check the original grammar again.\n\nYes, the user wrote:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nSo NT47 is not a defined non-terminal, which is a problem. But maybe it's a typo? Alternatively, perhaps the user intended NT43 to have two rules, but that would be okay as long as NT43 is defined as per some rules. Wait, looking back, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40'. So that makes sense because in CNF, NT43 can have two rules: one producing two non-terminals (NT83 and NT77) and another producing the terminal 't40'. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the issue with NT83 is that one of its productions refers to NT47, which is not defined. So that might mean the grammar is invalid, but perhaps the user made a typo or mistake. Alternatively, maybe the NT47 is not intended and is a mistake. So, maybe it's best to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the entire structure. Another non-terminal is NT3, which has two rules: NT3 \u2192 't82' and NT3 \u2192 't87'. That's acceptable because each production is either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t3 t42 t2 t40 t40 t40 t0 t2 t0 t36 t25 t2 t87 t21 t87 t87 t82 t21 t87 t74 t3 t74 t82 t25 t40 t27 t82 t21 t25`\n\nFirst, I should note that the string starts with 't3', which is the first token. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that immediately produces a terminal is S \u2192 NT61 NT43. But S is composed of two non-terminals. Let me check what NT61 and NT43 expand to.\n\nLooking at NT61: it directly produces the terminal 't33' according to the production NT61 \u2192 't33'. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nBut the string starts with 't3' not 't33'. So S starts with NT61 producing 't33' and NT43 producing another thing. Let's check NT43.\n\nNT43 has two productions:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT43 \u2192 't47' (but NT47 is undefined, which is a problem). Also, another rule is NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So, if NT43 first uses the first rule, it would produce 't40', which matches the second token in the string 't42'... Wait, the string starts with 't3 t42...', so the second token is 't42', but NT43 could produce 't40' as a terminal. So that seems off because 't42' isn't 't40' or 't47'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's take this step by step.\n\nThe given string starts with `t3`. So the first token is 't3', and the grammar's start symbol must expand to something that can produce this.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. S is defined only as NT61 NT43, according to the production S \u2192 NT61 NT43. So S isn't an explicit non-terminal symbol in the grammar, but rather NT61 and NT43. Wait, no, the start symbol is S, which is a non-terminal that must expand into two non-terminals plus a space, but the grammar is in CNF, so each production is either terminals or two non-terminals. But in this case, S\u2192 NT61 NT43, which is two non-terminals, so each of those can expand to their respective terminal or non-terminal. So the entire string must be a sequence of the terminals generated from S's expansion. Let's see.\n\nSo S must first expand to NT61 NT43, which means the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT61 and NT43. So let's look at each of these.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33' according to the production NT61 \u2192 't33'. So the first part of the string is 't3', but if NT61 produces 't33', that would match only if the string starts with 't33'. However, the string starts with 't3', not 't33'. So this suggests that maybe the string is not generated by the grammar, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps S has a mistake because S is defined as NT61 NT43, which would result in the string being two terminals, but the first one being 't33' from NT61, which doesn't match the given string's first token 't3'. So that's a problem.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which typically looks like A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar provided. It starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT43 NT61. So the first step is to break down these non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals until we reach the actual terminals. \n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT43 can produce either NT83 NT77 or 't40'.\nNT83 can be broken down into NT86 NT79 or NT83 -> t47. Wait, but NT83 also has another production NT83 -> NT86 NT79, and separately, NT83 is listed again as NT83 -> NT86 NT79. That might be redundant, but I'll note it.\n\nWait, let me check: The production list includes NT83 -> NT86 NT79, and then another entry for NT83 -> NT86 NT79. That's the same, so probably just listed twice by mistake, but it doesn't change much.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 can become NT83 NT77 or 't40'. So if we go for the terminal, then NT43 becomes 't40'.\n\nNow, the string I have to evaluate is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Let me write it out to see the pattern: \n\nt42 t6 t2 t0 t42 t27 t82 t40 t47 t36 t87 t87 t74 t25 t25 t74 t47 t40 t0 t82 t82 t87 t2 t36 t42 t74 t27 t2 t6.\n\nThat's 30 tokens. Hmm, that's quite long. Let me start breaking it down step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT43 NT61. So, I need to split this string accordingly. The first part starts with t42, so looking at the grammar, where can t42 come from? Looking at the productions, I see NT43 can produce t40 or other non-terminals. But t42 is a terminal. Checking the production rules, the only place t42 appears is in NT83 -> t42 and possibly others? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNo, t42 is produced by NT83 and NT87 (wait, NT87 is another rule? Let me check the list again.\n\nIn the productions, I see NT83 -> t42, NT28 -> t27, NT32 -> t56, etc. So t42 is produced by NT83.\n\nWait, but in my string, the first token is t42, so that must come from NT83. So the first step would be to split S into NT43 and NT61. Then, for each of these, they can split into further non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me start the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S -> NT43 NT61\n   So, the first two tokens should be parts of NT43 and NT61.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t42, which is from NT83. But NT43 isn't t42, so that might be an issue. Wait, in the grammar, NT43 has a production to 't40', but how does it get to t42? Maybe through a chain.\n\nLet's look at how NT43 can be expanded. NT43 can produce NT83 NT77 or 't40'. So if at some point, NT43 is broken down into NT83 and NT77. So each of these non-terminals can be further broken down.\n\nLet me think about the first token, t42. That must come from NT83, which is in the part that comes from NT43. So to get t42, NT43 must be producing NT83 NT77. Then, the first part is t42 (from NT83) and the second part is NT77. But wait, in the string, after t42, the next token is 't6', so that would come from NT77, right? Because NT77 is followed by NT87 or another terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT77 -> NT27 NT27 or 't42'? Wait, no, the productions for NT77 are: NT77 -> NT27 NT27 and NT77 -> 't42'.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nNT77 is listed as rule #17: NT77 -> NT27 NT27\nAnd another rule: NT77 -> t42.\n\nSo NT77 can produce t42 or two instances of NT27.\n\nSo, going back, the first token is t42 from NT83 (since it's the first in NT43's expansion). Then, the second part is NT77, which in the string is the next token 't6'. But wait, NT77 could be t42 or NT27 NT27. But 't6' is not an option for NT77. So that would be invalid, right?\n\nWait, maybe I got something wrong. Let me re-examine the string: It's t42 t6 t2 t0 t42 t27 t82 t40 t47 t36 t87 t87 t74 t25 t25 t74 t47 t40 t0 t82 t82 t87 t2 t36 t42 t74 t27 t2 t6.\n\nSo the first token is t42, which must come from NT83 (since NT43's other option is 't40', but the string starts with t42). Then, the next token is 't6', which would need to come from NT77. But looking at NT77's production rules, it can only produce 't42' or two NT27s. 't6' is not an option, so this suggests that this path is invalid. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to re-examine how the non-terminals are expanded. Alternatively, perhaps the first part of S is being split differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in assigning the tokens. Let's consider that S -> NT43 NT61. So NT43 would generate the first part of the string, starting from t42 and so on, and NT61 would generate the rest.\n\nIf I can't get the first two tokens to align correctly from NT43, perhaps the string is invalid. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the production chains.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong production for NT83. Let's check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> t47\n\nSo NT83 can be broken down into two non-terminals or produce t47.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t42, which isn't covered by NT83's productions. So this can't come from NT83. So then, how can we have t42 in the string? Because the only way to get 't' tokens is through terminal productions, which come from NT83, NT87, and others.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT21 -> 't25', NT32 -> 't56', NT25 is a production from NT27, but NT27 is a terminal? Wait, NT27 -> 't25', yes. So perhaps some terminals are coming directly from NT27.\n\nBut getting back to the problem, the first token is t42. Which NT in the grammar can produce t42? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT83: t42\n- NT27: No, NT27 is t25\n- NT87: Let's check if NT87 has a production.

{"custom_id":"request-327","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems to consist of a start symbol S and a bunch of non-terminals (NT) and terminals. The start symbol S directly expands into NT43 NT61, so whatever is on the left of the arrow, NT43 and NT61 must derive into the string's elements.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t's and numbers, split by spaces. The string is: `t6 t3 t87 t21 t82 t33 t74 t87 t82 t21 t87 t40 t21 t47 t2 t33 t21 t2 t74 t36 t2 t74 t3 t6 t40 t36 t47 t25 t87 t25`. There are 34 tokens here.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these tokens can be derived through the given productions. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, so 't6', 't3', etc.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT43 NT61, I need to find the rules for NT43 and NT61. Let's check the productions for NT43:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (again)\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (twice more?)\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n... and so on.\n\nSo, NT43 branches into NT83 and NT77. Let's see what those do:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nAnd so on.\n\nHmm, NT83 can go to NT86 NT79. Now, let's look at NT86:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT76 \u2192 NT74\nWait, is NT76 a terminal? The productions for NT76 is \u2192 NT74, which then is a terminal, as NT74 is a terminal (I think because NT74 isn't in the left-hand side of any production except the terminal 't74' in another rule).\n\nBut wait, the productions list doesn't show NT74 as a non-terminal; it only shows NT77, NT83, etc. So maybe NT74 is a terminal? Similarly, looking back:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't21', so 't21' is a terminal. So NT68 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs may be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me reconstruct the production rules as a list:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nThen NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33' \u2192 so NT61 is a terminal, 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82' \u2192 so NT3 is a terminal\n\nNT43 -> 't40' \u2192 so NT43 is a terminal\n\nWait, that's a big clue. So several NTs are terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S -> NT43 NT61, and both NT43 and NT61 seem to be terminals now because NT43 \u2192 't40' and NT61 \u2192 't33', so S directly gives 't40 t33'. But the given string starts with 't6', so that's not matching.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because in the string, the first token is 't6'. But according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and both NT43 and NT61 are terminals now. So S directly expands to 't40 t33'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't6', which isn't 't40' or 't33'. That suggests the string is not produced by this grammar, right? Because the start symbol S can only produce 't40 t33' as per the given rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me double-check the productions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT43 -> 't40' (line 11)\n- NT61 -> 't33' (line 19)\n\nSo yes, NT43 is a terminal 't40' and NT61 is a terminal 't33'. So S \u2192 't40 t33'. But the input string starts with 't6', which isn't 't40' or 't33'. Therefore, the string is not produced by the grammar.\n\nHowever, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there's a different path for NT43 or NT61. Wait, NT43 has only one production: \u2192 't40'. Similarly, NT61 \u2192 't33'. So there's no other way for them to expand; they're terminals.\n\nSo the start symbol S generates only 't40 t33' as a string. The input string starts with 't6', which doesn't match. Therefore, the string is not in the language of the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through again.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe I misread the production rules. Let me list all the rules clearly:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n\n- NT3 -> 't87'\n\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n\n- NT59 -> 't2'\n\n- NT83 -> 't27'\n\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, wait, I had missed some of these. So, for NT79, production is \u2192 't36'. Similarly, NT21 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me check NT43 and NT61 again.\n\nNT43 -> 't43' (but in the productions, NT43 \u2192 't40') but perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, the lines after S:\n\nLooking at the production rules, line 10: NT43 -> 't40'\n\nAnd line 13: NT3 -> 't82'\n\nLine 14: NT3 -> 't87'\n\nLine 32: NT27 -> 't25'\n\nLine 34: NT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, but in the initial list, the grammar is given with all these productions, so each line is a production starting with the left-hand side.\n\nSo, looking back, S is NT43 NT61, which are non-terminals. Their production rules:\n\n- NT43 -> 't40' (line 10)\n\n- NT61 -> 't33' (line 19), 't33' is a terminal.\n\nWait, line 19 is NT61 -> 't33'? Let me check.\n\nWait, line 19: \"NT61 -> 't33'\". But previously, lines 10,13: NT3 is 't82' and 't87'. Similarly, NT43 is 't40' in line 10.\n\nWait, so NT61 only has this production, right?

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production has two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or a non-terminal on the right. The string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t87 t6 t40 t36 t25 t6 t21 t36 t87 t33 t25 t21 t82 t3 t47 t21 t40 t27 t87 t82 t40 t2 t40 t25 t40 t40 t33 t25 t3 t3`.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar and see how the terminals in the string can be derived from it. The grammar starts with S -> NT43 NT61, so the entire string should derive from these two non-terminals. Let me check what NT43 and NT61 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 has two options: --> NT86 NT79 or --> NT83 NT47\n- NT77 -> t42\n- NT77 -> NT27 NT21?\nWait, the grammar shows NT77 -> NT27 NT21? Let me check the rules. Oh, wait, I see NT77 -> t42 and also NT77 -> NT27 NT21. So, if the string has a 't42' coming from NT77, then the other branch could be NT27 -> 't25'.\n\nSo, starting from NT43: T43 -> T83 T77. If T83 uses the t42 production, then T77 would be T27 T21, giving t25 t21. So that would make T43 produce t42 t25 t21.\n\nAlternatively, if T83 uses T86 T79, let's see what that gives. T86 -> T82 T76, and T76 -> t74. T82 -> T62 T0; T62 is T45 T32, which then is T28 T3; T28 -> T27 T59, T27 is t25, T59 is T42 T69? Wait, no, looking back: NT59 has two rules?

Alternatively, create a parse tree, but that might get complicated. Let's list the string tokens and see how they could fit into the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t87, t6, t40, t36, t25, t6, t21, t36, t87, t33, t25, t21, t82, t3, t47, t21, t40, t27, t87, t82, t40, t2, t40, t25, t40, t40, t33, t25, t3, t3.\n\nFirst, let's look for 't87's in the string because, in the grammar, NT87 doesn't appear, so perhaps the other productions lead to t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there's an NT87 -> 't87'. Also, NT29 -> 't42', NT77 -> t42, etc. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at NT29: NT29 -> t42.\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 cannot produce t87, because NT77's rules are either t42 or NT27 NT21 (which gives t25 t21).\n\nBut wait, I see NT87 at the end. Oh, looking back: There's a rule NT83 -> 't47' and also NT83 -> NT86 NT79.\n\nSimilarly, I see on line 18: NT27 -> t25, NT16 -> t3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has a t87 early on. Let's see: the string starts with t87.\n\nIn the grammar, the only NT that produces a t87 is NT87, but looking through the rules, it's not clear if any non-terminal directly produces t87.

Also, looking elsewhere, NT33 is a terminal 't33', so maybe that's part of another rule.\n\nWait, let me correct that.

Hmm, perhaps I need to see the possible expansions of NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT43 can go to NT83 NT77 or directly to 't40' via one of the rules. Wait, looking back: I think I misread that. From the given rules, I see:\n\nWait, the user provided:\n\n- NT43 -> 't40' (twice, but that might be a typo, since rules shouldn't repeat if they are same. Maybe just once.)\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe user provided a list of productions, one of them is NT43 -> 't40'. Another is NT3 -> 't82'. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me read the productions carefully.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking for where 't40' is produced: the rules:\n\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n\nAlso, looking at other rules, like NT83 -> 't47', which might be useful.\n\nBut the string starts with t40 t33. Let me think: S is NT43 NT61, so the first symbol should come from NT43, then NT61.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t40, which is the production for NT43. Then the next symbol is t33, which comes from NT61? Wait, no, NT61 has a production NT61 -> 't33' (from the given rules? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT61 -> 't33' is one of them. So NT61 can produce 't33'. So perhaps the first part is NT43 producing t40, and then the second part NT61 producing t33.\n\nSo the string begins with t40 t33, which would match the first two symbols. Then the third symbol is t87. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary split, so each step splits into two. Therefore, after the initial split, the two parts would each be non-terminals until they're fully expanded.\n\nSo maybe the string is structured as (Derivation from NT43) followed by (Derivation from NT61). So the total string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo, I'll need to break down the string into the first part (from NT43) and the second part (from NT61), then check if those parts match the possible expansions.\n\nLet me separate the string into two parts:\n\nLooking at the string: t40 t33 t87 t87 t74 t33 t47 t25 t27 t74 t87 t47 t40 t40 t40 t27 t2 t40 t2 t2 t33 t33 t6 t33 t27 t6 t74 t82 t6 t47 t87.\n\nHmm, that's 31 symbols. Maybe around 15 for the first part and 16 for the second. Not sure, but let's start parsing.\n\nFirst symbol after initial t40 is t33 (which is the end of NT43). So the next part would be the expansion of NT61, which is t33 and then continues.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the S -> NT43 NT61, so the entire string must be a combination of what NT43 expands to and NT61 expands to.\n\nSo I'll need to split the string into two parts, each derived from NT43 and NT43\/NT61. Wait, no, NT61 can only expand to 't33' sometimes, but looking at the rules for NT61: NT61 -> 't33'. So NT61 is a single terminal, 't33', so the second part after S's expansion will just be that t33.\n\nWait, but that contradicts. Let me re-examine.\n\nNo, according to the grammar, NT61 has a production NT61 -> 't33'. So that means NT61 can only expand to t33. Therefore, the second part of the string after S's expansion must be t33. So the entire string's second part just is 't33'.\n\nThus, the first part must be the expansion of NT43 followed by the rest as t33. Wait, no. Actually, the entire string is produced via S, which is NT43 NT61. So the entire string is a concatenation of (expansion of NT43) and (expansion of NT61).\n\nTherefore, the first portion of the string is the expansion of NT43, and the second portion is the expansion of NT61, which is just t33.\n\nSo the string is: [NT43 expansion] [t33].\n\nThus, the entire string, except for the last t33, must form a correct expansion of NT43.\n\nWait, wait, let me clarify: S -> NT43 NT61, so the entire string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT43 and the expansion of NT61.\n\nBut NT61 can only expand to 't33', which is a single terminal. So the entire string must have 't33' as the last symbol, which it does. So the first 30 symbols must form the expansion of NT43.\n\nWait, no, if S expands to NT43 NT61, then the entire string is the concatenation of NT43's expansion and NT61's expansion. So the entire string must be (expansion of NT43) followed by (expansion of NT61) which is just t33.\n\nTherefore, the string is [something derived from NT43] followed by t33.\n\nSo the total length is (length from NT43's expansion + 1) = 31.\n\nThus, the NT43's expansion must be 30 symbols long, followed by t33.\n\nLooking at the string, it is 31 symbols, so that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the first 30 symbols must be a valid expansion of NT43, and the 31st symbol (last one) is t33, which is correct.\n\nSo the main task is to check whether the first 30 symbols of the string (excluding the last 't33') can be derived from NT43 in the grammar.\n\nSo the first 30 symbols are: `t40 t33 t87 t87 t74 t33 t47 t25 t27 t74 t87 t47 t40 t40 t40 t27 t2 t40 t2 t2 t33 t33 t6 t33 t27 t6 t74 t82 t6 t47`.\n\nWait, no: Wait, the string is t40 t33 followed by t87 t87 t74 t33 t47 t25 t27 t74 t87 t47 t40 t40 t40 t27 t2 t40 t2 t2 t33 t33 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Oh, wait, perhaps the rules after NT3 are misaligned. Let me structure it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a formatting issue. Let me parse it correctly. The grammar is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nWait, that's another line above. It seems that some NT rules have two symbols on the RHS, as per CNF. For example, NT43 can be NT83 NT77 or NT43 -> NT40, but that seems odd because NT43 cannot have itself on the RHS. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the actual rule is NT43 -> NT40 terminal. Wait, perhaps the last few rules are:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So, for example, NT43 appears again in NT83's production: NT83 -> NT86 NT79, and also in NT45's production as NT45 -> NT28 NT3.

{"custom_id":"request-354","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string belongs to the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar. CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. In some cases, it can also be a single terminal, but usually, it's two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, and it produces NT43 NT61. Then NT43 and other NT symbols produce more symbols until they eventually produce terminal 't's and numbers. Some of the symbols are recursive, meaning they produce other non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of t and numbers: `t36 t0 t82 t87 t27 t74 t74 t21 t27 t2 t25 t2 t6 t6 t82 t25 t27 t6 t47 t82 t25 t82 t27 t33 t47 t36 t0 t3 t33 t42 t6 t40 t33`.\n\nMy goal is to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing context-free grammars can be done using methods like recursive descent parsing or using an algorithm like the CYK algorithm. But since the string is quite long, maybe I can approach it step by step, trying to break the string into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the entire string must be derived from S. S -> NT43 NT61, so the entire string should be a concatenation of something derived from NT43 and something derived from NT61. So, I can split the string into two parts, one that comes from NT43 and the other from NT61, but I'll have to figure out how to split them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT43 can be either 't40' or further derived into NT83 NT77. Similarly, NT43 can also become 't47' and other combinations. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit.\n\nLet me think. Since NT43 has multiple productions, perhaps I should look for parts of the string that correspond to each possibility. Similarly, NT61 has a production that directly goes to 't33', which might help in splitting.\n\nWait, NT61 directly produces 't33', which is a terminal. So the last part of the string ends with 't33'. Let me check the string: it ends with 't33'. So maybe the last part is from NT61, which is 't33'.\n\nSo, the string before 't33' should be the part generated by NT43.\n\nLet's see: without the last 't33', the rest is `t36 t0 t82 t87 t27 t74 t74 t21 t27 t2 t25 t2 t6 t6 t82 t25 t27 t6 t47 t82 t25 t82 t27 t33 t47 t36 t0 t3`.\n\nWait, but that ends with 't3', which might be connected to NT56 -> 't27' or other possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps the split is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. Since the entire string starts with S, which is NT43 NT61. Therefore, the string is a concatenation of the two parts from NT43 and NT61. So, if I can split the string into two parts, the first generated by NT43 and the second by NT61, then the string would be valid.\n\nNow, looking at NT61, its only production is 't33'. So the part generated by NT61 should end with 't33'. Therefore, I can split the string into two parts at the last occurrence of 't33'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the last token is 't33', so the entire string ends there. So maybe the string is NT43 producing the beginning and NT61 producing just 't33'.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens. The string has 36 tokens, I think. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the string: t36, t0, t82, t87, t27, t74, t74, t21, t27, t2, t25, t2, t6, t6, t82, t25, t27, t6, t47, t82, t25, t82, t27, t33, t47, t36, t0, t3, t33, t42, t6, t40, t33.\n\nWait, that's more than I thought. Let me count each t and number:\n\n1. t36\n2. t0\n3. t82\n4. t87\n5. t27\n6. t74\n7. t74\n8. t21\n9. t27\n10. t2\n11. t25\n12. t2\n13. t6\n14. t6\n15. t82\n16. t25\n17. t27\n18. t6\n19. t47\n20. t82\n21. t25\n22. t82\n23. t27\n24. t33\n25. t47\n26. t36\n27. t0\n28. t3\n29. t33\n30. t42\n31. t6\n32. t40\n33. t33\n\nSo, 33 tokens in total. So, the string is 33 tokens long. Since S -> NT43 NT61, which are two non-terminals, each generating a sequence of terms, the total number of tokens should be even if each non-terminal generates a single token. But here, it's 33 tokens, which is odd. That seems confusing because NT43 and NT61 each produce a certain number of tokens, and their concatenation adds up.\n\nWait, no. Each non-terminal production can have multiple tokens. For example, a production might lead to two non-terminals, each of which could produce two more, etc., so the total number of tokens isn't necessarily fixed based on the number of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, the start S produces two non-terminals, NT43 and NT61, so the entire string is the concatenation of what NT43 produces and what NT61 produces. So, the number of tokens in the string must be the sum of the tokens produced by NT43 and the tokens produced by NT61.\n\nBut in this string, we have 33 tokens. If S is two non-terminals, their productions must add up to 33. So, if NT43 produces k tokens, and NT61 produces m tokens, then k + m = 33. For example, 32 and 1, 31 and 2, etc. But since NT61 has a production that directly produces 't33' (so m could be 1), then NT43 would need to produce 32 tokens.\n\nHmm, let me see. The NT43 production has the following:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT43 can either be 't40' or break down into NT83 NT77. Similarly, NT83 can be 't47' or break down into NT86 NT79, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the paths that lead to 't's or numbers, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the first part is NT43, the second part is NT61. NT61 \u2192 t33, so the second part is just one token. Therefore, the first part (from NT43) must account for 32 tokens, because 32 + 1 = 33.\n\nBut that seems a bit hard to imagine. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the NT61's production isn't just t33, but more. Let me check the grammar again: NT61 \u2192 't33'. So, it's a single production to a terminal. So, the second part of the string must be a single 't33'. But in the string, there's a 't33' towards the end, but before that, there are multiple tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the split is different. Maybe the last part is not NT61, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the start symbol S does more than just two steps, but I don't think so.

NT83 has two productions: one to NT86 NT79 and another to 't47'. But in the given rules, I think this is a mistake. It shouldn't have two same NT productions unless it's intended. Hmm, maybe a typo, but in the context, perhaps it's supposed to be another rule. Actually, looking at the list, the last few entries repeat some NT numbers, which might cause confusion. Maybe it's a mistake in writing. I'll assume that each NT has only one production except for the ones listed multiple times. Wait, upon closer look, I see that NT83 is defined twice: line 4 and line 27. Maybe the intention was to have one production, so perhaps the second line is a mistake. For now, I'll proceed, assuming that each NT has a unique production. Perhaps line 27 is an error and should point to something else, but since line 4 says NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79, I'll keep that.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals: `t47 t40 t25 t40 t36 t42 t6 t42 t2 t74 t3 t27 t21 t6 t2 t33 t82 t74 t2 t47 t25 t36 t2 t47 t36 t25 t47 t27 t21 t27 t0 t42 t3`. \n\nMy approach will be to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step.

S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNow, I need to expand NT43 and NT61 into their respective terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (from line 4)\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 (line 5)\n- NT77 \u2192 't42' (line 19)\n- So, expanding NT83: NT83 \u2192 't86' 't79' (if we expand NT86 and NT79 further)\nWait, no, let me check the rules again:\n\nNT83 can either go to NT86 NT79 (line 5) or 't47' (line 27). Wait, I think line 5 says NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79, and line 27 is another production for NT83 \u2192 't47'. But in the given list, it's written as:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nSo, NT83 can produce either two non-terminals or the terminal 't47'. That's fine.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (line 4), which can then expand as 't47' if NT83 \u2192 't47' or other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, NT77 \u2192 't42' directly (line 19), so that's a terminal.\n\nSo, expanding NT43:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nIf we expand NT83 as 't47', then NT77 as 't42', so NT43 \u2192 't47' 't42'\n\nSo, the derivation for NT43 would be 't47' and 't42'.\n\nNow, moving on.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 \u2192 't33' (line 14), which is a terminal. So NT61 is straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together, S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 't47' 't42' 't33'\n\nWait, but our string starts with 't47 t40 t25 ...' so this suggests that the initial expansion might not be happening as I thought. Or perhaps I'm approaching it incorrectly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the entire string and apply the grammar rules step by step, looking for possible substrings that match the terminals generated by the non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into subparts that match the productions. For example, since S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the first part of the string should be NT43 expanding to a sequence ending with NT61 expanding to 't33'.\n\nWait, but looking at the string:\n\nt47 t40 t25 t40 t36 t42 t6 t42 t2 t74 t3 t27 t21 t6 t2 t33 t82 t74 t2 t47 t25 t36 t2 t47 t36 t25 t47 t27 t21 t27 t0 t42 t3\n\nLet me look for 't33' since that's where NT61 \u2192 't33' occurs. So the last part should end with 't33', and before that, the part before that should be the expansion of NT61.\n\nWait, no. NT61 is S's second component. Wait, S is NT43 followed by NT61, so the entire string should be the expansion of NT43 followed by the expansion of NT61, which is 't33'.\n\nSo, the entire string should consist of the expansion of NT43 followed by 't33'. So, the end of the string should be 't33', which it is. So, that part is correct.\n\nNow, let's go back to NT43:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT83 \u2192 either 't47' or NT86 NT79\n\nIf NT83 \u2192 't47', then NT43 \u2192 't47' 't42'\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terms are 't47 t40', which doesn't match.

{"custom_id":"request-358","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, and the grammar consists of several productions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way a grammar is structured, where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to fit this form. So, that checks out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t87 t27 t6 t33 t33 t0 t40 t87 t0 t47 t74 t6 t82 t6 t0 t0 t87 t6 t82 t2 t36 t27 t2 t3 t40 t47 t40 t87 t82 t33 t2 t3 t6 t82`.\n\nI notice that the grammar's terminal rules are all single characters, so each terminal in the string must correspond to exactly one production. Now, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's look at the production for S: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, S can only be expanded into NT43 followed by NT61. That means the string must start with whatever NT43 generates and then whatever NT61 generates.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT43 has two productions: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 NT40. Wait, in the given grammar, there's NT43 \u2192 't40' directly, so that's a terminal. So NT43 can generate 't40' or NT83 followed by NT77. Similarly, NT61 has a production NT61 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo, starting from S, the first part is NT43, which can be 't40' or NT83 NT77. The second part is NT61 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo the string must start with NT43's derivation. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: NT43 \u2192 't40', so the first token is t40, followed by whatever NT61 generates, which is t33. So the start would be 't40 t33 ...' but in the given string, the first token is t87, which doesn't match 't40'. So that path is not possible.\n\nSecond possibility: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So NT83 can produce 't82' directly or 't47'. Let's see NT83's productions: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 't27'. So NT83 can generate 't27' directly or two non-terminals.\n\nLet's consider the first branch: NT83 \u2192 't27'. So the first part would be 't27', and then NT77. What does NT77 produce? Looking at the grammar, NT77 \u2192 't42', so it's a terminal. So the sequence becomes 't27 t42 ...'. But the string starts with 't87', so that doesn't fit. Therefore, NT83 must be the second option: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nNow, NT86: productions are NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, and NT76 \u2192 't74'. Let's trace that. So NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. NT82 can expand to NT62 NT0. NT62 \u2192 NT27 NT59, and NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79. Let's see NT68 \u2192 NT21, NT21 \u2192 't6', and NT79 \u2192 NT36 or 't36'? Wait, looking back, NT79 has two productions: NT79 \u2192 NT36 and NT79 \u2192 't36'. So both lead to 't36'.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to map this out step by step. The string starts with t87, so we need to see if NT87 produces 't87'. Looking at the grammar, NT87 is not a non-terminal; all the NTs end with numbers. So t87 must be a terminal, which in the grammar, does any NT produce 't87'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't87' and NT29 \u2192 't42', etc. Wait, in the given productions, NT3 is defined as \u2192 't82' and 't87'. Similarly, NT29 is \u2192 't42' and 't77'. So NT87 is not directly a production; wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT3 has two productions: NT3 \u2192 't82' and NT3 \u2192 't87'. Similarly, NT29 \u2192 't42' and \u2192 't77'. So, in the string, I see t87, which must come from either NT3 \u2192 't87' or maybe another NT that leads to it.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The NTs are like NT87, but in the given grammar, I think it's actually NT93, but perhaps the numbers are not in the NTs. Wait, looking back, the grammar entries are like S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which suggests that the NTs are like N1, N2, etc., with digits as subscripts. So NT43 is a non-terminal that can produce other sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Let's reorganize.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string correctly. The string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: 't87', 't27', 't6', 't33', and so on.\n\nThe start is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the first thing is to expand NT43 and NT61.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33', so the second part is 't33'. Therefore, the first token in the string must come from NT43. But looking at the string, the first token is 't87', which comes from somewhere else.\n\nSo perhaps my initial thought was wrong. Wait, does NT43 produce 't87'? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions provided:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't82', 't87'\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT21, which \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, does any NT produce 't87'? Yes, NT3 does. But in the grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so if the start produces NT43 and NT61, and NT43 is a different non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the NTs. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the grammar might have mistakes. For example, in the productions provided, I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, this suggests that NT43 can be expanded into two different things: either a sequence of NT83 and NT77, or directly into 't40'. Similarly, NT3 can produce 't82' or 't87'.\n\nSo, the start S can expand into NT43 NT61, which are two separate non-terminals. Let's look at their productions.\n\nFirst, NT43:\n\nOption 1: NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nSo, the first token in the string would be 't40', but the string starts with 't87', so that's not possible.\n\nOption 2: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nSo, now we need to expand NT83 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT83:\n\nOption 1: NT83 \u2192 't27'\n\nSo, 't27' would be the next token, but the string starts with 't87', which still doesn't match.\n\nOption 2: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\nNow, NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n\nSo, NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT59 NT0\n\nThen each of those might expand further.\n\nThis seems like it's getting too deep. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to work backward from the string. Each token must be matched by the terminal productions of some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't87'. Where can 't87' come from? From NT3 \u2192 't87'.\n\nSo, in the grammar, NT3 can produce '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-367","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens: `t47 t0 t42 t87 t42 t33 t25 t21 t25 t27 t27 t6 t2 t47 t47 t33 t3 t36 t27 t36 t42 t33 t33 t6 t0 t3 t0 t36 t2 t6 t74 t2 t36 t47`. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this, except I need to check each production to confirm.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most productions on the right side have two non-terminals except for a few that end with terminals, like NT61 \u2192 't33'. However, in standard CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, productions can have a single terminal on the right side, so those are acceptable because 'a' can be a single terminal. So each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to see if the string can be derived by the grammar. The string consists of a sequence of terminals. The grammar's terminals are ts with numbers, and the non-terminals are NT followed by numbers. The start symbol is S.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards from the string to see if we can reduce it using the grammar rules. That is, parse the string top-down using the given productions to see if we can derive it step by step.\n\nLet me list the string again for clarity: `t47 t0 t42 t87 t42 t33 t25 t21 t25 t27 t27 t6 t2 t47 t47 t33 t3 t36 t27 t36 t42 t33 t33 t6 t0 t3 t0 t36 t2 t6 t74 t2 t36 t47`. That's a long string, 39 tokens.\n\nI'll try to group the string into phrases that can be generated by the grammar. Starting from the beginning, I need to find a sequence that matches a production. Looking at the beginning tokens: t47, t0, t42. Let me see if any non-terminal generates t47 followed by t0 t42.\n\nLooking at the productions, especially the start symbol S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S generates NT43 and NT61. Let's see what NT43 and NT61 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and also \u2192 't40'. Wait, but NT43 is a non-terminal, so it must produce symbols via other productions. The first production for NT43 is NG43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. But before we can get to t47, perhaps we need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to represent the string as a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, and then attempt to match from the top.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if each part of the string matches the rules. Let me try breaking down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look at the possible lengths. Since the grammar is in CNF, the maximum length of a string derived from any non-terminal at each step can be computed. The start symbol S can generate a string of length 2^n, where n is the number of productions, but I don't know the exact value here. However, the string has 39 tokens. Maybe 39 is possible because some productions can lead to longer strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the sequence of tokens and see if each can be generated by a production.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which immediately splits into NT43 and NT61, each of which must generate their own respective strings, concatenated. So the entire string must be the concatenation of two sub-strings: one generated by NT43 and the other by NT61.\n\nLooking at the first production, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the entire string is the concatenation of the string generated by NT43 and that generated by NT61.\n\nNow, let's split the given string into two parts for NT43 and NT61.\n\nBut how? Because NT43 could be a production that expands into multiple tokens, and similarly for NT61.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to split the string into two parts, the first part corresponding to NT43's expansion and the second to NT61's expansion. But without knowing the exact split, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards.\n\nStarting from the end of the string, let's see if the last parts can be generated by the productions. For example, the last token is t47.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which terminal is t47? Let me check the productions. I see NT83 \u2192 t47 is written twice: once as NT83 \u2192 t47 and once as NT83 \u2192 t47. So NT83 \u2192 t47.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 t25, NT25 \u2192 t25? Wait, let me check all terminals:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 t47\n- NT47 \u2192 t47 from multiple rules?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT83 \u2192 t47 (twice)\nNT82 \u2192 t0\nNT76 \u2192 t74\nNT77 \u2192 t42\nBut maybe I need to list all terminal symbols and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nWait, let's list each production that directly produces a terminal:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40' (but also splits into NT83 NT77)\nWait, no, looking back, each production is either a split into two non-terminals or just a single terminal.\n\nSo let me list all the terminal symbols and their producing non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions, the single-terminal ones are:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40' (wrong, because earlier I thought NT43 has multiple productions)\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 | NT83 NT77 | ...

Looking at the productions, 't6' appears as a terminal in NT27 -> 't25' (wait no, looking through the list):\n\nWait, let me find all terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT9 is derived from NT68 and NT16 (non-terminals)\n- NT59 is derived from NT68 and NT79 (nt)\n- NT43 can go to NT83 and NT77, or NT45 and NT3\n- NT83: NT86 and NT79, or itself and NT47, or NT82 and NT0\n- NT82: NT62 and 't0'\n- NT62: NT45 and NT32\n- NT45: NT28 and NT3\n- NT32: NT56 and NT9\n- NT56: NT29 and NT21\n- NT16: NT27 and 't3'\n- NT86: NT82 and NT76\n- NT76: NT74 and 't76'\n- NT82: also, wait, earlier it was NT62 and 't0', and here it's NT82 -> NT62 and 't0'. So NT82 can produce 't0' via that path.\n- NT79: NT73 (no, looking through the list actually, NT79 is in NT59 as NT68 and NT79, but NT79 has production NT73 -> 't42' and NT82 -> 't0'? Wait, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, looking for 't6' in the grammar, it's in NT27: NT27 -> 't25'\u2014no, wait, searching the list, I see that NT27 has production -> NT25. So that's a non-terminal. Hmm. Wait, let me find all places where terminals appear.\n\nLooking through all the productions, any NT that has a terminal?\n\nYes:\n\n- NT43 can produce 't40' (line 22: NT43 -> 't40')\n- NT43 can also produce 't87' (line 21: NT43 -> 't87')\n- NT3 can produce 't82', 't40', or 't87' (looking at lines where NT3 is the LHS).\n- NT29 can produce 't42'\n- NT77 can produce 't42'\n- NT79 has production NT73 -> 't42' and another production NT79 -> NT73 -> 't42'?\nWait, sorry, let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, line numbers might help, but it's better to note each production's options.\n\nLet me list all NTs with direct terminals:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT43 \u2192 't87'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT3 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT79 \u2192 't73' (if line 1 is 1: NT9 -> others), wait, no\u2014looking for NT... lines:\n\nI think this is taking too long. Let me find all the NTs that can produce terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT43 can produce directly 't40' or 't87' (lines 22 and 21 respectively)\n- NT38: not present\n- NT23: No, line 21 is NT43 \u2192 't40', same for 22\n- Wait, let's look through each NT:\n\nCheck all the NTs in the productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-375","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token corresponds to a specific non-terminal or terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a series of production rules where non-terminals on the left are expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals which are just symbols like 't' followed by numbers. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT43 NT61. So every derivation starts with the combination of NT43 and NT61. \n\nEach non-terminal seems to be defined by two other non-terminals, except for the terminals at the bottom of the hierarchy. For example, NT68 is broken down into NT43 and NT16. These eventually resolve to terminals as we go further down the chain.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t42 t6 t42 t82 t36 t0 t27 t25 t87 t42 t40 t82 t87 t82 t82 t33 t40 t42 t25 t6 t47 t2 t87 t6 t36 t36 t47 t3 t2 t6 t6 t27 t3 t21 t25`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has two non-terminals on the right side, so any valid string will have a length that is a power of two times the number of non-terminals, but maybe that's not directly applicable here. Instead, I should approach it by seeing how the string can be split into the productions.\n\nLet me start by checking the first symbol. The string starts with t42. Looking through the grammar, 't42' appears as the terminal for NT27 (t27) and others, but I need to trace back through the possible productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the only terminal t42 is in a few places: NT27, NT43 is also sometimes 't40', but let me check. Wait, in the provided grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT27 -> 't25' and others, but t42 is one of the terminals that appear in a few places like NT74, but let me double-check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT74 -> 't74'\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me go through each rule line by line:\n\n1. S -> NT43 NT61\n2. NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n3. NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n4. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n5. NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n6. NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n7. NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n8. NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n9. NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n10. NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n11. NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n12. NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n13. NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n14. NT61 -> 't33'\n15. NT3 -> 't82'\n16. NT43 -> 't40'\n17. NT3 -> 't87'\n18. NT29 -> 't42'\n19. NT77 -> 't42'\n20. NT27 -> 't25'\n21. NT68 -> 't21'\n22. NT0 -> 't42'\n23. NT56 -> 't27'\n24. NT16 -> 't3'\n25. NT59 -> 't2'\n26. NT83 -> 't27'\n27. NT83 -> 't47'\n28. NT82 -> 't0'\n29. NT76 -> 't74'\n30. NT21 -> 't6'\n31. NT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo, looking through these, 't42' is a terminal for NT27, NT43 (as per rule 16: NT43 sometimes becomes t40, but perhaps it's defined elsewhere?), Wait, rule 16: NT43 -> 't40' but wait, that's a direct production, but earlier, rule 4 says NT43 => NT83 NT77. Wait, no, rule 16 says NT43 is sometimes 't43', but actually, no, looking again, rule 16 is NT43 -> 't40', but that can't be right because earlier it's defined as NT43 production. Wait, maybe I need to look carefully.\n\nWait, lines 4 and 16 both define NT43, which is inconsistent. Line 4: NT43 -> NT83 NT77, line 16: NT43 -> 't40'. That can't be, because a non-terminal can't have two different productions. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nAfter S, we have:\n\n4. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nThen later,\n\n16. NT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, that's impossible, because a non-terminal can't have two separate productions. So perhaps I'm miscounting the lines.\n\nWait, let's list the grammar lines properly. The user provided the grammar as a block of rules, each on a separate line. The line numbers are given, but perhaps they're not in order, but I can see:\n\nThe lines with NT43 are:\n\n- Line 4: NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nAnd later:\n\n- Line 16: NT43 -> 't40'\n\nSo actually, those are two different rules, which is impossible in a CFG. That must be a mistake in the problem. Because a non-terminal can only have one definition. So perhaps line 4 was supposed to be a production, and line 16 is another. But that can't be, so perhaps line 16 is a terminal t40 for NT43. But then line 4 overrides that, which can't be. So that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps line 16 is the terminal form, and line 4 is another production. That can't be because NT43 would have to have both a production and a terminal, which is not possible. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar input. Because normally, each non-terminal would have only one definition. So perhaps line 4 shouldn't be a production for NT43. Let me re-examine the provided rules.\n\nWait, line 4: NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nLine 16: NT43 -> 't40'\n\nHmm, so according to this, NT43 could produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But that's invalid because each rule for a non-terminal must be unique. So perhaps one of these lines is incorrect. Wait, maybe the first line (line 4) is supposed to be something else, and the second (line 16) is correct. It's a common mistake in formatting.\n\nWait, perhaps line 4 was meant to be another production, but in the problem, the user included both, which is invalid. So maybe I should ignore line 4 and take line 16 as the production for NT43. That would make more sense, so NT43 is a terminal 't40'. But then why is there a line 4? Maybe that's an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps line 4 is the correct production, and line 16 is another production, which is impossible, so the grammar is invalid. But that's beyond my control; as a helper, I'll proceed assuming that the user made a typo.\n\nLooking back, perhaps line 16 is the correct definition for NT43, and line 4 is a typo. That would make more sense because otherwise, NT43 would have two different productions, which is impossible.\n\nSo I'll assume the correct productions are as follows:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nThat would resolve the conflict. Now, with that assumption, I can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT16, there are two different productions:\n\nLine 10: NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nLine 24: NT16 -> 't3'\n\nAgain, this can't be, as NT16 would have two different rules. So one of these must be a typo. But again, I'm proceeding based on the assumption"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are quite complex, with multiple non-terminals and terminals. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are as follows. Each production is written with the non-terminals on the left and the right-hand side. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't33', 't82', etc.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions. Alternatively, working backwards, I can parse the string using the grammar to see if it can be reduced to the start symbol.\n\nGiven the string is a series of terminals, each token in the string must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Looking at the string, all tokens are 't' followed by numbers, which are the terminals in the grammar. So that's good; each token in the string is present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nNow, I need to check if the string can be constructed by the grammar. Let me try to see if each part can be parsed according to the rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string, it's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if these can be derived from S. Alternatively, perhaps I can parse it step by step, breaking it down from left to right, using the grammar.\n\nBut before getting into that, let's see if there's a way to model this as a recursive descent parser or perhaps use a table-driven approach, but given the complexity, maybe it's better to look for a pattern.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand side of some productions generate certain sequences. For example, S -> NT43 NT61. So S starts with NT43 and NT61, which are non-terminals. Each of these must generate sequences that are two tokens long. Wait, no, in context-free grammars, each production produces a sequence of symbols, so each non-terminal will produce a string, and the total string generated by S will be the concatenation of the two strings produced by NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t36 t82 t21 t6 t2 t47 t82 t27 t3 t25 t42 t40 t74 t25 t42 t36 t25 t74 t74 t2 t40 t6 t36 t74 t6 t27 t33 t36 t33 t21 t0 t27 t87 t6 t36 t40.\n\nWe can model this as starting with S and trying to split the string into two parts, the first generated by NT43 and the second by NT61.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S produces NT43 followed by NT61. So the string should start with the production from NT43, followed by the production from NT61.\n\nSo first, let's check the beginning of the string. The first symbol is 't36'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't36'? Looking through the list:\n\nNT3 -> 't82' (but wait, no, looking again: NT3 -> 't82'? Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking back, the productions are:\n\nNT3 -> 't82' (is this correct? Let me check the original grammar. The original grammar has:\n\nNT3 -> 't82' (from the list at the end, yes: NT3 -> 't82')\nSimilarly, NT36 is in the list but not as a start symbol, but it's a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, each non-terminal is on the left side of a production. Let me list the productions again properly:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'  [Ah, this is another production for NT83]\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\nAnd others.\n\nSo, looking for which non-terminals can produce 't36'. From the list, NT79 -> 't36'. So NT79 can produce 't36', which is the first 't36' in the string. So perhaps NT79 produces 't36'?\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't36', which is generated by NT79's production.\n\nSo, S begins with NT43 followed by NT61. So the first part of the string generated by NT43 must be the first part of the string, and the second part by NT61.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't36', which is generated by NT79 -> 't36'. So is NT43 able to generate the first part before the 't36'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nThe string is a single sequence; I need to consider how it can be split into two parts, each generated by NT43 and NT61.\n\nWait, no. S produces NT43 NT61, and each of those is a sequence of symbols. So the entire string is split into two parts, the first part generated by NT43, and the second part by NT61, and the two are concatenated.\n\nTherefore, the string must be split into two contiguous segments, where the first segment is generated by NT43's production, and the second by NT61's production.\n\nSo first, I need to find if the entire string can be split into two parts, such that the first part is generated by NT43 and the second by NT61.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt36 t82 t21 t6 t2 t47 t82 t27 t3 t25 t42 t40 t74 t25 t42 t36 t25 t74 t74 t2 t40 t6 t36 t74 t6 t27 t33 t36 t33 t21 t0 t27 t87 t6 t36 t40.\n\nI need to see if there's a k such that the first k tokens form a string generated by NT43, and the remaining (length of string - k) tokens form a string generated by NT61.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a parse tree, but given the complexity, maybe I can look for specific sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for the production of NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions: NT43 -> NT83 NT77 | NT43 -> 't40' and another production: NT43 -> 't47', but wait, looking back, in the given grammar, NT43 has two productions: NT43 -> NT83 NT77, NT43 -> 't40', and wait, also NT43 -> 't47'?

{"custom_id":"request-386","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll recap what I know. A CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS) expands into two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS). This structure is helpful for certain parsing algorithms, but for my task, I just need to see if the given string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe grammar provided consists of a series of rules. Each rule looks like A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for those ending with a terminal (like 't33'). Some of the RHS seem to have terminals, and others continue to split into more non-terminals. Since the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, I need to see if this string can result from the top symbol S expanding into a series of these productions.\n\nLet's look at the string: `t74 t87 t82 t6 t36 t40 t42 t27 t3 t2 t82 t33 t47 t87 t2 t42 t2 t74 t21 t40 t36 t42 t2 t0 t36 t42 t87 t3 t6 t2 t36 t33 t33 t74 t3 t2`. \n\nHmm, that's a long string. Let's start by checking the start symbol, S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the start is the concatenation of NT43 and NT61.\n\nLet me see: NT43 can be explored. Looking at the rules, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. Then, NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79, and NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76. NT82 is a terminal, t0, but in the string, I see t82. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. NT86 produces t82, so if the string starts with t82, that would come from NT86, but wait, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. Then NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79. NT86 is 't82', so that could match the first part. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 't42', which could be a part later in the string.\n\nBut wait, let me see. The string starts with t74 t87 t82 t6... I'm getting confused because the string starts with several t's, but I'm not sure if it matches the derivation from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work backwards from the first token. Let's check if t74 can come from some non-terminal. Looking through the rules, which non-terminals can produce 't74'? \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT76 \u2192 't74', and NT27 \u2192 't25' (No, that's not t74). NT79 \u2192 't36', but that's not relevant here. NT83 \u2192 't27' and 't47'. Hmm, wait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. Wait, I might have made a mistake. Looking back at the rules: \n\nWait, NT76 \u2192 't74' is there, right? So if the string starts with t74, it must come from NT76, which is derived from NT86. So, for example, if a non-terminal A \u2192 B C, where B is NT86 \u2192 't82', and C is NT78? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the rules again.\n\nIn the rules, NT76 \u2192 't74' and 't79', I think. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the rules given, I see:\n\nNT76 \u2192 NT82 NT76? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me parse them correctly.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- NT76 \u2192 NT82 NT76? No, the rules are:\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT76 \u2192 't74' and 't79' ??? Wait, no, the rules are:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not reading them correctly.

NT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, I'm seeing that some non-terminals have multiple 't' productions, like NT83 has two rules for t27 and t47. Similarly, NT82 has t0. \n\nBack to the initial string: it starts with t74 t87 t82 t6...\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t74. So in the grammar, which non-terminal gives 't74'? Looking through the rules:\n\nFrom the above, I see:\n\nNT76 \u2192 't74' (rule 29) and maybe others? Wait, rule 29 is NT76 \u2192 't74' and NT29 \u2192 't42' (rule 18). So NT76 can produce t74 or others. But in the rule for NT76, from the list, I see something else? Wait no, in rule 29, NT76 appears to be terminal. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nReview the rules:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nRule 21: NT68 \u2192 't21'\nRule 22: NT0 \u2192 't42'\nRule 23: NT56 \u2192 't27'\nRule 24: NT16 \u2192 't3'\nRule 25: NT59 \u2192 't2'\nRule 26: NT83 \u2192 't27' and 't47'\nRule 27: NT83 \u2192 't47'\nRule 28: NT82 \u2192 't0'\nRule 29: NT76 \u2192 't74'\nRule 30: NT21 \u2192 't6'\nRule 31: NT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, so in rule 29, NT76 \u2192 't74' only. So the only way to get 't74' is from NT76.\n\nSo, the string starts with t74, meaning the non-terminal must be NT76.\n\nBut how does NT76 get in the derivation? To get NT76, we need to look at the grammar. Do we have any production rules that lead to NT76?

The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules, and the input string is quite long, consisting of various elements separated by spaces. \n\nFirst off, I remember that a context-free grammar consists of a start symbol, some non-terminals, and a set of production rules. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, it does fit this structure because every rule seems to have either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string can be derived by the grammar. One approach is to use the method of tracing the derivation, starting from the start symbol and trying to expand it step by step to see if we can form the input string. However, doing this manually for a long string would be tedious and error-prone, especially since the string has many elements.\n\nAlternatively, I can try using a parsing approach, perhaps a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll stick to the first method of tracing the derivation in a structured way.\n\nLet me start by identifying all the symbols in the string and mapping them to their respective production rules. The string is: t6, t36, t25, t74, t42, t33, t40, t36, t47, t74, t6, t36, t21, t47, t36, t47, t2, t74, t27, t27, t47, t3, t74, t3, t36, t87, t42, t87, t47, t33, t74, t3, t40, t2, t21, t0, t36.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I can list the possible expansions for each terminal:\n\n- t42: NT3, NT29, NT3, etc. Wait, checking the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't82' and NT3 is mentioned multiple times.

So the initial parse should start from S.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules for clarity:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, I notice that NT43 has two productions: one to 't40' and another to 't43', but looking close, no. Actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, no, the original grammar says NT43->'t40' and also NT43->'t47'? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40' and NT3 -> 't82', etc. So:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nAnd also there's NT43 -> 't47'?\n\nWait, no, in the original message, the user listed:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nAnd then later:\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nHere are the production rules:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\n... etc.\n\nThen the terminal rules:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nWait, but this is problematic because NT3 can produce 't82' or 't87' or 't40'? Wait, no, in the original user provided grammar, I think the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me list out the terminal productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo the only non-terminals are those with arrows, the rest are terminals. So NT43 has a production to 't40' but also possibly others? Wait, no, the user listed:\n\nNT43 -> 't40' and NT43 -> NT83 -> 't47' but wait, no, actually, looking at the original grammar, the production for NT43 is:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nand another production for NT43 is to NT83 -> 't47', but no, wait, no. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nLooking back, the production for NT43 is:\n\nNT43 -> 't40' and also NT43 -> NT3? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nBut also, the grammar has NT3 -> 't82', etc. But NT43 has only one production: NT43 -> 't40'?\n\nWait, no. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original user's grammar, they have:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nAnd that's it for NT43. But wait, the initial question had both NT43->'t40' and NT3->'t42', etc. So perhaps there's a mix-up.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing NT43 with NT3.

{"custom_id":"request-398","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of t's with numbers, like `t0 t27 t40 ...` and so on. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring CFGs where all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit because each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16, etc.\n\nNow, the string is a series of terminals: t0, t27, t40, and so on. The question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S. \n\nIn CNF, each production step either combines two non-terminals into another non-terminal or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal. So, starting from S, each step would replace non-terminals with their respective productions until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level production is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S must expand into NT43 and NT61. Therefore, the string should start with the symbols derived from NT43 and NT61.\n\nThe string starts with `t0 t27 t40 ...`. Let's see what NT43 and NT61 produce. \n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 or NT43 can also go to 't40' if it's a terminal. Wait, looking back, I see NT43 \u2192 't40'. So that's a production rule where NT43 directly becomes t40.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 \u2192 't33'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be the terminals derived from NT43 and NT61, which are t40 and t33 respectively. But looking at the string, the first symbol is t0. That doesn't match. Hmm. So that would suggest that either the string is not derived from NT43 and NT61, or there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, no. Let's double-check: NT43 can produce 't40' directly, so S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which would expand to 't40' 't33'. So the string should start with t40 t33. However, the given string starts with t0. That's a contradiction. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the way the productions work. Each production is a leftmost derivation, so the leftmost symbols are expanded first. So S becomes NT43 NT61. If NT43 can produce t40, and NT61 can produce t33, then the string should start with t40 t33. But the string starts with t0, which is not t40. \n\nAlternatively, maybe NT43 can have other expansions. For example, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, which can then expand further. Let me see the chain from NT83:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\nNT29 \u2192 't42'\nNT76 \u2192 't74'\nSo NT83 expands to t42 (from NT29) and t74 (from NT76). So NT83 becomes t42 t74. Wait, but NT83 might go through more steps. Let me outline the entire expansion:\n\nStart with NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't42'.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42'.\n\nSo substituting these expansions, NT83 would be t42 (from NT29) and NT77 is t42 (from NT77's production?), wait, no, looking at NT77's production:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42'. So NT77 becomes t42 directly.\n\nSo combining: NT83 \u2192 t42 (from NT86 down to NT29) and 't74' (from NT76?)\n\nWait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nEach NT can expand as follows:\n\nStarting with NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't42'.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42' (since NT77 can go to t42 directly).\n\nSo NT83's expansion would be t42 (from NT29) and NT79's expansion, which is 't2', because NT79's production is 't2'. \n\nWait, so NT79 \u2192 't2'.\n\nTherefore, NT83 becomes t42 t2. But the NT77 becomes t42. So overall, NT83 NT77 would expand to t42 t2 t42. \n\nSo that would make NT43 expand to t42 t2 t42.\n\nThen, going back to S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which would be t42 t2 t42 (from NT43) followed by t33 (from NT61). So the two parts are t42 t2 t42 and t33, making the entire string t42 t2 t42 t33.\n\nBut wait, the given string starts with t0, which is entirely different. So the initial expansion doesn't match the string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe S can expand into other forms? Wait, no, S only goes to NT43 NT61. So unless the string is derived from another start symbol, which it's not, the string doesn't start with t40 t33, which is what S produces.\n\nTherefore, the string provided doesn't start with the expected sequences from S, so it's not possible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with `t0`, which doesn't match the first productions of NT43 and NT61 needed to derive from S. \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-404","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nThe grammar consists of several productions, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and right-hand side expressions of two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like `t40 t47 t36 ...`. \n\nI think the best approach is to perform a leftmost derivation, trying to break down the string step by step according to the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each part can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems to have a series of productions where each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals until a terminal is reached. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT43 NT61. So the initial expansion would be two parts: one starting with NT43 and another with NT61.\n\nLet me write down the structure:\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n- NT43 \u2192 ... (various options)\n- NT61 \u2192 't33' (so this part is terminal, meaning the 't33' will be at the end of the string in the generated language)\n\nSo the string ends with 't42' followed by 't82' followed by 't74', but I think in the string, it ends with 't33 t74 t33 t74 t0 t47 t82 t25 t25 t27 ...' Hmm, wait, the string given is: `t40 t47 t36 t2 t0 t27 t82 t87 t82 t2 t87 t33 t74 t33 t74 t0 t47 t82 t25 t25 t27 t3 t3 t33 t25 t6 t87`. It ends with 't47 t82 t25 t25 t27 t3 t3 t33 t25 t6 t87', which includes 't33 t25 ...' and some terminals.\n\nSince NT61 only has one production, which is NT61 \u2192 't33', the part after NT61 in S's expansion must be 't33'. So that part is at the end of the expansion. That means the string must end with 't33', but looking at the string, the last part is '... t33 t25 t6 t87'. So wait, there's another 't33' two places before the end? That might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the string.\n\nWait, let me check the string again: `t40 t47 t36 t2 t0 t27 t82 t87 t82 t2 t87 t33 t74 t33 t74 t0 t47 t82 t25 t25 t27 t3 t3 t33 t25 t6 t87`.\n\nSo looking at this, the last segment ends with 't87', but I thought NT61's expansion is 't33'. Hmm, perhaps I need to parse it differently. Maybe the end of the string is derived from NT61's production. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by attempting to parse the string step by step, reducing it to the start symbol S, using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me note that the string is a flat list of terminals, so I need to build it from the start symbol S, expanding it into non-terminals, which in turn expand into more non-terminals and terminals until the entire string is covered.\n\nBut given that NT61 \u2192 't33', perhaps the last part of the string must expand to 't33', which is at position t33 in the string, possibly repeated.\n\nWait, looking again, the string has 't33' at position 8 (counting from 0: positions 8 and 9). So the string is:\n\n0: t40\n\n1: t47\n\n2: t36\n\n3: t2\n\n4: t0\n\n5: t27\n\n6: t82\n\n7: t87\n\n8: t82\n\n9: t2\n\n10: t87\n\n11: t33\n\n12: t74\n\n13: t33\n\n14: t74\n\n15: t0\n\n16: t47\n\n17: t82\n\n18: t25\n\n19: t25\n\n20: t27\n\n21: t3\n\n22: t3\n\n23: t33\n\n24: t25\n\n25: t6\n\n26: t87\n\nSo perhaps I should see how this can be broken down, starting from S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Since S is producing two parts, maybe the string is a concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT43 and another from NT61. But wait, NT61 directly produces 't33', which is a terminal. So the second part of the string should be exactly 't33'. However, looking at the string, it ends with 't87', which is longer than that. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps the NT61 is somewhere in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by expanding NT43 into a sequence, and then NT61 into 't33'. So the entire string would be the expansion of NT43's part followed by 't33'.\n\nSo the string must be the concatenation of NT43's expansion and 't33'. Let me check the string: from the end, the last part is 't33' at position 11, but followed by more symbols up to 26. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the NT43 expansion ends. Alternatively, maybe NT43's expansion ends with 't33', and then NT61's expansion is 't33', but that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the overall string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT43 and 't33', so I can split the string into two parts: before 't33' and including 't33'. So the two parts would be:\n\nPart1: t40 t47 t36 t2 t0 t27 t82 t87 t82 t2 t87 t33 t74 t33 t74 t0 t47 t82 t25 t25 t27 t3 t3 t33 t25 t6\n\nPart2: t87\n\nBut then Part2 must be 't33', but it's 't87', which doesn't match. So maybe that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT61 production is not the last part. Maybe the NT61 is in the middle, and the entire string is built by several expansions.\n\nAnother approach is to find the rightmost derivation, which often helps in CF grammars. Starting from the string, each step we find a non-terminal part and reduce it.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps the best way is to look for the last symbols and see if they match any productions.\n\nLooking at the string: ends with t87. But none of the productions end with t87 directly. The productions go up to t87, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the last part can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT74. Let me check the productions for NT74. Looking through the provided rules, I see NT74 is not directly a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the provided rules, NT74 is not present, but NT74 is not even listed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-411","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar's starting symbol is S, which produces NT43 NT61. Each of these, in turn, breaks down into other non-terminals and terminals. The first step is to see how the string is constructed based on these rules.\n\nThe string given is a series of tokens separated by spaces. I notice that many of these are 't' followed by numbers, like 't33', 't2', etc. Some others are numbers without 't', like 't42', 't74', etc. I think each of these represents either a non-terminal that produces that token or a terminal that must exactly match.\n\nI need to parse the string step by step according to the grammar. Starting from S, which is NT43 NT61. From the grammar, both NT43 and NT61 have productions. Let's see:\n\nNT43 can go to NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47. NT61 goes directly to 't33'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT61 -> 't33'. So when we have NT61, it produces 't33' directly. So the second part of S (NT61) is 't33' for sure.\n\nNow, the first part is NT43. Looking at its productions:\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77 or NT43 -> NT83 NT47.\n\nWait, actually the grammar shows NT43 -> NT83 NT77 and NT43 -> NT83 NT47. So NT43 can produce either NT83 NT77 or NT83 NT47.\n\nBut let's see the string. The start of the string is t33, which comes from NT61. So the string starts with t33, which matches. Then after that, we have t2 t2 t74 t42 t0 t36 t21 t21 t47 t47 t0 t87 t40 t42 t82 t6 t3 t33 t... etc. Hmm, that's a lot.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the overall structure. Let me write down the grammar rules and see possible ways the string can be broken down.\n\nSince S -> NT43 NT61, and NT61 is always 't33', the string must start with the result of NT43. So whatever NT43 produces, it's the first part, followed by 't33'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the part after t33 is t2 t2 t74 t42 t0 t36 t21 t21 t47 t47 t0 t87 t40 t42 t82 t6 t3 t33... This seems like a long sequence, so I need to see if it can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLet me first try to determine what the string is composed of. Let me look at each token:\n\nt33, t2, t2, t74, t42, t0, t36, t21, t21, t47, t47, t0, t87, t40, t42, t82, t6, t3, t33, t2, t6, t74, t2, t36, t21, t36, t3, t3, t21, t33, t6, t33, t27, t42, t74, t21, t0, t33, t25.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let's see if I can find the starting point.\n\nSince S -> NT43 NT61, which is NT43 followed by 't33'. So the string must have two parts: the first part from NT43 and then 't33' at the end? Wait, no: NT43 and NT61 are concatenated, so the entire string should be NT43's expansion followed by 't33'. So the string ends with 't33', so the last token 't25' must not be part of the expansion, unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me check the string again. The string is: t33 t2 ... t33 t25. Wait, so it starts with t33, which is the result of NT61, and ends with t25, but S expands to NT43 NT61, meaning the entire string should consist of NT43's expansion followed by NT61's expansion, which is 't33'. So the string must end with 't33', but the last token is 't25', which doesn't match. That's a problem. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the last part doesn't match NT61 -> 't33'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the string. Let me check: the string given is: \n\nt33 t2 t2 t74 t42 t0 t36 t21 t21 t47 t47 t0 t87 t40 t42 t82 t6 t3 t33 t2 t6 t74 t2 t36 t21 t36 t3 t3 t21 t33 t6 t33 t27 t42 t74 t21 t0 t33 t25.\n\nYes, it ends with t25, which is 't25', but according to the grammar, NT61 is only t33. So that's a mismatch. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar because the last part doesn't fit NT61.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because in the grammar, S is NT43 NT61, which together produce whatever their expansions are. So the whole string must be the concatenation of NT43's expansion and NT61's expansion. So the last token must be the last token of NT61's expansion, which is 't33'. But in the string, the last token is 't25', which is not 't33', so the string is invalid.

Similarly, NT43 has two different productions: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 't40', which would mean it can produce both another pair and a terminal. Similarly, NT3 has two productions: 't82' and 't87', which is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the second line for NT43 is a mistake. It says NT43 \u2192 't40', but perhaps it should not be in the same block. Let me parse the grammar again:\n\nLooking back, the given grammar is: \n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40' [Wait, this seems to replace NT43 directly with 't40', which is missing from the previous productions. Hmm, perhaps it was supposed to be different.]\n\nWait, I think the grammar had multiple entries for NT43 because it's ambiguous. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking again, the grammar is presented in a block of rules, each line starting with the non-terminal and then the production. So, from line 1 to line 22, we have all the productions.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- S: NT43 NT61\n- NT9: NT68 NT16\n- NT59: NT68 NT79\n- NT43: NT83 NT77\n- NT83: NT86 NT79\n- NT28: NT27 NT59\n- NT62: NT45 NT32\n- NT45: NT28 NT3\n- NT56: NT29 NT21\n- NT16: NT27 NT3\n- NT86: NT82 NT76\n- NT82: NT62 NT0\n- NT32: NT56 NT9\n- NT61: 't33'\n- NT3: 't82'\n- NT43: 't40' [Wait, this is another production for NT43: 't40']\n- NT3: 't87' [Another production for NT3? That's conflicting because earlier it was 't82'. That can't be right. There must be a mistake here.]\n\nI think the way the grammar was presented has some overlapping or duplicated rules. Maybe the last few lines have some errors. Let's try to clarify:\n\nNT3: 't82' \u2192 first line\nNT3: 't87' \u2192 next line\nBut that's impossible because a non-terminal can't produce two different terminals. So perhaps this is a mistake, and only one of these is intended.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it's written as:\n\n...\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't42'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. It seems that some non-terminals have multiple direct terminal productions, which would make the grammar ambiguous or even non-LL if it's not possible for all to be correct. But perhaps this is a misunderstanding. Let me try to list each non-terminal and its productions, ensuring each has at most one production that is a terminal.\n\nLet me re-express the grammar correctly, assuming that each non-terminal has productions either to two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\n1. S -> NT43 NT61\n2. NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n3. NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n4. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n5. NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n6. NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n7. NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n8. NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n9. NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n10.

NT3 -> 't87' [Another production for NT3]\n\nHmm, that can't be right because NT43 and NT3 can't have multiple terminal productions. This suggests that perhaps the grammar was incorrectly pasted, and maybe some lines are meant to be under different non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the last few entries were meant to be for different non-terminals but got mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps after line 14, the NT3 and NT43 lines were mistakenly duplicated. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, after NT61: 't33' (line 14), then NT3: 't82' (line15), NT43: 't40' (line16), NT3: 't87' (line17).\n\nThat would mean NT3 has two separate productions, which is conflicting. Same with NT43 having two: 't40' and in the initial block, it was also NT43: NT83 NT77. So now it's producing both NT83 NT77 and 't40'. So that's overlapping for NT43.\n\nThis is a problem because no non-terminal should have two different terminal productions. It seems like this might be a mistake in the grammar provided. It's possible that NT43 was intended to have only one of those, or perhaps the line with NT43: 't40' was meant to be for a different non-terminal. Maybe the formatting got messed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line NT43: 't40' is a separate rule for NT43, but it's unclear why there's that duplication.

{"custom_id":"request-424","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are all the 't' followed by a number and possibly some symbols. The non-terminals are everything else, like S, NT9, etc. The goal is to parse the given string using these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t21 t47 t87 t82 t40 t36 t42 t74 t0 t3 t36 t87 t42 t36 t0 t47 t74 t27 t3 t74 t6 t27 t42 t3 t25 t33 t0 t0 t87 t6 t21 t2 t47 t3 t36 t40 t42 t25 t25 t21`.\n\nI notice that the string is quite long, so I'll need to approach this methodically. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal, where A, B, C are non-terminals. This means each production expands a non-terminal into exactly two other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, each step in the parsing should reduce the string by replacing two symbols with another non-terminal, ultimately leading to the entire string being consumed when only a single non-terminal is left, which then gets replaced by terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this by top-down parsing using something like the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. But since I'm just thinking through this, maybe I'll try to find a way to break down the string into the given rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level symbol in the grammar: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the start is NT43 followed by NT61. Each of these can be derived from other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT43: From the grammar, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. So the first part of the string must derive to NT83 and NT77.\n\nNT83 has two options: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 NT47. So from the string, after NT43, the next part should be either NT86 NT79, which further breaks down, or NT47.\n\nLooking at the string, after the initial S split into NT43 and NT61, the first part starts with t21. So the first symbol is t21. But NT43 can't directly produce a terminal like t21 because NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, which are non-terminals. So for NT43's expansion, we have to see which path leads to terminals.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. Let me think again. Each step in the CNF grammar replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So when building the parse tree, each non-terminal will split into two parts.\n\nSo starting with S, which is NT43 NT61. So the string must start with NT43 followed by NT61. So the string must begin with the terminal symbols derived from NT43 and then from NT61.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t21. Let's see which NT can produce t21.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t25\n- NT21 \u2192 t6\n- NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n- NT42 \u2192 t82\n- NT27 \u2192 NT25 (Wait, looking at the rules: NT27 \u2192 t25 is correct, so NT27 can produce t25. But in the string, after t21, we have t47, t87, etc. Hmm, maybe I confused the order.\n\nWait, let's map out the structure more carefully.\n\nThe string is: t21 t47 t87 t82 t40 t36 t42 t74 t0 t3 t36 t87 t42 t36 t0 t47 t74 t27 t3 t74 t6 t27 t42 t3 t25 t33 t0 t0 t87 t6 t21 t2 t47 t3 t36 t40 t42 t25 t25 t21.\n\nThe first two symbols are t21 and t47. Since S leads to NT43 followed by NT61, which produce t21 and t47? Let me check the rules for NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at NT43: its productions are NT83 NT77 and NT68 NT79.

Looking back at the grammar provided:\n\nHere are the rules:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT68 -> NT21\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nSo, okay, some of these non-terminals directly go to terminals. For example, NT68\u2192 't21', so NT68 can directly produce t21.\n\nNow, looking at NT43: it can go to NT83 NT77 or NT40, but wait, NT43\u2192't40' is correct? Or is it NT43\u2192 NT83 NT77? Wait, no. Looking at the original grammar:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> 't40' ?\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, there's:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nAnd later:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. In CNF, each rule must have two symbols. So I think the user made a typo. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT68 -> NT21\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nWait, so looking at NT43: its rule is NT83 NT77, but then there's another rule for NT43: 't40'. Wait, that's impossible because in CNF, the right-hand side must be two symbols. So either I misread or there's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps it's:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nand also\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nBut that would not conform to CNF, because 't40' is a single terminal. So perhaps the user made a typo and should have another non-terminal, or maybe the 't40' is a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-426","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should help in parsing the string as each step reduces two symbols into one, using the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's given as a sequence of productions. The start symbol is S, and it immediately produces NT43 and NT61. So, the grammar starts with NT43 NT61. The provided string starts with t40 t87 t0..., which suggests that the start symbol S must derive into something that starts with t40 and t87, but I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, actually, each production goes from a non-terminal to two symbols, which can be further broken down. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which are the actual characters, and non-terminals, which need to be replaced by their productions.\n\nLet me list all the productions for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT43 \u2192 NT40\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 NT27 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT42\nNT27 \u2192 t25\nNT61 \u2192 t33\nNT3 \u2192 t82\nNT43 \u2192 t40 (also appears in another production, so maybe redundant)\nNT3 \u2192 t87 (wait, that's conflicting with the previous NT3 \u2192 t82. Hmm, maybe this is a typo or I'm misreading. Let me check the productions again. Oh, I see NT3 \u2192 't82' and NT3 \u2192 't87'. That means NT3 can derive either t82 or t87. So that's an issue because it's ambiguous. Similarly, other non-terminals might have multiple productions, but for each step, it's non-deterministic, choosing which path to take.\n\nI need to trace the given string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t40 t87 t0 t6 t21 t87 t25 t27 t21 t2 t47 t40 t33 t21 t82 t47 t3 t87 t47 t40 t33 t2 t6 t2 t40 t2 t42 t3 t33 t74 t25 t6 t25 t47 t21 t40 t2 t74 t36.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let's see if we can parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string should be built as [NT43] [NT61]. Each of these can be expanded into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT61, the production is NT61 \u2192 t33. So when NT61 is derived, it becomes t33. So one part of the string should be t33 immediately after the S starts. Wait, but the first token is t40. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, the start symbol S is NT43 NT61, which is two non-terminals. So the initial expansion is two symbols: NT43 and NT61. The string is a sequence of these, so the first token would be from NT43 and the next from NT61? Or is it that the entire string starts with NT43 and NT61 derived, but the string is a concatenation of their expansions.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the process. In context-free derivations, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So starting from S, the entire string isn't built step by step as a flat list; instead, it's built by replacing non-terminals with their productions.\n\nBut wait, the given string is a linear sequence of t's and numbers, which suggests that the entire string is the complete derivation, with non-terminals replaced by their respective symbols. So in other words, the leftmost non-terminal is derived first, then the resulting string is built, and so on until the entire string is produced.\n\nBut the Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So starting with S, we have two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61. So the initial step is S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which would result in a string of two symbols: NT43 and NT61.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t40, which suggests that NT43 \u2192 t40 must happen first. Let me check the productions for NT43: NT43 can produce NT83 NT77, or NT40, or if I look again, I see:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT43 \u2192 NT40\n\nSo NT43 can produce NT40 directly, which is a terminal t40. So that's one possibility.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t40, which could be from NT43 \u2192 t40. So, the initial expansion of S is NT43 (which becomes t40) and NT61 (which becomes t33). So the string would start as t40 t33, but in the given string, it's t40 t87..., which doesn't match. That suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the given string isn't a direct derivation but a linear representation of the parsing. Hmm, perhaps the string is built by a pushdown automaton parsing the string, expanding non-terminals as needed. But I think I need to model how the string is derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each terminal in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, and non-terminals need to be replaced. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each of which must be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut then, the issue is that the grammar may derive a string that is a certain arrangement of terminals, so perhaps we can check if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe given string is: t40 t87 t0 t6 t21 t87 t25 t27 t21 t2 t47 t40 t33 t21 t82 t47 t3 t87 t47 t40 t33 t2 t6 t2 t40 t2 t42 t3 t33 t74 t25 t6 t25 t47 t21 t40 t2 t74 t36.\n\nThat's 43 tokens. That's a lot. Let's see.\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string must start with NT43 and NT61, expanded to terminals.\n\nBut in the first token, the string starts with t40, which would come from NT43 \u2192 t40. So that would leave NT61 to be expanded. NT61 \u2192 t33, so the next token should be t33. However, the given string's second token is t87. That doesn't fit. So that suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string isn't a leftmost-derivation, so perhaps the NT43 is expanded later in the process, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is rightmost-derived, but CNF can handle both.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all possible production paths for NT43 and NT61.\n\nLet me consider the NT43:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 or NT40.\n\nAnd NT61 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo the initial expansion is S \u2192 t40 (from NT43 \u2192 t40) and t33 (from NT61 \u2192 t33). So the string should start with t40 t33, but the given string starts with t40 t87. Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps the NT43 doesn't directly produce t40 as the first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT43 is being expanded in a way that involves other non-terminals before it can produce t40.\n\nWait, but the initial expansion from S would require that both NT43 and NT61 are expanded first. Because in CNF, each production is applied by replacing a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So the initial string after S \u2192 NT43 NT61 is [NT43][NT61], which needs further expansion.\n\nSo the leftmost symbol is NT43, so we replace it first.\n\nReplacing NT43 with two symbols: possible options are NT83 NT77 or t40.\n\nIf I choose NT83"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-435","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is in the language defined by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or one terminal. That's helpful because it means that each production can contribute to derivation steps without involving multiple terminals immediately, which simplifies things.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t82 t2 t6 t47 t87 t21 t82 t36 t27 t36 t47 t82 t87 t0 t42 t33 t3 t0 t42 t27 t40 t42 t33 t33 t82 t27 t27 t25 t47 t33 t40 t87 t36 t0 t36 t25 t87 t74 t42 t74 t21`.\n\nLooking at the string, all elements are strings of lowercase letters (I think). I'm assuming each token like 't82' is a terminal symbol because numbers are followed by letters (e.g., t82, t2, etc.). Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, many non-terminals are converted into terminals. For example, NT68 -> 't21', so each production either leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. \n\nSo, the first step is to parse the string and see how it can be generated by the grammar. Let's list the symbols in the string: t82, t2, t6, t47, t87, t21, t82, t36, t27, t36, t47, t82, t87, t0, t42, t33, t3, t0, t42, t27, t40, t42, t33, t33, t82, t27, t27, t25, t47, t33, t40, t87, t36, t0, t36, t25, t87, t74, t42, t74, t21.\n\nI notice that some terminals are longer, like t82, t21, etc. So, each non-terminal production can expand into terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe approach is to work backwards: check if the entire string can be generated by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions. Alternatively, I can use a method like recursive descent parsing or handle it by checking possible derivations.\n\nGiven the string's length, it's manageable, but I need to be systematic.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol: S. Its production is S -> NT43 NT61. So, the first step in any derivation is S expanding into NT43 and NT61. That means the string should start with NT43 and then NT61. Let's split the string into two parts.\n\nThe string is \"t82 t2 t6 t47 t87 t21 t82 t36 t27 t36 t47 t82 t87 t0 t42 t33 t3 t0 t42 t27 t40 t42 t33 t33 t82 t27 t27 t25 t47 t33 t40 t87 t36 t0 t36 t25 t87 t74 t42 t74 t21\".\n\nIf S expands into NT43 and NT61, then the string should be NT43 followed by NT61. So, the first part is NT43, which is from the start of the string, and the second part is NT61 from the end.\n\nLet's split the string accordingly. The first part is up to NT61. Let me see, the end of the string is ... t74 t42 t74 t21. So, the last part should be NT61, which in the grammar is NT61 -> 't33'.\n\nSo, the last terminal is 't33'. Let me look at the end of the string:\n\n... t42 t74 t42 t74 t21\n\nWait, no, the last element is 't21', which is the production for NT61: NT61 -> 't33'. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list the entire string as a list of terminals:\n\nTerminals: t82, t2, t6, t47, t87, t21, t82, t36, t27, t36, t47, t82, t87, t0, t42, t33, t3, t0, t42, t27, t40, t42, t33, t33, t82, t27, t27, t25, t47, t33, t40, t87, t36, t0, t36, t25, t87, t74, t42, t74, t21.\n\nWait, no, the string as given is a single string with spaces, so the entire list is the 43 terms I listed above. So, the first part should be NT43, and the second part NT61.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT43 has two productions: -> NT83 NT77 and -> NT43 -> 't40'. Oh wait, no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, let me reread the grammar properly:\n\nThe grammar is:\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47' (wait, is this a separate production?

{"custom_id":"request-429","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by recalling what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to fit that structure because all the non-terminals on the left side produce two non-terminals on the right, except for some that directly produce terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t21 t36 t87 t74 t25 t82 t21 t33 t27 t3 t0 t36 t21 t0 t36 t47 t87 t2 t74 t42 t74 t36 t6 t74 t27 t27 t3 t33 t42 t36 t33 t36 t2 t40 t21 t2 t33 t25 t33 t87 t21`.\n\nFirst, I notice that this string consists of a series of terminal symbols, specifically various 't' followed by numbers. The non-terminals in the grammar are things like S, NT9, NT59, etc., so I need to see how these can be expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't82', NT43 \u2192 't40', etc. So each production either eventually leads to a terminal or continues to produce non-terminals. The string must be a result of fully expanding all non-terminals into terminals, with the correct sequence.\n\nTo approach this, I think I need to parse the string using the grammar, which probably means applying the productions in reverse, trying to match the string to the right-hand sides of the productions. Alternatively, I might need to see if the string can be derived by starting from S and applying the productions step by step, though that might be more complicated.\n\nGiven the length of the string, that's 39 symbols long, manually expanding it step by step seems impractical. Instead, maybe I can try a top-down approach to see if the string can be generated starting from S, or perhaps a bottom-up approach, starting from the terminals and trying to build up to the start symbol S.\n\nGiven the grammar's structure, I can note the possible expansions for each non-terminal. Also, since we're dealing with a context-free grammar, we can use techniques like the CYK algorithm for parsing, but since that's beyond my current capacity, I'll try to look for patterns in the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the entire string must start with the expansion of NT43 followed by NT61. Let's check the string's beginning:\n\nThe string starts with t21, t36, t87, t74, t25, t82, t21, t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo the last part of the string ends with several t33's, but the penultimate part is t82, which is NT82 \u2192 't0' (I think I mistakenly read NT82 as t82 \u2192 t0, but looking back, yes, NT82's production is \u2192 t0. Wait, looking back, the productions include NT82 \u2192 t0.\n\nWait, let me verify the grammar:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo in the string, the last part has t36, t21, t0, t36, t33, etc. So towards the end, t36 t21 t0 appear. Wait, but looking at the initial part of the string, it starts with t21 followed by t36, t87, etc.\n\nWait, I might have confused the start of the string. Let me write the string again:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt21 t36 t87 t74 t25 t82 \u2192 the first six elements.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nBut before that, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each non-terminal expansion produces a certain number of symbols, and the entire string's length must be compatible with how the non-terminals are expanded.\n\nGiven that each production rule (except those that directly produce terminals) produces two non-terminals, starting from S which splits into two non-terminals, each of those splits into two, and so on. The total number of terminals produced is 2^(n) for a derivation of depth n, but that's not quite right because each production either leads to terminals or continues splitting.\n\nWait no, actually, each non-terminal production could produce either two non-terminals (which would each expand further) or directly a terminal. So the number of terminals can vary. For example, a production that directly yields a terminal would stop a chain, whereas others would extend the depth.\n\nSo perhaps the string's length can give an indication of how many steps were taken in the derivation.\n\nThe string has 39 tokens. Let me see: 39 is an odd number, which is fine because each step of the grammar can produce an even number of tokens if both sides are non-terminals. But that might not hold in all cases because some productions produce terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible expansions.\n\nLet me attempt a top-down approach:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands into NT43 and NT61. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at the string, let's check the first part after S:\n\nFirst, NT43 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT43 has the production:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nThen NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n\nAnd so on. Alternatively, I need to see if the initial part of the string fits into the expansion of NT43 followed by NT61.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split the string into two parts near the middle and check each part against NT43 and NT61.\n\nWait, NT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo the last part of the string must end with several t33's. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string: ... t21 t0 t36 t21 t33 ... Hmm, but there's more.\n\nWait, let me look at the entire string:\n\nt21 t36 t87 t74 t25 t82 t21 t33 t27 t3 t0 t36 t21 t0 t36 t47 t87 t2 t74 t42 t74 t36 t6 t74 t27 t27 t3 t33 t42 t36 t33 t36 t2 t40 t21 t2 t33 t25 t33 t87 t21\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the elements:\n\n1: t21\n2: t36\n3: t87\n4: t74\n5: t25\n6: t82\n7: t21\n8: t33\n9: t27\n10: t3\n11: t0\n12: t36\n13: t21\n14: t0\n15: t36\n16: t47\n17: t87\n18: t2\n19: t74\n20: t42\n21: t74\n22: t36\n23: t6\n24: t74\n25: t27\n26: t27\n27: t3\n28: t33\n29: t42\n30: t36\n31: t33\n32: t36\n33: t2\n34: t40\n35: t21\n36: t2\n37: t33\n38: t25\n39: t33\n40: t87\n41: t21\n\nWait, that's 41 symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is: \n\n`t47 t40 t47 t82 t3 t33 t74 t33 t6 t82 t27 t21 t82 t40 t82 t82 t82 t82 t2 t36 t21 t25 t6 t25 t6 t21 t21 t21 t36 t0 t36 t6 t2 t42 t42 t21 t33 t74 t2 t3 t40 t42`.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a grammar in CNF looks like. CNF is characterized by production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Only the start symbol can derive into terminals without any non-terminals in between.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that all the productions (S -> NT43 NT61, NT9 -> NT68 NT16, etc.) except for some are in CNF. Wait, actually, I see that some rules like NT3 -> 't82' and others have terminals as their RHS. So the grammar seems to be mixed\u2014some rules are in CNF, and others are direct terminal productions, which is acceptable in CNF because the start symbol can be derived to terminals, but other non-terminals must continue to produce symbols until all are terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals (like t47, t40, etc.), so the question is whether this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the start symbol S -> NT43 NT61. So the start string must begin with whatever NT43 produces and then whatever NT61 produces.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT61: it directly goes to 't33'. So the second part is fixed as 't33'.\n\nNow, looking at NT43, it has two productions: one leads to 't40', and the other leads to NT83 NT77. So NT43 can be either a terminal or a combination of NT83 and NT77.\n\nIf NT43 is 't40', then the string starts with t40 t33. But let's see if our string starts with t47, which suggests that NT43 might not be 't40' but rather the other option, which is NT83 NT77. So let's follow that path.\n\nNT83 has two productions: one to 't86 NT79' and another to 't47'. If it's 't47', then we can take that. So the string starts with t47 t33 so far, which matches the beginning.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t47, so NT43 is using the 't47' production, which requires NT83 -> 't47'. Is NT83 allowed to directly produce 't47'? Looking back, the productions for NT83 are:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nWait, hold on. In the grammar, I think there was a rule NT83 -> 't47', but I'm checking: yes, line 12 says NT83 -> NT86 NT79, line 47 says NT83 -> 't47'. So yes, NT83 can produce either NT86 and NT79 or 't47'.\n\nSo in the first step, NT43 could go to 't47' if NT83 -> 't47'. That matches the string's first symbol, t47, followed by 't33' from NT61. So that part works.\n\nNow, after 't47 t33', the string continues with t47. So let's look deeper into the grammar for what comes next.\n\nLooking at NT83 -> 't47' in this position. Wait, but in the production NT83, if we choose 't47', that gives a terminal immediately. If we choose NT86 NT79, we have to see how NT86 and NT79 produce further symbols.\n\nBut since in the string, it's another t47, perhaps the grammar allows NT83 to be 't47' every time. Wait, no, because NT83 can produce 't47' directly, but can it also produce longer chains?\n\nWait, no. NT83 has two options: either go to 't47' directly or go to NT86 and NT79, which themselves can produce something. So, for each NT83, it can generate either 't47' or a chain that starts with NT86 and NT79.\n\nIn the string, the first occurrence is t47, then t33, then again t47. So after the initial NT43 -> 't47', we have t47, then 't33', then another t47, then 't33'.\n\nWait, but in the string, it goes t47 t40 t47 t82..., which conflicts a bit with my earlier thought. Let me check the string again:\n\nThe string starts with t47, followed by t40, then another t47, t82, etc. So the initial part is t47 t40, but according to my earlier analysis, after NT43, I thought it would be t47, then 't33' from NT61, making it t47 t33. But the string starts with t47 t40. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps NT43 is not taking the 't47' production but the other, which is NT83 NT77.\n\nWait, so I need to correct that. Let's re-examine this.\n\nS produces NT43 NT61.\n\nNT61 -> 't33' is fixed. So the string must start with what NT43 produces. If NT43 is 't40', then it's t40 t33, but the string starts with t47, so that's not it. Therefore, NT43 must have gone to NT83 NT77.\n\nSo, NT43 -> NT83 NT77. Then, NT83 can produce either 't47' or NT86 NT79.\n\nLooking at the string, the next symbol after t47 (from NT43) is t40 (from NT61), but wait\u2014that doesn't align because NT43 is followed by NT61 which is t33, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, S -> NT43 NT61, so the full string is the concatenation of what NT43 produces and what NT61 produces. So if NT43 is, for example, NT83 NT77, then NT83's production is either 't47' or NT86 NT79, and NT77 is produced. So, the string starts with 't47' or whatever NT86 and NT77 produce.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet's list the start: S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 X Y, where X is what NT43 can produce, and Y is what NT61 can produce. NT61 directly \u2192 't33', so Y = 't33'.\n\nSo X must produce the first part of the string before 't33'. The string as given is 't47 t40 t47 t82 t3 t33 t74 t33 t6 t82 t27 t21 t82 t40 t82 t82 t82 t82 t2 t36 t21 t25 t6 t25 t6 t21 t21 t21 t36 t0 t36 t6 t2 t42 t42 t21 t33 t74 t2 t3 t40 t42'.\n\nSo after the initial X and Y, which would be X t33, the entire string is X followed by t33, but actually, the string is X Y where Y is t33. Wait no: S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the entire string is X (from NT43) followed by Y (from NT61). But wait, Y is 't33', so the last part of the string should be 't33', but looking at the string, it ends with 't33 t74 ...' Wait, no\u2014the string is: the entire string is written as a sequence of tokens. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break down the string into tokens and see how they might fit.\n\nThe string is: t47 t40 t47 t82 t3 t33 t74 t33 t6 t82 t27 t21 t82 t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the first step is that S must expand into NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t6 t25 t3 ...`. So the initial part is 't6', which is the terminal of NT21. So let's see: NT61 -> 't33', which starts the string as 't33', but our input starts with 't6', so that's not matching NT61. Alternatively, perhaps it's using NT82, because NT82 can be NT62 NT0, which could lead to 't25' because NT62 is NT45 NT32, and NT45 is NT28 NT3, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t6`. Let's look at the non-terminals that produce 't6'. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT21 -> 't6' (production 82: NT21 -> 't6')\nSo, in the string, the first part must be NT21 producing 't6'.\n\nNow, how does NT61 and NT43 resolve to NT21?\n\nNT61-> 't33', which is not 't6', so the start S is NT43 NT61, and that must produce 't6' somehow. So perhaps NT43 and NT61 have to combine to produce 't6' when expanded.\n\nWait, no. Because S is NT43 NT61, which is two separate units. Each needs to resolve into something that can form the string. Since the string starts with 't6', which is from NT21, perhaps either NT43 and NT61, when expanded, must produce a 't6' somewhere in their derivations. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT43:\n\nNT43 can go to NT83 NT77 or NT28 NT3.\n\nNT83 can go to NT86 NT79 or NT83 NT47 (Wait, but in the given grammar, NT83 has two productions: NT83 -> NT86 NT79 and NT83 -> NT47. Wait, checking:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT83 -> NT47\n\nSo that's two options. Similarly, NT28 -> NT27 NT59, and NT27 -> 't25'.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, S is NT43 NT61. So the NT43 will expand, and then the NT61.\n\nWait, no, because in a context-free grammar, the left-hand side is rewritten, so S -> NT43 NT61; that's a single rule. Each step is a single production on one non-terminal. So to resolve S, you replace it with NT43 NT61, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nSo, the first step is S => NT43 NT61.\n\nNow, we can expand NT43 and NT61 independently.\n\nLooking at NT61: it can be replaced by 't33', which is a terminal. So NT61 -> 't33'. So that gives us the first symbol as 't33', but our input starts with 't6', so perhaps NT43 is producing something that includes 't6'.\n\nBut looking at NT43's productions:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77 or NT28 NT3.\n\nLet me track both possibilities.\n\nFirst option: NT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nThen, NT83 can be NT86 NT79 or NT47.\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0.\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3.\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59.\n\nNT27 -> 't25'.\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79.\n\nNT68 -> 't21'.\n\nNT79 -> 't36'.\n\nSo, breaking that down:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0.\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3.\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59.\n\nNT27 -> 't25'.\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79.\n\nNT68 -> 't21'.\n\nNT79 -> 't36'.\n\nSo putting that into symbols: 't25' (from NT27) and 't21' (from NT68) and 't36' (from NT79), but wait, NT86 is NT82 NT76, which would be 't25', 't74' from NT76?\n\nWait, let's correct that. Let's step through each non-terminal.\n\nStarting with NT83 -> NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 is replaced by NT62 NT0: 't25' (since NT0 is 't42', but wait wait, NT0 -> 't42'? Wait, in the grammar, NT0 is 't42'. But in the productions, NT0's expansion is 't42', not another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's confirm: looking back, the productions include NT0 -> 't42'.\n\nSo when we expand NT62: NT62 -> NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3.\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59.\n\nNT27 -> 't25'.\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79.\n\nNT68 -> 't21'.\n\nNT79 -> 't36'.\n\nPutting that all together:\n\nSo the NT43 path is: NT83 -> NT86 NT79 -> NT86 is NT82 NT76. NT82 is NT62 NT0. NT62 is NT45 NT32. NT45 is NT28 NT3. NT28 is NT27 NT59. NT27 is 't25'. NT59 is NT68 NT79.

{"custom_id":"request-453","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a series of tokens. My task is to figure out whether the grammar can produce that exact string. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a CFG in CNF looks like. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and 'a' is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the derivation starts with S. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for the terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, let me see if it follows CNF. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Then NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16, and so on. I notice that some of the productions have more than two non-terminals? Wait, no, wait, in the given grammar, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, etc. So it seems like all the non-terminal productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for some rules like NT27 \u2192 t25 or NT3 \u2192 t82, which are terminal productions. So that seems correct for CNF.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to test whether the string is generated by this grammar. Given the string:\n\nt0 t40 t0 t27 t33 t82 t74 t74 t74 t87 t2 t40 t0 t3 t36 t82 t36 t3 t82 t3 t47 t6 t33 t33 t2 t27 t74 t33 t82 t40 t42 t27 t33 t33 t87 t33 t36 t27 t87 t87 t40 t27 t0\n\nLooking at this string, it's a sequence of tokens, each of which is either a number (terminal) or a letter (non-terminal). Wait, but in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, meaning each token must correspond to a terminal production in the grammar, and we need to see if they can be derived from S through a series of steps.\n\nSo the approach I take is to model the string as a sequence of terminals that must be generated by the grammar. To do this, I think of the problem as a parsing problem: can the given string be derived from S by applying productions until all symbols are terminals?\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal. However, splitting into two non-terminals would require them to be further split until all are terminals. \n\nGiven that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals (around 40 something), and each non-terminal has only one production (except for those with multiple productions?), wait no, looking at the grammar, I see some non-terminals have multiple production rules. For example, NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or NT83 \u2192 t47. Similarly, NT79 \u2192 NT68 NT71? Wait no, let me check: looking through the rules, I see NT83 has two productions: \u2192 NT86 NT79 and \u2192 t47. So NT83 can be replaced by either of these. Similarly, NT76 has \u2192 t74.\n\nEach time a non-terminal appears, its production is chosen based on available options. So, our task is to check if the given string can be generated by a leftmost (or any) derivation from S.\n\nThis seems a bit complex, but perhaps we can model the problem as a tree, where each node is a non-terminal, and its children are the two non-terminals from the production rule until we reach leaves that are terminals. The given string must be the sequence of terminals when we traverse the tree in a specific order, perhaps left to right.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a flat sequence, perhaps the order is leftmost or rightmost, but considering that it's a CFG, the order depends on the derivation. \n\nAnother approach could be to simulate the derivation. Starting from S, we can replace S according to its production, which is NT43 NT61. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Then, we have to replace NT43 and NT61. Let's see: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT61 doesn't have a production except in NT61 \u2192 't33'. Wait no, wait: looking back, the grammar rules include NT61 \u2192 't33'.\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT61 is a non-terminal. If there's a rule NT61 \u2192 't33', then that's a terminal production. So, starting from S, we have S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Now, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and NT61 \u2192 't33'. So the first string after replacement would be NT83 NT77 't33'. \n\nBut then, the next step is to replace NT83. Since NT83 has two production rules: either expand into NT86 NT79 or produce 't47'. So let's say we choose one of those. Let's choose NT83 \u2192 t47, then the string so far is t47 NT77 't33'.\n\nBut wait, this approach is getting complicated because each step could lead to multiple possibilities. Since the string is quite long, doing this manually would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nPerhaps, given the structure, the grammar can be analyzed for each element in the string. Each terminal in the string must be produced by some non-terminal. So, for each terminal in the string, we can trace back through the production rules to see if it can be derived.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string in order:\n\n1. t0\n2. t40\n3. t0\n4. t27\n5. t33\n6. t82\n7. t74\n8. t74\n9. t74\n10. t87\n11. t2\n12. t40\n13. t0\n14. t3\n15. t36\n16. t82\n17. t36\n18. t3\n19. t82\n20. t3\n21. t47\n22. t6\n23. t33\n24. t33\n25. t2\n26. t27\n27. t74\n28. t33\n29. t82\n30. t40\n31. t42\n32. t27\n33. t33\n34. t33\n35. t87\n36. t33\n37. t36\n38. t27\n39. t87\n40. t87\n41. t40\n42. t27\n43. t0\n\nEach of these must be generated by the grammar. Let's check each of them:\n\n- t0 is present. Looking at the grammar, NT61 \u2192 t33, NT62 \u2192 t42, NT27 \u2192 t25, etc. Wait, but looking through all the non-terminals, I can identify which non-terminals produce t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT82 \u2192 t0\nNT32 \u2192 t56...\nWait, let me find all the non-terminals that produce t0.\n\nLooking for rules ending with t0:\n\nLooking at NT82 \u2192 t0 (from NT82 \u2192 t0)\nAlso, looking for other rules that result in t0.\n\nLooking, seems only NT82 produces t0. So, t0 must come from the expansion of NT82.\n\nSimilarly, t40 is another terminal. Looking for NT's that produce t40:\n\nNT43 \u2192 t40 (rule NT43 \u2192 't40')\n\nt2 comes from NT87? Wait, let's check. The grammar has NT87 \u2192 't2'? Let me look. Yes, 'NT87 -> 't2''.\n\nt33 is produced by several NTs. For example, NT68 \u2192 t21 (but wait, that's not t33). Wait, from the given rules:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 t47\n- NT82 \u2192 t0\n- NT33 is perhaps a root? Wait, need to check which NTs produce t33.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't82' but also, wait:\n\nWait, the given rules include:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- Also, maybe other rules that have NT3 on the left.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except for the start symbol which can go directly to terminals. Wait, looking at the rules, actually, some of them go directly to terminals. For example, `S -> NT43 NT61`, and other NTs eventually produce terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions until only terminals remain, forming the given string. Since the string is quite long, I'll need a systematic approach.\n\nStarting with the string, I can look for possible leftmost derivations. Each production in the grammar breaks down NTs into other NTs or terminates with a 't' and a number. So each 't' in the string must come from a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: `t21 t42 t87 t3`. Each of these must be a terminal production. Let's check the grammar:\n\n- `t21` is produced by NT21 -> 't25'. So t21 can come from NT21 as 't25'? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT21 -> 't6'. But the string has t21, so t21 must be produced directly. But in the grammar, I don't see an NT production directly leading to t21. Wait, the initial grammar only goes up to 't82' for the NTs, but in the string, the earliest terminal is t21. Let me check the available NT productions.\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nFor example, NT68 -> 't21'\n\nSo NT68 directly produces 't21'. Okay, so t21 could come from NT68.\n\nBut in the string, we have t21 followed by t42. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial string is a sequence of terminals. Let's see if each terminal corresponds to a production from some NT.\n\nLooking for the leftmost symbol in the string: t21.\n\nIn the grammar, which NTs produce t21? Looking:\n\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n\nSo, t21 would be part of the body of NT68. So, in the derivation, somewhere, NT68 must appear to produce t21.\n\nSimilarly, the next symbol is t42.\n\nWhich NT produces t42? Looking through the productions, the grammar has:\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nAnd NT74 -> 't74'? No, that's a terminal. Wait, some Nts produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see some Nt productions:\n\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT3 -> 't87' (Wait, that's possibly an error; earlier it was NT3, maybe that's a different production or a typo. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT3 -> 't82' and NT3 -> 't87'. Hmm, that doesn't make sense in standard CNF because each production would have exactly one production. Wait, maybe the user mistakenly duplicated some rules or there's a mistake. Let me count the NTs and their productions.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, maybe some Nts were written twice by accident. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, for example, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't87'\n\nThat's not correct because each non-terminal can have only one production in Chomsky Normal Form. So maybe this is a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is a different case.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo, and the second NT3 is intended to be a different NT. Alternatively, it's possible that the user intended to have both, but that's violating the CNF structure. Since I'm the one evaluating, I need to proceed carefully.\n\nBut perhaps this is an error, and I need to figure out. Alternatively, maybe the second NT3 is a mistake, and it's supposed to be something else. For now, I'll note this as a potential problem and proceed.\n\nBut let's return to the string. The string starts with t21, which requires an NT68 as I noted. Then the next symbol is t42.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t42:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n\nSo either NT29 or NT77 can produce 't42'.\n\nSo, after NT68 -> t21, the next symbol is t42, so perhaps NT68 has a next production that links to another NT.\n\nWait, no. Because in the string, the next symbol after t21 is t42. So perhaps the production for NT68 includes t42 as a symbol. Looking at the grammar, NT68 isn't in the left part of any production. The productions that end with t21 are only NT68 -> t21.\n\nSo, that means that the string t21 t42 cannot come from a single NT68, because NT68 only directly produces t21. So how would the production for NT68 end up producing t42 after t21?\n\nWait, no. Maybe the t42 comes from a different NT in the same higher-level NT. For example, perhaps NT68 is part of a longer production that includes t21 and another NT that produces t42.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, perhaps NT68 can be part of a larger chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this using the leftmost derivation method.\n\nThe string is s = [t21, t42, t87, t3, t21, t2, t74, t36, t47, t25, t2, t87, t87, t21, t36, t42, t87, t21, t25, t21, t40, t40, t2, t36, t3, t2, t27, t25, t3, t36, t27, t87, t87, t25, t33, t82, t0, t74, t2, t36, t82, t87, t27, t25]\n\nLet's start with s.\n\nIn leftmost derivation, the first step is to replace the first symbol (t21) by what it could be. Looking at the grammar, the only way to produce t21 is NT68 -> t21. So, the current string starts with NT68 -> t21.\n\nSo, after leftmost substitution, the string becomes [NT68, t42, t87, t3, ...]\n\nNow, next, perhaps NT68 is part of a larger production. But looking at the grammar, I don't see NT68 on the left of any production except NT68 -> t21. So perhaps in this case, NT68 is part of a bigger production? Wait, no, because NT68 only produces t21 directly. So to generate more symbols after NT68, perhaps the start is part of a different production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's reconsider.\n\nWait, S is the start symbol. The entire string must be generated from S through leftmost expansions.\n\nSo, let me see: the first step in any derivation is that S is replaced by one of its productions. Looking at the grammar, S -> NT43 NT61.\n\nWait, so the first production is S -> NT43 NT61. So in the initial step, S becomes NT43 NT61.\n\nNow, that gives us the string [NT43, NT61]. But since the given string starts with t21, which is a terminal, that can't be the case. Because in S's production, the next step would be to replace NT43 and NT61, which are non-terminals, and each Nt would need to generate another terminal or another Nt.\n\nWait a minute, the start symbol S produces NT43 NT61. So when we perform leftmost substitution, the first Nt is NT43.

First, I need to see if each token in the string is either a terminal or can be derived from a non-terminal using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by writing down the grammar and seeing which symbols are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nNon-terminals (NT) are: S, NT43, NT9, NT59, NT43, NT83, NT86, NT28, NT62, NT45, NT28, NT3, NT56, NT16, NT86, NT82, NT32, NT61, NT3, NT29, NT77, NT27, NT68, NT0, NT56, NT16, NT59, NT83, NT83, NT82, NT76, NT21, NT79, NT27.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Actually, the non-terminals are the ones on the left side of the arrows. Let me list all unique non-terminals:\n\nS, NT43, NT9, NT59, NT83, NT86, NT28, NT62, NT45, NT3, NT56, NT16, NT27, NT77, NT68, NT0, NT82, NT32, NT61, NT79.\n\nTerminal symbols are the ones on the right side when they are single characters: t33, t40, t3, t82, t25, t0, t6, t21, t2, t42, t74, t27.\n\nI notice that NT83 has two productions: NT83 -> NT86 NT79 and NT83 -> t27. So NT83 can be a non-terminal that can expand into either another non-terminal pair or a terminal.\n\nThis is important because, for instance, in the string, there's a \"t33\" which directly matches NT61's production.\n\nSimilarly, \"t40\" is directly produced by NT43.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string step by step, symbol by symbol, using the grammar. I'll try to apply the productions to see if I can derive the string.\n\nThe string starts with t36. Let me check the grammar for a production ending with t36. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT79 -> t36\n- NT82 -> t0 (which is a terminal), but there's also NT82 -> t82? Wait, looking again: NT82 has production NT82 -> t0 and NT82 -> t82. Hmm, in the production list, I see NT82 -> t0 and NT82 -> t82 (from earlier lines?

Since I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that's a standard form, and I might be able to apply some parsing strategies.

I need to see if this string can be derived by expanding the starting symbol S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S breaks down into NT43 and NT61. Let's see what each of these produces.\n\nNT43 has two options: NT83 NT77 or NT45 NT3. Wait, hold on. Looking back, I see two rules for NT43:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT45 NT3\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, it's listed under NT43, and then again later as NT43 -> 't40'. Hmm, that might mean that sometimes NT43 is a terminal. But that seems conflicting. Maybe each production is a separate rule, so perhaps NT43 has two different rules. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nOh wait, I see that NT43 is rewritten twice. That might mean that either one of those is applicable, or perhaps one of them is a terminal. Looking at the rules, there's NT43 -> 't40', but it's appearing under NT43? Wait, maybe each line is a separate production. So NT43 can become NT83 NT77 or NT45 NT3 or maybe even directly 't40'? Wait, no, because in the first line, it says S \u2192 NT43 NT61, then there are several NT9, NT59, etc., and then later under NT43, it's 't40'. So actually, the NT43 can be either NT83 NT77, or NT45 NT3, or 't40'? Or is that another production?\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is written in a way that each line after S is a separate production. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61 is one production. Then NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16 is another. Then, under NT43, it's 't40', meaning that NT43 can also be rewritten to 't40'. So that adds a rule NT43 \u2192 't40'.\n\nBut wait, that would mean NT43 has three rules:\n\n1. NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n2. NT43 \u2192 NT45 NT3\n3. NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nSimilarly, I see a few NTs that can end with terminals like 't...'. So, for example, NT68 \u2192 't21', NT3 \u2192 't82', etc.\n\nSo, with that in mind, S can generate as NT43 NT61, each of which can either generate more non-terminals or a terminal, all the way down to letters like t and numbers, which are leaves.\n\nOur string to check is a sequence of these terminals, but let's see. The string is a list of t and numbers, separated by spaces. Each element is a token, which must correspond to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but how does the grammar produce these tokens? Each step in the parsing replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT43 NT61) or eventually with terminals (like NT43 \u2192 't40').\n\nSo the process is top-down, starting from S, breaking down each non-terminal into its components.\n\nBut the string given is the concatenation of the terminals generated at each step. The order must match the leftmost derivation.\n\nSo, to see if the string is in the language, we need to find a leftmost derivation that produces this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the string, checking if the tree can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut this might be complicated, so perhaps another approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. But since I might not remember all the details, maybe I can think through the string.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a long sequence of 't's and numbers. Let's list them:\n\nt74, t47, t42, t47, t25, t25, t82, t25, t0, t25, t2, t6, t74, t36, t33, t87, t40, t82, t33, t33, t74, t0, t6, t0, t47, t36, t87, t6, t33, t3, t36, t3, t21, t0, t25, t25, t82, t6, t82, t36, t82, t27, t36, t74, t3.\n\nWait, that's a lot. It might be helpful to see where the start can break down.\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nSo, the string should start with the expansion of NT43 followed by NT61.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t74, t47, t42.\n\nHmm. Let me think: NT43 can expand into multiple options.\n\nFirst option for NT43 is NT83 NT77.\n\nThen NT83 can expand into either NT86 NT79 or, as per the rules, maybe NT83 can also go directly to terminal t's, but actually, looking at the rules, NT83 is \u2192 NT86 NT79, so it can't be a terminal yet. So starting with NT83, which gives NT86 NT79. Then NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76, and NT79 \u2192 NT74, etc.\n\nWait, but that's getting into too much depth; maybe a better approach is to see what the start symbol S produces and match the string accordingly.\n\nLet me think about how the string begins: t74... So does any non-terminal produce 't74'?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT27 \u2192 t25, NT21 \u2192 t6, NT29 \u2192 t42, NT32 \u2192 t56, etc. Wait, in the rules I see NT27 \u2192 t25, NT68 \u2192 t21, NT3 \u2192 t82, NT45 \u2192 t40, NT9 \u2192 t87? Wait, no, I think the grammar may list for each NT the production, sometimes including a terminal.\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n\nThen later, under NT3, it's 't82' twice.

Wait, the lines are the productions for various NTs. So for NT43, there's two rules: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT43 \u2192 NT45 NT3. Then, under NT83, it's another rule? Wait, no, the initial list only shows S, then NT9, NT59, NT43, etc. And in some of the rules, after NT..., it's written as 't...'.

{"custom_id":"request-477","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and it looks pretty complex with a bunch of terminals and non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of t-strings separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It starts with S -> NT43 NT61, which means the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, NT43 and NT61. I need to see how these non-terminals can break down further.\n\nLooking at NT61, I see that it directly corresponds to the terminal 't33'. So that's straightforward. Next, NT43 can be broken down into NT83 and NT77. From the grammar, NT83 can split into NT86 and NT79, which in turn can split into more non-terminals until some of them correspond to terminals. Similarly, NT77 is NT28 and NT3, and NT28 is NT27 and NT59, and so on. I can see that a lot of these non-terminals are interdependent, so I'll need a systematic approach.\n\nThe string given is a long sequence starting with t82 and ending with t42. Since the grammar starts with NT43 and NT61, I'll trace the possible paths to see if the string can be generated by expanding these.\n\nI'll start by checking the first few characters. The first token is t82. Looking at the grammar, t82 is generated by NT82. So, I need to find a production rule that leads to NT82. From the grammar, NT82 can be split into NT62 and NT0, or it can split into NT62 and NT76. Let's take NT62 and NT0. NT62 is NT45 and NT32, and NT0 is 't42'. NT45 is NT28 and NT3, while NT3 is 't87'. NT28 is NT27 and NT59, and so on.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t82 t21 ... Let me check how to reach t21. In the grammar, t21 is generated by NT79 (since NT79 -> t74 and something else, no, wait, no, looking again, I think I might have made a mistake). Let me double-check the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 -> t25, NT68 -> t21. Hmm, maybe I should make a tree. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a parsing approach, trying to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a stack-based approach like the CYK algorithm to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. But since the string is quite long, that might be tedious. Maybe I can spot any red flags or see if the string requires a production that's not present.\n\nWait, looking at the tokens, I notice that the string includes t82, t21, t82 again, then t25, t3, etc. I know that t21 comes from NT68, which is S->NT43 NT61, so NT68 is part of S's expansion. Wait, no, wait: S is NT43 NT61. So S splits into NT43 and NT61. NT61 is 't33', so that's straightforward. NT43 is NT83 NT77, which I mentioned earlier.\n\nLooking at the string, after t82 comes t21. So, where does t21 come from? Checking the grammar, NT68 -> t21. So for t21 to appear, there must be a production where NT68 produces 't21'. So in the derivation, at some point, we must have an NT68 that becomes 't21'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see a production rule that goes directly to NT68 -> 't21' immediately. Let me see: The production for NT68 is not present in the given rules. Wait, no, NT68 is actually generated by another non-terminal. Looking back, the grammar has productions like NT24 -> something, but wait, NT68 is one of the starting symbols? Or perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, the grammar provided starts with S and then other NT rules. Let's list all the productions again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe productions are:\n\n- S->NT43 NT61\n- NT9->NT68 NT16\n- NT59->NT68 NT79\n- NT43->NT83 NT77\n- NT83->NT86 NT79\n- NT28->NT27 NT59\n- NT62->NT45 NT32\n- NT45->NT28 NT3\n- NT56->NT29 NT21\n- NT16->NT27 NT3\n- NT86->NT82 NT76\n- NT82->NT62 NT0\n- NT32->NT56 NT9\n- NT61-> 't33'\n- NT3->'t82'\n- NT43->'t40'\n- NT3->'t87'\n- NT29->'t42'\n- NT77->'t42'\n- NT27->'t25'\n- NT68->'t21'\n- NT0->'t42'\n- NT56->'t27'\n- NT16->'t3'\n- NT59->'t2'\n- NT83->'t47'\n- NT82->'t0'\n- NT76->'t74'\n- NT21->'t6'\n- NT79->'t36'\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking at the rules, I see that NT68 -> 't21' is a production. Because in the list above, there's NT68->'t21'. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, t21 comes from NT68, which is a terminal. Now, going back to the string: the third token is t82 again, followed by t25, which is from NT27.\n\nSo let's see: Let's try to write a possible derivation path.\n\nStarting with S: NT43 NT61.\n\nNT43 expands to NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 expands to NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 expands to NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 expands to NT62 NT0.\n\nNT62 expands to NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 expands to NT28 NT3.\n\nNT28 expands to NT27 NT59.\n\nNT27 expands to 't25'.\n\nNT59 expands to NT68 NT79.\n\nNT68 expands to 't21'.\n\nNT79 expands to 't36'.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo this would give the string up to this point: 't25 t21 t36'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's 't82 t21 t82 t25 t3 t3 t27 t74 t3 t0 t36 t40 t47 t87 t3 t74 t27 t3 t0 t6 t42 t21 t21 t25 t3 t36 t0 t87 t0 t40 t33 ...'\n\nHmm, that's complex. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, in the derivation above, we had NT0 -> 't42', so that's the 't42' in the string. Similarly, NT3 -> 't82' and 't87'.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check the parse step by step. Let's try to match the given string against the grammar.\n\nGiven the string: t82 t21 t82 t25 t3 t3 t27 t74 t3 t0 t36 t40 t47 t87 t3 t74 t27 t3 t0 t6 t42 t21 t21 t25 t3 t36 t0 t87 t0 t40 t33 t2 t3 t36 t21 t21 t25 t3 t36 t0 t87 t0 t40 t33.\n\nLooking at the beginning: t82 t21.

That should make it a bit easier because the parse trees would be straight with no more complex structures.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, which is S. The productions starting with S are S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, S can only produce NT43 and NT61 as two separate symbols. The string begins with 't2', so I need to see how 't2' is derived.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT43 has rules like NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and NT43 also directly goes to 't40'. Hmm, 't40' isn't in the string. Wait, the first part of the string is 't2', so maybe that's from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT21 is a non-terminal that produces 't6', NT27 produces 't25', and NT82 goes to 't0'. Also, NT33 is an terminal. The string is a sequence of t's and numbers, so I think the key is to see if each t or number can be matched by a production.\n\nThe string starts with 't2 t21 t0 t27 t27 t74 t87 t82 t40 t25 t42 t6 t3 t82 t87 t87 t42 t0 t82 t27 t87 t25 t87 t36'. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nI'll start from the beginning:\n\n1. 't2' must come from a production of NT that allows 't2'. Looking at the productions, I see NT29 \u2192 't42', but that's not it. Wait, what about NT21? NT21 \u2192 't6' so that's not 't2'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see all the end productions. I see that NT43 has some rules where it's a direct terminal. Wait, no, some NTs have direct terminals, like NT43 \u2192 't40', but that's not 't2'. Let me list all the terminal symbols from the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT43 can produce 't40', NT83 \u2192 't27', NT86 \u2192 't82', NT82 \u2192 't0', NT3 \u2192 't82' or 't87' based on NT3 \u2192 't82' or 't87' through different productions. NT9 \u2192 't68' or 't16', etc. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by writing out the possible derivation steps. Starting from S, which is NT43 and NT61. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT43 and the other from NT61.\n\nLet me check the start: the string starts with 't2', which must come from NT61 since the first symbol is 't2', and from the productions, NT61 \u2192 't33', but that's a direct terminal. Wait, but 't2' is not 't33', so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps NT61 is part of a larger substitution.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The start symbol S is divided into two parts: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string should be a concatenation of two parts: one from NT43 and one from NT61. So the string should have two main segments, each part being the expansion of NT43 and NT61 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't2', 't21', 't0', etc. Let me see how these can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each symbol in the string needs to correspond to a production of the start symbol. But since S is a combination of NT43 and NT61, perhaps each of these NTs is expanded into a sequence of terminals and other non-terminals. The entire string should be the concatenation of these two expansions.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts. The length is 40 symbols. If I consider NT43 \u2192 something, say produces 20 symbols, and NT61 \u2192 the other 20, but that depends on how the productions expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if each part of the string can be parsed starting from NT43 and NT61.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check if the string is a valid sequence generated by the grammar. Let's start breaking it down.\n\nThe string starts with 't2'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't2'. Looking through the productions, I see NT33 \u2192 't33' (so not directly helpful), NT45 \u2192 't42', etc. Let me see all the terminal productions:\n\nFrom NTs:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82' or 't87'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT59 \u2192 't2'\nWait, no, NT59 seems to produce 't68' or 't79'. Wait, looking back, the productions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79. No, that's a production of NT59 \u2192 NT68 and NT79, not a terminal. Wait, looking again, the productions include NT29 \u2192 't42' and NT79 \u2192 't36', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some direct terminals. Let me list all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82' and 't87' (since NT3 \u2192 't82' or 't87')\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT32 \u2192 't56' and 't9' (since NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9; but 56 is for 't27', so maybe NT32 can produce 't27' or 't9'?)\nWait, no, wait, NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9. So NT56 \u2192 't29' or 't21', but NT9 \u2192 't68' or 't16'. So NT32 would produce t29 t68 \u2192 't29t68', etc.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should instead start by trying to parse the string from the start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a top-down parsing. The first two symbols are 't2' and 't21'. Wait, S is NT43 followed by NT61, so the string should start with NT43's symbols, then transition to NT61's.\n\nWait, NT43's productions are:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT43 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT43 \u2192 NT28 NT32\nNT43 \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't87' (Wait, no, looking at the productions, NT3 can produce 't82' or 't87'?

Because in the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't82' and NT3 \u2192 't87'. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar lists:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nYes, so NT3 can directly produce 't82' or 't87'. That's important.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 \u2192 't42'. NT43 occurs in multiple productions, but also in some cases, like here: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, so it can produce that, but maybe there are ways to also reach terminals through other means.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me outline the steps I took:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n2. So the string should be a concatenation of NT43's expansion and NT61's expansion.\n3. Let's split the string into two parts, but how to split?\n\nWait, perhaps each part (NT43 and NT61) will have their own expansion sequences, but they can be interleave? No, because in CFGs, the left-hand side produces exactly two non-terminals. So the string is a concatenation of the expansions of these two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-481","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, two terminals, or a non-terminal producing two non-terminals. The string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Let me look at the given rules:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- NT3 -> 't87'\n- NT29 -> 't42'\n- NT77 -> 't42'\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT0 -> 't42'\n- NT56 -> 't27'\n- NT16 -> 't3'\n- NT59 -> 't2'\n- NT83 -> 't27'\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n- NT82 -> 't0'\n- NT76 -> 't74'\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n\nI notice that many of these non-terminals directly correspond to terminal symbols. For example, NT43 has two productions: one to 't40' and another to 't47'. So depending on which production is used, it can become either 't40' or 't47'. The same goes for others like NT83.\n\nThe string given is:\n\nt42 t33 t27 t3 t87 t21 t33 t42 t36 t74 t47 t21 t25 t3 t0 t6 t40 t21 t87 t36 t6 t0 t42 t6 t74 t87 t36 t6 t47 t27 t42 t2 t21 t21 t74 t3 t87 t33 t33 t33 t25 t36 t40 t0 t87 t47\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string starting from the top symbol S and see if it can derive the string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That means when I derive, each step should either replace a non-terminal with two symbols or a terminal.\n\nBut this seems a bit complex for a long string. Maybe I should look for a way to break the string down step by step, looking for matches in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's see the initial step. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT43 NT61. So, S must derive into two parts: NT43 and NT61. So the entire string should start with the symbols derived from NT43 and NT61. \n\nLooking at the first tokens of the string: t42, t33, t27, etc. Wait, S -> NT43 NT61. So the first part is NT43, and the second is NT61. So the string should start with a production from NT43 followed by a production from NT61.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t42. Let's see if t42 can come from NT43 or NT61. \n\nLooking at NT43, it has two rules: 't40' or 't47'. It's not t42, so t42 isn't directly produced by NT43. Hmm, so maybe NT61. Let's check NT61's production: it directly goes to 't33'. So the first token t42 doesn't match NT61's production directly. That suggests that maybe t42 is not the first part, but perhaps the entire string has to be derived correctly as a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. Let's clarify: when we parse in Chomsky normal form, each production is applied in a certain way. So S -> NT43 NT61. Then, each of those non-terminals will have their own productions. \n\nPerhaps I should break the string down into smaller parts, looking for where the non-terminals appear and then checking their possible productions.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the string as a sequence of terminals and see if each non-terminal can generate a specific subsequence. Since S is two non-terminals, the entire string should be made up of the two parts generated by NT43 and NT61.\n\nWait, so the entire string should be such that it can be split into two parts at some point, where the first part is generated by NT43 and the second by NT61.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split such that the first part ends with 't42' and the second starts with 't33'. Because NT61 goes to 't33', so the second part should start with t33.\n\nSo, perhaps the split is after the first few tokens. Let me see:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt42 t33 t27 t3 t87 t21 t33 t42 t36 t74 t47 t21 t25 t3 t0 t6 t40 t21 t87 t36 t6 t0 t42 t6 t74 t87 t36 t6 t47 t27 t42 t2 t21 t21 t74 t3 t87 t33 t33 t33 t25 t36 t40 t0 t87 t47\n\nIf the split is between the second 't33' and the following 't27', but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the split is somewhere else.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should model the parsing step by step.\n\nLet's start with S -> NT43 NT61. So, we need to derive the string as NT43 followed by NT61. Therefore, the entire string should be a result of NT43's derivation followed by NT61's.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT43 and the second by NT61.\n\nLooking at the second part, which must start with NT61's production 't33', the first token is t42, which doesn't match. So that's a problem. Wait, maybe the first part is derived into a symbol that produces t42 at the end. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split is wrong. Maybe the string is derived from NT43 producing something that starts with t42, and NT61 producing t33 followed by the rest. But wait, NT61's first token is t33, which is the second token in the string, so perhaps the split is after the first token. But then NT43 would have to derive t42, which it can't because NT43 only becomes 't40' or 't47'.\n\nSo that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the string is not derived correctly because the first token t42 isn't part of NT43's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is wrong. Let me check the productions again. S -> NT43 NT61. So the string must be two parts: first from NT43, then from NT61. The first token of the string must come from NT43's derivation, and the second part from NT61's.\n\nNT61 -> 't33', so the second part of the string must start with t33. But the second token in the string is t33, so the second part must start from t33 onwards.\n\nSo the second part starts at the second token: t33 t27 t3 t87 t21 t33 t42 t36 t74 t47 t21 t25 t3 t0 t6 t40 t21 t87 t36 t6 t0 t42 t6 t74 t87 t36 t6 t47 t27 t42 t2 t21 t21 t74 t3 t87 t33 t33 t33 t25 t36 t40 t0 t87 t47\n\nWait, that's confusing. So let's take the string and split it into the first part (from NT43) and the second"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar consists of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT9, NT59, etc.) that can produce terminal symbols, which in this case are a series of 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to see if the string can be derived step by step using the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, it produces NT43 and NT61. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nBreaking it down, I'll evaluate each part of the string as a series of productions from the grammar.\n\nThe string given is:\nt33 t87 t21 t2 t40 t36 t47 t82 t6 t27 t87 t87 t87 t21 t40 t87 t27 t6 t87 t21 t21 t36 t0 t87 t74 t21 t27 t36 t42 t27 t42 t74 t21 t42 t36 t25 t21 t36 t82 t40 t27 t36 t2 t36 t25 t74 t0.\n\nI need to split this into components that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, look for production rules in the grammar that produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT83 \u2192 t42. Wait, but let's list out the relevant productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87' (another production)\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT68 \u2192 't21'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n\nWait, I notice that NT3 appears to have two productions: 't82' and 't87', which might form a cycle. Similarly, NT27 and NT21 each have single productions.\n\nLooking deeper, the string starts with t33. Now, in the grammar, the only way to get 't33' is from NT61. Checking the rules:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo the first two symbols must be t33 and then NT61's production. Wait, no. Wait, the grammar for S is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So S would produce two tokens: the production of NT43 and then the production of NT61.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the production for S is NT43 followed by NT61. So each non-terminal symbol must be replaced, and the overall string is the concatenation of their terminals.\n\nSo the start is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Each of these can be terminals or otherNTs. So for S, it's the concatenation of NT43's production and NT61's production.\n\nLooking at NT43: it has two productions: \u2192t40 and \u2192t83. So S can either be t40 followed by NT61's production or t83 followed by NT61's production.\n\nSimilarly, NT61 \u2192 't33', so the end of S's production is t33.\n\nSo the first t in the string must be part of either NT43 or perhaps another NT that starts with a t, but I see NT3 is 't82' and 't87', which are 't' followed by numbers, but starts with t.\n\nWait, no\u2014the string starts with t33, which is the production of NT61, so the entire S production would be the production of NT43 followed by 't33'. Therefore, the first part should be whatever NT43 produces.\n\nLooking at NT43: productions are t40 and another production to something else. Wait, in the grammar, NT43 is listed twice:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT43 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar again:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as a series of lines, maybe each line being a production. So let me list all the productions clearly for better understanding.\n\nHere's the full grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\n NT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo, let's parse the grammar step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61. So for S to produce the string, the first part is NT43's production, then followed by NT61's production.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33', so the last part of S is 't33'. Therefore, the string must end with 't33'.\n\nLooking at the string: It ends with 't0 t74 t21 t27 t36 t42 t27 t42 t74 t21 t42 t36 t25 t21 t36 t82 t40 t27 t36 t2 t36 t25 t74 t0'.\n\nWait, the string ends with 't0 t74 ... t0'. Wait, the last token is 't0'. But NT61 \u2192 't33', so the end of S is 't33'. Therefore, the string should end with 't33', but in the given string, the last part is 't0 ... t0'. This suggests an inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nS is NT43 followed by NT61, each of which can be a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nLet me process the string step by step, trying to match it.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nSo the first symbol must come from NT43, and the second from NT61. Wait, no, S is the production of NT43 followed immediately by NT61, so the string generated by S is a concatenation: NT43's string followed by NT61's string.\n\nSo if NT43 produces, say, a terminal, that comes first, and then whatever NT61 produces. If NT43 is a non-terminal, then it's replaced by another production.\n\nLooking back at NT43's productions:\n\nNT43 can produce 't40' or 't83'.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT43 appears to have two productions:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nand another production where NT43 is again a combination: 'NT83 NT77'. So I think that's not correct. Wait, looking back, the lines in the grammar for NT43 are:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT43 -> NT47\n\nWait, in the data provided by the user, NT43 is listed twice. So perhaps it's two different production rules:\n\nProduction 1: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nProduction 2: NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, that can't be, because the two lines indicate that NT43 can produce either of those. But that's problematic because it would create a loop, but let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the syntax is such that each line is a separate production. So let me list them as:\n\nProduction 1: NT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nProduction 2: NT43 \u2192 't47'\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT43 appears twice with different structures, but both are to 't40' and 't47'. Wait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, looking again, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-489","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols. Since I'm a bit new to this, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It seems to consist of a start symbol S and a bunch of non-terminals (NT) that eventually produce terminals, which in this case are 't' followed by numbers. The terminals make up the string we're checking, and the non-terminals need to be expanded according to the rules.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string must start with NT43 and NT61. Let me see if that's the case. The string begins with 't25 t6 t87 t74 t21 t25 t33 t21 t25 t2 t33 t21 t6 t42 t87 t33 t82 t0 t0 t40 t0 t87 t87 t33 t47 t6 t74 t25 t42 t25 t82 t42 t33 t6 t25 t47 t0 t0 t87 t82 t3 t42 t36 t25 t87 t2 t0'. Wait, that's a lot of tokens. Maybe I should split it into segments that match the left-hand sides of the rules.\n\nLooking at the possible non-terminals, the starting point is NT43 and NT61. So each of these should expand into a sequence of two symbols according to their production rules. Let me check each non-terminal's production:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 or NT45 NT3\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nSo NT61 directly becomes 't33', which is part of the string. That's a good sign. Now NT43 can choose between two options. I think the string starts with 't25', which is derived from NT25, but wait, NT43 is involved. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't25', so I need to check if any non-terminals expand to 't25'. Looking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 't25'. So NT27 must appear in the expansion. But the start symbol is NT43 and NT61. So NT43 must expand into something that leads to NT27.\n\nLooking at NT43's rules: it can be NT83 NT77 or NT45 NT3. Let's explore NT83: NT83 \u2192 't82' or 't47'. Hmm, and NT77 \u2192 't42'. So if NT43 expands to NT83 NT77, that would give 't82 t42' (if NT83 is 't82'), but that's not matching the 't25' at the beginning. Alternatively, if NT77 is 't42', and NT83 is 't47', that would be 't47 t42', which doesn't help. Alternatively, if NT43 expands to NT45 NT3, then NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3, and NT3 can be 't82', 't87', or 't42'.\n\nWait, this might take a long time. Maybe it's better to start from the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with 't25'. Looking at the rules, the only way to get to 't25' is through NT27. So we need a part of the string that starts with NT27. But NT27 \u2192 't25'. So the first token is 't25', which is the result of NT27.\n\nSo before NT27, there must be NT43 because looking back, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So NT43 must expand to something that includes NT27.\n\nWait, actually, the entire string is a series of terminal tokens. Since S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the string must start with the expansion of NT43 and then NT61. So S expands into two parts: the first part is NT43, the second is NT61. The NT61 directly expands to 't33', which is the second token in the string: 't6 t33'. Wait, hold on, the string is: 't25 t6 t87 t74 t21 t25 t33 t21 t25 t2 t33 t21 t6 t42 t87 t33 t82 t0 t0 t40 t0 t87 t87 t33 t47 t6 t74 t25 t42 t25 t82 t42 t33 t6 t25 t47 t0 t0 t87 t82 t3 t42 t36 t25 t87 t2 t0'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, each token being a terminal symbol. Each production rule in the grammar must expand into a sequence of these terminal symbols.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which means the string should be NT43 expansion followed by NT61 expansion.\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33' directly. So after the expansion of NT43, the next token must be 't33'. Looking at the string, the second token is 't6', which is not 't33'. That's a problem because according to S, after NT43's expansion comes NT61's 't33'. But here, after the initial 't25', the next token is 't6', not 't33'. So that suggests that S can't produce the given string because the NT61 part is 't33', which should come right after NT43's expansion. Here, it's not.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the string. Let me look again: the string is: 't25 t6 t87 t74 t21 t25 t33 t21 t25 t2 t33 t21 t6 t42 t87 t33 t82 t0 t0 t40 t0 t87 t87 t33 t47 t6 t74 t25 t42 t25 t82 t42 t33 t6 t25 t47 t0 t0 t87 t82 t3 t42 t36 t25 t87 t2 t0'.\n\nWait, the second token is 't6', which is part of NT61? No, NT61 is 't33'. So something's wrong here. According to the grammar, S produces NT43 and then NT61. So after NT43 expands, the next token should be 't33' from NT61, right?\n\nBut in the string, after the first 't25', the next is 't6', then 't87', etc. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe I need to re-examine the grammar. Alternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of NT43 and NT61, which means after NT43's expansion comes NT61's 't33'. But in the string, it's 't25 t6 t87...', so 't6' is before 't33'. That's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the string starts with another NT, but S only starts with NT43 and NT61. So after 't25' (which would be from NT27), what comes next should be something that leads to 't33' from NT61. But the string after 't25' is 't6', so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all possible paths. Let's try to see if there's another way to get from S to the start of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is supposed to start with NT43's expansion, which itself starts with other non-terminals. So perhaps NT43 expands to something that includes 't25' as one of its terminal symbols.\n\nLooking back at the NT43 rules: NT43 can be NT83 NT77 or NT45 NT3.\n\nIf it's NT45 NT3, then NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3, and NT3 can be 't82', 't87', or 't42'. So, combining these, if NT45 is 't28' and NT3 is 't25', then that would contribute to 't28 t25'. But 't25' isn't in the options for NT3.\n\nWait, no, NT3 can be 't82', 't87', or 't42' but not 't25"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like the productions are all two-symbol or three-symbol right-hand sides, but wait, actually, looking closer, the productions are mostly two symbols. Let me check:\n\n- S -> NT43 NT61 (two symbols)\n- NT9 -> NT68 NT16 (two)\n- NT59 -> NT68 NT79 (two)\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77 (two)\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79 (two)\n- NT28 -> NT27 NT59 (two)\n- NT62 -> NT45 NT32 (two)\n- NT45 -> NT28 NT3 (two)\n- NT56 -> NT29 NT21 (two)\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT3 (two)\n- NT86 -> NT82 NT76 (two)\n- NT82 -> NT62 NT0 (two)\n- NT32 -> NT56 NT9 (two)\n- NT61 -> 't33' (uh, wait, this is a terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't82' (terminal)\n- NT43 -> 't40' (terminal)\n- NT3 -> 't87' (terminal)\n- NT29 -> 't42' (terminal)\n- NT77 -> 't42' (terminal)\n- NT27 -> 't25' (terminal)\n- NT68 -> 't21' (terminal)\n- NT0 -> 't42' (terminal)\n- NT56 -> 't27' (terminal)\n- NT16 -> 't3' (terminal)\n- NT59 -> 't2' (terminal)\n- NT83 -> 't27' (terminal)\n- NT83 -> 't47' (terminal)\n- NT82 -> 't0' (terminal)\n- NT76 -> 't74' (terminal)\n- NT21 -> 't6' (terminal)\n- NT79 -> 't36' (terminal)\n\nSo, the grammar is composed of non-terminals (like S, NT43, NT3, etc.) and terminals (t followed by numbers). The starting symbol is S, and each production either breaks down into more non-terminals or converts into a terminal. \n\nLooking at the given string: It's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, so each token is a terminal. The string starts with `t2 t0 t82...` up to `... t47 t47 t36 t47 t47 t36 t33 t87 t47 t47`. \n\nI need to see if this entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. \n\nOne approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the productions. But since the string is quite long, maybe I can find a way to group the terminals into symbols that correspond to non-terminals' productions.\n\nI also notice that some productions are conflicts, for example, NT43 has two rules: NT83 NT77 and also directly becomes 't40'. Wait no, looking back, NT43 is defined as NT83 NT77 OR is it? Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- And separately, NT43 -> 't40'\n\nWait, no: Looking again, I see NT43 has two different productions:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\nand\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n\nSo, that's a conflict, which probably isn't possible in standard CNF, but given the grammar, it seems the user provided it, so perhaps in the original it's meant to have both.\n\nWait, but that would mean for NT43, it can be either NT83 NT77 or 't40', which is problematic. Or maybe I misread it, perhaps some other symbols. Let me double-check:\n\nThe user's grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nSo, NT43 has two different production rules: \n\n1. NT83 NT77\n\nand \n\n2. 't40'\n\nSo, when parsing, you can only expand NT43 into either NT83 NT77 or 't40', but not both. It seems this could be a problem because it's a mutual recursion, but in any case, to produce the string, we have to pick one or the other.\n\nBut let's move on.\n\nThe string given starts with 't2', which is a terminal. Let's see if it can be matched by any production.\n\nLooking at the terminals and non-terminals:\n\n- t2 is equal to NT29 and NT3.\n\nBut from the grammar, NT29 is a non-terminal that produces 't42', but wait, in the user's grammar, I think NT29 -> 't42'. So 't2' doesn't match NT29. But NT3 as in NT3 -> 't82', so 't2' doesn't match NT3. Is there a non-terminal that produces 't2'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all productions, the only non-terminals that produce terminals are NT29->t42, NT77->t42, NT27->t25, NT68->t21, NT0->t42, NT56->t27, NT16->t3, NT59->t2 (wait, looking back: NT29->'t42', NT77->'t42', NT27->'t25', NT68->'t21', NT0->'t42', NT56->'t27', NT16->'t3', NT59->'t2', NT83->'t27', NT83->'t47', NT82->'t0', NT76->'t74', NT21->'t6', NT79->'t36', NT45->'t40'.\n\nWait, so looking at these, we have NT59->t2. So the string starts with t2, which can be matched by NT59. So, the first step is to have NT59 derive 't2' via production NT59 -> 't2'.\n\nBut looking deeper, the production for NT59 is NT59 -> NT68 NT79. So to get 't2' from NT59, it would need to produce NT68 followed by NT79, but those are also non-terminals that ultimately produce 't21' and something else.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Perhaps a better approach is to work backwards.\n\nLooking at the last token, the last few are 't47 t47 t36...

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, where do I start? First, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That structure should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it has two main rules: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT43 and NT61. Let me check the string: the first part is 't21 t87 t2 t82 t25 t21 t3 ...'. Since S generates NT43 NT61, we'll need to see if the entire string can be broken down into derivations starting with NT43 and NT61.\n\nNext, checking NT43: according to the grammar, NT43 can be NT83 NT77 or NT40. Wait, looking again, I see NT43 has two rules: one is NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and another is NT43 \u2192 't40'. Hmm, so when generating, NT43 can either split into two non-terminals or the terminal t40. Let's see the first part of the string: does anything look like t40? At the end, I see t40 several times, but the beginning is different.\n\nHold on, the string starts with t21, so maybe NT43 is splitting into other non-terminals. Let's check the rules for NT43 again. Oh, I see that NT43 has two production rules: one is NT83 NT77, and another is 't40'. Wait, that's two rules for NT43. So, when we have NT43, it can expand into either NT83 and NT77 or directly into t40. So somewhere in the string, the parser would choose either option.\n\nIf NT43 is t40, then the string after S would start with t40, but the string starts with t21, so that's not possible. So, NT43 must be expanding into NT83 NT77. So after S, we have NT83 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT83's rules: NT83 can be NT86 NT79 or 't42'. Let's see the string after S83: t86 t79 t82 ... Hmm, the string starts with t21 t87 t2 t82... Wait, does that mean maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Maybe the NT83 would produce something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should break down the string step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should write the string as tokens: t21, t87, t2, t82, t25, t21, t3, t40, t87, t40, t74, t87, t2, t3, t0, t87, t40, t0, t3, t21, t21, t74, t47, t42, t82, t87, t25, t27, t2, t36, t74, t40, t25, t25, t27, t87, t2, t3, t6, t36, t3, t3, t47, t3, t40, t33, t36, t74, t42.\n\nWait, maybe I should group them into possible phrases. The first thing is that the string starts with t21, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, t21 is a terminal because it's on the right-hand side of a production for NT21. NT21 \u2192 't25', so t21 is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but t21 is a terminal in the string, so it must be generated directly by a production. Looking at the grammar, is there any production that ends with NT43 -> something ending with t21? Let me see: From NT21, it's 't25', so that's a terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to look for which non-terminals expand into t21.\n\nLet me list all the rules with terminals on the right-hand side. The grammar provides several:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82', 't87', 't40', 't87', etc. Wait, looking at the provided grammar, which terminals are present:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 't74'\n- NT32 \u2192 't56'? Wait, no, looking at the production rules for NT32: it's NT56 NT9. Hmm, perhaps I should re-express each rule from the provided set.\n\nHere's the given grammar (simplified):\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 | 't40'\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 | 't42'\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76 | 't74'\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0 | 't0' | 't87'?\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, and look for what NT0 is: NT0 \u2192 't42'.\n\nWait, let me see the detailed grammar:\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, NT40\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79, NT42\n- NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, 't0', 't87'? Wait, in the given rules, it's NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, and elsewhere, like NT27 \u2192 't25', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 | t40\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 | t42\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76 | 't74'\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n\nSo, in the string, when we see 't82', that must come from either NT82 \u2192 t74 (if it's 't74's rule), or maybe NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0, which would need to derive into a terminal.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to try building the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t21, which is a terminal. So, to get t21, we must have a production that directly produces it. Looking through the grammar, which non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through each rule, some rules have terminals on the RHS. Let's list them all.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar rules:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 't42'\n- NT86 \u2192 't74'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT59 \u2192 't2' (Wait, not provided directly, but looking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 't25' is a rule, but other terminals like 't74' and 't42' are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note which rules produce terminals:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 't42' (since it can produce 't42')\n- NT86 \u2192 't74' (since it can produce 't74')\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3' (if any rule for NT16 produces 't3', but in the rules for NT16, it's NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3, both of which are non-terminals. So NT16 must expand into something else, but none of the rules for NT16 produce a terminal directly. Wait, looking again: No, I think all the rules for NT16 are production into other non-terminals.

So NT43 is on the left, and when it appears in the string, it must reduce to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT43:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT3 is a terminal and 't82'.\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nAnd other rules lead to terminals.\n\nWait, so following NT43 all the way down, it seems NT43 might eventually reduce to 't82'. Let me check that. Starting from NT43:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nWait, NT68 \u2192 't21', so that's another way to a terminal.\n\nHmm, so NT43 can't directly reduce to t42. Because NT43 goes through several steps. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me retrace. Starting from S, it's NT43 NT61. Each of these can produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe NT43 and NT61 each produce their own terminal sequences. So the string starts with t42, which could be the terminal from NT43. Let's trace the possible derivation.\n\nHmm, looking at the string, each token is separated by spaces, so each is a single character. The string is: t42 t74 t36 t0 t27 t25 t82 t87 t3 t42 t33 t0 t27 t6 t42 t82 t87 t42 t0 t36 t27 t33 t27 t21 t3 t2 t25 t21 t42 t27 t27 t42 t74 t74 t33 t42 t82 t2 t74 t82 t27 t25 t0 t36 t74 t36 t2 t21 t27 t33.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the first two elements should be the terminals from NT43 and NT61. So, the string starts with t42, which would be from NT43, and then t74, which would be from NT61.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT61 is 't42' because NT61 \u2192 't33', but that's a different rule. Wait no, let me check: NT61 has two rules: one is 't42' and another is 't33'. So is there a conflict? Or does the grammar allow for multiple productions for the same non-terminal?\n\nLooking back, I see NT61 has two rules: NT61 \u2192 't42' and NT61 \u2192 't33'. That might be a mistake in how I read the rules. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar provided:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\nWait, that's one production. Then, another line says NT61 \u2192 't42'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar is a bit jumbled. Let me list them correctly:\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\n\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\n\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\n\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\n\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\n\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nNT3 -> 't87'\n\nNT29 -> 't42'\n\nNT77 -> 't42'\n\nNT27 -> 't25'\n\nNT68 -> 't21'\n\nNT0 -> 't42'\n\nNT56 -> 't27'\n\nNT16 -> 't3'\n\nNT59 -> 't2'\n\nNT83 -> 't27'\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nNT82 -> 't0'\n\nNT76 -> 't74'\n\nNT21 -> 't6'\n\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, so NT61 has two productions: one is \"t33\" and another is \"t42\"? Or is NT61 only having one production? I'm confused because in the grammar, NT61 is written twice: once as NT61 \u2192 't33' and another as NT61 \u2192 't42'. That can't be right because a non-terminal can have only one production. Maybe it's a typo, and one of the productions is redundant.\n\nLooking more closely: The user input for the grammar is:\n\n```\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 -> 't42'\nNT27 -> 't25'\nNT68 -> 't21'\nNT0 -> 't42'\nNT56 -> 't27'\nNT16 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't27'\nNT83 -> 't47'\nNT82 -> 't0'\nNT76 -> 't74'\nNT21 -> 't6'\nNT79 -> 't36'\n\nWait, that's 24 lines. So for NT61, there are two lines:\n\nNT61 -> 't33'\n\nand\n\nNT61 -> 't42'\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Unless one is a typo. Maybe it's meant to be one production, so perhaps it's a mistake, but in any case, for our purposes, each non-terminal has one production.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, line \"NT61 -> 't33'\" and another line \"NT61 -> 't42'\". That's a problem. So perhaps it's a mistake, and only one of them is intended. Let's see where 't33' and 't42' appear in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t42, which would have to be derived from either NT43 or NT61 if they can produce t42. But let's trace the possible paths.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76.\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59.\n\nNT27 \u2192 t25.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t21.\n\nSo starting from NT43, we get t25 and t21, but the string starts with t42. So maybe NT43 can also produce t42 through another path. Wait, looking back, I think I might have missed some rules.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It has several production rules, and the start symbol is S. The goal is to see if the string `t42 t33 t27 t42 t0 t3 t3 t27 t42 t87 t42 t6 t87 t42 t47 t42 t3 t21 t47 t2 t82 t42 t25 t40 t36 t47 t74 t21 t36 t42 t36 t2 t82 t3 t0 t27 t27 t27 t74 t33 t2 t21 t47 t2 t21 t42 t27 t33 t40 t25` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's all a series of 't's followed by numbers. And looking at the grammar, many of these terminals are present, like 't42', 't33', etc. So that seems manageable.\n\nThe process is probably to work backwards from the string, trying to find the productions that would generate each part. Alternatively, we can build a parse tree or use something like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a way to derive the string by applying the productions step by step, but that might be tricky because the string is long, and the grammar has a lot of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be split into components that match the terminals produced by the non-terminals. For example, any occurrence of 't42' must come from either a direct terminal production or a non-terminal that produces 't42'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some non-terminals have terminal assignments:\n\n- NT3 -> t82\n- NT3 -> t87\n- NT29 -> t42\n- NT27 -> t25\n- NT68 -> t21\n- NT0 -> t42\n- NT56 -> t27\n- NT16 -> t3\n- NT59 -> t2\n- NT83 -> t27\n- NT83 -> t47\n- NT82 -> t0\n- NT76 -> t74\n- NT21 -> t6\n- NT79 -> t36\n- NT43 -> t40\n- NT43 has two productions: NT43 -> NT83 NT77 and NT43 -> t40. So when NT43 is used, it could either produce two non-terminals or the terminal 't40'.\n\nBut the string has a lot of 't42's. So let's examine where 't42' comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT29 and NT0 both produce t42. So either NT29 or NT0 could generate 't42'.\n\nBut how do we get 't42' in the string? Each occurrence might come from either NT29, NT0, or perhaps from a chain of non-terminals that reduce to one of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't42', so the first production we need is 't42' somewhere in the derivation. Let's assume that the first 't42' comes from either NT29 or NT0.\n\nIf it's NT0: NT0 -> 't42'. Then, in NT0, the only production is S \u2192 NT43 NT61, but wait, in this case, NT0 is used as a non-terminal in the production of S? Or is NT0 elsewhere?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT0 is a non-terminal that produces 't42', but in the initial production S, it's S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so NT43 and NT61 are the ones directly derived from S. So NT0 is a separate non-terminal that can be used in other derivations, possibly through other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe the string is being derived from S, so we start with S, which is NT43 NT61, meaning S expands into two non-terminals NT43 and NT61, and then these can be further expanded.\n\nSo the string starts with t42, which would have to come from either NT29 or NT43 or NT61 or something else? Wait, but in the production for NT43, it can produce 't40' or NT83 NT77.\n\nBut the first token is 't42', so perhaps that 't42' is from NT0 or NT29.\n\nBut wait, in the initial expansion of S, it's NT43 NT61. So how does that string begin with 't42'? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is not directly derived but is generated through other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps the string is built by replacing S step by step, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's consider that the string is a sequence of terminals, so to derive it, each part must come from a terminal in the grammar, but through production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production of S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and then each of these non-terminals must generate the parts of the string.\n\nBut the string starts with t42, which would have to be part of either the NT43 or NT61 expansion.\n\nWait, but NT43 can produce t40 or NT83 NT77. Similarly, NT61 produces 't33'.\n\nSo if NT61 is the first part, it directly gives 't33' as the first token, which is exactly the first token in the string. So the first token is 't33', which would come from NT61. That makes sense.\n\nThen, the second token is 't42', so perhaps the second part is from NT43. Let's see: NT43 can either produce 't40' (which is not the case here, as the next token is 't42'), or produce NT83 NT77. So if NT43 is 't40', but we have 't42', that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the 't42' comes from another part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is the sequence of symbols generated, so S -> NT43 NT61. Then, NT61 is expanded to 't33', so the first token is 't33'. The second token is 't42', so that would have to come from NT43 somehow.\n\nLooking back, NT43 can produce 't40' or NT83 NT77. So 't40' isn't 't42', so that path doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't42' comes from a different part of the grammar. Wait, NT29 and NT0 both produce 't42'. So maybe somewhere deeper in the derivation, we have an NT29 or NT0 that expands to 't42'. But then how does that fit into the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the productions of the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse the string using a top-down approach.\n\nThe string is: t42 t33 t27 t42 t0 t3 t3 t27 t42 t87 t42 t6 t87 t42 t47 t42 t3 t21 t47 t2 t82 t42 t25 t40 t36 t47 t74 t21 t36 t42 t36 t2 t82 t3 t0 t27 t27 t27 t74 t33 t2 t21 t47 t2 t21 t42 t27 t33 t40 t25\n\nWait, that's 50 tokens. Let's see how they can be generated.\n\nFirst token is 't33' from NT61. So S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and NT61 \u2192 t33. Then NT43 might need to produce the remaining tokens.\n\nBut the next token after 't33' is 't42', which would have to come from NT43's expansion. Looking at NT43, it can produce 't40' or NT83 NT77.\n\nBut 't42' is neither, so that's a problem. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first token 't42' comes from somewhere else, but NT61 gives 't33', so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the string doesn't come from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar consists of several production rules, and the string in question is \"t40 t33\". I need to determine whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It looks like all the non-terminals are on the left side of the rules, and each has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the terminals at certain points. In Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string \"t40 t33\", it's a sequence of two terminals. Since the string has two tokens, the derivation must eventually consist of two steps, starting from the start symbol S and each production step adding tokens until we reach the two terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S. From the production rules, S -> NT43 NT61. So S directly produces NT43 and NT61. Therefore, the string derived from S will be the combination of strings derived from NT43 and NT61 separated by a space.\n\nSo, the string \"t40 t33\" must be equal to the concatenation of the strings from NT43 and NT61. Since \"t40 t33\" has exactly two parts, t40 and t33, this suggests that NT43 produces \"t40\" and NT61 produces \"t33\".\n\nNow, let's look at each of these non-terminals separately.\n\nStarting with NT43: The production rules for NT43 are:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> NT40\n\nWe need to see if NT43 can derive \"t40\". Looking at the production rules, NT43 can directly become \"t40\" via the second rule. So NT43 \u2192 \"t40\" is possible.\n\nNext, looking at NT61: The production for NT61 is:\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n\nWhich means NT61 directly produces \"t33\". So NT61 \u2192 \"t33\" is possible.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together: S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 \"t40\" \"t33\", resulting in the string \"t40 t33\".\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check if there are any alternative derivations. For example, does NT43 have another path that might produce something else, but since we have a direct rule for NT43 \u2192 \"t40\", that's the only way for NT43 to produce a terminal string. Similarly, NT61 only has one production, which is a terminal, so that's also straightforward.\n\nI should also make sure that the NTs don't have any other productions that could interfere. For example, looking at NT83: its productions are -> NT86 NT79 and -> NT83 NT47. Wait, wait, I notice that there's an NT83 -> NT47. So NT83 can either produce NT86 NT79 or NT47. But wait, in our previous step, we thought that NT43 directly produces \"t40\". That's because in the given grammar, NT43 has a production rule NT43 -> NT40, which is a terminal. So as long as that rule exists, that's the way it goes.\n\nWait, but looking again, I notice that the user provided the grammar again, so I should make sure I have it correctly. The user's grammar includes:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT40\n\nYes, so NT43 can go to either NT83 NT77 or \"t40\". Since we need NT43 to produce \"t40\", that's one possibility. Are there any other ways NT83 could get into it? For example, NT83 can produce NT86 NT79 or NT47. But regardless of that, as long as we can choose to take the direct production from NT43 to \"t40\", that path is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for NT61, it's directly producing \"t33\" as a single production.\n\nSo, putting it all together: S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 \"t40\" \"t33\", which forms the string \"t40 t33\".\n\nI don't see any issues or alternative paths that would cause the string not to be derivable.

{"custom_id":"request-21","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the given string \"t27 t42 t33\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the grammar looks like. The start symbol is S, which produces NT43 NT61. So the string starts with NT43 and ends with NT61, or vice versa if order matters. Wait, but in the given string, the order is t27 t42 t33. Hmm, I think the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so each symbol must correspond directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the NT43 and NT61 productions:\nS -> NT43 NT61\nI need to check if \"t27 t42 t33\" can be derived from this. So the entire string must be generated by expanding S.\n\nWait, wait. No, because NT43 and NT61 are non-terminals. They need to be expanded into sequences of terminals. So S produces NT43 NT61, which in turn must each be expanded into terminal sequences, and when combined, form the entire string.\n\nSo, the string is three terminals: t27, t42, t33. That suggests that the grammar needs to produce a string where S expands into three parts. But in the given grammar, S only has two non-terminals: NT43 and NT61. How can that result in three terminals?\n\nHmm, maybe each of NT43 and NT61 can expand into sequences that when combined add up to three terminals. So let's see. Let's break it down:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nOh, wait, it's going into more non-terminals. Let me map it out step by step.\n\nStarting from S:\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nNow, let's look at the possible expansions for NT43 and NT61.\n\nStarting with NT43:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 NT25\nAnd it stops. Wait, but NT27 has a rule NT27 \u2192 NT25, which isn't a terminal yet. So NT27 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal. \n\nWait, but the string is three terminals. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try tracing each production step.\n\nStarting with NT43, let's try to expand it as much as possible:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nThen NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 NT25 (but NT25 isn't a terminal)\nSo maybe that's a dead end. Wait, maybe NT27 is further expanded? Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, in the rules given, for NT27 \u2192 t25? Wait, the given rules are:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t25 (Oh, yes, in the provided rules, it's stated that NT27 produces t25. So earlier I think I misread. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have rules ending with terminals or others. So let's correct that.\n\nStarting again with NT43:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 t25\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nNT68 \u2192 t21\nNT79 \u2192 t36\n\nSo, putting it all together: Starting from NT43, when fully expanded, it will be t25, t21, t36.\n\nSo NT43 can expand into t25 t21 t36.\n\nWait, let's see step by step:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 \u2192 NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76 \u2192 NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0 \u2192 NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32 \u2192 NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59 \u2192 NT27 \u2192 t25; NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79 \u2192 NT68 \u2192 t21; NT79 \u2192 t36.\n\nWait, but NT83's expansion is NT86 NT79, then NT86 is NT82 NT76, etc. So the entire expansion for NT43 would be:\n\nt25 (from NT27), then t21 (from NT68), then t36 (from NT79). So NT43 \u2192 t25 t21 t36.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or is there more steps? Let me see:\n\nEach step takes a non-terminal and expands it into two non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo for NT83:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nThen NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 t25\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79 \u2192 NT68\u2192t21; NT79 \u2192t36.\n\nSo all together, NT43's expansion is t25, t21, t36.\n\nSimilarly, let's examine NT61. Looking at the given grammar:\n\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\n\nOh, that's an atomic production. So NT61 directly expands to t33.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT43 NT61, which upon full expansion becomes t25 t21 t36 t33.\n\nWait, but that's four terminals, but our string is three: t27 t42 t33. So that can't be right. Therefore, either I made a mistake, or perhaps the NT43 is supposed to produce fewer terminals?\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, for NT43, it's defined as:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nThen each of those is expanded further. So, when we derive NT43, is there a way to stop before reaching t25, t21, t36? Or does it have to fully expand all the way to terminals?\n\nBecause in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So in the case of NT43, it's broken down into two non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo perhaps, the NT43 expansion is t25 t21 t36. So that's three terminals, but wait, each expansion would produce two parts. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think in terms of the structure.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT43 NT61, and both NT43 and NT61 produce three and one terminals respectively, then the total would be 3 + 1 = 4 terminals. But our string is three terminals, which would match something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way they combine is such that some part is being skipped. But each expansion step should consume the non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the NT43 expansion. Let me try again.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 t25\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nNT68 \u2192 t21\nNT79 \u2192 t36\n\nSo the expansion of NT43 is t25 (from NT27), followed by t21 (from NT68), followed by t36 (from NT79). So that's three terminals: t25 t21 t36. Then NT61 \u2192 t33.

Let me start by understanding the grammar first. It looks like the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT43 NT61. So the initial derivation is S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Now, each of these NT symbols eventually derives some terminal (t) or non-terminal, ending in terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. The string is `t47 t42 t33`, which I can think of as three tokens: T47, T42, T33. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive exactly these three tokens.\n\nStarting from S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the first two tokens must come from NT43 and NT61.\n\nLooking at NT61: I see in the grammar that NT61 \u2192 't33'. So that's direct. So the second token should be T33.

Let's see. Checking the rules:\n\nLooking for NT... \u2192 t0. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT62 \u2192 't6' (no)\n- NT32 \u2192 't56' NT9 (nope)\n- NT82 \u2192 't0' (Yes! NT82 \u2192 't0')\n\nSo, to get t0, we need NT82 \u2192 't0'. But NT82 comes from NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0.\n\nSo, how do we get to NT82?\n\nLooking at the production for NT62: it's NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32.\n\nSo, NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3, and NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9.\n\nThen, looking at NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59, and NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79.\n\nWait, this seems a bit convoluted. Let me map out the entire possible derivation from NT43, maybe.\n\nStarting with NT43, it can either go to 't40' or split into NT83 and NT77. Since our string starts with t0, which isn't 't40', so the other option: NT83 and NT77.\n\nSo NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNow, NT83 can produce 't27' or 't47'. In our string, the second token is t74. Hmm, but none of these are t74. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if NT77 can derive to t74 somehow. Let me check NT77.\n\nLooking up NT77: NT77 \u2192 't42'. So NT77 is 't42'. But wait, in our string, after t0 comes t74, then t36, t42, t33.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach it differently.\n\nThe entire string is t0 t74 t36 t42 t33.\n\nBreaking it down as NT43's expansion, which is two elements: first is t0, then t74, then t36, then t42, then t33. Wait, but NT43 and NT61 generate two non-terminals each, so each will contribute tokens.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the string generated by S will be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT43 and NT61. So, the full string must be the result of NT43 producing some tokens and NT61 producing others.\n\nThus, the string t0 t74 t36 t42 t33 has five tokens. Wait a minute, NT43 and NT61 each produce a sequence of terminals. So the total number of tokens should be even, because both NT43 and NT61 will each expand into some number of terminals, and their concatenation must form the string.\n\nBut the string has 5 tokens, which is odd. That suggests an issue because NT43 and NT61 each must expand into sequences that sum up to 5 tokens, which is impossible since 5 is odd. Because each NT production results in a concatenation of two non-terminals (except the terminals).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's re-express:\n\nEach non-terminal, when expanded, can produce either a terminal or another pair of non-terminals. So, for example, NT43 can either be 't40' (one token) or split into NT83 and NT77, each of which may produce further tokens.\n\nSo, for NT43's expansion into multiple tokens, let's consider the breakdown:\n\nCase 1: NT43 \u2192 't40' \u2192 one token.\n\nBut the string starts with t0, which is part of the 't0 t74...' sequence. So unless there's a way for NT43 to produce t0, which would require NT43 \u2192 t0, but according to the rules, NT43 has two options: either 't40' or NT83 NT77.\n\nSo unless there's a rule where NT43 can produce t0 via some chain, but looking through the rules, it doesn't seem so. All the other non-terminals are defined in terms of other NTs, but t0 is only directly produced by NT82.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe the string isn't correctly formed because the number of tokens should be even, but it's odd. Let's see.\n\nThe entire string has 5 tokens: t0, t74, t36, t42, t33.\n\nIf S expands to NT43 NT61, then each of these NTs would generate some number of tokens. Let me assume that each NT is expanded fully.\n\nFor NT43:\n\nPossibly, NT43 can be expanded to NT83 NT77. Now, NT83 can expand to 't27' or 't47'. Let's see:\n\nIf NT83 \u2192 't27' (one token), then NT77 \u2192 't42' (another token). So NT43 \u2192 t27 t42, total two tokens.\n\nThen NT61 \u2192 't33' (one token). So total tokens would be 2 +1 = 3 tokens. But the given string is 5, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT43 expands into more NTs, leading to more tokens.\n\nLet me think about NT43 expanding to NT83 NT77. Suppose NT83 produces 't47' (another t47 token), so NT43 produces 't47 t42' (assuming NT77 becomes 't42'). Then NT43 would produce 't47 t42', which is two tokens. Then NT61 is one"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which I assume are the result of the non-terminals expanding to these terms. So I need to see if there's a parse tree where the root is S, and it expands into the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar's start symbol is S. Looking at the productions, S -> NT43 NT61, which are two non-terminals, meaning that any valid string starting with S must have two parts. So the string we have is just a single sequence of terminals, so perhaps it's the concatenation of the expansion of NT43 and NT61.\n\nBut the string starts with t25, t2, etc. Wait, no, the string is a single sequence of terminals, like t25 t2 t87 etc., so that would correspond to the entire string being a sequence of the two non-terminals, each expanding into their own parts.\n\nSo I think I should parse the string into parts where each non-terminal in the grammar's initial expansion (S -> NT43 NT61) corresponds to a substring.\n\nLet me list the string parts: t25, t2, t87, t27, t21, t3, t42, t74, t36, t42, t33.\n\nWait, that's 11 tokens. Since S produces two non-terminals, each of those would produce at least one symbol, but possibly more, so the total number of symbols in the string would be the sum of the symbols produced by each non-terminal.\n\nSo I need to see if I can split the string into two consecutive parts, each part being the expansion of NT43 and NT61 respectively.\n\nLet me start by looking at NT43 and NT61.\n\nFirst, let's examine NT43. The given productions for NT43 are:\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT43 -> NT83 NT79\nNT43 -> NT86 NT79\nNT43 -> NT27 NT59\nNT43 -> NT28 NT3\nNT43 -> NT45 NT3\nNT43 -> NT3 -> 't82'\nBut then looking, there are several productions. Wait, let's see each production for NT43:\n\n- NT43 can expand into several pairs:\n  1. NT83 NT77\n  2. NT83 NT79\n  3. NT86 NT79\n  4. NT27 NT3\n  5. NT28 NT3\n  6. NT45 NT3\n  7. NT3 -> 't82' (Wait, no, that's for NT3, not NT43. So perhaps the last one is a typo, or I read it wrong. Wait:\n\nLooking back, the grammar is written line by line. The lines for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\n...\nWait, maybe the production for NT43 is also an 't40'? Wait no, let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT43 has several productions, including some that go to 't's:\n\nNT43 -> 't40' (I think that's one production), and others go deeper, like:\n\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the last line is NT43 -> 't40'? Let me check:\n\nThe grammar as given:\n\nNT43 -> 't40'\n\nYes, so NT43 can directly produce 't40', and through other productions like NT43 -> NT83 NT77.\n\nSimilarly, for NT61, it's in the production as S -> NT61, and NT61 \u2192 't33'. So NT61's only option is to produce 't33'.\n\nSo S's expansion will be NT43 NT61, which would produce some t's from NT43, followed by t33.\n\nThe given string ends with t33, so that part is fine. Let me split the string into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT43, and the second is 't33'.\n\nThe entire string is: t25 t2 t87 t27 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33.\n\nSo the second part is just 't33', so that should correspond to NT61. So the first part is t25 t2 t87 t27 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42.\n\nNow, I need to check if this first part can be produced by NT43.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions, it can expand into several structures. Let's see the possible steps.\n\nFirst, possible productions for NT43:\n\n1. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n2. NT43 -> NT83 NT79\n3. NT43 -> NT86 NT79\n4. NT43 -> NT27 NT3\n5. NT43 -> NT28 NT3\n6. NT43 -> NT45 NT3\n7. NT43 -> 't40'\n\nThe direct expansion is 't40', so if the first part is longer than that, it's a sequence of these non-terminals and other terminals.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t25 t2 t87 t27 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42.\n\nHmm, that's 10 tokens. Wait, but NT43 can produce 't40', which would be just one token. Wait, but that's not possible because the first part is 10 tokens, meaning that NT43 must have expanded into a structure that results in 10 terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production step adds more symbols, but each non-terminal expands to a fixed number of symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the NT43's possible derivation. Let me consider the possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the given productions for NT43, the depth varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string with the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the possible way to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the last symbol of the first part, which is t42. So if the first part ends with t42, let's see if there's a production that ends with that.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT21 -> 't6'\n- NT68 -> 't21'\n- NT82 -> 't0'\n- NT74 -> 't74'\n- NT27 -> 't25'\n- NT79 -> 't36'\n- NT86 -> 't82'\n- NT28 -> 't27' 't59' \u2014 no, that's NT28: -> NT27 NT59, which produces 't27' as terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each non-terminal and see how they produce the required tokens.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to try to see if the last symbols can be parsed according to reverse engineering.\n\nLooking at the end of the first part: t42 is produced by which NT?\n\nIn the grammar, the productions that end in t42:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't82' (wait, NT3's productions are: NT3 -> 't82', so no, that's incorrect. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar's non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT3 -> 't82'\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n- Then, for other NTs:\n\nLooking for any production that ends with t42. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT producing t42 directly. Except maybe via other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake, maybe some NTs produce t42 as a terminal.

Oh, but wait, perhaps via two NTs.\n\nWait, I need to see if any NT can produce a sequence that ends with t42.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT which directly produce t42.

So the first step is to split the string into two parts that correspond to NT43 and NT61. \n\nI should list the string as a sequence: t25, t2, t82, t27, t21, t3, t42, t74, t36, t42, t33.\n\nNow, let's see where each substring could connect.

From the given productions, NT43 has two options: either NT83 NT77 or it can produce the terminal 't40' or 't43' (though the last line seems to have some duplicates). Wait, in the grammar, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and also earlier it's written as NT43 \u2192 't40' and NT43 \u2192 't42' due to possible duplicates. Hmm, I need to check the exact productions.\n\nLooking back: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and also from the given, the line mentions NT43 -> 't40' and NT43 -> 't42'. So maybe that's an error, but perhaps NT43 can either split into NT83 and NT77 or directly produce a terminal.

I'll check the string:\n\nThe start with t25, which probably comes from NT25, but looking at the grammar, NT25 isn't present. Wait, are there any possibilities for NT25? Let me check the grammar. Actually, the given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So perhaps NT43 is part of S, and I'm seeing the expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let's think differently.\n\nThe string starts with t25, which might be part of a longer chain. Let me see if any non-terminals can produce t25. Looking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 t25, but that's it. So to get t25, we need to have a chain ending in NT27. So, for t25, we need something like ... \u2192 NT27 \u2192 t25.\n\nLooking further, so after NT43 (which is one part of S), the first part is t25. That suggests that NT43 must produce a sequence that starts with t25 or a chain leading to t25. Let's see, what do we have for NT27? NT27 \u2192 t25, so NT27 is the part that can produce t25. But to get NT27, it must come from some NT rule that eventually splits into NT27.\n\nWait, let's consider NT25. Wait, there's no NT25 in the grammar. The closest seems to be NT27 \u2192 t25. So to have t25 in the string, the earlier part of the string must correspond to a derivation that ends up with NT27.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the first part is NT43, which should generate a substring starting with t25, which is derived from NT27, which in turn must be generated by some part of the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions: it can split into NT83 and NT77. So when S produces NT43 NT61, the first step is to consider NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and then NT61 \u2192 t33. So the end of the string is t33, which is covered by NT61 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT43 NT61 \u2192 (NT83 NT77) NT61 \u2192 (NT83 (NT77)) NT61 \u2192 (NT83 (t42)) NT61 \u2192 (something) t33.\n\nBut wait, the string has t25 first, so let me step back. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, S starts with NT43, which can split into NT83 and NT77. \n\nLet's think about the beginning of the string: t25. So, if the first part is t25, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at NT27 \u2192 t25. So, maybe the first part comes from NT43 producing a chain of non-terminals that eventually becomes NT27. How?\n\nLooking at NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nWhat do we know about NT83 and NT77?\n\nNT83 can produce t27 or t47, and NT77 produces t42.\n\nSo, NT83 \u2192 t27 or t47.\n\nNT77 \u2192 t42.\n\nSo, let's assume NT43 splits into NT83 and NT77.\n\nIf NT77 \u2192 t42, then the next step after that would be NT83 \u2192 something.\n\nBut the string begins with t25. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is t25, which would come from NT27, which is derived from another non-terminal.

Let's try to see if we can split the string into two parts that correspond to NT43 and NT61's production.\n\nWait, the string is t25 t2 t82 t27 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33.\n\nLet's perhaps split into two parts, as S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the string must be such that the first part (the first 10 elements) comes from NT43, and the last element (t33) comes from NT61. But given that NT61 \u2192 t33, as per NT61 \u2192 t33.\n\nWait, NT61 produces t33 directly, so that's fine.\n\nSo, the first part must be the substring before t33, which is t25 t2 t82 t27 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42.\n\nThat's 10 elements.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So all the rules here look like that except they sometimes produce a single terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually in this grammar, except for some rules, like NT3 \u2192 't82' or 't87', etc., most rules have two non-terminals on the right side, which is typical for CNF.\n\nThe string we have is a sequence of terminals, all lowercase t's and numbers. The grammar's string starts with S, and every production eventually leads to a terminal, so the entire string should be derived from S.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. The string starts with 't25', so I need to see which production rule leads to 't25'. Looking at the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 't25'. So the leftmost part must come from NT27.\n\n2. Now, looking at where NT27 appears. Checking the rules, NT27 is used in two places: RT43 -> NT83 NT77 and NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3. But wait, in the given grammar, it's actually NT27 -> 't25'. So the leftmost part comes from NT27 \u2192 't25'.\n\n3. Following that, the string after 't25' is 't21 t36'. So after 't25', the next should come from NT21 and then something. Looking at the rules, NT62 \u2192 't21', and also NT21 \u2192 't6'. Hmm, the rule for NT21 is NT21 -> 't6'. So after 't25', the next is 't21', which must come from NT21.\n\n4. Now, after 't21', the next is 't36'. The next production should derive from NT36. Looking for NT36, but actually, looking at the rules, I see NT3 appears in several places. Wait, NT3 has two productions: NT3 \u2192 't82' and NT3 \u2192 't87'. So maybe not NT36. Wait, the string has t36, but the grammar has NT21 \u2192 't6', so after 't21' comes 't6'. But the string after 't21' is 't36', not 't6'. Wait, that might be confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's start from the start symbol S and try to expand it into the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nSo the first part is NT43 and then NT61. Now, let's expand each of these.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 (from the rule NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77). Then, NT83 \u2192 't27' (from NT83 \u2192 't27'), so that's 't27'. Then, NT77 \u2192 't42' (rule NT77 \u2192 't42'), that's 't42'. So the first part is 't27 t42'.\n\nNow, moving to NT61 \u2192 't33' (rule NT61 \u2192 't33'), so the next is 't33'. So after S, we have 't27 t42 t33'. But our target string starts with 't25', so that doesn't match. Hmm, that's not right. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I went the wrong way. Let me try again.\n\nThe string starts with 't25', so let's see which part of the string must come from NT27. Since NT27 \u2192 't25', then the first symbol in the string is 't25', so the production must be NT27. So S must expand to something that starts with NT27.\n\nLooking at where NT27 appears: it's part of rules like NT83 \u2192 NT83 NT77 and NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3, but more importantly, in the productions, NT27 \u2192 't25'. So the first symbol 't25' must come from NT27, meaning that S must derive to a production that eventually leads to NT27. But looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Where are these NT43 and NT61 pointing?\n\nWait, that's a problem. The start symbol S expands into NT43 NT61. So the first symbol must come from NT43. But in our string, the first symbol is 't25' which is NT27. There's no production from NT43 that starts with 't25'. So how is this possible? Did I misunderstand the grammar?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar rules are:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nSo S produces NT43 followed by NT61. The first symbol of any expansion from S must come from NT43. But NT43's only production is NT83 NT77. So the first symbol must come from NT83, then NT77.\n\nWait, but NT83 \u2192 't27' (from NT83 \u2192 NT83 NT77 is a recursion? Or maybe that's a typo. Wait, looking again: the rules list includes NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 and NT83 \u2192 't27'. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nNT83 has two options:\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 't27'\n\nOh, okay, so when we expand NT83, sometimes we get a terminal and sometimes another non-terminal. So the first symbol in the string is 't25', but NT43 expands into NT83 NT77, so the first symbol must come from NT83. But NT83 can either produce 't27' or have a longer expansion.\n\nSo if NT83 \u2192 't27', then the first symbol would be 't27', but in our string it's 't25'. So that doesn't match. Therefore, the expansion must come from the recursive rule where NT83 remains as NT86 NT79.\n\nSo let's try that. NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79, then NT86 \u2192 't82' (from NT86 \u2192 't82'), and NT79 \u2192 't42' (from NT79 \u2192 't42'). So that gives 't82 t42'. But that's not matching the string either, as the string starts with 't25 t21...'.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the order. Let me re-examine.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT43 NT61.\n\nNT43 can expand into NT83 NT77.\n\nSo NT43 becomes NT83 NT77. Then, we need to expand each of these.\n\nNT83 can be either 't27' or another NT rule. So if it's 't27', then after that we have NT77 which can expand into 't42'.\n\nSo starting from S, the first part would be 't27 t42'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't25', so this doesn't match. So either the grammar isn't producing the string, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's another rule for NT43. Looking back: the rules for NT43 are:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought. So Nt43 can produce either NT83 NT77 or 't40'. So that changes things.\n\nWait, so if NT43 has two productions: NT83 NT77 or 't40'. So the first symbol is 't40' (if we choose that production), not 't27'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't25', which isn't 't40', so that doesn't help either. Or wait, does S's expansion go through another rule? But S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so unless there's a way for NT43 and NT61 to produce the start. But NT61 can only expand into 't33', so the second part of S is 't33', which is at the end of the string, which is 't33'. So that would mean the string must end with 't33', which it does.\n\nSo let's see. The string is:\n\nt25 t21 t36 t87 t27 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33\n\nSo it's 1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT9, NT43, etc.) and terminal symbols (like 't25', 't2', etc.). Each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A can be a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string we're evaluating starts with S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to find a derivation from S to the exact string.\n\nLet's start by matching the string's first token to the possible productions starting from S. Looking at the grammar, the only production for S is S -> NT43 NT61. So the first step is to split the string into the two parts corresponding to NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo the string starts with `t25 t2 ...`, which I need to match against NT43 and NT61. Let's process each part.\n\nFor NT43, its productions are:\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> NT40 (terminal)\n\nSo NT43 can be directly matched to 't40' or further split into NT83 and NT77. Looking at the string, the first token after S is `t25 t2`, so I need to split NT43 into two parts. Wait, no, the string is split as `t25 t2 t82 ...`, so perhaps NT43 is split as `t25 t2`, but that doesn't directly match any production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps I should build the parse tree from the bottom up. But since the string is a sequence of terminals, a top-down approach would work, trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the leftmost derivation. Let me list all the non-terminals and their possible productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\n\nStarting with S: S => NT43 NT61.\n\nNow, each of these NTs can be further expanded. Let's process NT43 and NT61 one by one.\n\nFirst, NT43 has two productions:\n1. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n2. NT43 -> 't40' (terminal)\n\nBut in our string, the first part after S is `t25 t2`, which is just two symbols. If I consider NT43 to expand to 't40', that would only produce one terminal, which doesn't fit because we have `t25 t2`. So perhaps NT43 needs to be split into two non-terminals that together produce `t25 t2`.\n\nLooking at NT43's productions, the only options are 't40' or NT83 NT77. So to get `t25 t2`, NT43 must be 't40', but that's a single terminal. Therefore, this doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the structure. Let me see: S -> NT43 NT61. The entire string must be composed of the concatenation of NT43's expansion and NT61's expansion. So the string should be split into two parts, with NT43 expanding into some sequence and NT61 expanding into another.\n\nThe given string is `t25 t2 t82 t42 t6 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33`. Let's see how it can be split into two parts. The leftmost part would come from NT43, and the right part from NT61.\n\nSo, the NT43 part must be the first k tokens, and NT61 must be the remaining tokens.\n\nI need to see if there's some split where NT43 can generate the first part and NT61 the second.\n\nLet's try to see NT43's possible expansions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT43 can be:\n\n- NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n- NT43 -> 't40'\n\nBut in the string, the first token after S is 't25', which is part of NT43's expansion. So if NT43 is split into multiple non-terminals, each of these non-terminals must generate the appropriate tokens.\n\nFor example, if NT43 expands into NT83 NT77, then each of these can further expand. Let's check if NT83 and NT77 can produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT83's productions:\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n\nBut in the string, the first few tokens are 't25 t2 t82 t42...'. So perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should consider that NT43 directly produces 't40', but that would only give one token, which doesn't fit the split into two parts. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all possible ways the string can split between NT43 and NT61. The total number of tokens is 12. Let's imagine possible split points after the first k tokens for NT43 and the rest for NT61.\n\nPossible split points: k=1,2,...,11.\n\nBut considering that NT43 can expand into multiple non-terminals, the number of tokens it produces could be more than one. So maybe the split is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this as a recursive problem, trying to match the string token by token from S.\n\nLet me think about S => NT43 NT61, so the string is the concatenation of NT43's expansion and NT61's expansion. So, the entire string is T = T1 || T2, where T1 is NT43's expansion and T2 is NT61's expansion.\n\nI need to see if there exists a way to split the string into T1 and T2 such that T1 is generated by NT43 and T2 by NT61.\n\nFirst, process NT61.\n\nNT61's productions:\n- NT61 -> 't33'\n\nSo NT61 can directly produce 't33' as a terminal. So the last token in the string is 't33', which matches NT61 -> 't33'. Therefore, T2 must be 't33', so the string must split such that the first 11 tokens are generated by NT43, and the last token is generated by NT61.\n\nSo T1 is `t25 t2 t82 t42 t6 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36` and T2 is 't33'.\n\nNow, can NT43 generate the first 10 tokens?\n\nNT43 can expand in two ways:\n1. NT43 -> 't40'\n2. NT43 -> NT83 NT77\n\nBut generating 10 tokens seems unlikely if it's the direct production, because that would only produce one terminal. So we need to expand NT43 into NT83 NT77, which in turn can expand further.\n\nBut NT83 and NT77 are non-terminals. Let's check their productions.\n\nNT83's productions:\n- NT83 -> NT86 NT79\n- NT83 -> 't47'\n\nIn the string, the first token after NT43 is 't25', but NT83 can produce either NT86 NT79 or 't47'.\n\nBut 't25' doesn't match either, so perhaps this is a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming how the split works.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to think of each non-terminal's possible expansion as a series of steps. Let's try building a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a top-down approach with memoization or recursive descent. But since I'm doing this manually, it's time-consuming.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if any can generate the required tokens.\n\nLooking at NT61, it's easy: it can only produce 't33', so T2 must be 't33'.\n\nSo now, T1 must be `t25 t2 t82 t42 t6 t21 t3 t42 t74 t36`.\n\nNow, NT43's productions are either 't40' or NT83 NT77.\n\nSince T1 has 10 tokens, it's unlikely to be the direct 't40' (which is one token). So it must be NT83 NT77.\n\nNow, NT83 can produce 't47' or NT86 NT79. The first token in T1 is 't25', which doesn't match 't47', so perhaps NT83"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-140","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is `t25 t2 t82 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36`, and I have a bunch of production rules for the grammar. Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal can produce a terminal symbol. Since the start symbol is S, I'll start from there and see if I can derive the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is given by S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the first step is to split the string into two parts that correspond to NT43 and NT61. The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, so each 't' followed by a number is a symbol in the terminal alphabet. So the first thing I need to do is parse the string into parts that correspond to NT43 and NT61.\n\nLet me list out the parts of the string:\n\nt25 t2 t82 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT43 NT61, so the entire string should be the concatenation of NT43 and NT61. So I need to split the string into two parts where the first part is NT43 and the second part is NT61.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see:\n\nNT43 can be derived from NT83 NT77, but NT83 can be either 't47' or 't86 NT79', and NT77 is 't42'. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but maybe I can approach this by building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards from the start. Let me note that the string has 12 symbols, so NT43 \u2192 something and NT61 \u2192 something. Let's split the string into two parts at various points and see if either part fits.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for each non-terminal and see if their productions can match the symbols they produce.\n\nStarting with NT43:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n\nNT77 \u2192 't42'\n\nSo that part is easy. Now, NT83 \u2192 either 't47' or 't86 NT79'.\n\nIf NT83 is 't86 NT79', then we need NT86 and NT79.\n\nLooking at NT86, the production is NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT79.\n\nSo NT86 and NT79: this could get recursive. Let's see, NT82 \u2192 't0' or 't42'.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should approach this more systematically.\n\nGiven the string, let's see if it can be split into two parts, one starting at the beginning and the other starting after that. The first part should be NT43 and the second NT61.\n\nLooking at the possible productions, for NT43, the only production is NT83 NT77. But NT83 can either be 't47' or NT86 NT79. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77, and NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79 or 't47' or 't42'?\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, under NT83, there are two entries:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79 \n\nand \n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nSimilarly, NT86:\n\nNT86 -> NT82 NT79 \n\nand \n\nNT86 -> 't82' \n\nWait, no, looking back, the given grammar has:\n\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\n\nNT83 -> 't47'\n\nWait, is 't47' a terminal or is it 't' followed by 47? Because in the string, all the terminals are like 't25', 't2', etc. So 't47' would be a terminal symbol, but in the string, we don't have such a symbol. Wait, in the string, I don't see 't47' present. Let me check the string again: the string is t25 t2 t82 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36. So none of the letters are 't47'? Hmm, that might be a hint.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So in the grammar, NT83 can produce 't47', but in the string, 't47' isn't present. So perhaps the correct path is the other one, which is NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nSo NT83 becomes NT86 NT79.\n\nThen, NT86\u2192 NT82 NT79, so NT86 and NT79.\n\nNow, let's handle NT82. NT82 can be either 't0' or 't42'. In the string, we have a 't0' at the end. So if NT82 produces 't0', that's one possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if NT82 is 't42', that would give us another symbol in the string.\n\nBut in the string, the last part is 't36', so perhaps 't42' isn't sufficient. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT82 can be 't42', and then the next NT79 can produce some symbols.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step using a recursive approach.\n\nThe first symbols are t25, t2, t82, t42, t6, t21, t25, t87, t42, t74, t36.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is NT43 and NT61.\n\nSo NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 is 't42', so that's simple.\n\nThen NT83. It can be either 't47' or NT86 NT79.\n\nSince 't47' is not in the string, perhaps it's NT86 NT79.\n\nSo NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nThen, NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT79.\n\nSo now we have:\n\nNT83: NT86, NT79\n\nNT86: NT82, NT79\n\nNow, let's split the string into parts. The first part is t25, t2, t82, t42, t6, t21, t25, t87, t42, t74, t36.\n\nWait, but when S splits into NT43 and NT61, so NT43 is the first part, and NT61 is the second. Maybe the splitting is after the first NT43 and before the next NT61.\n\nSo for the NT43 part: NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nSo from the string, the first symbols would be the production of NT43. Let's see how much of the string is used in producing NT83 and NT77.\n\nNT77 is 't42', so that's one symbol.\n\nThen NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nSo that would take up two more symbols: 't86' and 't79'?\n\nWait, but in the string, after t25, the next symbols are t2, t82, etc. That seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen S \u2192 NT43 NT61, the entire string should be the concatenation of NT43 and NT61. So the string should start with NT43's symbols and then continue with NT61's symbols.\n\nSo, for NT43, which is NT83 NT77.\n\nNT77 is 't42', so that's one symbol. Then NT83 is either 't47' (which is not present) or NT86 NT79.\n\nIf it's NT86 NT79, then that would take two symbols: NT86 and NT79.\n\nBut what are the productions for NT86 and NT79?\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT79.\n\nSo NT86 splits into NT82 and NT79.\n\nThen, NT79 \u2192 't36'.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT79.\n\nNT79 \u2192 't36'.\n\nSo for NT83 NT77, the symbols would be:\n\nNT83: (NT86: (NT82, NT79): ( 't42' ), NT77: 't42' )\n\nWait, no, NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is provided, and the string I need to evaluate is `t25 t21 t36 t87 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens to unpack.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that all production rules be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions fit this structure: each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's a Type 2 grammar. The language it generates is a context-free language. Now, to determine if \"t25 t21 t36 t87 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33\" is in this language, I'll need to see if a leftmost derivation can produce this string.\n\nThe first thing I should note is that in a leftmost derivation, at each step, the leftmost non-terminal is replaced by the right-hand side of the applicable production. Since the start symbol is S, we'll start from S and try to reach the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are all terminals: t25, t21, t36, etc. So, the initial productions must start with S and expand into these terminals through a series of rules.\n\nLet me look at the productions again:\n\n- S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n- NT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\n- NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\n- NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\n- NT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\n- NT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\n- NT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\n- NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\n- NT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\n- NT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\n- NT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\n- NT61 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't82'\n- NT43 \u2192 't40'\n- NT3 \u2192 't87'\n- NT29 \u2192 't42'\n- NT77 \u2192 't42'\n- NT27 \u2192 't25'\n- NT68 \u2192 't21'\n- NT0 \u2192 't42'\n- NT56 \u2192 't27'\n- NT16 \u2192 't3'\n- NT59 \u2192 't2'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't47'\n- NT82 \u2192 't0'\n- NT76 \u2192 't74'\n- NT21 \u2192 't6'\n- NT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nI should probably trace a possible derivation starting from S.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT43 NT61\n\nSo S starts with NT43 and NT61. Let's look at both.\n\nFirst, NT43: From the productions, NT43 can be NT83 NT77 or 't40'. But 't40' isn't in the string, so it's likely NT83 and NT77.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t25, which is from NT27. Let's see how we get to NT27.\n\nWait, the first token is t25. Let's look for a production that starts with t25. From the productions, NT27 \u2192 't25'. So, if some non-terminal resolves to NT27, which then resolves to 't25'.\n\nSo looking back at S's expansion: S \u2192 NT43 NT61. Let's see how NT43 and NT61 can resolve.\n\nLooking at NT43: It can be either NT83 NT77 or 't40'. Since 't40' is a terminal, but our string starts with t25, we need to go through NT83 and NT77.\n\nLet's see NT83: It can be NT86 NT79 or 't27' or 't47'.\n\nFrom the string, the first token is t25. To get t25, the path must go through NT27, so maybe let's see how NT83 can resolve to something that includes NT27.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT61 is resolved first. NT61 \u2192 't33'. So if NT61 is a terminal, that would produce 't33' as the second token. But the string starts with t25, which is not 't33'. So, that suggests that NT61 can't be the immediate expansion. Hmm, perhaps I'm making this more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So the first part is NT43 and the second is NT61. If NT43 starts with t25, then perhaps NT43 can be expanded further.\n\nWait, NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. That's the first expansion. So S becomes NT83 NT77 NT61.\n\nNow, let's expand NT83 next in a leftmost way. NT83 can be 't27', 't47', or from the production NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79.\n\nSo, to get t25, let's see if NT83 can produce t25. But looking at the productions, NT83 can only go to 't27', 't47', or NT86 NT79. So, perhaps we need to expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider NT83's expansion leading to more non-terminals: NT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79. Then, NT86 can be NT82 NT76. So, S becomes NT86 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNow, NT86 is NT82 NT76. So, S becomes NT82 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNT82 can be NT62 NT0. So, S becomes NT62 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32. So, S becomes NT45 NT32 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3. S becomes NT28 NT3 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59. So, S becomes NT27 NT59 NT3 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNT27 \u2192 't25'. So, NT27 becomes 't25'. Now, the string starts with t25, which matches the first token.\n\nSo, now the expansion is 't25' NT59 NT3 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNext, let's process NT59. NT59 can be NT68 NT79 or 't2'. The string's next token is t21, so perhaps we can proceed.\n\nWait, NT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79 or 't2'. But the next token is t21, which isn't 't2', so let's expand NT59 to NT68 NT79.\n\nS becomes 't25' NT68 NT79 NT3 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNow, NT68 \u2192 't21'. So that becomes 't25' 't21' NT79 NT3 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nNext, the string's next token after t21 is t36. Let's see where that comes from.\n\nNow, proceeding to NT79. NT79 can be NT76 and NT21? Wait, checking the productions: NT79 \u2192 't36' or from NT27, but looking again, I see:\n\nWait, looking back at my list, I have NT79 \u2192 't36'. So, perhaps NT79 can be expanded to 't36', which would be the next token.\n\nSo, S becomes 't25' 't21' 't36' NT3 NT0 NT76 NT79 NT77 NT61.\n\nHmm, that's matching the string so far: t25 t21 t36.\n\nNow, the next token in the string is t87.

{"custom_id":"request-156","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT9, NT43, etc.) and the rules define how they can be rewritten. The terminals are strings that appear in the rules, such as 't25', 't21', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t25 t21 t36 t82 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33`.\n\nFirst, I should note that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two terminals and a non-terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, so the string must derive from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, according to the given grammar, S \u2192 NT43 NT61. So, the string must be derived from NT43 and NT61, which means the string is a concatenation of the sequences generated by NT43 and NT61.\n\nLet me split the string into parts that correspond to these two non-terminals. The string has 14 tokens, so I'll check if the first half can be generated by NT43 and the second half by NT61, but I need to see how the productions work.\n\nWait, actually, the string is split between NT43 and NT61 when derived. So I need to check if the first part of the string can be derived by NT43 and the second part by NT61.\n\nLet me look at the productions again:\n\nLooking at NT43, the rules are:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT27 \u2192 NT25 (Wait, in the given grammar, NT27 \u2192 t25. Oh, right, so production for NT27 is to terminal t25, not another non-terminal. So that's a terminal, which is t25.\n\nSo, starting with NT43:\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77 \u2192 NT83 (which can go to NT86 NT79) and NT77 can go to NT79 (since NT77 \u2192 NT72? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have mislooked. Let me re-express the grammar steps more carefully.\n\nWait, the given grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT43 NT61\nNT9 \u2192 NT68 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT68 NT79\nNT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT28 \u2192 NT27 NT59\nNT62 \u2192 NT45 NT32\nNT45 \u2192 NT28 NT3\nNT56 \u2192 NT29 NT21\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT3\nNT86 \u2192 NT82 NT76\nNT82 \u2192 NT62 NT0\nNT32 \u2192 NT56 NT9\nNT61 \u2192 't33'\nNT3 \u2192 't82'\nNT43 \u2192 't40'\nNT3 \u2192 't87'\nNT29 \u2192 't42'\nNT77 \u2192 't42'\nNT27 \u2192 't25'\nNT68 \u2192 't21'\nNT0 \u2192 't42'\nNT56 \u2192 't27'\nNT16 \u2192 't3'\nNT59 \u2192 't2'\nNT83 \u2192 't27'\nNT83 \u2192 't47' (this is an additional production for NT83 that I didn't notice earlier)\nNT82 \u2192 't0'\nNT76 \u2192 't74'\nNT21 \u2192 't6'\nNT79 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, so for NT83, there are two productions: one leading to t27, and another to t47.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate the string step by step by tracing the possible derivation.\n\nLet's break the string into the order of tokens and see if we can match them.\n\nThe string is: t25 t21 t36 t82 t42 t6 t21 t25 t87 t42 t74 t36 t42 t33\n\nI think it's better to process the string from left to right, matching each token to the appropriate productions.\n\nStarting with NT43 and NT61.\n\nFirst token is t25, which is the terminal for NT27. So in NT43's expansion, NT83 and NT77. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77.\n\nNow, NT83 can go to nt86 nt79 or t27 t47.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT83's rules are:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 NT47 (which is t47 as a terminal)\n\nSo, for NT83, it can produce either NT86 and NT79, or t47.\n\nIn our string, the first token is t25, which is from NT27. So to get t25, we need NT27. So in the derivation, NT83 must produce t25, which is only possible via NT83 \u2192 t47, but wait, t27 is 't25'. No, wait, NT27 is a non-terminal that produces t25. So in the string, we have t25 as the first token. So in our string, the first token is t25, which is the production of NT27.\n\nSo looking back, we have NT43 \u2192 NT83 NT77. Let's consider that NT83 must produce t25 (which is NT27's production as t25). So in the derivation, NT83 \u2192 t25 would require that NT83 somehow, but looking at NT83's rules, it doesn't directly produce t25. It can only produce t47, which is another terminal.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Wait, NT27 is a rule in the grammar: NT27 \u2192 t25. So the terminal t25 is the result of NT27.\n\nBut in the production of NT83, can it directly produce t25? Looking back, the NT83 rules are:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 t47\n\nWait, so NT83 doesn't directly produce t25. So then where does t25 come from?\n\nAh, perhaps the non-terminal that leads to t25 is NT27, so somewhere in the derivation chain, we must derive NT27 and it becomes t25.\n\nSo in the production of NT83, we need a way to reach t25, but seems that through NT86 and NT79, but that might lead to other tokens. Alternatively, perhaps NT83 can produce t47, but that's a different terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps we made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rules for NT83 are:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 NT47 (which is a terminal).\n\nWait, in the first list, under the grammar, the productions include:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT86 NT79\nNT83 \u2192 NT47 (maybe that's a way to get 't47'? But our string has 't25' as first token, which is different.)\n\nWait, actually, under the grammar, the terminal usages, for instance:\n\nNT83 \u2192 t27 (from another rule), no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar in the problem lists:\n\nLooking at the given grammar in the problem statement, the lines are:\n\nNT43 \u2192 t40\nNT3 \u2192 t82\nNT43 \u2192 t40 (duplicate?)\n\nWait, the problem statement gives:\n\nHere is the grammar:\n\nS -> NT43 NT61\nNT9 -> NT68 NT16\nNT59 -> NT68 NT79\nNT43 -> NT83 NT77\nNT83 -> NT86 NT79\nNT28 -> NT27 NT59\nNT62 -> NT45 NT32\nNT45 -> NT28 NT3\nNT56 -> NT29 NT21\nNT16 -> NT27 NT3\nNT86 -> NT82 NT76\nNT82 -> NT62 NT0\nNT32 -> NT56 NT9\nNT61 -> 't33'\nNT3 -> 't82'\nNT43 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't87'\nNT29 -> 't42'\nNT77 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
