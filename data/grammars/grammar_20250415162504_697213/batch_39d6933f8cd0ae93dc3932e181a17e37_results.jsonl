I'm a bit new to this, so I'll start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. It doesn't have any epsilon productions or long right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that all the start symbols (S, NT18, NT5, etc.) have productions that consist of either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate whether it's generated by the grammar. The string is \"t55\". Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because each production either results in two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is \"t55\". Since it's a single string, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, the string consists of two terminals: 't55'. Wait, but in the grammar provided, each production produces at most two non-terminals, maybe I should check if 't55' can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the start symbol in the grammar is S. S is \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the start production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. To get 't55', I need to derive it from these two non-terminals. So, I need to figure out if NT18 can produce 't' followed by something, and NT42 can produce 't55', or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's start by mapping the NTs. For example, looking at NT42 in the grammar, I see it can be \u2192 't27'. So wait, in the grammar, NT42 has a production to 't27'. Similarly, looking at NT18, one of its productions is NT23 and NT57. So NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nBut wait, I'm trying to match this to the string. Let me see: the string is \"t55\", which has two parts, 't5' and 't5'. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, \"t55\" is just two terminals: 't' followed by '55'? Or is it 't' followed by '55' as a single symbol? No, each is a separate symbol. So, it's 't' followed by '55', making the entire string \"t55\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the way it's presented. Each 't' followed by a number is a separate terminal. So, \"t55\" would be 't', '5', '5'? No, wait, in the string \"t55\", 't' is one terminal, then '55' would be another. Or is it a single symbol 't55'? No, usually, each symbol is a single character. So, probably, 't55' is made up of three terminals: 't', '5', '5'? But in the problem, it's presented as \"t55\", so maybe it's 't' followed by '55' as a single terminal? That's unclear, but perhaps I should consider each character as separate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the start symbol S can produce. S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, for the string \"t55\", S would have to produce two non-terminals that in turn produce \"t\" and then \"55\". But that might not make sense because each step produces non-terminals, which only turn into terminals through their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see if either NT18 or NT42 can directly produce 't55', but looking at the productions, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't55'. Let me look through the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, some NTs have productions with 't' as the first symbol. For example, NT42 \u2192 't27', but 't27' is not a terminal. 't27' is a terminal symbol because in the grammar, NT42 is a terminal. Wait, no, NT42 is a non-terminal, right? Because in the given rules, some are of the form A \u2192 BC. So, I think I'm mixing up between NTs (non-terminals) and actual terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map all the NTs to what they produce. Let's see, some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT42 \u2192 't27', NT27 \u2192 't42', etc. So, I think that the NTs eventually produce individual terminals, each as a single symbol. So, for example, if NT42 \u2192 't27', then when that non-terminal is expanded, it results in the terminal symbol 't27', which is a single terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, 't55' is two characters: 't' and '5', so the terminal is 't' followed by '55'? Or is the string 't' followed by '55' as separate symbols? I think that in the question, the string is given as the literal 't55', meaning 't' followed by '55', so two separate terminals, each 't' and '55'? But that's not typical because in most case ins, symbols are individual characters. But maybe in this case, it's allowed.\n\nWait, but each NT can only produce a single symbol, so to get 't55', we'd need to have a non-terminal that produces 't55', which I don't see. Looking at the grammar, all the productions are either two NTs or a single terminal. So, for example, NT42 can produce 't27', which is a single terminal. So, to produce 't55', we need some NT that directly produces 't55', but looking through all rules, I don't see any NT that directly does that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can have a sequence where one NT produces 't' and another produces '55', connected with some other NT. But let's think about how the derivations work.\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, to generate the string, we need to expand NT18 and NT42 into terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at NT18, one of its productions is \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT49. NT49 is a terminal. Wait, NT26 has another production: \u2192 NT28 NT50. So let's follow one path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to find if 't55' can be generated step by step. Let's see:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, to get a string of two terminals, each must come from NT18 and NT42 expanding.\n\nLet's check NT42: NT42 has a production \u2192 't27', which is a terminal. So NT42 can produce the terminal symbol 't27'. So if NT42 is expanded, it becomes 't27'. So, in that case, to get 't55', I need the other NT, NT18, to produce 't55' as well, but I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, let me check if NT18 can produce 't' followed by '55'. Let's look at NT18's rules: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Now, NT23's rules: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 can be \u2192 NT28 NT49 or \u2192 NT28 NT50. Let's pick one path.\n\nFor example, NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT49. NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40. NT40 is a terminal. Wait, NT40 is \u2192 't6'. So NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40 \u2192 ... Let's see. So that would produce the terminal 't4' and 't6' connected? But wait, no, since each step is a production, so NT28 can be expanded as either of its rules. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's try tracing this. Starting from S, let's see if we can reach any 't' symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Let's expand NT42 \u2192 't27' as that's a terminal. So, one part is 't27'. Now, the other part is NT18, which is \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNow, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 can be \u2192 NT28 NT49 or \u2192 NT28 NT50. Let's take the first: NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT49. NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40. Now, NT4 \u2192 't9' (from the rules: NT4 \u2192 't9' (I think earlier I wrote differently, but let me check the provided rules)).\n\nWait, looking back, yes: NT4 \u2192 't9'. NT40 \u2192 't6', as per the rules. So, NT28 \u2192 't9' 't6' as the two symbols."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-19","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the string \"t28 t7\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar produces. Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically requires each production rule to have two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. The given grammar has several production rules, some of which produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the string \"t28 t7\", I notice it's made up of two tokens: 't28' and 't7'. In the grammar, each non-terminal can either produce another non-terminal pair or a terminal. So, to get 't28' and 't7', I need two production rules that directly produce these terminals.\n\nI see that in the grammar, there's a rule NT2 -> 't28'. That's one part. But to get 't7', is there a rule that produces 't7' directly? Looking through the list, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't7' as a terminal. The closest is NT51 -> 't7', but that requires NT51 to produce 't7', but then NT51 must be derived from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a way to derive 't7'. Let's see if 't7' can be generated. Looking at the rules, NT51 -> 't7', but to get NT51, what's its production? Checking the rules, NT51 doesn't seem to have a production; it's only on the left side of a production. So maybe I need to see if there's a way to reach NT51 via other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I can work backwards. For the string to end with 't7', the last symbol must come from a production that has 't7' on the right. So, the only way is if there's a rule that directly produces 't7', which is NT51 -> 't7', so we need to have NT51 derived somewhere.\n\nBut how do I get NT51? Looking at the grammar, the left-hand sides are all non-terminals, and there's no production that directly produces NT51. Hmm, wait, maybe NT51 can be derived from another non-terminal. Looking at the rules, perhaps NT51 is on the right side of another rule.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules again, I see NT2-> 't28', which is one part. For 't7', NT51->'t7'. So, the string is t28 followed by t7, which corresponds to NT2 followed by NT51. So the overall derivation would need to end with NT2 and NT51. But then, these non-terminals must be derived from the start symbol through productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Let's see how S is produced. S -> NT18 NT42. So, S is the start, and it splits into NT18 and NT42. Then, each of those can be further split.\n\nLooking at NT18, the production is NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 has a production: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. NT26 is NT26 -> NT27 NT58, which then splits. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should look for a way to derive t28 and t7 step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nThen NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT42 can be several things. Looking at the rules for NT42, there are two productions: NT42 -> NT4 NT13 and NT42 -> 't27'. But in our string, after 't28', we have 't7', so we need to see if after 't28', the next production can be 't7'. But looking at the rules, it seems that 't28' is produced by NT2, but after that, the NT42 which is part of NT2's production in S (S \u2192 NT18 NT42) would have to be further split, but in our string, after 't28' comes 't7', so maybe NT42 is not the one producing 't27' directly because S is part of two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. If we take S as NT18 NT42, then each of those can be split further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see if 't28' is directly produced by any non-terminal and 't7' is directly produced by another non-terminal, and whether these non-terminals can be part of a derivation from S.\n\nLooking at the production rules, 't28' is directly produced by NT2, so to get 't28', I need NT2 to be a part of the derivation. 't7' is directly produced by NT51.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is built by a sequence of non-terminals that ultimately produce these terminals. Let's think about how to get NT2 and NT51.\n\nStarting with S, it's NT18 NT42. NT18 is NT23 NT57, and NT42 can be NT4 NT13 or 't27'. But in our case, the first symbol after S is 't28', which comes from NT2, so maybe the path through S divides into NT18 and NT42, but maybe NT18 leads to NT2 somehow, but looking at the productions for NT18: NT18-> NT23 NT57, so that's more non-terminals. Maybe this is not the right path.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if the entire string can be formed by leftmost or rightmost derivations. Let's try to see if t28 is a leaf in a leftmost derivation or the rightmost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too short or not possible because 't7' can't be generated because NT51 can't be derived from S.\n\nAnother thing: Let's check if the productions can generate 't7'. Looking at the grammar, the only way to get 't7' is from NT51 -> 't7'. So, to derive t7, we need NT51 in the string, which comes from the production NT51. But in the grammar, NT51 is on the right side of production NT56 -> NT10 NT51, but there's no production for NT51 except as the left side. So NT51 can't be derived from anything else; it's stuck. Therefore, NT51 can't be a non-terminal unless it's at the top level, but since S is the start, the top level can't generate NT51 because there's no production that starts with NT51.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, NT51 is never used as a start symbol, and it's never derived from anything else. Therefore, NT51 can't be part of any string, meaning that the string 't7' can't be generated because the only way to get 't7' is via NT51, which can't be formed.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t28 t7\" can't be generated because 't7' can't be produced by any rule except NT51, which isn't reachable from the start symbol S.\n\nSo the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string I need to evaluate is \"t40 t49 t9\". \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where each non-terminal is rewritten into two non-terminals, right? So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and we have start symbols that eventually derive into terminal symbols. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems each NT (non-terminal) has rules that break down into two other non-terminals until we hit terminals like 'tX', which are the actual characters in the string. The string I'm evaluating is \"t40 t49 t9\". \n\nI think the approach here is to try and derive this string starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and from the rules, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S expands into NT18 and NT42. \n\nSo, let's break it down step by step. \n\n1. Start with S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n   So, we now have NT18 and NT42 to derive.\n\n2. Next, let's see what NT18 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.

So, NT26 splits into NT27 and NT54.\n\n5. Then, NT54 \u2192 t33. So, one of the terminals comes in: t33.\n\n   Now, the remaining parts are NT27 and NT54.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

But in the rules, NT42 can expand into 't27', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, so let's go step by step.\n\nBut maybe I should track each production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the given string \"t40 t49 t9\" and see if it's possible to derive this.\n\nEach 't' is a terminal, so we need to see if these ts can come from the non-terminals through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: 40, 49, 9.\n\nLet me check which non-terminals can produce these ts.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t40 (Yes, rule: NT5 \u2192 t40)\n- NT4 \u2192 t9 (Yes, rule: NT4 \u2192 t9)\n- NT49 \u2192 t45 (Wait, but 49 here is a non-terminal producing t45, not t49. Hmm. Wait, no, the string has t49. So that's a problem.)\n\nWait, no, looking again: The terminals are t40, t49, t9.\n\nSo looking at the rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT26 \u2192 t49\n- NT8 \u2192 t47 (but 47 isn't in the string)\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- So, for t49, which rule produces it? Looking at the rules, NT26 \u2192 t49 (from NT26's rule: NT26 \u2192 t49 NT45. Or wait, no. Let's look again.\n\nWait, the rules:\n\nNT26 \u2192 t49 NT45\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT26 is derived from t49 and NT45. And NT45 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo, to produce t49, we need NT26.\n\nSimilarly, t40 is produced by NT5.\n\nt9 is produced by NT4.\n\nSo, the string \"t40 t49 t9\" would correspond to a sequence of NT5, NT26, and NT4.\n\nBut let's reconstruct the derivation path.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\n2. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\n3. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\n4. NT26 \u2192 t49 NT45\n\n   Now, NT45 \u2192 t10\n\n   So, NT26 \u2192 t49 t10\n\n   So, \"t49 t10\"\n\n5. Now, we have to derive the other part: NT42\n\n   NT42 \u2192 't27' (since one of its rules is NT42 \u2192 t27.\n\n   Wait, but looking at the rules, NT42 can be multiple things. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 t27 (Yes, one of the rules is NT42 \u2192 't27'.

So, the derived string would be \"t49 t10 t27\", which is different from the given string.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because we're getting t49 and t10 and t27, but the target is t40, t49, t9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in choosing the production paths.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Maybe the production of NT18 can branch differently.\n\nWait, the first step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 can go to NT23 NT57 or another rule. Wait, no, looking back: NT18's rules are NT23 NT57. So that's the only option, right?\n\nSo NT18 must produce NT23 and NT57.\n\nThen NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So that's fixed.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t49 NT45.\n\nNT45 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo, the first part is t49 t10.\n\nNow, NT42 \u2192 t27.\n\nSo the derived string is t49 t10 t27.\n\nBut our target is t40 t49 t9.\n\nSo, there's a mismatch here.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that after t49, other ts are added. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe the NT23 branch leads to something else. Is there another production for NT23 beyond NT26 NT54?\n\nLooking at the rules, I think no. The only rule for NT23 is NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, am I missing something? Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any other production for NT23. So, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nWhich then gives t49 t10 and then t27.\n\nSo, perhaps this path can't produce t40. Since t40 is in NT5, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, what's the way to include t40 in the string?\n\nPerhaps, maybe we can have another production earlier on.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nIs there a way to have NT18 produce something else? No,NT18 only goes to NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT23 goes to NT26 NT54.\n\nNT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo, that's fixed as well.\n\nThen NT26 would go to t49 NT45, which gives t49 t10.\n\nThen NT45 is t10.\n\nSo, perhaps this part is fixed, and the first part of the string is t49 t10, which doesn't match t40.\n\nThus, in order to have t40 in the string, maybe another path is needed.\n\nWait, but t40 is produced by NT5.

For example:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27' (twice)\n- NT43 \u2192 't38' (twice), 't33', 't57'\n- NT45 \u2192 't10'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n- NT57 \u2192 't31'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT51 \u2192 't7'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT2 -> 't28' (twice)\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't11' (twice)\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\nOther rules might produce more, but focusing on terminals, I can list these.\n\nNow, the string is three tokens: t12, t33, t43.\n\nWe need to see if there's a way to produce this sequence through the grammar.\n\nLet's see if any non-terminals can produce these. For example, does any rule directly produce t12, t33, t43?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' (not t12)\n- NT26 \u2192 't49' (not t33)\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' (not t33)\n- NT36 \u2192 't48' (not t33)\n- NT38 \u2192 't53' (not t33)\n- NT40 \u2192 't6' (not t33, t43)\n- NT42 \u2192 't27', 't4' (twice)\n- NT43 \u2192 't38', 't33', 't57'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n- NT38 again. \n\nSo, looking for possible t33, it's produced by NT43, NT54, and others. t43 is produced by NT26 \u2192 't49'? No, wait. Oh, wait NT43 \u2192't57'? No, that would produce t57. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at all rules for terminals:\n\nLooking for t12:\n\n- None. The rules listed don't produce t12. Wait, the rules are provided, and looking through, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't12'. Hmm, that's an issue because our string starts with t12, but if no non-terminal directly produces t12, then it's impossible to derive t12 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let's check the productions again carefully. The user provided a list:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27', 't4' \u2192 no, NT42 is broken into two parts each time. Wait, no, each production for NT42 branches into two terms, e.g., NT42 \u2192 NT54 NT41.\n\nWait, no, I might be miscalculating. The rules are in the form S \u2192 NT18 NT42, etc. Then NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, etc., down to some NT -> 'something'.\n\nWait, for example, NT42 can produce either NT54 and NT41, or 't27', or 't4', or others. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT42 has several options:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT22 \u2192 NT54 NT53\n- etc., perhaps. Alternatively, some directly produce t27 and t4.\n\nWait, looking:\n\nLooking back, the user wrote the productions in a list:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT54 NT41\nNT22 \u2192 NT54 NT53\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\netc. So, looking specifically, NT42 has two productions:\n\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT22 NT27\nWait, but actually, in the user's list, perhaps:\n\nLooking again, I think the rules were listed as:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 -> 't28'?\n\nWait, no, let me parse the user's given grammar correctly. The grammar is written in multiple lines, but with tabs and maybe incorrect formatting.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a list of lines, starting with S, then NT5, NT22, etc., each line either being a production for a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT22 -> NT29 NT9\nWait, maybe I got the structure wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-45","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t53 t27 t36 t55`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has the form where each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit this: each production on the left side has exactly two parts separated by '->', and all the rules except the terminals have non-terminals on either side.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating has four tokens: `t53`, `t27`, `t36`, `t55`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the given production rules.\n\nI'll need to check if each of these tokens can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Maybe I should list out the non-terminals and see their productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the productions, the starting symbol is S, which directly expands to NT18 NT42. So, the first step would be to derive the string starting with NT18 followed by NT42. \n\nSo, the string starts with `t53`, which is one of the terminals, and the first rule that produces `t53` is NT38. Wait, checking the grammar, yes, NT38 -> 't53', so NT38 can produce `t53`. But according to the left-hand side of the production for NT38, it's actually NT36 -> 't38'. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the productions include NT38 -> 't53'. So NT38 can be replaced by `t53`. Now, looking at where NT38 appears, it's in NT27's production: NT27 -> NT42 NT43, but there's another NT38 production under NT5: NT5 -> NT23 NT57, wait no, actually I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me systematically go through each non-terminal and see their possible productions and which terminals they can produce.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT18 NT42. So the first two non-terminals we need to derive are NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So to get NT18, we need NT23 followed by NT57. The terminal corresponding to NT57 is 't53', which is the first token in the string. So for NT18 to produce `t53`, we need NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23's production is NT26 NT54. So NT23 needs to expand into NT26 and NT54. The terminal 't54' corresponds to NT54 (from NT54's production: NT54 -> 't54'). So that's good. So now, from NT23, we can get `t54`.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Because NT23 is a non-terminal, so to get up the tree, it needs to be expanded into NT26 and NT54. NT54 then needs to expand into 't54', which isn't part of our string. But wait, our string starts with `t53`, which is NT38, so maybe I'm not looking in the right place.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each token in the string and see if it can be derived.\n\nThe string is `t53 t27 t36 t55`.\n\nLet's process each token one by one:\n\n1. `t53`: How is this derived? Looking at the grammar, NT38 -> 't53'. So NT38 can produce `t53`. But where does NT38 appear in the grammar? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT38 -> 't53'. So that's correct. So `t53` comes from NT38.\n\n2. Next token is `t27`. Which non-terminal produces `t27`? Let's see. The productions that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT27 -> 't22' (Wait, no. Wait, checking NT27: NT27 -> NT42 NT43, and NT42 can produce 't27' as seen above. Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, looking at the list:\n\nNT27's production: NT27 -> NT42 NT43. So NT27 can't produce `t27` directly. Let me check other NTs.\n\nLooking at NT22, production: NT22 -> NT29 NT36 (Wait, maybe I'm mixing NT22 with other NTs). Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at each terminal and see which NT produces it:\n\n- 't10' is produced by NT2 and NT53.\n- 't11' by NT10, NT8, etc.\n- 't12' by NT13, NT26.\n- 't18' by NT23, etc.\n- 't27' is produced by NT42, according to the production NT42 -> 't27'.\n- 't28' by NT8, NT40, etc.\n- 't36' by NT38, NT53.\n- 't38' by NT36, NT47.\n- 't43' by NT27, NT45.\n- 't53' by NT38, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, after `t53`, comes `t27`. So the second token is `t27`, which must come from NT42. Because NT42 -> 't27'.\n\nSo how is NT42 derived? Looking at NT42's productions:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT42 -> NT54 NT41\nNT42 -> other combinations, but in our case, to produce `t27`, that must be from the production NT42 -> 't27', but wait, NT42 can directly produce 't27' only via NT42 -> 't27'. But in the grammar, is that the case? Let me check the given rules.\n\nLooking back: \"NT42 -> 't27'\". Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look again:\n\nIn the given grammar list, I see several rules for NT42, but nowhere is it listed as NT42 -> 't27'. Instead, the rule is NT42 -> NT27 NT55. Wait no, that's not correct. Let me list all the NT42's productions:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, I'll extract NT42's productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 nt38\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> NT54 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT58 nt42\n- NT42 -> NT22 nt27\n- So, looking at these, I see that NT42 can be produced by NT22 NT27. So, NT42 does not directly produce 't27'; instead, it can be broken down into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, so in the string, the second token is `t27`, which would need to come from a production that includes `t27`. But according to the productions, NT27 expands to NT42 NT43. So where does `t27` come from?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42. So the string starts with NT18 and NT42.\n\nThe string is `t53 t27 t36 t55`.\n\nSo, the first token is `t53`, which comes from NT38. But where is NT38 in the derivation of NT18?\n\nNT18's production is NT23 NT57. The right-hand side of NT57 is 't53', which matches the first token. So, in the parse tree, NT18 must expand to NT23 and NT57, and NT57 produces 't53'. So that works.\n\nBut wait, how do we get NT57 from NT18? Because NT18 is NT23 NT57. So the first part of the string after the start is derived as NT18 -> NT23 NT57, so the next token comes from NT23, then the next from NT57.\n\nBut the next token is `t27`, which we think comes from NT42, but NT42 is not part of NT18's expansion. Wait, NT18 goes to NT23 NT57, and NT42 is part of the S's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. Since this is a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, I can apply the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm to parse the string.\n\nThe string to parse is `t53 t33 t7 t36`. Let's note that each 't' is immediately followed by a number. Some of these numbers like t53, t33, etc., are terminals because they can't be replaced further. So, I can start by constructing the grammar's parse table to see how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, here are some key points I noticed:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42: So S starts with NT18 and NT42.\n- NT18 can derive t10 or another non-terminal. Looking at NT18's productions, it can go to NT23 and NT57.\n- NT23 can further split into NT26 and NT54, which can then go to various terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on each token and see how they can be derived.\n\nLet's list the tokens:\n\nt53, t33, t7, t36.\n\nLooking at NT42 \u2192 t27, which is terminal, so any production that leads to NT42 must end with t27. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 t33, so that's where t33 comes from.\n\nLooking further, let's see where t53, t33, t7, and t36 come from.\n\nt53 comes from NT38 \u2192 t53, which is terminal. So where does NT38 come from?\n\nLooking at NT38's productions: it can be NT9 and NT51, or NT43 and NT5, or NT53 and NT4. Wait, no, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT38 can be NT9 and NT51, or NT53 and NT4.\n\nWait, let me find NT38's rules. From the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT38 -> NT9 NT51 and NT38 -> NT53 NT4. So NT38 can split into these two.\n\nIf t53 is the result of NT38, then for NT38 to produce t53, it would go through NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. Wait, but NT53's production is NT42 and NT38. That's a direct terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, the production for NT53 is NT42 \u2192 t42? Or is it NT42 \u2192 t27 as per the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT42 \u2192 't27' as one of its productions. So NT42 can only derive t27.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\n1. Let's see what each token corresponds to.\n\n- t53 comes from NT38 \u2192 t53. Specifically, NT38 can go to NT53 and NT4. But NT53's production is NT42 \u2192 t27, so if NT53 goes to NT42, that's t27, not t53. That doesn't align with t53 in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT38 again. From the grammar, the rule is NT38 \u2192 NT53 NT4. So NT38 becomes NT53 and NT4. Now, NT4's productions are multiple: from the grammar, 't9' is possible, as well as other NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I need to track each possibility.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to construct the parse table.\n\nSince the string has four tokens, the parse table will be for that.\n\nLooking for the start symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the entire string must be derived starting from S, which means the first production is NT18 and NT42. But the string begins with t53, which is a terminal. So NT18 must produce something that leads to t53. Let me check NT18's productions.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 can go to NT23 and NT57. Let's see what NT23 and NT57 can produce.\n\nNT23 can be NT26 and NT54. NT26 can be NT49, which is 't49', or another path. Let me see the exact rules. From the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNow, NT26 can go to NT49, which is 't49' and NT54, which can be NT4 ... I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at where t53 comes from. Since t53 is a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that directly produces t53. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. So NT53 produces NT42 and NT38. Then, for NT53 to produce t53, both NT42 and NT38 must produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT42: It has a production 't27', as per the grammar line: NT42 -> 't27'. So if NT42 is to produce t27, that's fixed.\n\nNT38: NT38 can go to NT53 and NT4. Wait, that's a cycle, right? Because NT38 \u2192 NT53 and NT4, which then can lead back to NT38. That would be problematic unless it's handled correctly.\n\nWait, let's see NT38's rules again: NT38 \u2192 NT9 NT51 or NT38 \u2192 NT53 NT4. Oh, right, that's a recursive production.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t53, we have t33, so maybe T33 comes from NT54.\n\nLooking at the string: t53 t33 t7 t36.\n\nt53 comes from NT38, which goes to NT53 and NT4. But NT53 must produce a terminal, which is t53. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the NT38 can produce t53? Let me check NT38: the productions are NT9 NT51 and NT53 NT4. So for NT38 to produce t53, it must first produce NT53, which can produce t53 via... Wait, does NT53 directly go to t53? Or does it go to t42 and t38, which may be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rule for NT53 seems to be: NT53 can go to NT42 NT38, which are two non-terminals. But then, NT42 can produce t27, and NT38 can produce... Hmm, this seems like a loop. Because NT38 can go to NT53 and NT4, which then might go back to NT38.\n\nThis might mean that it's not possible to directly get t53 from NT38, as NT53 leads to another NT38. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the grammar might have a way for NT53 to produce t53. Let me check the exact rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the production for NT53 is NT42 \u2192 t27. Wait\u2014no, that's not NT53. Let me clarify the grammar production.\n\nLooking back, I see that there's a rule NT42 \u2192 't27'. Also, NT38 can go to NT42 and NT38 via NT38 \u2192 NT53 NT4. But wait, it's written as NT38 \u2192 NT53 NT4 or NT38 \u2192 NT53, NT4? No, the line is NT38 \u2192 NT53 NT4. So NT38 is divided into NT53 and NT4.\n\nIf NT53 produces NT42 and NT38, and NT42 can produce t27, while NT38 can produce either NT9 NT51 or NT53 NT4, it seems like this is forming a circular dependency which may not derive to a terminal.\n\nSo, maybe t53 is produced from NT38, which then goes into a cycle and can't reach a terminal. Therefore, it's impossible for t53 to be part of the string. But that contradicts the string given, so perhaps I'm missing a path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace it differently.\n\nLet me see: since the provided string starts with t53, and t53 comes from NT38 \u2192 NT53 NT4.

{"custom_id":"request-68","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t35 t57 t23 t40 t51` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, wait, actually, the string seems to be a sequence of tokens, but I'm not entirely sure. I think in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, and terminals can only appear at the bottom of the derivation. But in this case, the string consists of a bunch of 't' followed by numbers, like 't35', 't57', etc. I should check the grammar to see if these 't's and numbers are terminals or if they're part of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that for example, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. The right-hand side has NT23 and NT57, which are non-terminals. Let me go through each production to see which ones have terminal symbols.\n\nWait, I see some rules where a non-terminal is followed by a 't' and a number. Like NT9 -> 't35', same with NT2 -> 't28', NT42 -> 't42', and so on. So, in the grammar, any non-terminal that has a rule ending with 'tXX' is considered a terminal in the sense that it's a terminal symbol in the language. When generating the string, the leaves of the parse tree would be these terminal symbols.\n\nThe given string is `t35 t57 t23 t40 t51`. So, I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, let's restate the start symbol S. Looking at the start rule, S -> NT18 NT42. So, S is two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. Therefore, in order for the string to be generated, the parse tree must start with NT18 and NT42 being derived into terminal symbols that form the string.\n\nWait, but the string has five tokens. S produces two symbols, so each of those must produce sequences that together make the string. That is, when we parse, each symbol from the S production must expand into a sequence of terminals. So, the string must be the concatenation of what NT18 expands into and what NT42 expands into.\n\nThe given string is five tokens: t35, t57, t23, t40, t51. Let's see if NT18 can produce t35 followed by t57 and then maybe followed by more, but wait, NT18 has a rule: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So, NT18 expands into NT23 and NT57. But NT23 has a production NT26 NT54, right? Wait, let me check the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules for the non-terminals to see how they expand. Let me go through each non-terminal and see their productions:\n\n- S -> NT18 NT42\n- NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT22 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT40\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT58\n- NT28 -> NT43 NT5\n- NT53 -> NT42 NT38\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't42' (Wait, there's another rule for NT42: earlier, it's 't27', and then later another NT42: 't54', etc. So, I think each rule is a separate option.)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. I think I need to list all the productions for each non-terminal so I can see how they can expand. Let me try to create a list for each non-terminal that shows their production rules.\n\nLet me note that the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT1, NT2, etc., up to NT58 and higher. Let's list them:\n\n1. S: NT18, NT42\n2. NT5: NT23, NT47\n3. NT22: NT36, NT53\n4. NT41: NT51, NT45\n5. NT42: NT2, NT38, also 't27', 't42', etc. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the rules are in the form of NTxy -> something or NTxy -> 'txtz'. So, some NTxy rules expand into two non-terminals, others expand into a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given rules, some of them have 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT9 -> 't35', which probably means that NT9 is a terminal. Similarly, NT2 -> 't28', so that non-terminal is a terminal.\n\nBut for the NT42 rule, I see NT42 -> NT2 NT38, NT42 -> 't27', NT42 -> 't54', and so on. Wait, no, let me check: looking back, the grammar has NT42 -> NT2 NT38, then later in the list, another NT42, but actually, the rules are written as separate lines, so I think some rules are in the same non-terminal.\n\nI think maybe the initial list of productions from the user is correct. So, each production is written in the order given. So, for NT42, it has multiple rules:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> 't42' (I think the original user wrote 't54', no, looking back:\n\nLooking again, the user wrote:\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\nNT9 -> 't35'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT42 -> 't27'\nNT43 -> 't57'\nNT45 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't33'\nNT38 -> 't51'\nNT51 -> 't7'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT26 -> 't49'\nNT43 -> 't38'\nNT10 -> 't43'\nNT36 -> 't48'\nNT38 -> 't53'\nNT40 -> 't6'\nNT26 -> 't23'\nNT28 -> 't50'\nNT13 -> 't11'\nNT49 -> 't45'\nNT27 -> 't22'\nNT28 -> 't55'\nNT57 -> 't31'\nNT8 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nNT5 -> 't40'\nNT36 -> 't36'\nNT43 -> 't47'\nNT42 -> 't54'\nNT47 -> 't21'\nNT38 -> 't12'\n\nWait, that's quite extensive. So, some non-terminals have production rules that expand into terminals, others into non-terminals.\n\nSo, now I need to find out which terminal sequences can be generated by each of these non-terminals.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFirst, S is the start symbol, leading to NT18 and NT42. So, each of these must expand into a sequence of terminals. Let's evaluate what NT18 and NT42 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is a set of production rules where each non-terminal (on the left side) is replaced by two other non-terminals (on the right side), except for the terminals. Wait, actually, looking closer, some of the right-hand sides have terminals, like 't47', 't40', etc. So, the grammar is not purely in CNF because CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I should check that.\n\nWait, no, the standard CNF allows productions to be A \u2192 a where a is a single terminal, but perhaps in this case, the rule is that all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which is still acceptable for CNF but sometimes it's strictly two non-terminals. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, that's two non-terminals. NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, where NT23 is a non-terminal and NT47 is a terminal? Wait no, in the production rules, NT47 is written as a terminal. Wait, but in the context, NT5 is on the left, and on the right, it's NT23 (which is a non-terminal) and NT47 (which is a terminal). So that can't be right because in CNF, all productions must consist of two non-terminals or a single non-terminal (for unit productions). Wait, but in this grammar, some productions produce a mix of non-terminals and terminals, which isn't allowed in CNF. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, perhaps all productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42 is two non-terminals. Then NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47: NT23 is a non-terminal, NT47 is a terminal? But that can't be, because in CNF, all productions are either a \u2192 bc or a \u2192 b, where a, b, c are non-terminals. So if a production is a \u2192 b c, then both b and c must be non-terminals, otherwise, it's a mix, which is invalid for CNF. So perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some of the non-terminals on the RHS are marked as terminals. For example, NT42 \u2192 't27' or 't42'. Wait, that's impossible because in Chomsky normal form, you don't have terminals on the production rules. All productions in CNF are between non-terminals, where each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 B. So perhaps the way it's written is different. Maybe the 't' symbols are literals, and they're allowed on the RHS. In that case, it's a mix of terminals and non-terminals on the RHS, which isn't allowed in CNF. But the problem states that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so perhaps I've misread the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the arrows. Let me look again. For example, the rule S \u2192 NT18 NT42: both are non-terminals. Then NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47: NT23 is a non-terminal, and NT47 is a terminal? Wait, but if the grammar is in CNF, that's not possible. So maybe the way the rules are written, like NT47 is a terminal, but in reality, the grammar should only have non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't' symbols are terminals, and the rest are non-terminals. So perhaps the RHS can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, which would mean that the grammar is in a form that's not strictly CNF. But the problem states that the grammar is in CNF, so I must have misunderstood.\n\nWait, perhaps each production in the grammar is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 t, where t is a terminal and NT is a non-terminal. So that's acceptable in CNF as a mixed grammar. Hmm, but I thought CNF only allows A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 B, but in this case, I see productions like NT42 \u2192 't27' or 't42', which are terminals. So perhaps the grammar is a mix of terminals and non-terminals on the RHS, which is allowed in CNF, though not all productions are necessarily to two non-terminals in every case. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a single terminal. So each production must have exactly one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThus, the given grammar has some productions with mix of terminals and non-terminals, but that's allowed in CNF, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can proceed without getting stuck.\n\nThe string to check is `t47 t40 t33 t53 t50`. So this is a sequence of terminals. So I need to find a derivation in the grammar that exactly produces this sequence.\n\nSo to do that, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string, starting from the string and seeing if each step can be reduced according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to see the structure. The string is t47 t40 t33 t53 t50.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which would produce two sequences on the left: each sequence will be parsed from NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps I can decompose the string into two parts, each corresponding to the productions of NT18 and NT42. But maybe not, because the order could matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the productions that produce 't47' and 't53' first, as these are towards the ends of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can trace the production steps backward.\n\nLooking at the given string: t47 t40 t33 t53 t50.\n\nEach of these is either a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first symbol is t47. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals produce t47 as a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see 't47' appears in a few places. For example, NT47 \u2192 't47', and also NT44 \u2192 NT47 (if such exists?), but wait, let me scan the list.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT44 \u2192 NT77 NT?\nWait, let's check all the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each production to identify which produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nWait, no, it's NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal when expanded, which would be the base cases.

Wait, looking for t9, I see NTT8 \u2192 t9 is one of the productions. So t9 comes from NTT8.\n\n- t49: Looking for a production that gives t49. I see NTT4's production: NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. Wait, that's not t49. Maybe another NT. Let me check: No, looking through, perhaps NT23? Wait, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, but t54 is another terminal. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Maybe start by building the parse tree.\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So we have S = NT18 NT42.\n\nNow, let's expand NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: From the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT18 becomes NT23 NT57.\n\nNow NT23 expands to NT26 NT54.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 expands to NT49.\n\nLooking for NT26 \u2192 NT49.\n\nWait, NT26's productions: Wait, no. Looking back, I think NT26's production is in the list as NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. Wait, that seems to be an error. Let me look through the list carefully.\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54.\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT26 can be expanded into NT23 and NT54.\n\nSo NT18 is NT23 NT57, which expands into NT26 NT54 (since NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54) and then NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 and NT54 \u2192 t51 (wait, no, I think I'm confusing.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to work top-down and see if we can match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm or parsing the string step by step.\n\nBut maybe I should trace the string.\n\nWait, let's list the terminals in the string:\n\nt9, t49, t35, t27, t21, t36.\n\nSo we need to see if the start symbol S can derive these in order.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the first part is NT18 and the second is NT42.\n\nLet's see what NT18 can produce. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo we have NT23 and NT57 in the string so far: t9. Wait, but the string starts with t9, which is the first token. So is NT23 can produce t9?\n\nLooking at NT23's production: It expands to NT26 NT54. So NT23 can generate NT26 and NT54.\n\nBut the first terminal we have is t9. Let's check where t9 comes from. Looking through the grammar, the only production that gives t9 is NTT8 \u2192 t9. So NT24? Wait, no. Wait, in the list, I see NT8 \u2192 t9. So perhaps NT8 can produce t9.\n\nWait, wait, let's look for t9. Looking through the production rules for terminals:\n\nAh, here's a production: NT8 \u2192 t9.\n\nWait, yes, in the list: \"NT8 \u2192 't9'\" So NT8 can produce t9.\n\nBut how does that connect? I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me retrace.\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54.\n\nWait, that seems circular. Let me check: NT26 is defined as NT23 NT54. So that would imply NT26 can't go further because both NT23 and NT54 are terminals or non-terminals?\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. So if we expand that, each NT23 and NT54 can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for the rightmost derivation.\n\nStarting from S, and trying to match the string from the right.\n\nThe string is t9 t49 t35 t27 t21 t36.\n\nWe'll start at the start symbol S:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThese non-terminals need to produce the terminals when expanded. So the string t9 t49 t35 t27 t21 t36 should come from NT18 followed by NT42 when each is expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT in the production will produce a consecutive segment of the string.\n\nSo NT18 should produce the first few symbols, and NT42 the rest.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThus, the string should be a combination of NT18's expansion and NT42's expansion.\n\nSo suppose NT18 expands to something that produces the first few symbols, say up to a certain point, and NT42 expands to the rest.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps we can split it into two parts that correspond to NT18 and NT42.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each NT18 and NT42 can be checked for possible derivations.\n\nFirst, let's focus on NT18, as the first part. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT18 needs to expand into the beginning part of the string, which would be t9, t49, t35, t27, t21, t36.\n\nWait, but NT18 is followed by NT42. So perhaps the NT18 expansion is going to produce, for example, t9, t49, t35 and then NT42 would produce t27, t21, t36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be matched by NT18 and NT42's expansions when each is expanded.\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose NT18 produces t9, which would require NT8 \u2192 t9.\n\nSo in NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, if NT23 \u2192 something that produces t9, but none of the NT23 productions directly produce a terminal except via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nBut NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54, which again is a loop, so perhaps there's an issue here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming NT18 can produce t9. Since NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which are both non-terminals, then that would mean that NT18 must expand into these two non-terminals, so neither of which are terminals. Therefore, NT18 can't produce a terminal directly. Thus, the first symbol in the string, t9, must come from NT8, which is a child of NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused about the dependencies.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to see if the string can be parsed into a sequence of expansions that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t9 t49 t35 t27 t21 t36.\n\nWe can think of this as t9 followed by several more symbols. Let's see where each of these symbols come from.\n\nt9: production of NT8."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-87","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t51 t51 t9 t51 t9 t55`, and I have a set of production rules for the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol. So every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t51 t51 t9 t51 t9 t55`. This string consists of six tokens, all of which are terminals (they start with 't'). My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, let's look at its production. The top-level production for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string must be built by first generating NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18, I check its production. From the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Both of these are non-terminals. So, to find out what NT18 produces, I need to look at the productions for NT23 and NT57.\n\nFor NT23, the production is NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Similarly, NT57 \u2192 NT38. So, NT57 is a non-terminal, and it produces NT38. Let's look at NT38: NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT53. Both NT51 and NT53 are non-terminals.\n\nSo, in total, to get the term 't51', that's derived from NT51, which is a terminal. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, let's check each NT's productions:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't7' (a terminal). So NT51 directly gives 't7'.\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because the string has 't51's, like t51 t51.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: looking at the list, there are several NTs ending with 't'.\n\nLooking at NT53: NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. NT42 is a non-terminal. So to get 't51's in the string, perhaps we need to generate 't51' from some NT.\n\nWait a minute, let's go deeper.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S:\n\nIt's S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54.\n\nWait, that's circular because NT26 also has that production. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see. Let's track each non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT18:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. So this seems to keep restarting as both NT23 and NT26 depend on NT23 and NT54, which themselves have further productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a parsing tree step by step.\n\nThe goal is to have 't51' appearing multiple times. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t51.\n\nFrom the given productions, I see:\n\nNT51 \u2192 't7'.\n\nSo NT51 always produces the terminal 't7', not 't51'. Hmm, that means we might have another route. Wait, maybe through other productions.\n\nWait, let me check all productions for any NT that can derive to 't51':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't51'. So I must see if any non-terminals can produce sequences that lead to 't51'.\n\nLooking at NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nNT42 can be either 't43' or 't27' or proceed further.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me see if I can find a path that leads to 't51'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all possible ways a non-terminal can reach a sequence that includes 't51'. Let's see.\n\nLooking for NTs that can eventually derive to 't51'. Since in the productions, each NT is either terminal or breaks down into other NTs, maybe via their chains.\n\nLet's check each non-terminal that could eventually lead to 't51'.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\nFor example, NT28 \u2192 't55' (so that production is 't55').\n\nWait, maybe that's a dead end. Let's see.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nPerhaps I'll look for a production where NT51 can be derived. Wait, there's no direct rule for NT51, it's a terminal. So NT51 cannot produce any other symbol; it only produces 't51'? Wait no, let's look.\n\nWait, in the given productions, I think I might have gotten confused earlier. Let me re-examine each rule.\n\nNT51 \u2192 't7' \u2013 so NT51 can only produce 't7'. So maybe I was wrong before\u2014that there's no NT leading directly to 't51'. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me check all NTs again:\n\nLooking through all NT5's, for example:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'.\n\nWait, but looking for 't51':\n\nLooking for any productions that have 't51' in the terminals. Let me check each rule to see if any NT directly produce 't51'. Scanning the entire list:\n\nLooking at each rhs:\n\nS \u2192 non-terminals\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47.\n\nThen, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT47 \u2192 't21'.\n\nSo NT47 \u2192 't21'.\n\nBut wait, in NT23's production, both NT26 and NT54.\n\nLooking at NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54.\n\nAgain, a cycle. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see: Is there any non-terminal that can derive to 't51'? Maybe not directly. So perhaps 't51' can't be produced by any NT, which would mean the given string cannot be produced, but that seems conflicting because the string includes 't51's.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me see: For example, NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38.\n\nNT42 has two possible productions: NT42 can be 't27' or 't43' or other chains.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce 't51':\n\nFrom the rules, is there any NT that has a production where 't51' is part of the output? Or any ND that can produce a string ending with 't51'?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38.\n\nNT42 can be 't27' or 't43' or further.\n\nWait, from NT42:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT27 or 't43' (but wait, looking again, I think my eye might have moved; perhaps NT42's production leads to more steps.\n\nWait, no, looking correctly:\n\nWait, under the given grammar, let's note each production:\n\nHere's the full list:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47.\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53.\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45.\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38 or \"t27\".\n\nWait, NT42's production has two options: NT2 NT38 or 't27'.\n\nAh, so NT42 can produce a terminal 't27' or a combination of NT2 and NT38.\n\nSame for NT58: NT58 can produce 't42' or 't41' or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier; perhaps NT42 can produce 't27' directly.\n\nYes, looking back, NT42 \u2192 't27' is one of the productions. So NT42 can produce 't27' or proceed via other productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 -> NT10 NT22, which can be further broken down.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find paths where NT51 is involved, but since NT51 is a terminal, how can 't51' appear in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps it's not possible, which would imply the string is not generated.\n\nBut that can't be, as the string contains 't51's, which must be derived from some NT.

{"custom_id":"request-109","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t22 t38 t27 t9 t55 t55 t12` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. That means every step in the derivation should reduce the number of symbols by one, and the start symbol is S.\n\nThe given string consists of several terminals: t22, t38, t27, t9, t55, t55, t12. I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S is the root, and from there, it splits into NT18 and NT42.\n\nNext, let's look at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So from NT18, we go to NT23 and NT57.\n\nNow, NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT38 NT53. So from NT57, we go to NT38 and NT53.\n\nLooking at NT38: NT38 \u2192 NT51. Wait, no, in the list, I see NT38 \u2192 't51'? Let me check again. Yes, NT38 \u2192 t51. So once we have NT38, it's just 't51', which matches part of the string.\n\nNow, NT53: NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. So from NT53, we have NT42 and NT38.\n\nNT42 can be either a terminal or a non-terminal. Looking back, I see multiple NT42 rules: NT42 can split into NT2 and NT38, or it can be a terminal t27. Hmm, wait, let me check: NT42 \u2192 't27' is mentioned, so actually, NT42 can become t27.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT42 has several rules. For example, NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, or NT42 \u2192 't27'. Also, in other parts, NT42 is involved in other productions, but since we're focusing on NT42 as part of NT53's expansion, which is NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38.\n\nBut in the string, after t38 comes t27. So, if NT42 is 't27', that could fit. Let me map this:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be matched by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps constructing a parse tree would be better. But since it's a bit time-consuming, maybe I can look for the order in which terminals appear.\n\nThe string is t22 t38 t27 t9 t55 t55 t12.\n\nLet me look for t22. Where in the grammar is t22? From the list, I see NT22 \u2192 't28'. So t22 is generated by NT22, which is a terminal? Wait, no: NT22 is a non-terminal that goes to 't28'? Or in another rule: NT22 \u2192 't28'? Wait, the rules show NT22 in several places. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo NT22 can either be NT36 and NT53 or it can be 't28'. Wait, but in our string, the first t22 appears. So perhaps in the parsing, the first step is to have NT22 \u2192 't28'? But that would start with 't28', but our string starts with 't22'. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules for NT22 again. Oh, yes, NT22 \u2192 't28' is also present. So in the grammar, NT22 can be a terminal or a combination. But in the string, we have 't22' as the first symbol. So if NT22 is 't28', that can't generate 't22'. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the NT22 rules wrong.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe list includes:\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nand\n\nNT22 -> 't28'\n\nSo NT22 can be either NT36 and NT53 or 't28'. Therefore, in the derivation, when needing to produce t22, it's not possible because NT22 doesn't produce t22. Instead, NT22 can produce 't28' which is not t22.\n\nWait, but that suggests that the string starts with 't22', which isn't possible because in the grammar, the non-terminals NT22 can't produce 't22', only 't28' or combine into other symbols.\n\nTherefore, perhaps this string can't be generated because the first symbol t22 can't be derived from any rule in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check if there's another NT that could produce t22.

Alright, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're supposed to evaluate.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. It seems like every non-terminal symbol on the left side of an arrow has two non-terminals on the right. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This helps because parsing using methods like CYK could work, but since I'm doing this manually, I might need a different approach.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminal symbols. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is defined as S -> NT18 NT42. So, the string starts with a terminal, and each step should involve expanding non-terminals into two terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet's map out each symbol in the string and see how they can be connected. The string is: t38, t53, t33, t28, t22, t55, t7.\n\nStarting from S, we have S -> NT18 NT42. So, we need to derive t38 followed by t53, etc. Wait, but the first two symbols are t38 and t53. Hmm. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, T38 and T53 have productions that expand into terminals. For example, NT38 -> 't51', and NT53 -> 't38'. Wait, but in our string, the first symbol is t38. Is that from NT38 or NT53?\n\nWait, the initial production is S -> NT18 NT42. So S is made of NT18 and NT42. NT18's production includes 't10' but also NT23 and NT57. Wait, the first symbol is t38, but in NT18, possible terminals are 't10' from NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and in NT23, we have 't49' or 't54', etc. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work backwards from the string. Let's see. The string ends with t7. Looking back at the grammar rules, which non-terminals can produce t7? Looking through the rules, I see that NT26 -> 't49', and NT28 -> 't50'. There's also NT51 -> 't7'. So, t7 comes from NT51.\n\nSo the last symbol t7 must come from NT51. Now, NT51 -> 't7', so to get t7, we must have NT51 in the string somewhere. But how does NT51 get to t7?\n\nWait, NT51 might be part of a larger expansion. Starting from S, we have S -> NT18 NT42. So, let's consider how NT18 and NT42 expand. Let me see:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. So, NT18 can produce NT23 and NT57. NT23 can expand to 't49' or 't54'. NT57 -> 't31' or 't53'. Wait, in our string, the second symbol is t53, which is one of the possible terminals of NT57. So, perhaps NT57 becomes t53.\n\nSo, let's see: S -> NT18 NT42\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT57 -> 't53'\nSo that gives us 't53' as the second symbol in our string.\n\nNext is t33. Let's see where t33 comes from. Looking through the rules, NT36 can go to 't36' or NT27 and NT58. NT27 can go to 't22' or NT42 and NT43. The third symbol is t33. Hmm, t33 doesn't seem to be directly in any production as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT43 -> 't38', so maybe another approach is needed. Let me try to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to see if the entire string can be produced by S. Let's see:\n\nThe string is t38 t53 t33 t28 t22 t55 t7.\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 can expand into NT23 NT57. So, first step: NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nNow, NT57 can expand into 't53', so that's our second symbol.\n\nNow, NT23 can expand into 't49' or 't54' or possibly other options. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT23, the rule is NT23 -> NT26 NT54. So, it can only go to NT26 and NT54. Next, NT26 can go to 't49' or NT43 and NT54.\n\nWait, so NT23 -> NT26 NT54. Then, NT26 can produce 't49' or NT43 NT54.\n\nBut in the string, the next symbol after t53 (which is the second) is t33 (third). Let's see if t33 can come from any NT.\n\nLooking at NT42 -> 't27' and 't22'. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third symbol t33 comes from NT43, which can go to 't38' or NT13 and NT47.\n\nWait, this might not be working. Maybe I should track the entire derivation sequence. Let's try.\n\nStart with S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 has two options: NT23 NT57 or NT9 ('t10'? Wait no, NT9 has production 't40' and 't28'? Wait, looking at NT9: NT9 -> NT40 NT28. Hmm, got to double-check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 or 't18' (wait, no. From the rules, NT18: NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, NT18 must expand into NT23 and NT57. Then, each of those can be terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo, S -> NT18 NT42 -> NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nBut wait, each production is to two symbols, so the current expansion is NT23 NT57 NT42, which is three symbols. But the original string is of length 7, starting with seven terms. So perhaps that's more than we need, but perhaps the expansions can lead to the string.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first term is t38. Let's see if t38 can be derived from one of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT51 -> t7, but t38 is further up.\n\nWait, maybe I should track down the derivation step by step:\n\n1. Start with S.\n\n2. S -> NT18 NT42.\n\n3. NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\n   Now, we have NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\n4. Look at each symbol:\n\n   - NT23: can it produce t49 or NT26 NT54.\n   \n   - NT57: can produce t53 or NT42 NT43.\n   \n   - NT42: can produce t2 or NT2 NT38.\n\nSo, after step 3, we have NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nLet's think about expanding further. Maybe we can expand each terminal to a t.\n\nBut let me see the string:\n\nt38 t53 t33 t28 t22 t55 t7.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t38. Is that possible?\n\nLooking for NT that produce t38. NT51 -> t7, but that's not t38. Looking back, perhaps NT51 is part of the tree.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT51 -> t7, so that's the end point.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the entire string can be derived by looking at each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using lookaheads or using the grammar to check for possible strings.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the count of terminals versus non-terminals.\n\nThe string has 7 terminals. Since each production adds one non-terminal each time (since it's two non-terminals on the RHS), the number of symbols in the string should be 1 (original S) plus the number of steps. For a CNF grammar, each step increases the count by one, so the length of the string is 2^k where k is the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me start by understanding the grammar structure. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols. Some terminals can be in the RHS as well. So, looking at the grammar, it seems to be in CNF because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t38 t50 t31 t21 t51 t45 t54 t31`. Each token is separated by a space, which suggests they are either terminals or results from productions.\n\nNow, the approach to solve this is to use a parsing strategy, maybe top-down parsing since it's CNF. But since the string is given, perhaps I can work backwards, reconstructing the derivation starting from the start symbol and see if I can reach the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The production for S is S -> NT18 NT42. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts: the sequence starting with t38 (which is part of NT18) and the rest. Wait, but NT18 could be a derivation of t38. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 has a production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. And NT23 -> NT26 NT54, etc. Wait, but looking at the rules for NT18, I see that NT18 can produce 't10' because one of the productions is NT18 -> NT26 NT54, and NT54 -> 't33'. Wait, no, looking again, wait:\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT18 has production rules. Wait, the user provided a list of productions. Let me go through them:\n\nLooking at NT18: there's NT18 -> NT23 NT57. And NT23 has NT26 NT54, etc. But also, NT18 has a production NT18 -> 't10'. Wait no, I'm looking at the list:\n\nLooking through the productions, for NT9 -> 't35', NT2 -> 't28', NT42 -> 't27', etc. So I'm looking for terminals. The string has 't38', 't50', etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to trace the possible derivations.\n\nSo, starting from S, which produces NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the first two tokens should correspond to NT18 and NT42's derivations.\n\nSo, first token in the string is 't38'. Let me see which non-terminals derive to 't38'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't38'. Looking through, the productions for 't38' are:\n\n- NT58: NT58 -> NT42 NT41, but that's generating two non-terminals. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, each rule is a production, and the left-hand side is a non-terminal. Each rule on the right is either a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nSo, looking for any rule where a non-terminal directly becomes 't38'. Let's scan through the productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't38'\n\nYes, so NT43 directly produces 't38'. Similarly, NT42 -> 't27', NT47 -> 't21', etc.\n\nSo, going back, the string starts with 't38', which is the terminal, so that corresponds to NT43, which is 't38'.\n\nNow, the first token is 't38', which comes from NT43.\n\nSo, looking back, S is S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the left part (NT18) must derive into a string that starts with 't50', and the right part (NT42) must derive into 't31'.\n\nWait, the string is t38 t50 t31 t21 t51 t45 t54 t31.\n\nWait, hold on: S produces NT18 and NT42, so the string should start with the production of NT18 and then NT42. So the first token comes from NT18, and the second from NT42, but since it's two separate non-terminals, the string should start with the concatenation of their derivations.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in context-free grammars, each production is a single non-terminal expanding into two parts. So, the overall string is a sequence of symbols, which could include both non-terminals and terminals. For a top-down parser like CYK, it works by breaking the string into substrings and checking derivations.\n\nBut since the user provided a string, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to think step by step.\n\nThe string is t38 t50 t31 t21 t51 t45 t54 t31.\n\nSo, 8 tokens, which is even since each expansion in CNF is into two symbols. Wait, 8 is a power of 2 (2^3), which makes sense for a top-down parser that works recursively.\n\nSo, let's try to split the string into parts based on the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string: the root is S, which is NT18 NT42. So the entire string should be the concatenation of derivations of NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, the string t38 t50 t31 t21 t51 t45 t54 t31 must be equal to the concatenation of the derivations of NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, first, let's check the start:\n\nThe first token is t38. So, t38 must come from NT18's derivation. Wait, no, because S is NT18 NT42. So, in the expansion, the first token is from NT18's first part. Wait, maybe I need to reconstruct it.\n\nWait, perhaps a bottom-up approach would be better. Starting from the string and trying to match rules in reverse to see if they can reduce to S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a top-down approach, trying to split the string into left and right parts according to possible productions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me list all the possible ways the string can be generated.\n\nStarting with S, the production is NT18 NT42.

The string to evaluate is `t38 t28 t35 t43 t50 t43 t11 t21`.\n\nFirst, I remember that each production in CNF has either two non-terminals or a terminal.

For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT18 is in CNF because it's two non-terminals on the left, but wait, actually in the problem statement, all the productions are shown as having two non-terminals or a terminal as the right side.

In CNF, each production rule has one non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. So I need to check that. Looking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT18 (Wait, but the original grammar is S -> NT18 NT18, so that's two non-terminals on the left? No, wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires that the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals or one terminal. So if the start symbol S is producing two non-terminals, that would mean S is a non-terminal, so it's allowed. But in the given grammar, the productions are written in a way that sometimes a single non-terminal is on the left and the right has two non-terminals or a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I should parse each production correctly.\n\nWait, for example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so S is a non-terminal on the left, and the right side has two non-terminals. That's correct. But looking at another example, NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53, so that's valid. Now, looking at some other productions: NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, again valid. But then, some other lines like NT28 \u2192 't35'\u2014oh, that's a terminal, because the right side is a terminal. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't11' and so on.\n\nSo in this grammar, S is a non-terminal, and all other productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal, so the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string `t38 t28 t35 t43 t50 t43 t11 t21` to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nI think the standard way to parse using an algorithm like recursive descent or the CYK algorithm would work, but given that the grammar might be ambiguous, perhaps a parse tree approach would be better.

So the entire string must be the combination of two parts: one derived from NT18, and the other from NT42.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: the first part derived by NT18 and the second by NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: `t38 t28 t35 t43 t50 t43 t11 t21`.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the string should be the concatenation of the string derived by NT18 and the string derived by NT42.\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 ... ?\n\nLooking at NT18's rules: I see that in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and also NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT22. So NT18 can fork into different possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 can derive to NT27 NT43 and so on, but also to NT4 and NT13 among others, including terminals like t27, t42, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the grammar has multiple production rules for each non-terminal. For example, NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, or NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, etc.\n\nSo let's try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string is split into two parts: NT18 part and NT42 part.\n\nLet me split the given string into two parts such that each part is derived from NT18 and NT42 respectively.\n\nBut I don't know how to split it ahead of time. Perhaps I need to try different splits.\n\nLet me list the entire string: t38 t28 t35 t43 t50 t43 t11 t21.\n\nOne way to approach this is to see which production could start with the first symbol 't38' and which would start with 't28'. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions: I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 and NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT22. Additionally, from earlier, I see that NT18 is also shown to produce 't10' (line: NT18 -> 't10'). Wait, actually, I think I need to parse each NT along with their production rules.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar is given, and I can list each production for each non-terminal. But the problem is that this is a large grammar, so I need to consider the possible productions that could result in starting with a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nand\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT10 NT22.\n\nAlso, looking at line: NT18 -> 't10', but wait, that might not be correct because the rest of the lines show that NT18's productions are NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, NT18 \u2192 S, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to read the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nAnd also, looking further down, NT18 is assigned to NT18 \u2192 't10'\u2014wait, no, that's part of NT2's production.

{"custom_id":"request-145","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t12 t40 t9 t22 t55 t33 t9 t35 t23`, and the grammar has several production rules.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes parsing easier and is useful for certain algorithms.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it consists of a series of production rules starting with the start symbol S and others, eventually terminating in 't' symbols. Each rule is in CNF, which helps because each step in the derivation can produce at most two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: t12, t40, t9, t22, t55, t33, t9, t35, t23. Since the grammar's rules must produce only 't' symbols eventually, each of these must be reachable from the start symbol S through the productions.\n\nI'll approach this by attempting to derive the string step by step, working backwards from the string to see if I can connect them using the given grammar rules. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens: [t12, t40, t9, t22, t55, t33, t9, t35, t23]. I'll note that each production either appends a single 't' symbol or two non-terminals. So, the derivation must expand into these tokens through a series of steps.\n\nStarting from the string, the first symbol is t12. Looking through the grammar, 't12' is produced by NT43. Checking the production rules for NT43:\nNT43 \u2192 t57\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me look again. Oh, no, actually, I think I made a mistake. The rule is NT43 \u2192 't38', but that's not matching 't12'. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Looking through the rules:\nNT43 is defined as \u2192 t57, and also NT45 \u2192 t10. Checking the rules for NT43, there's \"NT43 -> t38\", but that's an NT production, not a terminal. Hmm, maybe I misread the rules.\n\nWait, the grammar is given in a structure where each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT43, the production is NT43 -> 't57'. So 't57' is a terminal that comes from NT43. Similarly, looking at the string, I have 't12'. Does any non-terminal produce 't12'? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see entries like NT9 -> 't35', NT2 -> 't28', NT42 -> 't27', etc. I need to check if any non-terminals directly produce 't12'. Looking through all the rules, it seems that none have 't12' on the right-hand side. The closest is NT43 \u2192 't38' which is a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, looking again, I notice that in the rules like NT42 -> 't27', which is a terminal 't27'. Similarly, NT43 -> 't57', which is a terminal 't57'. So does that mean that to produce 't12', it has to be generated by a non-terminal which is derived via another production?\n\nLooking back, perhaps I'm missing a rule.

I remember that Chomsky normal form requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Let me check if the given grammar fits this.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rules like S \u2192 NT18 NT42 fit because they produce two non-terminals. The terminal rules include ones like NT2 \u2192 't28', so each terminal production is a single terminal symbol. So, the grammar is indeed in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t48 t49 t57 t33 t36 t51 t23 t38 t7`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through some sequence of productions.\n\nI'll start by trying to build the string step by step. The string has nine elements, which is an odd number, but each production step in the grammar seems to require two non-terminals (since each rule on the left side is replaced by two on the right). However, the length of the string is 9, which is odd. Wait, let's think about that: each step in the derivation can increase the number of non-terminals by one, starting from one non-terminal (the start S) and ending with 9 terminals. So the number of steps is 8, which would result in 1 + 8 = 9 symbols in the string, so that's correct.\n\nLet me try to see if these symbols can be produced from the non-terminals. I'll go backwards, trying to match symbols to the right-hand sides of the production rules.\n\nThe string is: t48, t49, t57, t33, t36, t51, t23, t38, t7.\n\nFirst, let's look for the last symbol, t7. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT18 \u2192 t10 and NT26 \u2192 t49, but I don't see t7 directly. Wait, looking at the rules, NT7 \u2192 ... Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see an NT that directly produces t7. Let me check: \n\nLooking for a production where a non-terminal directly results in t7. Scanning through all the 'a' productions:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 t7\n\nYes, NT51 produces t7. So the last symbol, t7, must come from NT51. Now, let's replace t7 with NT51. So the current string becomes: t48, t49, t57, t33, t36, t51, t23, t38, NT51.\n\nNext, the preceding symbol is t38. Looking for a production where a non-terminal directly produces t38. Checking the rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t53\n- NT51 \u2192 t7\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\nOthers don't seem to directly produce t38. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong symbol. Let me index them correctly. The string is 9 symbols, so positions 1 to 9:\n\n1: t48\n\n2: t49\n\n3: t57\n\n4: t33\n\n5: t36\n\n6: t51\n\n7: t23\n\n8: t38\n\n9: t7\n\nSo, t38 is position 8. Let's look for a production that directly gives t38. Scanning the 'a' productions:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t53\n- NT40 \u2192 t6\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t49\n- NT43 \u2192 t38\n\nWait, NT43 \u2192 t38. So, t38 must come from NT43. So now, replace t38 with NT43, making the string up to position 8 as NT43, followed by position 9: t7. So the string is: t48, t49, t57, t33, t36, t51, t23, NT43, t7.\n\nProceeding to position 7: t23. Looking for a production that directly gives t23. Scanning 'a' productions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t49\n- NT23 \u2192 t38 (Wait, actually, let me check the rules again. Looking through the given rules, the only 'a' production matching t23 is NT23 \u2192 t36 | t49? Hmm, no. Wait, the rules provided are:\n\nLooking for NT23 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo, to get t23, do any non-terminals produce t23 directly? Checking all the rules: I don't see any. Wait, let me go through all the rules to see if any NT directly gives t23.\n\nLooking through the rules: NT18 \u2192 t10, NT23 \u2192 t49, so no NT directly gives t23. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again the given rules.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the rules. Wait, the rules are given as:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nWait, that's a production from NT23 to two non-terminals, not a terminal. So, no NT directly produces t23.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because the symbol at position 7 is t23, which is a terminal, so it must come from a production that directly produces it. But none of the production rules for non-terminals produce t23 as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check if I missed any rule that produces t23 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at all the rules, the only ones that produce terminals are the ones ending with -> 't...', so for example:\n\nNT26 \u2192 t49\n\nNT22 \u2192 t28\n\nWait, no others. So maybe the string contains a symbol that cannot be derived, which would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try a different approach. Maybe the string is built correctly, but I'm going back the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the string should be built from the start, trying to match it forward.\n\nLet me try that approach. So starting with S, which is NT18 NT42.\n\nSo S is NT18 and NT42. The string starts with t48. So maybe either NT18 or NT42 can produce a t48.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT18 and NT42:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nLooking for t48 in their right-hand sides. The right-hand sides of NT18 \u2192 NT23 and NT57 \u2192 ... Let's see, NT23's productions are NT26 and NT54. So NT23 doesn't produce t48.\n\nNT57's productions: NT57 \u2192 NT42 NT43. So NT42 is on the right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching it wrong.

Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form is a way to define CFGs where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So, the grammar is structured to make parsing easier, which is good because parsing strings in CNF can be done efficiently with algorithms like CYK, but I think for this problem, I can approach it manually.\n\nThe string to test is: `t11 t38 t21 t6 t50 t35 t40 t28 t48 t21`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar. Let me recall the grammar rules:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nSo, S must start with NT18 followed by NT42, which produce specific sequences of tokens.\n\nLooking at NT18 in the grammar, it has the production NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and NT26 is part of another rule. Wait, hold on, let me get this straight.\n\nWait, the given grammar has multiple NT symbols, each of which can branch into other NTs or terminal symbols. My approach should be to work backwards, seeing how the string can be parsed into the non-terminals according to the rules.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and non-terminals:\n\nTerminals (when a non-terminal's production includes an 'a'?) Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nI notice that some productions are to terminals, like NT9 -> 't35', and others are to other non-terminals, like NT42 -> NT4 NT13.\n\nSo, the string given is a sequence of terminals, each of which must come from the terminals in the productions.\n\nThe string is: t11, t38, t21, t6, t50, t35, t40, t28, t48, t21.\n\nI think I should start from the beginning of the string and try to find a way to derive it using the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is t11. So, I need to find a production that starts with t11. Looking at the grammar, I see NT26's production: NT26 -> t49. Wait, that's not helpful. Wait, also, look for any NT that starts with t11.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT26 -> t49, but that's just a terminal. What about NT9? NT9's production is NT40 NT28. Wait, no, NT9's production is NT40 NT28, not terminal. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT9 -> NT40 NT28. So, that's producing NT40 and NT28. Hmm. Also, looking for where t11 comes from.\n\nI see NT53 -> NT42 NT38, but that's producing NT42 and NT38.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminal that directly produces t11. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal leads to t11 directly. For example, NT23's production is NT26 NT54, but both are NTs. Similarly, NT8's production is NT54 NT49, etc.\n\nWait, wait, looking through, no NT has a production that directly produces t11. So how can the string start with t11? That seems impossible because, given the grammar, none of the non-terminals produce t11 directly.\n\nWait, unless t11 is part of a larger production that eventually produces t11. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of two NTs or a terminal. So the only way t11 can appear in the string is if some non-terminal in the grammar can derive to t11 through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but if none of the non-terminals produce t11 directly, then it's impossible. So is t11 present in the grammar at all?\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT26's production is NT28, which leads to NT28 being NT43 NT5, and NT28 also appears in other places. Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from NT18, which is in the start symbol S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck because t11 isn't present in any production. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because t11 is not part of any derivation from the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar doesn't have any NT that produces t11 directly or through any chain. For example, NT26 is t49, NT23 is NT26 NT54, but NT23 leads to t49 and t45? Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me look again:\n\nLooking for t11:\n\n- NT9's production: NT40 NT28, but these are non-terminals.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t11? It seems none. Similarly, no NT has a production where t11 is directly the right-hand side.\n\nSo, in the string provided, the first symbol is t11, which suggests that some non-terminal must derive to t11. But since no production in the grammar results in t11, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it starts with t11, which isn't present in any production.\n\nSo, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Checking all the terminals assigned to non-terminals, I see that NT23 is a non-terminal, but its production leads to NT26 NT54, which are also non-terminals, so 't23' must come from something else.

Both NT2 and NT9 are non-terminals.

For example, NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22 (non-terminal paths) but also NT2 \u2192 't28'. Similarly, NT42 \u2192 't27', NT43 \u2192 't57', etc. So, any non-terminal that has a production that includes a terminal token must be handled carefully.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t31, which is a terminal. So, looking at the productions, the only non-terminal that can produce t31 is NT57. So, how does NT57 get produced? Because NT57 is only on the left side of a production? Wait, looking through the productions: NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58, but that's not NT57. Wait, let me check each non-terminal.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see that NT57 is not listed on the left side of any production except possibly in NT57 itself, but that's not present in the list. Wait, actually, in the given productions, I see NT38 \u2192 T51, but no NT57 \u2192 ... Wait, the list of productions is quite extensive. Let me check each non-terminal to see if they have a production that leads to t31.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that NT57 \u2192 't31' is not listed; instead, I notice that NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, which could lead to t27 or t41 paths. Wait, actually, looking at NT57, in the list, there is NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58, which leads to t27 or other possibilities. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, looking at the top-level productions, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem, working backwards from the string and seeing if it can match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm for this. But given the length of the string, that might be cumbersome, but since the string is only 11 tokens, perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if the string can be generated by working from the start symbol down.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first step is S produces NT18 and NT42. Then, each of these can produce further non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT57 \u2192 't31'. So, if NT18 can produce something that ends with t31, that part would match. Similarly, NT42 has several productions, including NT42 \u2192 't27' directly.\n\nWait, let's think about the entire string: t31 t11 t43 t40 t23 t38 t28 t53 t35 t57 t48.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me outline the string:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: t31\n\n2: t11\n\n3: t43\n\n4: t40\n\n5: t23\n\n6: t38\n\n7: t28\n\n8: t53\n\n9: t35\n\n10: t57\n\n11: t48\n\nHmm, that's 11 tokens. Each production is two non-terminals, except when it produces terminals. But here, the string is a series of terminals. So, perhaps each of these terminals corresponds to a terminal production from some non-terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at each position:\n\n1: t31 \u2192 NT57 \u2192 (if NT57 was a production, but from the list, it's unclear if NT57 \u2192 t31.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t50 t27 t6 t27 t43 t33 t54 t50 t35 t50 t53 t12`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, with A, B, C being non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it allows for an efficient parsing method, like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm doing this manually, I won't use CYK, but maybe look for a way to build the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first thing to generate is NT18 and NT42, and the resulting string will start with whatever NT18 and NT42 produce.\n\nSo let's break down NT18 and NT42.\n\nStarting with NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 NT27 or NT49? Wait, looking again: NT26 \u2192 t49. So NT26 is a terminal. NT54 \u2192 NT54, which goes to t33. Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'. So NT23 = t49.\n\nNT57 \u2192 t31.\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 t49 t31 (t49 t31). So the first two symbols from NT18 are t49 and t31. But in the string, the first symbol is t50, followed by t27, so that can't be it. Wait, that's a problem. Because the first part of the string is t50, but NT18 starts with NT23 leading to t49. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently by starting from the string and seeing if it can be broken down into the grammar.\n\nThe string is t50 t27 t6 t27 t43 t33 t54 t50 t35 t50 t53 t12.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols, so for a string of length n, there should be n-1 productions. The string has 12 symbols, so 11 productions.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a top-down approach starting from S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo let's see if the string can be generated by NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo the first part should be NT23 NT57.\n\nLooking at the string: t50 is the first symbol. So does NT18 produce t50 in any of its steps?\n\nWait, let's trace NT18:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49' (terminal).\n\nNT57 \u2192 't31' (terminal).\n\nSo NT18 produces t49 t31.\n\nBut the string starts with t50, so that's not matching. Hmm, that suggests that the first part of the string might not be generated by NT18. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Could NT18 be producing something else?\n\nWait, let's look again at NT18:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nBut NT57 \u2192 't31', yes.\n\nSo NT23 produces t49 and NT57 produces t31. So NT18 produces t49 t31.\n\nBut the string starts with t50. So that doesn't match. Therefore, the first part can't be NT18.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the production, the first part must be t49 t31, but the string starts with t50. That suggests that either the string is not generated by this grammar, which would mean the answer is No.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong because perhaps I misread the productions. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49' (terminal).\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT54? Wait, no. Wait, NT54's production: Let me check the grammar again. Oh wait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'. And NT26 \u2192 't49'; NT57 \u2192 't31'; NT38 \u2192 't51'; NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54; NT54 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo yes, NT23 = NT26 NT54. So that's t49 t33.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let me make sure. Each production for a non-terminal is a single step. So NT23 is replaced by NT26 and NT54. Then each of those can be further expanded.\n\nSo for NT23:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Then NT26 \u2192 t49. NT54 \u2192 t33. So NT23 becomes t49 t33.\n\nSo then, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 (t49 t33) followed by t31. So NT18 produces t49 t33 t31.\n\nBut the string starts with t50, so this doesn't match.\n\nWait, is there another possibility? Or perhaps I made a mistake in choosing which non-terminals to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by a different sequence.

{"custom_id":"request-230","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t43 t9 t11 t22 t48 t57 t23 t36 t33 t22 t50 t7 t47`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two conditions: each production rule has either two non-terminals or one terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all the rules on the left (NTx) have two parts on the right, either NT followed by NT or a terminal. So that's good.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a parsing method suitable for that, like recursive descent or the CYK algorithm. But since the string is relatively small, maybe I can do it step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. I'll list them as tokens for easier handling:\n\n1: t43\n2: t9\n3: t11\n4: t22\n5: t48\n6: t57\n7: t23\n8: t36\n9: t33\n10: t22\n11: t50\n12: t7\n13: t47\n\nNow, I'll start from the top symbol S and try to see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at S, it's `S -> NT18 NT42`. So S produces two parts: NT18 and NT42.\n\nEach of these must be derived into the correct sequence. Let's look at NT18 and NT42:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT18 can be expanded. Looking up, NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. Let me list all the NT productions again for clarity. Wait, maybe it's easier to make a mental map.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT42 -> NT2 or other terminals.\n\nWait, I need to check each of these steps carefully.\n\nFirst, let's break down the string token by token and see how each could correspond to the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions.\n\nThe string has t43, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, t43 is a terminal and which production brings that in?\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT45 -> t10\nNT38 -> t51\nNT51 -> t7\nNT29 -> t9 (if any, but let's check)\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for t43:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT43 has two productions:\n\nNT43 -> t57 and NT43 -> t38.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, for example:\n\nLooking at NT43: the productions are:\n\nLooking back, the original grammar has:\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing indices. Wait, the grammar uses NTx where x is a number. Let me check each production line again. For example, the production NT43 -> t57, right?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT43 -> t57 and NT43 -> t38.\n\nSo NT43 can be t57 or t38. But in our string, we have t43 at position 13: t43. So wait, is there a production for NT43 that ends with t43? Let me check. Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see NT43 -> t43. The available options are t57 and t38. So how does t43 get generated?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I should check all the terminals in the string to see if they match any production's right-hand side (RHS). Let me list the tokens and their indices to see which production they could come from.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\nt43: Does any production have t43 on the RHS? Looking through the grammar, the RHS for NTx are either NTs or terminals. So for t43, checking the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, none have t43 as a terminal on the RHS. For example:\n\nLooking for any production x -> t43, none seem to exist. All the t43 appear as terminals in the string but no production in the grammar leads to t43. So that's a problem. Because that would mean the string has a terminal 't43' that cannot be derived from any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT productions that have 't43' as a terminal. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the list, for example:\n\n- NT43 -> t57\n- NT43 -> t38\n- And so on.\n\nSo 't43' isn't a terminal that any of the NT productions generate. Therefore, if the string has 't43', it must be generated directly, but there's no production in the grammar that has 't43' on the RHS.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t43. So how is t43 derived? Since none of the NT productions generate t43 as a terminal, it must be that the grammar doesn't produce t43. Therefore, if the string contains t43, it's impossible for the grammar to generate it. So the string can't be in the language because t43 is never produced.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me look for any production where t43 is on the RHS.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT42\n2. NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n3. NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n4. NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n5. NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n6.

{"custom_id":"request-223","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break down what I know and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, especially with algorithms like CYK. But since I'm not coding, I need a different approach, maybe step-by-step derivation.\n\nThe target string is: `t49 t54 t47 t28 t12 t7 t31 t12 t50 t54 t22 t54 t21`.\n\nHmm, that's a sequence of terminals. To see if it's generated by the grammar, I need to check if it can be formed by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can only produce NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols after S must be the expansions of NT18 and NT42. Wait, but when we expand S, the first step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string starts with t49 (from NT18) and t54 (from NT42). So the first part of the string is t49 t54. Let me see:\n\nOur string starts with t49, t54, t47, etc. So after t49 and t54, the next symbols must be produced by NT18 expanding into NT26 NT54, which is t26 and t54. But wait, in the string, the next is t47. Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet me outline the steps to generate the string. The string is 13 tokens long: t49, t54, t47, t28, t12, t7, t31, t12, t50, t54, t22, t54, t21.\n\nEach production in CNF steps through non-terminals until terminals are produced. So maybe I can work backwards from the string, using the reverse approach of checking if each pair of non-terminals can be derived into the corresponding symbols.\n\nWait, to backtrack, starting from the end. Let's denote the string as positions 0 to 12.\n\nLooking at the last two symbols: t21 and I need to see if they come from a production. So the last production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so after a few expansions, the last two non-terminals must expand into t21 and something else.\n\nBut let me approach this differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, every step is a binary expansion. For a string to be generated, the number of symbols must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. The string has 13 symbols, which is not a power of 2 (since 8 symbols would be 2^3, 16 would be 2^4, etc.), so 13 is not a power of 2. That seems problematic.\n\nWait, let me verify that. The number of symbols in the string after derivations. Each step in CNF starts from 1 non-terminal, which becomes 2. The number of symbols increases exponentially, but the exact number depends on the number of productions. For example, starting from S (1), after one step, 2 non-terminals. Each subsequent step can add more. But the final number of symbols is the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^k, where k is the number of expansions from the root.\n\nSo if our string has 13 symbols, which is not a power of two, it's impossible. 2^3=8, 2^4=16. 13 is between them. So that's a strike against the string being generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but maybe the initial expansion starts differently? Let me think again. Each step S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first two non-terminals must come from NT18 and NT42. Let me check if NT18 can produce t49 and whatever. Looking at the productions, NT18 can produce NT23 NT57 or 't10'. But in the string, the first symbol is t49, which isn't 't10' or any of the NT18 productions. So that's an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at NT18's rules: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 or NT18 \u2192 't10'. So the only terminal symbol from NT18 is 't10'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't49', so that's not possible. That contradicts, meaning that the string cannot be generated because the start symbol S's first expansion is NT18, which can't produce 't49'.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the number of symbols isn't a power of 2, which makes it impossible. Now, even more so, because the initial step from S can't even produce 't49' in the first position.\n\nSo both issues point towards the string not being generated. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-269","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string I need to check is \"t6 t11 t27 t7 t47 t22 t47 t11 t36 t23 t35 t10 t22 t51 t40\".\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two main characteristics: each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that all the rules indeed follow this structure, so it's in CNF.\n\nMy next step is to figure out if the string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this by trying to parse the string using either a recursive descent parser or by working backwards from the start symbol.\n\nI think the start symbol is S. Let me check the production for S. The only rule I see is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S produces two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42. That means the string must start with whatever NT18 produces and be followed by what NT42 produces. Let me see the string: it starts with t6, so I need to see if NT18 can produce a string starting with t6.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, NT18 splits into NT23 and NT57. Then, each of those is non-terminals, so I need to see what they produce. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 is NT26 and NT54. Then NT26 is NT49, as per the rule NT26 \u2192 NT49. And NT54 is 't33'? Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT54 \u2192 't33'. Oh, no, actually, looking correctly, I see NT54 \u2192 't33'? Wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, no, actually, let me list all rules properly to avoid confusion. Let me go through the rules step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT49.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo, NT23 NT54 becomes NT26 NT54 \u2192 NT49 't33'. Wait, but NT26 is a non-terminal, right? So in the string, it should be that NT26 is replaced by NT49, which is then replaced by 't49'? Wait, no. Wait, the rule for NT26 is NT26 \u2192 NT49. So NT26 is replaced by NT49, which is then a non-terminal. Wait, but NT49 \u2192 't45'? Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT49: Yes, NT49 \u2192 't45'.\n\nSo NT26 \u2192 NT49 \u2192 't45'.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is a single step. So when we have NT26 \u2192 NT49, and then NT49 \u2192 't45'. So when we parse t45, it's the production for NT49. So for the string, when we see 't45', that would have come from NT49.\n\nWait, but in the string I have t7, t6, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take the string step by step and see if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nThe string is: t6, t11, t27, t7, t47, t22, t47, t11, t36, t23, t35, t10, t22, t51, t40.\n\nThis is a sequence of terminals. So let's try to parse it starting from S.\n\nS produces NT18 NT42. So the first terminal should come from NT18, and the second from NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t6.\n\nSo NT18 \u2192 ... What does NT18 produce? It's NT23 NT57.\n\nSo the first part is NT18 splitting into NT23 and NT57. The first terminal in the string is t6, but according to the rules:\n\nLooking at NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT54 \u2192 't33'.\n\nHmm, but wait NT26 \u2192 NT49, which \u2192 't45'. So NT23 would produce NT26 NT54 \u2192 't45' 't33'.\n\nBut the string starts with t6, which isn't 't45' or 't33'. So that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules.\n\nWait, let me recheck the rules properly.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT49.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSo when you derive NT23, it becomes NT26 NT54 \u2192 which then becomes NT49 't33'. But NT49 \u2192 't45'.\n\nSo the first NT23 would produce 't45' followed by 't33'. But our string starts with t6, not t45. So that's a problem. So perhaps NT18 isn't producing correctly here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the NT18 production again.\n\nWait, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nAnd NT23 as above gives t45 and t33, but the string starts with t6. That doesn't match. So perhaps the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should go through more of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production for NT18 isn't NT23 NT57, but looking again: yes, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string after S are t6 and the next.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the string as a sequence of non-terminals, and terminals as the production's right-hand side.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking at the entire string and see if it can be parsed from the top down, using the production rules.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to see if the length of the string matches the structure.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which are two non-terminals.Each of these non-terminals will expand into sequences of non-terminals and terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo the total number of symbols in the string should correspond to the number of terminal symbols resulting from S's expansion.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to count that immediately. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to NT18 and NT42, respectively.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt6 t11 t27 t7 t47 t22 t47 t11 t36 t23 t35 t10 t22 t51 t40.\n\nLet me split it into two parts for NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, but how? Because the NT18 and NT42 each split into two parts. So perhaps the string is formed as the concatenation of the expansions of NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo perhaps, the first part would be the expansion of NT18, and the second part the expansion of NT42.\n\nSo, for example, if NT18 expands into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that results in some string, and NT42 expands into another, their concatenation would give the complete string.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, starting with t6, which would come from NT18. But as we saw, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT23 produces t45 and t33, which doesn't match t6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption about how the string is built is incorrect. Perhaps the string is supposed to have each symbol correspond directly to the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each symbol in the string must be the result of a single production step. So each symbol in the string must be either a terminal produced directly by a rule, or a non-terminal that must be further expanded.\n\nBut in this case, we have all terminals in the string, so we must see if the entire string is a direct result of S's expansion, considering that all non-terminals must be expanded into terminals throughout the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps an alternative way is to see if the string can be parsed by a recursive descent parser.\n\nLet me attempt to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting with S: the first production is NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nSo I'll expect the string to be split into two parts.

I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t35 t33 t40 t9 t54 t22 t36 t28 t53 t28 t57 t6 t50 t53 t45`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left. But wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a non-terminal -> terminal terminal or non-terminal non-terminal. So every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and I need to see if the given string can be derived starting from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. My approach will be to parse the string from the start and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S expands into NT18 and NT42, each of which must derive into a single terminal. Wait, no, each NT production expands into two NTs or terminals. Wait, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step, each non-terminal will expand into two non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial string is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so S generates two parts: NT18 and NT42. Each must derive into a sequence of terminals. So the overall string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet me see: the string has t35 at the start, which I think is part of NT18. Looking at NT18's productions:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 or NT54 NT49 or NT10 NT... Let's check:\n\nLooking at the NT18 productions:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT18 -> NT54 NT49\n- NT18 -> NT10 NT... Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT18 are:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> NT54 NT49\nNT18 -> NT10 NT... Wait, checking the given grammar:\n\nWait, the given grammar for NT18 is:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> NT54 NT49\nNT18 -> NT10 NT... Wait, but looking back, the user mentions that NT18 has a production -> NT23 NT57, -> NT54 NT49, and I see in the list:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> NT54 NT49\nNT18 -> NT10 NT28\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list. Let me look through each NT production to see NT18's options. Let me scroll through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT18:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT18 -> NT54 NT49\n- NT18 -> NT10 NT28\nYes, that's right. So NT18 has three productions: NT23 NT57, NT54 NT49, and NT10 NT28.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t35. So I need to see which production of NT18 can derive into a terminal sequence that includes t35. \n\nLooking at the options for NT18:\n\n1. NT23 NT57: Both are non-terminals. So this would require NT23 and NT57 to expand into sequences that include t35.\n\n2. NT54 NT49: Similarly, both non-terminals.\n\n3. NT10 NT28: Also non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, each NT must expand into a terminal string. So the derivation must eventually produce a single terminal, but each production reduces the number of non-terminals. So if NT18 is being expanded, each step must replace it with two non-terminals until a terminal is reached.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the string represents the leftmost derivation. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t35. Let's see if there's a production for NT18 that can lead to t35 as the first symbol. Looking at NT18's productions:\n\n- NT18 can start with NT23 NT57, NT54 NT49, or NT10 NT28. None of these start with a terminal. So perhaps the string is the concatenation of NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, the first part is NT18, which needs to derive a sequence that produces the beginning of the string, starting with t35. But if NT18 can't start with a terminal, then perhaps the first symbol t35 is from the second part.\n\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I need to see the entire string as a result of S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string is the concatenation of NT18's expansion and NT42's expansion.\n\nSo the string should be split into two parts: the part derived from NT18 and the part from NT42.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts. Let me assume that NT18's expansion is the first k tokens and NT42's expansion is the remaining. But I don't know how long each part is. So perhaps I should look for where t35 occurs in NT18's possible expansions.\n\nWait, t35 is a terminal. So in NT18's productions, when it's expanded, it must eventually produce a terminal. Looking at NT18's options, each production leads to two non-terminals. So for NT18 to derive a terminal, each of those non-terminals must produce something, but in this case, the first terminal is t35. That suggests that perhaps t35 is the result of some non-terminal expanding to it, which is not possible since in the initial split, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first part is NT18.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is the result of a series of productions, starting from S. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and seeing if the string can be derived.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must be structured as NT18's symbols followed by NT42's symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, after t35, we have t33 t40 t9... etc., but I'm not sure of the split.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for a way to split the string into two parts, each being the expansion of NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, let's look at NT42's productions. In the grammar, NT42 has multiple productions, one of which is -> 't27' (from NT42 \u2192 't27'). So that's a terminal. Another is -> NT22 NT53, etc. So perhaps NT42 can derive into t27, which is 't27' at some point.\n\nIn the string, I see multiple t's. Let's see if the string can be broken down into two parts, each being the expansion of NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: t35 t33 t40 t9 t54 t22 t36 t28 t53 t28 t57 t6 t50 t53 t45.\n\nI notice t35 is the first token, which I think is a terminal. But in the grammar, is there a production that produces t35? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\nNT47 -> 't21'\nNT38 -> 't51'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nWait, I don't see a production directly for NT23 \u2192 't35', unless I'm looking at the list again.\n\nWait, in the grammar given:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT43 \u2192 NT38 NT47\nNT36 \u2192 NT36 (wait, that can't be, maybe a typo).

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's presented in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal (like S, NT1, etc.) has production rules that either split into two other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it seems to consist entirely of terminal symbols. So I need to see if there's a derivation in the grammar that starts from S and through some sequence of productions reaches exactly this string of terminals.\n\nBut parsing such a long string directly might be complicated. Maybe I can approach this by first attempting to trace if each 't' in the string can be derived from some non-terminal. Let me list all the 't's and see their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6' (Wait, NT40? Or is it NT54? Let me check again.)\nWait, in the rules, NT40 appears here: NT8 \u2192 't40'. Hmm, no, actually, looking back, one of the rules is NT54 \u2192 't33', another is NT8 \u2192 't47 NT4', which isn't a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the rules.\n\nLet me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking for all 't' productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28' (yes)\nNT8 \u2192 't11' (yes)\nNT40 \u2192 't6'? Wait, looking at NT40's production: Wait, in the rules, NT40 seems to have a production like:\n\nWait, I need to go through each rule and find which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11' and another rule: NT8 \u2192 't47 nt4'. Wait, not a single terminal, so when taking a step, NT8 can either produce 't11' or the combination of 't47' and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the string we have is composed of only single 't's and other letters. So the string we're evaluating consists of terminals only, so every step must derive by replacing non-terminals with single terminals, or a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given string, each element is either a single 't' followed by a number or something else. Wait, actually, looking at the string, it's \"t6 t35 t48 t11 t27 t22 t9 t31 t49 t6 t57 t40 t6 t54 t47 t47\". Oh, I see, each token is a single character followed by numbers, but in terms of the string, it's a sequence of these tokens without spaces in reality. Wait, perhaps that's just a way of writing it. So each 't' is followed by other letters, but in the string, it's 't6', 't35', etc., but in reality, the string is a concatenation of 't6', 't35', 't48', etc. So the actual string is a sequence of these token-like strings.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let's clarify. The string is `t6 t35 t48 t11 t27 t22 t9 t31 t49 t6 t57 t40 t6 t54 t47 t47`. So, it's a sequence of 17 items, each is a string like 't6', 't35', etc. So the overall string is a concatenation of these.\n\nSo, the grammar's language consists of terminal symbols which are strings like 't6', 't35', etc. So each production rule's right-hand side must eventually derive to such a terminal string.\n\nBut wait, when the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for each step, we can replace a non-terminal with either an atom (another non-terminal) or a terminal. Thus, in the process of derivation, when we have a non-terminal, we can check if it has a production that directly gives a terminal, and if not, we have to split it into two non-terminals and then check each of them.\n\nSo, for the string in question, each terminal unit in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given string, let's list each terminal:\n\n1. t6\n2. t35\n3. t48\n4. t11\n5. t27\n6. t22\n7. t9\n8. t31\n9. t49\n10. t6\n11. t57\n12. t40\n13. t6\n14. t54\n15. t47\n16. t47\n\nWait, but in the grammar rules, the terminals are of the form 'tX', where X is a number, indicating the production for non-terminals. So, for example, NT2 \u2192 't28' means that whenever NT2 is used, it can produce the terminal 't28'.\n\nSo let's map each of these terminals in the string to their possible non-terminals.\n\n1. t6 \u2192 Looking for a non-terminal that has a production with 't6'. Checking the rules, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't38'\n\nWait, I'm looking for 't6'. Wait, in the rules, looking through:\n\nLooking for all rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal. For example, NT2 \u2192 't28', NT8 \u2192 't11', etc. So let's list all terminals:\n\n- 't7' from NT26 \u2192 't49' is not, but NT26 \u2192 't49' is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Wait, no, NT26 is a non-terminal, so looking through all rules, I need to find non-terminals that have production to 't6', 't35', etc.\n\nWait, the rules have productions like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't6' (Wait, looking through the rules again, actually I don't see NT40 \u2192 't6', perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me list all the 'tX' productions.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6' (Wait, no, let me recheck the rules. In the body of rules, under \"NT40\", I see: \"NT54 -> 't33'\", \"NT8 -> 't47 NT4'\". So 't47' is a terminal? No, that can't be because NT4 is a non-terminal. So perhaps wait, let's go line by line.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me scan the rules for productions that start with a non-terminal and produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule's RHS:\n\n- NT2 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT5 (Wait, no, in the rules, I see 'NT22 -> NT2 NT9', but that's a non-terminal split. Let me proceed carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer if I list all the terminals. Terminals are any sequences that consist solely of 't' followed by digits.\n\nLooking at all the rules, the RHS that are terminals are:\n\n- 't28' (NT2 \u2192 't28')\n- 't57' (NT27 \u2192 't57')\n- 't38' (NT23 \u2192 't38)\n- 't47)\nWait, no, let me go through each RHS:\n\n1.

The string is `t6 t31 t36 t12 t57 t21 t28 t48 t9 t36 t23 t7 t28 t12 t57 t12`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol. But looking at the rules, some start symbols have terminals as their productions, like NT2 -> 't28', etc. \n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each corresponding to a rule in the grammar. The first step is to parse the string from left to right, matching each token to a production's terminal output.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t6. Looking through the rules, NT42 -> 't27' is one option, but that's t27. Another is NT54 -> 't33'. Wait, that's not t6. Looking further, NT40 -> 't6', so that's how t6 comes from NT40. So, the first token must come from NT40.\n\n2. Next token is t31. Looking for a non-terminal that produces t31. Checking the rules, NT57 -> 't31'. So, t31 comes from NT57.\n\n3. Then t36. Possible sources: NT9 -> 't40' (but we're getting t36 now) or NT36. Let me check NT36's rules. NT36 has two productions: NT27 NT47 and NT28 NT58. But those are non-terminals, and their terminals are defined elsewhere. Looking further, NT36 -> 't36'? No, in the rules, NT36 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Wait, let me check: the rules for NT36 are `NT36 -> NT27 NT58 NT28 NT58`? Wait, no, looking back. Wait, no, the rules for NT36 are given as NT36 -> NT27 NT58 and NT36 -> NT28 NT54. So, none of those produce a terminal directly except in other rules.\n\nWait, no, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't28', but that's a specific case. So, to get t36, perhaps it's derived from NT36 somewhere.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT27 and NT28, which are involved in ND36's productions. Let me check NT27 and NT28. NT27 -> 't22', so if NT36 produces NT27 and NT58, then to get t36, maybe via another rule. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should represent the grammar as a parse tree, ensuring that each token in the string matches the terminals of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production produces two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string is a list of terminals. I need to see if they can be generated starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT18 NT42. So, each application of a rule produces two symbols. To parse the string, I'll need to apply these rules step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\n1. The first part is t6. As I found earlier, t6 comes from NT40. So, perhaps the start symbol S will eventually generate NT40, which outputs t6.\n\nWait, but S splits into NT18 and NT42. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nNT54 -> 't33'? Wait, looking back at the rules, NT54 -> 't33' is not there. Wait, checking again, the rules include NT54 -> 't33'? Let me check the provided rules. Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for where NT54 is. The rules given are:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n\nSo NT8 -> NT54 NT49. So NT54 is part of that. What does NT54 produce? Looking through, there's NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, but not NT54. Wait, do any non-terminals directly produce t36? Let me check NT36:\n\nThe rules for NT36 are:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT28 NT54\n\nSo neither directly produce t36 as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because in the string, we have t36, but if none of the NT36's productions produce t36, then it's impossible. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces t36. Wait, perhaps t36 comes from another non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT36's productions, they are both non-terminals, so perhaps t36 is generated when those non-terminals derive into it. But I don't see any rule that produces t36 as a terminal. That would mean that t36 can't appear in the string because there's no way to generate it as a terminal symbol. Therefore, the string must contain a terminal that's not present in any production.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I'm not missing a production that somehow leads to t36. Wait, looking at the rules provided for NT36 again:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT28 NT54\n\nAnd that's it. So, no production for NT36 yields a terminal. Therefore, if the string contains t36, it must have come from some rule where t36 is a terminal in a production. Since no rule produces t36, the string can't have t36 in it.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that t36 comes from NT36, but since there's no production directly yielding t36, that can't be. So the presence of t36 in the string is impossible because it's not present as a terminal in any production. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that perhaps I was missing something about t36 being in another rule, but no, the rules don't include that. So, the conclusion is that the string contains a symbol (t36) that's not produced by any production. Therefore, the string is not derivable from the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the token `t36`, but no production in the grammar directly generates `t36`.

Wait, but in the initial list, under NT22, the rules are:\n\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\nWait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, it says:\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT22, the rule is NT22 -> NT29 NT13, but checking the list, the actual rules are:\n\nThe provided grammar lines are:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\nNT9 -> 't35'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT42 -> 't27'\nNT43 -> 't38'\nNT45 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't33'\nNT38 -> 't51'\nNT51 -> 't7'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT26 -> 't49'\nNT43 -> 't38'\nNT10 -> 't43'\nNT36 -> 't48'\nNT38 -> 't53'\nNT40 -> 't6'\nNT26 -> 't23'\nNT28 -> 't50'\nNT13 -> 't11'\nNT49 -> 't45'\nNT27 -> 't22'\nNT28 -> 't55'\nNT57 -> 't31'\nNT8 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nNT5 -> 't40'\nNT36 -> 't36'\nNT43 -> 't47'\nNT42 -> 't54'\nNT47 -> 't21'\nNT38 -> 't12'\n\nWait, so in the provided grammar, under NT22, the rule is NT22 -> NT2 NT9, and under NT28, NT28 -> NT4 NT40, etc. So where does `t11` come in? Looking through the rules, I see NT13 -> 't11' and NT8 -> 't11'. So the terminal `t11` can come from NT13 or NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, the first `t11` is at the beginning. So we need to see which production can lead to `t11`. Let's see, possible sources: NT8 -> 't11' is one option, but looking at the grammar, NT8 actually has a rule NT8 -> 't54' NT49, which doesn't result in 't11'. Wait, no. Wait, wait, looking at the grammar, under NT8, the rule is NT8 -> NT47 NT4 and NT8 -> 't47' NT4. Also, there's another rule: NT8 -> 't11' in the top-level? Wait, no, looking at the provided rules:\n\nWait, let me check again. In the provided grammar, under NT8, the rules are:\n\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4\n- NT8 -> 't47' NT4\n- Wait, no, that can't be right. Looking back, in the grammar, the rules after NT10 are:\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\nNT8 -> 't11'\nAh, yes, there's a rule NT8 -> 't11' (in the 14th line from the end: NT8 -> 't11'? Wait, actually, looking through, it's under NT8:\n\nNT8 -> 't11' is line #24 in the provided list. So NT8 can directly expand to 't11'. Also, other rules expand into multiple non-terminals. So the string starts with `t11`, which suggests that the first production is NT8 -> 't11'. So let's process that.\n\nSo, the string starts with `t11`, which comes from NT8, so we'll have to look at the expansion of NT8. Now, the rest of the string after `t11` is `t9 t48 t35 t21 t23 t23 t23 t48 t31 t45 t21 t35 t23 t57 t54 t10`.\n\nWait, no, the full string is: `t11 t9 t48 t35 t21 t23 t23 t23 t48 t31 t45 t21 t35 t23 t57 t54 t10`.\n\nWait, no, the string is: `t11 t9 t4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem entails.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. That means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the first few rules, I see that S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S is the start symbol, and it's generating two NTs. NT18 then produces NT23 and NT57. Okay, this seems a bit complex, but I can handle it.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t12 t50 t9 t57 t49 t45 t35 t55 t43 t7 t43 t21 t55 t23 t38 t48 t21`. My goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach here is to use a parsing method, like checking each step to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a good candidate for a bottom-up or top-down parsing approach, but maybe a recursive descent parser would be suitable here.\n\nLet me start by listing all the non-terminals and terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see non-terminals like S, NT18, NT22, etc., and terminals like t12, t50, etc. Each production rule starts with a non-terminal and has two non-terminals on the right side, except for those that produce terminals.\n\nWait, some of the non-terminals on the right side produce terminals, like NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but wait, looking again, actually, no\u2014some of them directly produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28, and in the string, I see 't9' which must come from NT9. Hmm, no, wait: looking at the rules, some rules have terminals on the right side. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28, but looking at the rules I provided, not all of these are terminal productions. Wait, no, wait\u2014looking back, actually, some of the non-terminals on the right don't produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\u2014those are still non-terminals, but looking further, some rules have 't' followed by a number, like NT2 \u2192 't28'. Ah, okay, so these are terminals. So, NT2 \u2192 't28' is a terminal production.\n\nSo, the terminals in the string are: t12, t50, t9, t57, t49, t45, t35, t55, t43, t7, t43, t21, t55, t23, t38, t48, t21.\n\nSo the string has 17 elements, each of which is a terminal.\n\nNow, the question is: can this string be derived starting from S?\n\nI think the best way is to try to reconstruct the parse tree or the derivation steps.\n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT18 NT42.

The string is \"t47 t10 t11 t7 t38 t53 t35 t12 t57 t31 t47 t23 t54 t43 t21 t48 t54 t55\" and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because each production starts with a single uppercase letter on the left, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by non-terminals, except for the terminals at the end, which are single characters.\n\nNow, the string to verify is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which is a combination of two non-terminals, the string must start with the terminals that correspond to these non-terminals. Let me look at each production:\n\nLooking at the top-level production: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the sequences that NT18 and NT42 produce. Let's track each non-terminal and see what terminals they can generate.\n\nLet's start from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string should start with what NT18 produces and then NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So after NT18, we have NT23 and NT57.\n\nNow, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 breaks down into NT26 and NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT27 NT49. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, which are both non-terminals. NT42 in the string is present as 't27', which is a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT42 can produce terminals like 't27', 't28', etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me be careful. Each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by non-terminals, except when the production ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, no: actually, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each production can only have one terminal on the right-hand side. Looking back at the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41 is not correct because each rule can only have two non-terminals or a terminal followed by non-terminals. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where a is a terminal, and B and C are non-terminals. So in the given grammar, all productions are either two non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal on the right side. So, each production rule is of the form NT \u2192 a or NT \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some of the rules have two terminals on the right side, as seen in NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41, which is not possible in CNF. Wait, no, looking again, I think I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, it seems some rules have two terminals on the right. For example, NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4, which are both non-terminals, but wait, NT4 is actually a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production NT4 \u2192 't9', so that's a terminal, so NT4 is a terminal. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4, which is a production from NT8 to NT47 and NT4 (which is a terminal). So, in this case, NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4, where NT4 is a terminal, so it's allowed in the right-hand side because CNF allows a terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where a is a terminal. So, in NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4, that's allowed because one side is a non-terminal, another is a terminal. So overall, each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But in some cases, like NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, both sides are non-terminals.\n\nSo, the process is to start from S and see if we can derive the given string through a series of productions. Since S \u2192 NT18 NT42, the string must start with NT18 generating a certain sequence and NT42 generating another.\n\nLet me map the string to its components. The string is:\n\nt47, t10, t11, t7, t38, t53, t35, t12, t57, t31, t47, t23, t54, t43, t21, t48, t54, t55.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 18 terminals.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first two parts should come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet me see what NT18 can produce. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the first two symbols after S should come from NT23 and NT57.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t47 t10. Wait, but NT23's first terminal is t26, according to the rule NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 NT27 NT49. Wait, no, maybe I should look for the way the terminals are generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from right to left or see if it can be broken down according to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t47, which is the terminal from NT21, according to the grammar, looking at the rules, what produces t21? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for where t21 is a terminal. The only production that ends with t21 is NT21 \u2192 't21'. So, perhaps the last part of the string could be t21, which comes from NT21, which must be generated by its rules. But NT21 is not a non-terminal; it's directly a terminal. Wait, no: in the given grammar, NT21 is a non-terminal, but according to NT21 \u2192 't21', which is a terminal. So NT21 is a non-terminal whose only production is to 't21'. So, if the string ends with t21, then that part is fine.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the rest, the string is a long sequence, so perhaps building a parse tree would be a way. But since this is time-consuming, maybe a better way is to count the number of symbols and see if the derivation length makes sense.\n\nFrom S, each application of a production increases the number of symbols by 1 if it's a two-symbol production (A \u2192 BC) or keeps it the same if it's A \u2192 a terminal. Since the string length is 18, which is even, perhaps it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure can be broken down as S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and then each of these goes through several productions to generate the terminals.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to simulate the top-down parsing. Starting at S, which is the highest level, and try to match the string.\n\nThe string starts with t47, t10, etc., but S is NT18 NT42. So NT18 should generate something starting with t47, and NT42 should generate something starting with t10.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, what does NT18 produce? NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the first part of the string after S should be generated by NT23 and NT57.\n\nSo the string starts with t47, t10. Wait, does NT23 \u2192 ... yield t47 as the first terminal? Let's see.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 must generate something starting with t46? No, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, each non-terminal has productions that can generate certain terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production is a single non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. My task is to see if the string `t36 t50 t48 t6 t43 t48 t43 t57 t12 t31 t45 t12 t47 t31 t49 t28 t54 t7` matches any derivation from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first step in generating the string is that S must expand into NT18 and NT42. That means the string should start with whatever NT18 produces and end with whatever NT42 produces. Let's check the string: it starts with t36 and ends with t7. So, I need to trace back how NT18 and NT42 can produce t36 and t7 respectively.\n\nStarting with NT18: Looking through the productions, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, NT18 must expand into NT23 and NT57. Now, looking at NT57: The productions for NT57 include NT31, but wait, in the given grammar, NT57 actually has a production NT31 \u2192 NT47, which then is another non-terminal. Wait, maybe I need to double-check.\n\nLooking again, the production NT18 is defined as NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, NT18 produces NT23 and NT57. Now, NT23 is defined as NT26 NT54. NT26 is another non-terminal, and in the productions, NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. Wait, that's interesting because NT26 produces itself again. That might lead to a cycle or recursion.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's try to break it down. The first part of the string is t36. Looking at the productions, NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58. So, if the part after NT18 leads to t36, then NT36 must produce t36. Wait, but NT36 is produced by NT27 and NT58, but NT36 also has another production, like NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58. Hmm, wait, no. Looking more carefully, in the grammar, NT36's productions are: NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58 and NT36 \u2192 NT48 NT4. Wait, no, actually, the line says NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58, then later again NT36 \u2192 NT48 NT4. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me list all the productions for NT36: From the given grammar, I see NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58, and also NT36 \u2192 NT48 NT4. So, NT36 can produce either NT27 and NT58, or NT48 and NT4. Now, in the string, we have t48 t6. So, looking at t48, where does that come from? Let me check the productions that produce t48. Looking at the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 NT46 NT49, but also NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49, but t48 isn't directly produced by any of the given NTs except perhaps looking for 't' directly.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT48 is not listed; instead, in the terminal productions, NT8 is 't35', NT2 is 't28', NT42 is 't27', etc. Wait, no, looking again, I see that the grammar has NT9 \u2192 't35', NT8 \u2192 't54', NT2 \u2192 't28', NT42 \u2192 't27', etc. But in the NT definitions, some seem to have terminal symbols as their productions. Wait, no, that can't be, because all NTs are non-terminals except when a production ends in a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking again, for example, NT18 is defined as NT23 NT57, which are both non-terminals. Similarly, NT23 is NT26 NT54, which are non-terminals. So, the only way a terminal symbol appears is when a NT directly produces a terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, the NTs seem to only have other NTs as productions except for some that produce terminals. For example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, but then looking through the list, for example, NT80 is not listed. Wait, let me look for any NT that directly produces a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs, I see NT2, NT3, etc., but in their productions, they all seem to go to other NTs except in the case of NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22, which are NTs, and NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9, which are NTs as well. Wait, but looking again, in the last entries, I see NT54 \u2192 't33', NT45 \u2192 't10', NT42 \u2192 't27', etc.\n\nSo, actually, some NTs directly produce terminal symbols. For example, NT54 \u2192 't33', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT45 \u2192 't10', which is a terminal. So, this means that when we look for a path, a NT can eventually produce a terminal via a chain of productions.\n\nSo, to get t36 in the string, let's see where t36 comes from. t36 is the first word in the string, so that's produced by NT36. Now, NT36 can produce either NT27 and NT58, or NT48 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the first case, if NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58. So, then we have t36, which must come from NT27 producing a terminal and NT58 producing another terminal. Wait, but NT27 is defined as NT42 NT43. So, let's see: NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. Then, those are NTs, so they need to produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT42, in the given grammar, NT42 has a production NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, and also NT42 \u2192 't27'. Similarly, NT43 has a production NT43 \u2192 't57'.\n\nWait, so NT42 can produce either NT4 and NT13, or the terminal 't27'. Similarly, NT43 can produce the terminal 't57'.\n\nSo, if NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, and NT42 can be 't27' or produce further NTs, and NT43 is 't57'.\n\nSo, let's see: NT27 can expand to 't27' and 't57', which together would produce 't27 t57', meaning if NT27 \u2192 't27' and NT43 \u2192 't57', then NT27 \u2192 't27 t57'.\n\nWait, but NT27's production is NT42 NT43. So, for NT27 to produce 't27 t57', NT42 must produce 't27' and NT43 must produce 't57'. That seems possible.\n\nNow, looking back at NT36's production, which is either NT27 NT58 or NT48 NT4. Let's take the first path: NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58. Then, NT27 would produce 't27' and 't57' (as we just saw), which would give us 't27 t57'. Then, NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41. Let's look at NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41. Now, NT42 can be 't27' or produce further NTs, and NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45. Then, NT51 \u2192 't7', and NT45 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo, if NT58 \u2192 't27' and NT41 \u2192 't10', then NT58 would produce 't27 t10'. So, combining everything, NT36 \u2192 't27 t57' 't27 t10', which would give 't27 t57 t27 t10'. Wait, that doesn't match the beginning of the string, which is 't36 t50 t48 t6 t43 t48 t43 t57 t12 t31 t45 t12 t47 t31 t49 t28 t54 t7'. Hmm, that starts with t36, so maybe NT36 should produce the other alternative, which is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms like CYK, but since I'm not dealing with parsing here, just generating or recognizing, I need another approach.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S and seems to consist of multiple non-terminals (NT*) that eventually resolve to terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers).

{"custom_id":"request-345","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complicated with a lot of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of 't's and numbers. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm. But I don't know if I need to use CYK here, but maybe checking the structure using some other method could help.\n\nThe given string is: t6 t38 t11 t40 t7 t57 t9 t9 t45 t50 t48 t57 t53 t49 t49 t45 t21 t36 t40.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which according to the first production rule S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string should start with the two non-terminals NT18 and NT42. But in the string, it's a bunch of 't's and numbers, so each 't' followed by a number might be a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals? Or wait, in the given grammar, some rules produce terminals directly, like NT2 \u2192 't28', so any rule ending with \u2192 'tX' is a terminal. So the non-terminals are the left-hand sides of the production rules, and the terminals are the strings on the right.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's a series of tokens separated by spaces. So each token like 't6', 't38', etc., is a terminal symbol. So I need to see if the string can be derived from the grammar, meaning each 't' must be part of a rule that produces it, directly or through some steps.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t6 t38 t11 t40 t7 t57 t9 t9 t45 t50 t48 t57 t53 t49 t49 t45 t21 t36 t40.\n\nSince S starts with NT18 and NT42, the first part should derive to t6... So let's look at the grammar to see how 't6' could be generated.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nBut in the string, the first part is 't6', so 't6' must come from some production. Let me check the grammar for 't6' as a terminal. Scanning through, I see NT26 \u2192 't49', NT40 \u2192 't6', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the given productions:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't6'\n\nYes, so NT40 produces 't6'. So the first token 't6' must come from NT40. So let's go back: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S starts with NT18 and NT42. But for the string to start with 't6', NT18 must derive into 't6' and NT42 must derive into something else, but wait, in the string, the first token is t6, so S must produce t6 followed by other terms. Wait, no, the production S \u2192 NT18 NT42 means that S is replaced by NT18 followed by NT42. So in the string, we have NT18's expansion and then NT42's expansion.\n\nWait, but the first token is t6, so that would have to come from NT18, which is the first symbol in the production.\n\nSo let's look at NT18's production. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nBut also, looking at the rules, I spot:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, no, let me check. The rules as listed:\n\nLooking through all NT18 productions:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nAlso, looking further, I see:\n\nWait, no, in the list provided, after NT8 \u2192 't11' there's NT9 \u2192 't40', NT10 \u2192 't43', NT12 \u2192 't11', etc.\n\nWait, I might have missed some rules. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nBut I'm looking for where 't6' comes from. Scanning all the rules, I see:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't6'\n\nYes, so 't6' is produced by NT40. But where is NT18 in the production rules that produce t6?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The initial S is producing NT18 and NT42. So the first thing to process is NT18, which needs to expand into something. The correct way is to see where NT18 can produce a terminal. But in the given rules, looking through all the NT18 rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT18 production:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nAlso, is there any rule that produces NT18 as a terminal? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNo, the only NT18 production is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So that can't produce a terminal directly. Then where does 't6' come from? Oh, perhaps the confusion is because the string is a flat sequence of symbols, and it's not a parse tree. So perhaps the parser is using leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, but if S starts with NT18 and NT42, and the first symbol is 't6', which is only produced by NT40, not NT18. Hmm, that's a problem because NT18 only can go to NT23 NT57, which are both non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThen, NT18 is replaced, and NT42 is replaced next. But the string starts with t6, which comes from NT40. So unless NT42 can derive to 't6' as a terminal, but in the production rules, looking for NT42:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't27' (from \"NT42 -> 't27'\" - I see that one occurrence. So 't27' is produced by NT42. But in the string, the first token is 't6', not 't27'. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is parsed as a sequence, not as a tree. So perhaps I should look for sequences that the grammar can produce.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each symbol in the string must be produced by a production rule in the grammar, either directly as a terminal or via some expansion.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t6 t38 t11 t40 t7 t57 t9 t9 t45 t50 t48 t57 t53 t49 t49 t45 t21 t36 t40\", so each of these is either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nSo the first step is to check each token in the string: are they either terminals (like 't1', 't2', etc.) or non-terminals that can be expanded? But the grammar only contains non-terminals on the left-hand sides, so each token is either a non-terminal that can be expanded into other symbols, or a terminal, which must be directly produced by a rule.\n\nSo for the string token 't6', it must be produced by some NT rule that ends with 't6'. Looking up, I find:\n\nNT40 \u2192 't6'\n\nSo 't6' is from NT40. So, if the string starts with t6, then the first non-terminal in the first step must be NT40.\n\nBut in the initial production, S starts with NT18 and NT42. So S can't directly produce 't6' as the first symbol because the first symbol is NT18, which can't produce a terminal. Therefore, the first production of S must expand to NT18 followed by NT42, which themselves must expand further.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the question is about whether the entire string is a valid sequence, meaning that each symbol must be generated by the grammar, but since the string includes both terminals and non-terminals (as per the rules), perhaps I'm supposed to see if the string can be entirely generated through expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string itself is only terminals, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals refer to other non-terminals, so it's a matter of whether the entire string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, let me approach it differently: Maybe I should perform a backward check.

The provided grammar seems to fit this structure because all the non-terminals (like S, NT5, etc.) expand into two other non-terminals except for some that directly expand into terminals like 't12' or 't28', etc.\n\nThe string given is entirely made up of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be derived from a terminal production. I need to see if the string can be produced by the grammar by tracing the possible derivations.\n\nI start by looking at the string in reverse. The last symbol is 't21'. From the grammar, I see the production NT47 \u2192 't21', so the last token in the string, 't21', must come from NT47. So the last part is ... \u2192 NT47.\n\nNow, the second to last is 't55'. Looking at NT55: Wait, the given grammar doesn't have NT55, but perhaps it's part of a longer production. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a production that I missed. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, and in the string, 't57' is after 't55', but perhaps I should backtrack. Maybe I should think about the string as a sequence and see possible splits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be constructed by looking for possible sequences of non-terminals that can produce the tokens in reverse order.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, and each path from root to leaf corresponds to a derivation of the string.\n\nBut the string is of length 20, which would mean an 18-node tree, but maybe I can find a way to build the tree by matching the strings.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string:\n\nt12 t38 t6 t55 t48 t50 t45 t9 t11 t10 t11 t40 t51 t23 t57 t21 t7 t12 t55 t21\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT5 NT18 NT42. But wait, wait: looking back, the initial production is S \u2192 NT1 NT20 NT42? Or is it S \u2192 NT18 NT42? Because in the first line, it's written as S \u2192 NT18 NT42, right?\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar:\n\nThe first line is S -> NT18 NT42. Wait, is that S \u2192 NT18 NT42? Because typically S is the start symbol, so perhaps S \u2192 NT18 NT42 is a typo, because in CNF, S should expand into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial grammar is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nYes, that's correct. So S expands to NT18 and NT42, which each expand into non-terminals. So the entire string must have been derived starting from S, then producing NT18 and NT42 as the root of the parse tree.\n\nWait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the productions are all left- or right-push, but for CNF, the structure is non-overlapping. I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should consider each non-terminal and see how they can produce the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a parser simulation approach, trying to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the sentence must be a sequence of such productions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an alternative approach. Since each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, the string must be a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that can reduce by applying the productions in reverse.\n\nMaybe it's easier to see if the string can be split into a sequence of production steps.\n\nWait, let's try to split the string into a possible reduction order.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nt12.\n\nLooking up the productions for t12: NT58 \u2192 't42' NT41, and NT42 \u2192 't27' NT43 (from the given grammar).

So the process is recursive, breaking down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: `t48 t51 t57 t45 t51 t21 t50 t38 t43 t6 t22 t49 t45 t23 t51 t55 t54 t22 t6 t54`.\n\nThat's 20 tokens. I'll treat each token as a terminal symbol, so I need to get all 20 terminals in order through the derivation starting from S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT18 NT42. So in the first step, S is split into NT18 and NT42. Then each of those needs to derive into the necessary terminals.\n\nWait, but each production has exactly two symbols. So each step in the derivation takes one non-terminal and splits it into two. So for the top level, S splits into NT18 and NT42, each of which might split further.\n\nI think I can model this recursively. Let's see how each non-terminal can derive to the required terminals.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce terminals:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, there are many terminals already. Let me note which non-terminals derive to which terminals:\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47 \u2192 Wait, that's a production, but if both NT23 and NT47 are non-terminals, that's not a terminal. So I need to see which non-terminals are terminal leaves.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT9 -> 't35' \u2192 terminal\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nNT8 -> 't54'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT26 -> 't49'\nNT27 -> 't22'\nNT28 -> 't50'\nNT36 -> 't48'\nNT38 -> 't53'\nNT40 -> 't6'\nNT42 -> 't27', 't43', 't54', etc.\nNT43 -> 't38', 't57', etc.\nNT45 -> 't10'\nNT51 -> 't7'\nNT57 -> 't31'\nNT54 -> 't33'\nNT58 -> 't42' etc.\n\nWait, actually, the terminals are 't's with numbers. Each production that ends with a terminal is a possible leaf.\n\nI think the best approach is to model the string as a sequence of terminals and for each position, check if it can be the result of a production.\n\nBut considering the size, maybe a better approach is to see if the structure of the string matches the grammar's rules. Alternatively, think of the grammar as a series of steps to produce the string.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree. The string must be a leftmost derivation result. Let's see how.\n\nLet me write down the target string:\n\nt48 t51 t57 t45 t51 t21 t50 t38 t43 t6 t22 t49 t45 t23 t51 t55 t54 t22 t6 t54\n\nBreaking into individual terminals: t48, t51, t57, t45, t51, t21, t50, t38, t43, t6, t22, t49, t45, t23, t51, t55, t54, t22, t6, t54.\n\nSo 20 terminals. Let's see if each of these can be part of the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's check each terminal:\n\n1. t48: From the grammar, NT36 -> t48 (since NT36 -> NT27 NT58, and NT58 -> NT42 NT41, etc., but maybe NT36 can go directly to t48. Wait, no: looking back, yes, NT36 is defined as NT27 NT58. Then NT27 is NT22 NT54, and NT54 is t33? Wait, wait, maybe I need to check each production.\n\nAlternatively, looking for which non-terminals lead directly to a terminal.\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47 \u2192 not terminal\nNT2 -> t28\nNT4 -> t9\nNT8 -> t54\nNT18 -> t10\nNT26 -> t49\nNT27 -> t22\nNT28 -> t50\nNT36 -> t48\nNT38 -> t53\nNT40 -> t6\nNT42 can go to t27, t43, t54, etc.\nNT43 can go to t38, t57, etc.\nNT45 -> t10\nNT51 -> t7\nNT57 -> t31\nNT54 -> t33\nNT58 -> t42 etc.\n\nSo let's note the non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\nNT4 \u2192 t9\nNT8 \u2192 t54\nNT18 \u2192 t10\nNT26 \u2192 t49\nNT27 \u2192 t22\nNT28 \u2192 t50\nNT36 \u2192 t48\nNT38 \u2192 t53\nNT40 \u2192 t6\nNT45 \u2192 t10\nNT51 \u2192 t7\nNT57 \u2192 t31\nNT54 \u2192 t33\n\nThese are the immediate terminals. The other non-terminals (NT5, NT22, etc.) produce two non-terminals each.\n\nSo the string has 20 terminals. To parse it, each production step must split the non-terminals into two parts, eventually resulting in this string.\n\nBut each split can only produce two non-terminals, and each must result in terminals in the string.\n\nGiven the target string length is 20, the number of productions needed would be 19 splits because each split increases the count by one. Starting with one non-terminal (S), after each split, the number of symbols increases by one until 20.\n\nWait, S produces two non-terminals, then each of those may split, so for the string to have 20 terminals, the derivation would have to have a binary tree with 20 leaves, which means 19 splits. So that's necessary.\n\nBut to determine if the string can be generated, we need to see if each of the 20 terminals can be matched in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reconstruct a parse tree or use dynamic programming.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a parse tree and ensure each production leads to the correct sequence.\n\nAlternatively, use memoization or consider the structure of the grammar.\n\nBut since the process is time-consuming, maybe I'll look for patterns or see if the string can be built from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me see the structure of the string:\n\nStarting with t48, which is NT36. So the first non-terminal must be NT36.\n\nThen, NT36 splits into NT27 and NT58.\n\nFrom NT27, we get t22. So the first part is NT36 -> NT27 t22.\n\nBut the string is t48 t51 t57 t45 t51 t21 t50 t38 t43 t6 t22 t49 t45 t23 t51 t55 t54 t22 t6 t54.\n\nSo after t48 comes t51, which would come from NT51. Wait, but NT36 is followed by NT27, which goes to t22. But according to the string, after t48 is t51, which is the first symbol in NT51.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe the parse tree starts with NT36 as the first non-terminal, but then the next symbol is t51. So perhaps that approach is not correct.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe each non-terminal can only produce specific sequences, so perhaps I can break down the string into chunks corresponding to each non-terminal's production.\n\nFor example, S starts as NT18 NT42. So the string should be divided into parts that come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it can be split into two parts, one derived from NT18 and the other from NT42.\n\nBut I need to know the derivations of NT18 and NT42.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT26 -> NT49 (terminal)\nNT54 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which has rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol and the right-hand side is two non-terminals, except for the terminals. The string to check is \"t11 t36 t50 t7 t9 t49 t12 t27 t47 t51 t48 t28 t36 t43 t7 t23 t47 t21 t47 t21 t38\". \n\nHmm, the first step is to understand the grammar. Let me list out all the production rules. \n\nLooking at the rules, I see each symbol that isn't a terminal is a non-terminal. Terminals are those that end up as 't' followed by a number, like 't11', 't36', etc. Each production rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and the right is a combination of two non-terminals, except when the right side is a terminal.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be generated by some sequence of these rules. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if the non-terminals can be expanded to form this string.\n\nLet me parse the string into individual tokens: t11, t36, t50, t7, t9, t49, t12, t27, t47, t51, t48, t28, t36, t43, t7, t23, t47, t21, t47, t21, t38.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S can be split into two parts, NT18 and NT42. Each of these needs to be generated into parts of the string.\n\nLet me see what NT18 and NT42 can produce. \n\nLooking at the rules, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 becomes NT23 NT57.

So maybe some are just producing a terminal when necessary.\n\nWait, no, wait: in the rules, for example, NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, meaning NT5 expands to NT23 and NT47. Each is a non-terminal. So, for example, the string \"t11\" might be derived from NT13 \u2192 't11'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT13 \u2192 't11' and NT8 \u2192 't11'. So in the string, there's t11 appearing twice.

Let's expand each:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nSo, NT18 becomes NT23 and NT57. Then NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, so that's NT26 and NT54. \n\nNT57 \u2192 't31', according to the rules?

Wait, let me check.\n\nWait no, looking through the rules again, the rule for NT58 is NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, but that's a different one. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error. Looking at the rules list again:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 't51'? Wait no, checking each rule, I don't see NT57 having a production except perhaps 't51' is somewhere. Wait, in the list, there's a rule: NT51 \u2192 't7'? No, wait, NT51 is 't7'? No, wait, looking again:\n\nYes, under NT51 \u2192 't7', and NT38 \u2192 't53', and other similar rules. Wait, maybe I got confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of which non-terminals lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, any rule ending with a terminal (i.e., the right-hand side is two terminals). But I think the rules are set up such that each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals, except when they directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait no, actually, in this grammar, many rules directly produce a terminal. For example, NT53 \u2192 't38' and NT9 \u2192 't35' are direct terminals. So the grammar has some rules that output terminals, making it a context-free grammar with some terminals in the rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, some are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47 (both non-terminals)\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n- NT57 \u2192 't31' ?

{"custom_id":"request-385","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, every rule has the left-hand side as a non-terminal and the right-hand side as either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This is helpful because it limits the way the grammar can derive strings, and perhaps I can use something like a parsing algorithm, maybe recursive descent or using a table to track possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example, NT2 produces 't28', NT4 produces 't9', NT5 produces 't40', and so on. Other rules involve two non-terminals on the right-hand side, like S -> NT18 NT42 or NT5 -> NT23 NT47.\n\nThe string given is: t40 t43 t50 t22 t28 t33 t23 t45 t57 t31 t28 t48 t51 t23 t53 t22 t11 t47 t47 t9 t50\n\nI think the strategy here is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules. Since it's in CNF, each production produces either a terminal or two non-terminals, so each step either consumes a terminal or splits into two non-terminals, which then need to be further processed.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is small, maybe I can try to see which rules are applicable by looking for the string elements and see if they can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me see the start symbol: S -> NT18 NT42. So the entire string must be derived by first producing NT18 and NT42, each of which will generate a sequence on their own, and together they form the entire string.\n\nSo the string starts with t40, which could be produced by NT5, as per the rule NT5 -> t40. So perhaps NT5 is part of NT18 or NT42's derivation.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLet me check the first part of the string: t40, t43, t50, etc.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with t40. Looking at the rules, NT5 produces t40, so perhaps NT5 is part of the derivation.\n\nBut looking at the initial rule for S, it's S -> NT18 NT42. So S must produce two parts: the first part is NT18, the second is NT42. Maybe each of these can produce sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each part separately. Let's split the string into two parts, since S produces NT18 followed by NT42. So the string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, but the string has 20 tokens, which might mean that the two non-terminals (NT18 and NT42) each generate some number of tokens, adding up to 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire thing as a concatenation of NT18 and NT42, each of which will generate a sequence.\n\nLet's take the entire string as the concatenation of two parts: Part A and Part B, where Part A is generated by NT18 and Part B by NT42.\n\nLooking at the initial S -> NT18 NT42, so the entire string is the concatenation of the string from NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list of terminals. So if NT18 generates a sequence of terminals and NT42 another, the flat list is their concatenation.\n\nSo Part A: from NT18's production.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT18, I see that NT18 has the following production rules:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 (from the rule NT18 -> NT23 NT57)\nAlso, looking at other rules, perhaps others:\n\nWait, no, let me check the given grammar rules again:\n\nLooking through them, I see NT18 has only one rule: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So NT18 can only produce two non-terminals: NT23 and NT57.\n\nSo from NT18, we get two non-terminals. Each of those must be expanded further.\n\nNow, NT23's rule is NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT57's rule is NT57 -> NT31 NT38.\n\nSo NT23 becomes NT26 NT54, which further split into NT26 and NT54.\n\nLooking at NT26, the rule is NT26 -> NT23 NT49.\n\nBut wait, NT23 is already a non-terminal, so this could lead to more splits.\n\nThis might get complicated quickly, so perhaps a better approach is to use something like the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings in CNF grammars efficiently.\n\nBut since I'm just thinking it through, maybe I can try to proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string, the first token is t40. Let me see if that can be the result of some production.\n\nLooking at NT5's production: NT5 -> t40. So if NT5 can appear somewhere in the derivation, it can produce t40.\n\nLooking at the initial S production, NT18 and NT42. Maybe NT18 can produce t40 via NT5? But NT18 can only produce NT23 and NT57. So no, unless there's a way for NT23 or NT57 to produce t40, but let's check.\n\nWait, NT23's rule is NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nSo from NT23, we go to NT26 and NT54.\n\nLooking at NT26's rules, the rule is NT26 -> NT23 NT49.\n\nWait, if I substitute, NT26 would produce NT23 and NT49.\n\nThis seems like it's looping back, which might be an infinite loop, but perhaps there's a way to terminate.\n\nWait, this might not be the right approach. Maybe I should try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that fit the initial rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the start symbol, I can try to generate the string step by step.\n\nBut considering that the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check the string to see if each token matches the possible terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: the tokens are t40, t43, t50, t22, t28, t33, t23, t45, t57, t31, t28, t48, t51, t23, t53, t22, t11, t47, t47, t9, t50.\n\nWait, the first token is t40, which is produced by NT5. So let's see if any of the productions of the start symbol (S: NT18 and NT42) can lead to NT5.\n\nBut looking at the rules, S is NT18 -> NT23 NT57 and NT42 -> several things, including NT2, but not NT5.\n\nSo unless NT23 or NT57 can somehow produce NT5, which seems unlikely because each rule is two non-terminals, unless there's a way that NT23 or NT57 can be transformed into NT5, but I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, let me check NT23's rules again: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. No NT5 here.\n\nSimilarly, in the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to NT5 except itself, which wouldn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. NT5 is a single terminal, so perhaps it's only produced directly. So the only way to get t40 is through NT5.\n\nSo if the string starts with t40, that must come from NT5.\n\nLooking back to the start symbol, S is NT18 followed by NT42. So to get NT5 in there, either NT18 or NT42 must produce something that includes NT5.\n\nBut looking at NT18's production, it's NT23 NT57. So unless NT23 or NT57 can produce NT5 through some chain, which I don't see happening, S's NT18 starts the derivation with two non-terminals, and neither can produce a NT5.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT42's production: it has several rules, but none of them immediately produce NT5. The rules for NT42 are:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> NT27 NT43\nNT42 -> NT54 NT41\nAnd so on.

{"custom_id":"request-401","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string I need to evaluate is `t51 t33 t6 t23 t36 t35 t10 t43 t22 t57 t49 t57 t33 t51 t9 t47 t53 t33 t6 t35 t57 t6`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, the steps of derivation lead to a linear number of symbols, so the number of steps is related to the length of the string minus one. The given string has 21 tokens, so the derivation should take 20 steps. Each step doubles the number of symbols, so starting from 1 symbol, after 20 steps it should be 2^20, which is way bigger than the 21 in the string, but it's about the sequence of productions that can get me there.\n\nI think about the process of how to check this. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production gives two non-terminals. So the string is built from the start symbol, which is S, by applying productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its production is S -> NT18 NT42. So S directly produces two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. So the first two tokens in the string after S must come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, no, the string is a sequence of symbols, but the initial S would produce NT18 NT42, so the string should start with the symbols from NT18 and NT42. But the string starts with t51, which is a terminal, so I need to find out which non-terminal produces t51.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT51 -> t7, but that's a terminal, so NT51 is a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal. Wait, no, wait: NT51 is a non-terminal, and its production is NT51 -> 't7', which is a single terminal. So in the string, 't7' would appear when NT51 is expanded.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t51, but t51 is a terminal because it's in quotes. Wait, but in the grammar, are NT51 -> t7, so when NT51 is used, it becomes 't7'. So if the string has 't51', that might not be the case. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT51 with another NT. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT51's production is NT51 -> 't7', so 't7' is a terminal. Similarly, NT53 is used as NT53 -> NT42 NT38, which are both non-terminals. So I need to see how 't51' is generated. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT for each token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nStarting from S:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT42\n   So the next two symbols should be the results of NT18 and NT42.\n   \n   In the string, the first token is t51, which suggests NT18 must produce t51. But looking at the productions for NT18, I see NT18 -> NT23 NT57, which are non-terminals. Hmm, but the first token is t51, which is a terminal. So unless NT18 produces a terminal, which would mean NT18 must have a production that directly results in a terminal. But in the list, I don't see any such production for NT18. NT18's production is NT23 NT57, both non-terminals. So t51 cannot be the result of expanding NT18, since NT18 only becomes NT23 NT57. That suggests that the first part might not be NT18 at the first step.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-examine the productions.\n\nLooking again: NT18 is defined as NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So NT18 must expand into two non-terminals. So the first token in the string, t51, cannot come from NT18's expansion. So perhaps the first two tokens (t51 and the next) must be from the expansion of NT18, but since NT18 only yields two non-terminals, those must both be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, t51 is a terminal. So for t51 to come from NT18, NT18 must have a production that produces t51 directly, but in the given productions, I don't see that. So perhaps the first step isn't S -> NT18 NT42. Or perhaps the initial step isn't directly using the productions; maybe I need to consider the process more carefully.\n\nWait, no, S must expand to NT18 and NT42, so the start of the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT18 and NT42. So the string's first tokens should match the possible expansions of NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18, it's NT23 NT57, so after expanding, NT18 becomes two non-terminals, which then have to produce the first two symbols. But in the string, the first symbol is t51, which is a terminal. So unless one of those non-terminals (NT23 or NT57) can produce a terminal, but looking through the productions, I see NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and NT57 is part of NT23 -> NT26 NT54? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at NT23: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. NT54 -> t33. So NT54 is a terminal, so when NT54 expands, it's t33. Similarly, NT26 -> t49. So NT23, upon expansion, becomes t49 t33, because NT23 -> NT26 NT54, each of which becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string's first token is t51. Hmm. Maybe the path is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider what each non-terminal expands into.\n\nLet me list out what each non-terminal expands into, in terms of terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38: both are non-terminals, so they need further expansion.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53. NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41. NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. NT4 is NT8 NT10, NT8 is NT54 NT49, NT54 is 't33', NT49 is 't45', so NT4 becomes 't9', but wait, maybe I'm not getting this right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace the productions that produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct a parse tree for the given string.\n\nBut considering the complexity, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be parsed through CNF. In CNF, each step of the parse consumes exactly two non-terminals, each becoming a terminal or a single symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to represent the string as a series of steps where each step combines two symbols into one by expanding a production.\n\nBut let's see. The given string is: t51 t33 t6 t23 t36 t35 t10 t43 t22 t57 t49 t57 t33 t51 t9 t47 t53 t33 t6 t35 t57 t6.\n\nSo 21 tokens, so 20 steps.\n\nAnother approach is to simulate the parsing by trying to build up the string from the start symbol, ensuring that each production is used step by step, and that the symbols match the string.\n\nLet's try this.\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nFirst step: NT18 becomes NT23 NT57 (since NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57).\n\nThen, NT42 can be either NT13 (\u2192 't11') or other options, but looking at NT42's productions, I realize there are multiple possibilities. Wait, let me check: NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 or other options.\n\nWait, in the given productions, NT42 has several rules:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nAlso, NT42 \u2192 't27'?\n\nWait, no: Looking back, the user provided the grammar, and under NT42, there's a line NT42 -> 't27'. So yes, NT42 can directly produce 't27'.\n\nSimilarly, I see NT22 \u2192 NT29?

Context-free grammars derive strings through production rules, starting from the start symbol, which is S here. The grammar is in CNF, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal is defined by expanding into other non-terminals or terminals. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\nAnd so on.\n\nEach production either continues to break things down into more non-terminals or eventually terminates into a single terminal, which in this case is often represented by a 't' followed by a number.

Alternatively, I might generate all possible strings up to a certain point, but that could be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a parse tree. Let's start by looking at the structure.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT18 NT42. So, the first two elements in any string derived from S should be terminal tokens from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens in the string: t28 and t51.

NT54 is 't33' as per:\n- NT54 -> 't33'\nSo NT23 \u2192 't9' 't33'\n\nThen NT18 is NT23 NT57:\n- NT18 \u2192 't9' 't33' NT57\nBut NT57 is 't31' from:\n- NT57 -> 't31'\nSo NT18 \u2192 't9' 't33' 't31'\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't28', which would have to be NT18. Wait, but according to the grammar, NT18 doesn't produce 't28'; let me check NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT57 is 't31', so NT18 would have 't9', 't33', and 't31' as the first three tokens when expanded. But the string starts with 't28', 't51', so that can't be. Therefore, the string can't start with 't28' as the first token because NT18 starts with 't9', not 't28'.\n\nWait, but wait a minute: the grammar is given as NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Let me check each production for each non-terminal to see if there's a direct production to a 't'.\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals, I notice that some have productions that result in a single terminal. For example, NT42 \u2192 't27' in one production and also \u2192 NT2 NT38 in another. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't40' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals can directly produce a 't'.

The string is `t36 t53 t48 t50 t40 t38 t36 t31 t21 t6 t53 t51 t27 t7 t11 t22 t9 t28 t23 t27 t33 t22 t35`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and the productions involve various NT's and terminals (t followed by numbers). \n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nThen I see NT42 appears multiple times. Let's see the productions for NT42:\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> NT42 \u2192 This is a cycle, so we'll have to handle that.\n\nBut before that, let's break down the string into parts. Since each production rule in CNF replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the string should be broken down into pairs of symbols. Each pair should correspond to a production rule. \n\nWait, actually, since S produces two NT's, each step will produce more symbols until all NT's are replaced by terminals. So the entire string should be a sequence of terminal symbols generated from S.\n\nLet me start from the top:\n\n1. S produces NT18 and NT42. So the string must start with the symbols from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t36. Let me see what NT36 produces. According to the grammar, NT36 -> NT27 NT58. Wait, no, NT36 is under NT27's production. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT36: The productions are:\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT58\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4 ... Hmm, no. Wait, the NT36 production is only NT27 NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me list all NT non-terminals:\n\nNT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT9, NT10, NT18, NT22, NT23, NT27, NT28, NT36, NT38, NT40, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT47, NT48, NT51, NT53, NT57, NT58, NT8, etc. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a tree. Let me parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t36, t53, t48, t50, t40, t38, t36, t31, t21, t6, t53, t51, t27, t7, t11, t22, t9, t28, t23, t27, t33, t22, t35.\n\nLet me reverse-engineer the string by looking from the end, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can try to expand S and see if it can generate the string.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree starting from S. Let's see.\n\nS produces NT18 and NT42. So after expanding S, the symbols are NT18 and NT42. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nNT18 produces NT23 and NT57 (looking at NT18's production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57). So now the string starts with t23 and t57, but our initial part is t36 t53, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. The initial string starts with t36, which is produced by NT36, not NT18. So perhaps the first step is that S -> NT18 NT42, but then somehow NT18 is expanded into a path that includes t36. Wait, let me check NT18's production again.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So the expansion would produce t23 and t57. But t36 is the first symbol in the string. So that path would require that NT18 somehow produces t36, but its only production is to NT23 and NT57. Therefore, maybe S is not the start. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a path from S through NT18 and NT42 to generate the symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parse tree where the root is S, and each node has two children. \n\nLet me try to build the tree step by step.\n\n1. Start with S: S\n   S expands to NT18 NT42.\n\nSo now the string so far is: [NT18, NT42]\n\n2. Expand NT18 and NT42.\n\nNT18's production is NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 has multiple productions, let's see which one could lead to the given string.\n\nNT42 can expand into:\n- NT2 NT38\n- NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 But that's a cycle and would cause infinite recursion, so it's unlikely.\n\nLooking at the string, after the initial t36, which might be from NT36. Wait, but NT18 is at that point. Maybe I'm mixing up the NT's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S expands to NT18 NT42, and somehow NT18 and NT42 can produce the remaining symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the entire string in terms of the productions. Let's try to see if the entire string can be broken down into a sequence of productions.\n\nBut it's getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a top-down parsing method like recursive descent or to see if all symbols can be traced back through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use memoization or dynamic programming, but I might not have time for that.\n\nWait, let me try another approach: see if each symbol in the string can be derived from the grammar by tracing possible paths.\n\nLet's take the first symbol, t36. Which non-terminals produce t36?\n\nLooking through the grammar, t36 is part of NT36. Let's see if any non-terminal produces t36. \n\nLooking at the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT58\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4 ... Hmm, not t36.\n\nWait, perhaps NT8 is involved. Looking at NT8: NT8 -> NT54 NT49, which leads to 't33' and 't22' from NT54 and NT49, respectively. But that's not t36.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check each non-terminal that can produce t36.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT22 -> ... let's see, NT22's production is NT36 NT53, so NT36 is part of it.\n\nWait, if NT22 produces NT36 and NT53, and in the string there's t36 followed by t53, that could be part of NT22. So maybe one of the NTs in the expansion is NT22, which produces t36 and t53.\n\nWait, so if we have NT22, then after expansion, we get t36 and t53. In the string, the first symbols are t36, t53, which would fit this production. So let's assume that the initial expansion of S goes into NT22, but wait, S is NT18 NT42, not NT22. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's clarify: S is S -> NT18 NT42. So the first symbols after expanding S are the results of NT18 and NT42. \n\nBut according to the grammar, NT18 produces NT23 and NT57, which are non-terminals, not terminals, so the string starts with symbols that must be further expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, so the initial expansion after S is NT18 and NT42, which then each must be expanded until all leaves are terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, which is a terminal. So perhaps the first non-terminal in S's expansion is NT36, leading to t36.\n\nWait, but S can't directly produce NT36, because S's rule is NT18 NT42. So that's impossible. Therefore, maybe S can't directly produce t36, unless one of its children in the expansion can eventually produce it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me retrace: the string is given, and I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string step by step from S.\n\nThe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's structured with rules that split each non-terminal into exactly two other non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are leaf nodes. So, each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t33 t48 t35 t49 t11 t28 t50 t45 t50 t35 t22 t12 t27 t35 t22 t43 t12 t55 t57 t27 t35 t10 t38`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do that, I'll try to build a parse tree from the string upwards, applying the grammar rules until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by noting the length of the string. It has 21 tokens (separated by spaces), which is a good number since the grammar probably has a relatively small parse tree.\n\nLet me list out the string's tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t33\n2. t48\n3. t35\n4. t49\n5. t11\n6. t28\n7. t50\n8. t45\n9. t50\n10. t35\n11. t22\n12. t12\n13. t27\n14. t35\n15. t22\n16. t43\n17. t12\n18. t55\n19. t57\n20. t27\n21. t35\n22. t10\n23. t38\n\nWait, hold on. Counted them again, but I think the initial might have been 22 tokens? Wait, let me recount. The string is: t33 t48 t35 t49 t11 t28 t50 t45 t50 t35 t22 t12 t27 t35 t22 t43 t12 t55 t57 t27 t35 t10 t38. That's 23 tokens, right? t33 up to t38 as the last token. So 23 tokens in total.\n\nBut context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have derivations that are of length n-1 for a string of length n. Since we start with the start symbol S, each step increases the number of symbols by one. So, for a string of length 23, the derivation should have 22 steps, with the start symbol S at the beginning and end.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the start symbol S is used only in the initial production. Let me look at the start symbol. The grammar has S -> NT18 NT42. So the initial expansion starts with S splitting into two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. Each of these is a non-terminal that will further split into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if the given string can be produced by this grammar. I'll approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into the non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nTo do this, I might use a top-down parsing approach, starting with the start symbol S and seeing how to generate the string. Alternatively, I can try to build the parse tree from the bottom up, but since the string is pretty long, it might be easier to process it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the entire string to be generated by expanding S step by step, ensuring that each expansion aligns with the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model each step of expansion starting from S and see if we can generate the string. But given the string's length, it might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each non-terminal in the grammar eventually resolves to a specific terminal symbol, except for some that might produce other non-terminals. So, perhaps we can map the order of the terminals and see if it aligns with the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules in detail:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 NT49\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT33 NT36\n\nWait, hold on, let's start mapping from S:\n\nS expands to NT18 and NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 and NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT28 and NT49.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 and NT40.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 and NT10.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 and NT49.\n\nWait, here, NT8 and NT4 both expand into NT54 and NT49, which are non-terminals.\n\nThis might lead to multiple recursion. Let me try to see the expansion.\n\nWait, it's better maybe to try to model each step of expansion in reverse, seeing if the terminal string can be formed by combining the right symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start with the string and see if it can be reduced using the grammar rules, starting from the terminals and working our way up to the start symbol S.\n\nThis is called a bottom-up approach, where we see if the entire string can be reduced step by step using the reverse of the grammar rules.\n\nEach grammar rule A \u2192 BC can be read in reverse as BC \u2192 A. So, any substring that matches BC can be replaced with B and C. But in reverse, if we have BC, it can be replaced by A.\n\nBut I need to make sure that for each possible pair in the string, whether they can be grouped to form a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the entire string to be a sequence that can be divided into such pairs according to the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules as a reduction.\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string is too long, and trying to build a parse tree step by step would take too much time without making a mistake.

CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the rules on the left-hand side (like S, NT5, etc.) are followed by exactly two non-terminals on the right, except where it ends with a terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the productions, some have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT2 -> 't28', which is a terminal. That's okay in CNF because the rules can produce terminals, but they still need to be of the form two non-terminals for the main rule. So the grammar is correct in CNF, which is fine.\n\nNow, the approach to determine if the string is generated by the grammar is to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using techniques like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not very familiar with that, maybe I can approach it step by step by breaking down the string into possible chunks that match the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals (t43, t35, etc.). My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first step is to check if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to NT18 and NT42. Let's look at the string:\n\nt43 t35 t9 t7 t22 t28 t12 t28 t22 t9 t22 t33 t9 t43 t45 t45 t57 t55 t22 t33 t49 t40 t50 t21.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT18 NT42, then the string must first consist of something that matches NT18, followed by something that matches NT42. But how do I determine where to split the string?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by multiple steps, each expanding non-terminals. But since the string is relatively long, doing this step-by-step manually might be tedious. Perhaps I can look for known production rules and see if they can form parts of the string.\n\nLet me look for any production rules that include 't43'. From the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 t57\n- NT43 \u2192 t38\n- NT43 \u2192 't38' (wait, that's the same as above). Also, in the production rules:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT43 \u2192 t38\n- NT43 \u2192 t57. Wait, no, looking again, the production for NT43 is 't57' and 't38', and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT43 -> 't57'\n\nNT43 -> 't38'\n\nAlso, the production rules for NT43 are 't57' and 't38', so any term that can derive to NT43 would produce either 't57' or 't38'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the substring 't43 t35' appears at the beginning. Hmm, t43 is a terminal that corresponds to NT43. So if the first part of the string is 't43', that would correspond to NT43. But looking at the grammar, NT43 can be 't57' or 't38'. Wait, in the rules, the production is NT43 \u2192 t57 or NT43 \u2192 t38, meaning that NT43 can only produce either 't57' or 't38', not 't43'. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar rules again. The user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n...\nNT43 -> 't57'\nNT43 -> 't38'\n\nSo NT43 can only be t57 or t38. So in the string, t43 is a different terminal. So t43 isn't directly a terminal in the grammar; perhaps I misread. Let me scan the string again.\n\nWait, in the string, 't43' does appear twice: the first at position 1 and then again at position 13. Similarly, 't35' is the second token.\n\nSo the first two tokens are t43 and t35. Looking at the grammar, is there any production that starts with NT18 and NT42 such that they can derive to t43 and t35? Or perhaps the string starts with a production involving NT43, which can produce t35 or t57.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this by trying to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S expands to NT18 followed by NT42. Therefore, the string should be split into two parts: the first part is derived from NT18, the second from NT42.\n\nSo the entire string must be split into two subsequences, where the first subsequence is generated by NT18 and the second by NT42.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt43 t35 t9 t7 t22 t28 t12 t28 t22 t9 t22 t33 t9 t43 t45 t45 t57 t55 t22 t33 t49 t40 t50 t21.\n\nI need to find a split point where everything before it is a derived sequence of NT18 and after is NT42.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT18 NT42, the first token is the start of NT18's derivation, and the rest is NT42's derivation. Alternatively, NT18 could break into smaller non-terminals, but perhaps in a minimal split, the first token is from NT18.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t43, which I think corresponds to NT27, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT rules that can produce 't43'. The rules I see:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't57' or 't38'.\n- NT28 \u2192 't28' or NT4 NT40.\n- Looking for any NT rule that produces 't43' directly, but I can't find one. So 't43' must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces t43 through some productions.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the only rules that produce terminals are those that directly end with 't...', like NT2 -> t28, etc. So for a non-terminal to produce t43, there must be a chain of productions that lead to it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, maybe starting from some non-terminal that can lead to t43. Let me see where 't43' appears in productions. It seems that NT42 \u2192 't43' at one point. Looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't43' in the right-hand side of any production:\n\nYes, the rule NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, and from grammar, NT43's definitions are t57 and t38. So that might not be it.\n\nWait, another rule: NT28 \u2192 't55' which is in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the rules that produce terminals. Because 't43' is a terminal in the string, it must be produced directly by a rule if such a rule exists. Otherwise, it must be generated through a chain of non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't35'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10';\nWait, the rule for NT18 is S -> NT18 NT42, but looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLet me list all rules with terminals on the right side:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT9 \u2192 t35\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT24 \u2192 Not in the provided rules. Wait, actually, looking at each line:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT42\n2. NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n3. NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n4.

I'm a bit new to context-free grammars, but I'll try to work through it systematically. So, the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string in question. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This form is helpful because many algorithms can parse it efficiently, like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm doing this manually, I might need a different approach, like substitution or looking for parse trees.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it consists of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT18, NT5, etc.) and a few terminal symbols (like 't35', 't28', etc.). Terminals are the ones that eventually produce the symbols in the string, while non-terminals lead to the structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t50 t57 t40 t48 t53 t9 t36 t27 t40 t38 t12 t49 t54 t31 t6 t9 t9 t6 t40 t33 t28 t48 t23 t9 t11`.\n\nThat's quite a long string.

For example, NT8->'t11', NT4->'t9', etc. So, whenever I see a terminal in the string, I should check if it's reachable via any of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt50, t57, t40, t48, t53, t9, t36, t27, t40, t38, t12, t49, t54, t31, t6, t9, t9, t6, t40, t33, t28, t48, t23, t9, t11.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol except... well, none of them are non-terminals. Wait, no, the input is all terminals, so it's a question of whether the entire string can be derived by starting with S and expanding it through the grammar.\n\nBut the grammar starts with S->NT18 NT18. Wait, no, looking back: the first production is S -> NT18 NT42. Wait, no. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the initial production is S -> NT18 NT18? No. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the first rule is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT18.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, it's:\n\nS -> NT18 NT18.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the initial lines again.\n\nWait, the first rule is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT18\n\nWait, no, no, in the given grammar, the first is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT18.\n\nWait, no, let me reconfirm:\n\nThe initial rules provided are:\n\nS -> NT18 NT18\n\nThen others follow.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first line after \"Grammar:\" is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT18\n\nThen:\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nSo, S starts with NT18 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but I might be confused because in the structure, I see S -> NT18 NT18, which is two NT18 non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string provided, the first symbol is t50, which corresponds to NT28->'t50' in the rules.\n\nWait, so the initial production S is NT18 followed by NT18, each of those needs to be expanded.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT18 listed. Wait, let me check the grammar productions again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT18->NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT18 is a non-terminal, and it produces NT23 and NT57. Then each of those need to be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t50, which corresponds to the production NT28->'t50' (since NT28->'t50' is a rule).

So the string must be the result of expanding S according to the grammar rules until only terminals remain.\n\nEach step of expansion replaces a non-terminal with its production.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, which must correspond to a leftmost derivation (or any other, but typically leftmost is used in parsing algorithms).\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, so each step increases the number of symbols by one.

Wait, CNF has productions of the form A->BC, where B and C can be non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are terminals or non-terminals, never mixing.

I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. I remember that Chomsky normal form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It has several production rules for non-terminals (NT) and terminals. The string to check is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t50 t38 t35 t55 t47 t35 t55 t38 t50 t43 t38 t51 t27 t28 t11 t38 t21 t54 t40 t51 t27 t51 t21 t22 t51`.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the first token 't50' to possible productions. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT where the production results in 't50'. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT28 -> NT43 NT5 (but wait, NT28's production is actually NT28 -> NT43 NT53? Wait, let me check the grammar again.)\n\nActually, wait, the grammar might have multiple rules for the same NT. Let me see:\n\nLooking for any rule that produces 't50'. Scanning all the productions, I don't see any direct rule where a non-terminal expands into 't50'. Wait, but wait, the production for NT7, but in the given grammar, most of the non-terminals have rules that split into other non-terminals except some. Let me check all the 't's:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce 't's. For example:\n\n- NT54 -> 't33' (Wait, no, looking at the list, I think I need to go through each production carefully.\n\nWait, this could take a while. Maybe a better approach is to see how the string can be broken down.\n\nLet me look for the first token 't50' in the string. I need to see if there's a production that can directly produce 't50', but looking through the rules, I don't see any. So perhaps it's generated by a non-terminal that splits into sequences leading to 't50'.\n\nWait, perhaps a non-terminal expands into two symbols where the first expands to 't50' and the second is something else, or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a longer chain.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree for the string. Each step, I break apart the string into pieces that match the grammar.\n\nLet me list the productions again. Maybe I'll make a list of all non-terminals that can expand into 't's:\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43 \u2192 but NT42 can expand into 't27' or other options. Wait, NT42 has multiple rules. For example, NT42 can be 't27', 't42', 't2', etc. Similarly, NT43 can be 't38', etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't50'. I need to find a production where the left-hand side is an NT that can produce 't50' as its first symbol, followed by something that can produce the rest of the string.\n\nLooking through the productions, which NT rules include a terminal as part of the expansion:\n\n- Let's list all NTs and their possible expansions that include terminals:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT2: 't43' (Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, the productions are lines like 'S -> NT18 NT42'.

CNF requires each production rule to have two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. In this grammar, the start symbol is S.\n\nThe grammar's right-hand sides consist of non-terminals and terminals. Some non-terminals are marked with 't' followed by numbers, which I assume represent terminals (since they can't be broken down further).\n\nI notice that the string consists entirely of terminals like t31, t43, etc. So the idea is to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar to see if we can replace non-terminals step by step until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, I might need to parse it incrementally. However, doing this manually could be error-prone, so I'll look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll try to find if any of the non-terminals can produce corresponding parts.

So the right-hand side is non-terminals. The terminals are the ones that are directly present, like t27 being 't27' (same as the 't' number), which might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, in the given grammar, some non-terminals are terminals when their productions end up being those specific 't' sequences.\n\nFor example, at the end of the productions, I see NT42 -> 't27', which indicates that the non-terminal NT42 produces the terminal 't27'.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs produce terminals, like NT53 -> 't38', etc.\n\nSo, when dealing with the string, the initial symbols must match the productions of the non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t43.

The given grammar seems to fit this because each production either ends with a terminal or combines two non-terminals.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I can use a top-down parsing approach, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, perhaps a parse tree approach might be more manageable.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nSo, the first two symbols are NT18 and NT42. Let me look up their productions:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT42 has multiple productions, the first is NT2 NT38, but there's another one later, NT42 -> 't27'\n\nSo, to get 't9', I need to see if NT18 can produce that. Looking at NT18's productions, the first is NT23 NT57, which doesn't seem to help. There's no terminal immediately; all its productions go to non-terminals. So, to get 't9', perhaps there's a deeper production.\n\nLooking at NT42, it can also produce 't27', 't10', etc. Wait, looking at the given string: the first symbol is 't9'. So S starts as NT18 NT42, which after derivation steps would need to produce 't9' and another symbol.\n\nWait, but NT18's only production is NT23 NT57, so that would require NT23 and NT57 to eventually produce terminals. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT23's production: it can go to NT26 NT54 or 't21'. So, to get 't9', perhaps NT23 produces 't21' and then NT54 is another non-terminal. Wait, but the string starts with 't9', so perhaps I'm wrong because S is NT18 NT42, which must both be expanded into terminals.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol S is S->NT18 NT42. So when I do a top-down expansion, both NT18 and NT42 need to produce a terminal. But looking at NT18's production, the first is NT23 NT57, which doesn't produce a terminal immediately. So it's possible that NT23 and NT57 might need to be expanded further.\n\nBut the string starts with 't9', which is a terminal. So either NT18 or NT42 must produce 't9' in the first step, but looking at their productions, NT18 only goes to NT23 NT57, and NT42's first production is NT2 NT38. Neither seem to produce 't9'. Wait, but there's an NT8 -> 't9' production. So maybe 't9' comes from another part of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the productions might lead to 't9' deeper in the parse tree. Let's take a step back.\n\nStarting with S, I need to expand S to NT18 NT42. Then each of these needs to produce terminals. Since the string starts with 't9', perhaps NT18 is the one that eventually produces 't9' as part of the NT18 expansion.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- (Wait, the given grammar shows NT18 -> 't9' somewhere? Let me check the list.)\n\nLooking through the productions: Yes, near the bottom, there's NT58 -> 't42 NT41', but more importantly, further down: NT9 -> 't40 NT28' and others. Wait, I see earlier: NT53 -> 't42 NT38', and later, NT18 is written as NT18->... Looking at the top of the list: Oh wait, no\u2014the user provided a list where one of the productions is NT18 -> 't10' from earlier, but looking closely:\n\nWait, here's the list:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT9 -> 't40' and other nt's. Then, looking further down:\n\nLooking for where it can go to a terminal: It seems that NT8 -> 't9' is there. Also, NT4 -> 't9' maybe? Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking for 'a' -> terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT9 -> 't40', 't28' possibly? Wait, no. Looking at each:\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nLooking at NT8 -> 't11' and 't54' depending on context. Wait, actually, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\n\nNT9 -> 't40 NT28' (itself and NT28).

{"custom_id":"request-505","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar consists of a series of productions. \n\nFirst, let me get a clear picture of what's being asked. I need to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar. The string is: `t40 t33 t10 t57 t38 t6 t36 t45 t6 t49 t12 t55 t27 t51 t45 t53 t50 t54 t11 t10 t54 t31 t10 t31 t33 t6 t31`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions are in CNF, meaning each production is a rewriting of a non-terminal into two other non-terminals. Also, the start symbol is S, and it's defined as S -> NT18 NT42. \n\nSo, the string starts with 't40', 't33', etc., which are terminal symbols. My task is to see if these terminals can be derived by following the production rules step by step.\n\nI know that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, for each production, if it's to a terminal, then it's a leaf in the parse tree. If it's to two non-terminals, then those two can be expanded further.\n\nI think a good approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the given string can be matched as a result of that process.\n\nStarting with S, it produces NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols of the string must be NT18 and NT42. Let's check the string: the first symbol is t40. Wait, that's a terminal. So, I need to see if there's a production for NT18 that produces t40.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check where NT18 appears in productions. I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. That's a production, so NT18 must produce t23 and t57 downstream. So, the first symbol in the string is t40, which doesn't match NT18's production. Therefore, it seems that the string can't start with NT18, so perhaps the entire string is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar. Are there any productions where NT18 can produce a terminal? Looking at all the productions, I don't see NT18 producing a single terminal. Its only production is to two non-terminals: NT23 and NT57. So, NT18 cannot directly produce t40. Thus, if the first token is t40, it can't be derived from NT18.\n\nSo, does that mean the string is invalid? But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string is a sequence of terminals, and the parse tree expands into this sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the non-terminals can eventually produce the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the parse tree. The start is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols in the parse tree are NT18 and NT42. Therefore, the string should start with the terminal symbols that NT18 can produce, followed by those that NT42 can produce.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t40, t33. So, perhaps the first symbol t40 is from NT42. Let's check NT42's productions. Looking through the grammar, there are multiple productions for NT42, like NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT43, etc. But also, some NT42 productions are terminals: Wait, looking again, I see NT42 has four possible productions:\n\n1. NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n2. NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n3. NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT54\n4. NT42 \u2192 t27\n5. NT42 \u2192 t2\n\nWait, no, actually looking back, I think NT42 has several rules. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT42 -> 't27'  \/\/ Wait, wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, I see:\n\nLine 4: NT5 -> NT23 NT47\nLine 5: NT22 -> NT36 NT53\nLine 6: NT41 -> NT51 NT45\nLine 7: NT42 -> NT2 NT38\nLine 8: NT2 -> NT10 NT22\nLine 9: NT4 -> NT8 NT10\nLine 10: NT18 -> NT23 NT57\nLine 11: NT27 -> NT42 NT43\nLine 12: NT9 -> NT40 NT28\nLine 13: NT58 -> NT42 NT41\nLine 14: NT42 -> NT4 NT13\nLine 15: NT22 -> NT29 NT5; Wait, actually, let me list all NT42 productions correctly.\n\nLooking at all lines, I see that NT42 has the following productions:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\nNT42 \u2192 't27'\nWait, line 7 shows NT42 -> NT2 NT38.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at each production with NT42:\n\nLine 4: NT5...

{"custom_id":"request-528","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll do my best to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to fit CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal.\n\nThe goal is to simplify the string using the given productions to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string given is: `t23 t9 t57 t45 t21 t31 t48 t55 t35 t51 t49 t12 t31 t38 t9 t28 t54 t50 t22 t57 t36 t11 t12 t11 t11 t9 t47 t23`.\n\nI think I should parse the string from left to right, trying to match the longest possible substrings that can be rewritten using the grammar's rules. Each time I apply a rule, it should reduce the length of the substring I'm looking at by replacing a non-terminal with terminals or smaller non-terminals.\n\nLet me list down the productions to have them easily accessible:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S produces NT18 NT42. But looking at the string, the first symbol is t23, which is a terminal. So maybe we need to break it down further.\n\nWait, let's see what NT18 and NT42 produce. From the grammar:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nSo S starts as NT18 NT42. But how do we get t23 from NT18? Because according to the productions, NT18 leads to NT23 and NT57, which then produce terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT23:\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 can produce NT26 NT54 or terminals. From the rules, NT26 leads to NT23 NT54, which can further break down. Wait, but this might get recursive. It might be better to consider what each terminal is derived from.\n\nLet me look for each terminal in the string and see how they can be expanded.\n\nt23: Looking at the productions, t23 is derived from NT26. Wait, but NT23 can produce NT26 NT54. And NT26 can produce NT23 NT54 again, which suggests a cycle. Hmm, maybe we should look for how t23 is derived directly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, t23 is produced by NT26. Let me check:\n\nIn the productions, I see NT26 -> t49. So NT26 is a terminal here. So NT23 can't directly produce t23. That's confusing. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nSo NT23 becomes NT26 NT54. NT26 -> t49, so it's a terminal. NT54 -> t33.\n\nSo the string `t23 ...` comes from NT23, which is NT26 NT54. But NT23 can't produce t23 directly. That suggests that maybe t23 is part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string starts with t23, which would require NT23 to produce t23, but according to the grammar, NT23 doesn't produce t23 directly. That can't be. So perhaps the initial production starts from a different point.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe the string is produced entirely by the initial symbol S, so the string must be derived from S. Let's see. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be produced by starting from S and expanding the non-terminals until we get all terminals.\n\nLet's consider that S is NT18 NT42.\n\nThe string starts with t23, which is part of the expansion of NT18.\n\nLooking at NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, but that leads to more non-terminals. This might not be the right path because t23 is a terminal, and we can get to it via NT26.\n\nWait, NT26 -> t49. So if I can get NT23 to expand into t23, but it currently can't. Hmm.\n\nWait, is there a rule that directly produces t23? Let's look again.\n\nFrom the given productions, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nAdditionally, NT26: NT26 -> t49\n\nSo to get t23, it seems impossible unless I have a rule that directly produces t23. Since that's not present, I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying the start symbol.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42.\n\nLooking at the string's first token, t23. Let's see what can produce t23. There is no direct production for NT23 to t23; it goes through NT26 and NT54. So t23 is a result of expanding NT26.\n\nBut how does S lead to t23? S is NT18 and NT42. NT18 produces NT23 and NT57, and NT42 produces NT4 and NT13.\n\nSo after S, we have NT23 (from NT18) and NT42 (from NT18). Wait, no, S is NT18 and NT42. So the first expansion is NT18 and NT42.\n\nBut each non-terminal in S needs to be expanded into their respective productions. So the string derived from S is the concatenation of the expansions from NT18 and NT42.\n\nBut in our case, the string starts with t23, which is a terminal produced by NT26. So the expansion of NT18 must produce something that leads to t23 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So to get t23, NT23 must expand further. But NT23's rules don't lead to t23. That's a problem. So maybe the string cannot be produced by this grammar.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing a different path. Let's see:\n\nLooking back, perhaps I need to re-examine the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nLet me list out the possible expansions step by step.\n\nStarting from NT18:\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT26 is a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT26 -> t49 is a production.\n\nWait, but no, t49 is the result of NT26. So when NT23 expands to NT26 NT54, and then those are further expanded.\n\nBut the string starts with t23, which would have to come directly from NT23, which it can't. So maybe the string isn't possible. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Maybe there's another way. Let me try to parse the entire string step by step.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terms, so perhaps the entire string can be generated by S. Let's try to parse it.\n\nAssuming S produces NT18 NT42. Then, let's see what each symbol in the string can be derived from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the productions of NT18 and NT42. Let's check.\n\nFrom S: NT18 -> NT23 NT57, which then becomes NT23 NT57. NT23 further expands to NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 is a terminal: t49. NT54 is a terminal: t33. But wait, the string starts with t23, not t49 or t33.\n\nThis suggests that the initial production from S doesn't lead to the first token in the string, which is t23. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, unless there's a different way. Maybe the initial NT18 is expanding into something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the provided grammar. I might have misremembered the lines.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nHere are some key productions:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT26 -> t49\n\nSo, NT18 produces NT23 and NT57. NT23 then splits into NT26 and NT54, each of which produces terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t23, which isn't directly produced by any single non-terminal except for NT26 if it somehow produced t23, but that's not part of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-545","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars have production rules that work at the top symbol of the string, so we probably need to use some parsing method, maybe like the CYK algorithm or something. But wait, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), right? CNF has rules of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. Each production on the right-hand side has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me list the production rules I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT42 has multiple rules: NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- And so on, with many rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t40 t51 t43 t53 t27 t21 t11 t43 t12 t9 t7 t7 t22 t23 t22 t9 t10 t21 t57 t6 t47 t45 t45 t51 t54 t50 t55 t6 t33.\n\nFirst, I notice that each 't' is a terminal symbol, like 't40', 't51', etc., and the non-terminals are like NT18, NT22, etc. So the approach would be to start from the top symbol S and see if it can derive the given string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string length should be related to the depth of the parse tree. For a string of length n, the derivation depth is n-1. So the string has 31 tokens, so the derivation should have 30 steps. That's manageable, but parsing manually is tricky.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse table or use CYK algorithm. But since this is a thought process, I'll try to think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the expansion of NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t40. So maybe NT18 generates t40. Let me check NT18's productions. The rules for NT18 are:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 again\n- Wait, let me check all the rules. Oh, the NT18 rules are:\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT18 \u2192 NT51 NT45\nWait, the list shows:\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> NT51 NT45\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> NT47 NT4\nSo, the first production for NT18 can lead to two non-terminals, and then each of those can be further expanded.\n\nIf NT18 starts the string, then the first step is NT18 \u2192 something that starts with t40. Let's see which of NT18's productions can derive t40.\n\nLooking at NT18's rules:\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57: Now, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and check NT26 \u2192 t49, which is t49, not t40. So that's not helpful.\n- NT18 \u2192 NT51 NT45: NT45 \u2192 t10, and NT51 \u2192 t7. So NT51 is t7, but not t40.\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 again: same as the first, no.\n- NT18 \u2192 NT47 NT4: NT47 \u2192 t21, NT4 \u2192 t9. So no terminal symbols here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT18's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look further into each of these. Let me think: for NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, let's expand NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 t49\nNT54 \u2192 t33\nSo NT23 would expand into t49 followed by NT54, which is t33, making t49 t33. But in the string, the first token is t40, not t49. So that path doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, NT18 could go to NT51 NT45. Let's see what NT51 and NT45 produce.\n\nNT51 \u2192 t7\nNT45 \u2192 t10\nSo combining these, it's t7 t10. But the first token is t40, so this also doesn't match.\n\nAnother option for NT18 is NT47 NT4:\n\nNT47 \u2192 t21\nNT4 \u2192 t9\nSo t21 t9, but again, doesn't match t40.\n\nHmm, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps the initial S is derived into NT18 and NT42, and maybe one of those produces t40 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first token is derived from NT18 or NT42. Wait no, in a typical leftmost derivation, the first step is to expand S into NT18 NT42, so the first symbol of the string comes from NT18's expansion, and the second from NT42's expansion.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t40, which should come from NT18's expansion, and the second token should come from NT42's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT18's expansions, none of the direct expansions start with t40 as the first symbol. That seems like a problem. Did I list the rules correctly?\n\nWait, let me check all the NT18 rules again:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 (again)\n- NT18 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n\nNone of these directly start with a terminal symbol. So that would mean that the first symbol t40 can't come directly from NT18, which suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because maybe during the expansion, one of the non-terminals does generate t40.\n\nWait, maybe I should look into the production rules for other non-terminals and see if any of them can derive t40.\n\nFor example, let's see NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10.\n\nLooking at NT8's expansions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\nNT54 \u2192 t33\nNT49 \u2192 t45\n\nSo NT8 \u2192 t33 t45. Then NT4 would become t33 t45 followed by NT10.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nSo NT4 \u2192 t33 t45 t43.\n\nBut that would produce a sequence of terminals, which could contribute to the string. But in our string, after t40 comes t51, then t43, etc.\n\nWait, maybe other non-terminals produce t40. Let me check NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, which could further expand.\n\nWait, looking at NT58:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (if multiple rules)\nWait, looking at NT42's rules, there's one that says NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, there's: NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nSo NT42 can become NT4 and NT13.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nWhich, as before, becomes t33 t45 t43.\n\nWait, but NT42 would be NT4 NT13 \u2192 (t33 t45 t43) followed by NT13's expansion.\n\nWhat's NT13?\n\nLooking at the rules: NT13 \u2192 t11.\n\nSo NT42 could become t33 t45 t43 t11.\n\nBut in the string, after some tokens, there's t22 t23 t22 t9 etc.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this step by step, but it's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can see if the string could start with t40 somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's consider that the string starts with t40. So in the leftmost derivation, the first token is from NT18. But none of the direct derivations of NT18 produce a terminal. Therefore, it's impossible for t40 to be the first symbol, unless NT18 can produce t40 through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, but let me think again"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens that seem to come out of the right-hand sides of some of the productions. Let me start by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write out the string clearly to parse it properly. The string is: `t27 t12 t40 t48 t21 t45 t10 t48 t55 t53 t23 t43 t12 t7 t6 t49 t9 t23 t22 t10 t51 t9 t35 t33 t31 t27 t28 t51 t47`.\n\nI notice that 't' is always followed by numbers, so each token is something like 't31' or 't45'. Looking at the grammar, I see a lot of non-terminals that eventually produce such tokens. So the process is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production on the left (->) ends up producing a token or another non-terminal. I should check if each token in the input matches a production or can be generated through the grammar.\n\nLet me see, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So the first two non-terminals after S would be NT18 and NT42. From the given string, the first token is t27, so I need to see if NT18 can produce t27 or another non-terminal that can then produce t27.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT18: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Wait, no, the correct production is NT18 -> NT23 NT57? Wait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, yes, looking back, I see NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So NT18 can't directly produce t27. So maybe there's a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t27, which is one of the right-hand sides of NT58 (because NT58 -> NT42 NT41, and looking at NT42 and NT41, I see NT42 -> 't42' and NT41 -> 't10'). Wait, no, maybe I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is broken down into a series of non-terminals that expand into tokens. Each production uses two non-terminals, so the entire string should form a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a token.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is the leftmost derivation of the string starting from S. So I can model it as a parse tree and see if it's valid.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So the first part is NT18 and the second part is NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't27', which is produced by either NT58, because NT58 -> NT42 NT41. Let's see if the first production is NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nWait, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So perhaps NT18 can only produce sequences involving 't23' and 't57', but the first token is 't27', which doesn't match. Hmm, that seems like a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should build a parse tree from the given string and see if it matches the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the tokens in order: t27 t12 t40 t48 t21 t45 t10 t48 t55 t53 t23 t43 t12 t7 t6 t49 t9 t23 t22 t10 t51 t9 t35 t33 t31 t27 t28 t51 t47.\n\nThat's 30 tokens. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals, so the parse tree should have a root S, and each node has exactly two children. But with 30 tokens, the parse tree would have about 30 leaf nodes, but since it's a binary tree, the number of non-terminals would be 29, which seems complicated. Maybe I can look for the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process. Let's start with S and try to match the string.\n\nThe string is: t27 t12 t40 t48 t21 t45 t10 t48 t55 t53 t23 t43 t12 t7 t6 t49 t9 t23 t22 t10 t51 t9 t35 t33 t31 t27 t28 t51 t47.\n\nStep 1: S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nSo first, look for NT18 and then NT42 in the string starting from the beginning.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: the first token is t27, which I need to see if it can come from NT18. From the grammar, NT18's production is NT23 NT57. So the first part of S (NT18) must generate something that produces t27.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should check NT18's possible productions. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nHmm, that's it. So NT18 can't produce a token directly, it produces two non-terminals. So how would t27 come first? Unless one of those non-terminals produces a t27.\n\nWait, let's look at NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT57 -> NT51 NT31\n\nSo NT57 produces NT51 and NT31. Looking further, NT51 -> 't7', which is 't7', so that's one token. NT31 -> 't31', a token. Wait, but the first token in the string is 't27', so that doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that each production either is a terminal (like NT22 -> 't43') or a combination of two non-terminals. So for example, NT27 -> NT42 NT43, which produces tokens 't42' and 't43'.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by combining the right-hand sides of the productions. So the string should exactly match a sequence where each production's right-hand side appears in order.\n\nSo the first production is S -> NT18 NT42. So the first two tokens should be the results of NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar for all the productions where a non-terminal is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nIt seems that many non-terminals produce two other non-terminals, which in turn can produce tokens or more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into groups that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t27, which would have to be the result of one of the non-terminals in the grammar. Let's see: which non-terminals produce t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT42 -> 't42', but also NT27 -> NT42 NT43. So NT42 is a token, but to get t27, perhaps a non-terminal that expands to t27.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see several non-terminals that produce t27. For example, NT27 -> NT42 NT43, but that would produce 't42' and 't43', so that's two tokens. Alternatively, is there any non-terminal that directly produces t27?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any, except NT27, but that's not a terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, the only tokens are like 't18', 't27', 't45', etc. So each time, the non-terminals are either terminal tokens or combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't27', which must come from either NT27 or some production that eventually produces 't27'. But in the grammar, NT27 -> NT42 NT43, which would expand into the tokens from NT42 and NT43. For example, if NT42 could produce 't27', but looking at NT42's productions: NT42 -> 't42', 't27', 't4', etc. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking for any production that includes 't27' on the right-hand side. I see:\n\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\n- But the right side of production is two non-terminals, not a 't27'.\n\nWait, perhaps I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol shouldn't be on the right side of any production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to fit the CNF structure because all the non-terminals (like S, NT1, etc.) are on the left, and the right side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Except for the rules where a non-terminal is directly converted to a terminal, like NT2 \u2192 't28', these are all in the correct form.\n\nNext, I need to determine whether the string can be derived from the start symbol S.

So the number of symbols in the string should correspond to the number of symbols generated by the grammar's productions. \n\nLet me count the number of t's and other symbols in the string. The string is: \n\nt7 t27 t11 t43 t45 t22 t45 t27 t51 t9 t22 t40 t45 t48 t21 t10 t38 t21 t10 t48 t45 t21 t50 t7 t10 t55 t6 t55 t38 t31.\n\nCounting the number of symbols: 32 terms.\n\nEach production in CNF when expanded adds one terminal or splits into two non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string generated by the grammar must be 2^n, where n is the number of production steps from the start symbol.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. Each of these can further produce two non-terminals or terminals. So the length of the string would be 2^k, where k is the number of production steps. Let's see: the initial S produces 2 symbols, so the first level has 2 symbols. At the next level, each symbol can be either a terminal or split into two. If a symbol is a non-terminal and splits into two, the length increases. But if it's a terminal, it stays as 1.\n\nWait, but the length of the string can vary because some non-terminals produce terminals directly. So the total length isn't necessarily a power of two, but it's more complicated.\n\nLooking at the given string, it has 32 symbols, which is 2^5. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42, each step could potentially split each non-terminal into two, leading to 2^2, 2^3, etc. So 32 could be a possible length, but that might not be the case here because some non-terminals might produce terminals which don't split further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the structure of the string. Each time a non-terminal is split into two symbols, it consumes one symbol and creates two positions, so the number of symbols increases. But each time a symbol is a terminal, it doesn't create more positions.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so the leftmost part is NT18 and NT42. Each of these non-terminals can produce either terminals or other non-terminals. The number of t's in the string is quite high\u201432, which is a power of two, but not all symbols in the string are terminals. Some are non-terminals, which themselves can produce more.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string backward, seeing if each terminal can be matched by some production ending in that terminal.\n\nLooking at the last symbol in the string: 't31'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a production that ends with 't31'? Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't31'\n\nYes, so the last symbol could come from NT38 \u2192 t31.\n\nNow, the symbol before that is 't55'. So let's check what leads to 't55':\n\nLooking for productions where the last symbol is 't55' or where a non-terminal can produce something ending with 't55' indirectly.\n\nWait, 't55' isn't directly a terminal in any production. Let me see if any NT produces 't55' directly. Looking through the rules, no NT ends directly with 't55'. Hmm. So 't55' must be part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nLooking for a production where the right side includes 't55'. Wait, perhaps a non-terminal can produce something like NT \u2192 A B, where either A or B is 't55' or leads to 't55' through another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try starting from the end and see if each symbol can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be broken down into a series of productions. But this might take a while.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the entire string as a sequence of symbols and check if each terminal matches some production's terminal.\n\nWait, but the entire string is a series of terminals, so each 't' in the string must be generated by some production that produces a terminal. So for each t in the string, I can check if there's a production rule that directly ends with that t.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11' (from NT18 \u2192 t11)\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' (not in the given list, wait: in the given rules, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but looking through the rules, yes, NT8 \u2192 t11 and others.

{"custom_id":"request-562","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, and the grammar is quite extensive too. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, CNF has some specific characteristics. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Additionally, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production except as the start symbol. From the grammar provided, I notice that the start symbol is 'S'. All the production rules follow the format where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right sides are combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t23 t22 t40 t6 t12 t31 t22 t55 t57 t6 t11 t50 t35 t22 t50 t47 t23 t10 t9 t43 t27 t12 t50 t7 t9 t38 t36 t38 t28`\n\nI'll start by looking at how the string is built. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal production uses two steps to reach terminals. So, for example, the initial symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, to produce any string, every non-terminal in the derivation must be broken down into two symbols at each step.\n\nLooking at the string, the starting point is t12. So, I need to find which non-terminal(s) can generate t12. Scanning through the production rules, I see NT38 \u2192 't51' and NT23 \u2192 't11'. Wait, but t12 is in the string, so I need to find a production that directly or indirectly leads to t12.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, NT38 \u2192 't51', NT18 \u2192 't10', but there's also NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT57 is defined as 't31'. Hmm, so NT18 can eventually produce 't10' or NT23 followed by NT57. NT23, from another rule, is NT22 followed by NT49. Wait, let me try to track this.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t12. I need to find a production rule for a non-terminal that can generate t12. Looking through the production rules, I see NT43 \u2192 't38' and NT27 \u2192 't42'. Wait, but in the list, NT43 is defined as 't38', and I don't see 't12' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack and see if any non-terminals can produce t12. For example, NT27 \u2192 't42', but looking at the string, I can see sequences that might lead to t12. Alternatively, I can look at the production rules of non-terminals to see if any can produce t12 at the deepest level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree step by step to see if the string can be generated.\n\nThe string starts with t12, so let's find a non-terminal that can produce t12. Looking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 (and 't10')\n- NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT49\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 't28', so maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any production that generates t12. Scanning through the rules, I see NT36 \u2192 't36' and also NT36 can be replaced by NT27 and NT58. NT27 \u2192 't42', and NT58 \u2192 NT42 and NT41. NT42 can be 't4' or broken down further. Hmm, maybe that's not leading me to t12.\n\nWait, looking at NT43 \u2192 't38' and then looking at where t38 comes from. From the rules, NT9 \u2192 't43' and NT27 \u2192 't42', but t38 is part of several productions. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't12'. But in the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't12' except perhaps indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if 't12' can be derived from any non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58, and NT27 \u2192 't42'. So if NT27 is 't42', that's not helpful. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 't38', which is further down. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking for any rule where the production ends with 't12'. Or maybe a rule where a non-terminal can be replaced by 't12' in one step. Let me check each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42: Both are non-terminals.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47: Neither is 't12'.\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53: No.\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45: No.\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38: So 't2' and 't38'.\n- NT2 -> 't28': No, not 't12'.\n- NT4 -> 't9': No.\n- NT18 -> 't10': No.\n- NT27 -> 't42': No.\n- NT43 -> 't38': No.\n- NT9 --> 't43': No.\n- NT23 -> 't11': No.\n- Wait, perhaps looking further down.\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't12' directly. Let me check all the production rules where a non-terminal is replaced by 'something':\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't36' and also NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58. So if NT36 can be rewritten as 't36', that's one way. But 't36' is a different token.\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41. NT42 can be 't4' (from NT42 \u2192 't4') or broken down further.\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't4'; so if NT42 is 't4', and NT58 is broken down to 't41'... I might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any production that has 't12' as a right-hand side. In the given rules, I don't spot 't12' directly. The only non-terminals that produce 't...' are those that have a terminal in their production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the string starts with 't12', which would have to come from a production of a non-terminal that expands into 't12'. Or perhaps multiple steps.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string is built by repeatedly expanding the non-terminals into other symbols until all are terminals. So I can build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet me try expanding these:\n\nFirst, NT18. Looking at the rules, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 or 't10'. So it can be either 't10' or followed by NT23 and NT57.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, or 't4' (from NT42 \u2192 't4').\n\nSo, if the start is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and then NT18 is replaced by 't10', then the string starts with 't10', but our string starts with 't12', so that's a problem. Therefore, NT18 must be expanded as NT23 NT57.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT18 NT42 \u2192 NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nNow, NT23 \u2192 NT22 NT49, and NT57 is 't51', and NT42 as before.\n\nSo expanding:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT49 \u2192 so we have NT22 and NT49.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9. So NT2 \u2192 't28', NT9 \u2192 't43'.\n\nSo that's getting us into more terminals. But let's see: So S starts as 't12' but in this case, we're getting 't28' and 't43'. Hmm, but the string starts with 't12', so maybe I'm on the wrong path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each rule has two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except for the start symbol which can have a single terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, S is the start symbol. Let me check the rules:\n\nThe first rule is S -> NT18 NT42. So the start rule breaks down S into NT18 and NT42, each of which are non-terminals. Then NT18 can break down into NT23 and NT57, and so on. Each rule is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. \n\nThe string we have to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols, separated by spaces. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. The task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules until all symbols are terminals.\n\nSince this might be complex, maybe I can approach it by constructing a parse tree from the string and see if it can be reduced to S using the given rules. Alternatively, I can try to reduce the string step by step using the rules to see if it can be completely converted into the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the string: t28 t50 t54 t22 t27 t27 t10 t40 t50 t43 t36 t38 t31 t27 t10 t33 t50 t9 t55 t23 t23 t40 t35 t45 t54 t48 t33 t7 t35 t36 t21.\n\nI need to reverse-engineer this. Starting from the end and working my way back towards S.\n\nLet me note that each rule (except S) involves two non-terminals. So each step in the reverse process should involve combining two terminal sequences into a non-terminal that produces them.\n\nLooking at the last token, t21. In the rules, I see that NT47 -> t21. So that's a terminal that can be produced by NT47. So the last symbol is t21, which must come from NT47. So the last part of the string reduces to NT47. Then before that, it's t48. What can produce t48? Looking at the rules, NT48 -> t48? No, looking through the list, I don't see any rule for NT48. Wait, does any rule have NT48 on the left? Looking through all the rules:\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\n- NT38 -> 't53'\n- NT36 -> 't48'\n- So wait, NT36 -> t48. So in the string, t48 must come from NT36. So now I have t48 followed by t21, which in reverse would be NT36 followed by NT47. Also, in the rules, NT36 can be expressed as NT27 and NT58? Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT36:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\n\nWait, no, that's not matching. Let me check the given rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules as given:\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\n\nSo NT36 is a non-terminal that can split into NT27 and NT58. But in the string, after t36 comes t38, which is another terminal. So in reverse, we have NT36 -> t36 and then the next symbols are t38, which would need to come from NT58, because I think NT58 is a rule that produces t38.\n\nWait, looking for NT58 in the rules:\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nWait, no, in the given rules:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNo, looking again:\n\nWait, the given rules include:\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nAnd NT42 can produce t4 and other symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nI need to find the sequence of non-terminals that can generate the given string. Each rule can be used to split terminals into smaller parts until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list all the possible non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nAll the NTX where X is a number, and the rule is NTX -> 'tY', meaning NTX can produce tY as a single terminal.\n\nLet me list those:\n\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT4 -> t9\n- NT5 -> t40\n- NT8 -> t11\n- NT22 -> t27\n- NT23 -> t49\n- NT9 -> t43\n- NT18 -> t10\n- NT26 -> t23\n- NT27 -> t22\n- NT28 -> t25 (Wait, no. Looking at the rules, the NT28 rule is NT28 -> NT4 NT40.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps some non-terminals can produce more than one token. For example, NT42 can produce 't27', and also split into 't4' and 't13' (because looking at the rules, NT42 has two entries: one where it goes to 't27' and another where it goes to 't4' and 't13').\n\nWait, actually, each non-terminal's production is a single option. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production is a single rule, but sometimes with optional terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal has multiple production options. For example, some have both a terminal and a two-symbol production.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules:\n\nNT42-> 't27' and also NT42 -> NT4 NT13.\n\nSimilarly, NT22-> 't27' and NT22-> NT2 NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 -> 't48' and also NT36-> NT27 NT58.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in the string, when we see a terminal, it can be produced by either a single non-terminal or via a split. So, for example, in the string, we have t28, which is produced by NT2. So the production for t28 comes from NT2.\n\nBut before that, earlier in the string, let's start reconstructing.\n\nThe string is: t28 t50 t54 t22 t27 t27 t10 t40 t50 t43 t36 t38 t31 t27 t10 t33 t50 t9 t55 t23 t23 t40 t35 t45 t54 t48 t33 t7 t35 t36 t21.\n\nFirst, I think I should try to see if the first symbols can be converted into non-terminals.\n\nLet me see, starting from the beginning:\n\nt28 comes from NT2.\n\nThen the next symbol is t50. How can t50 be produced? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NTX that directly produces t50. Wait, no, in the rules:\n\nLooking for 't50' as a terminal, I don't see a rule where NTX produces t50. So this seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for t50, there is a rule for NT45 -> t10, but that's not t50.\n\nWait, let's check each rule where NTX produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't43'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't11'\n- NT22 -> 't27'\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT27 -> 't22'\n- NT28 -> 't54' and also NT28-> 't4' and 't40' (Wait, looking at the rules given: NT28 -> 't54' is one rule, and NT28 -> NT4 NT40 is another. So that's a split into NT4 (t9) and NT40 (t6). Wait, but then 't4' comes from NT4, which is 't9'? That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, let's clarify. For each non-terminal, their productions are the possible ways they can split. So for example, NT28 can produce 't54' (a single terminal) or split into NT4 and NT40. But when it's split, those would produce other terminals or split further.\n\nBut looking at the given rules, I'm noticing some inconsistencies, maybe due to multiple rules for the same"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has all productions either generating a terminal or breaking down a non-terminal into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. Each 't' is followed by a number, like 't55', 't22', etc. These numbers probably represent non-terminals. So each 'tX' would correspond to NTX in the grammar.\n\nNow, to check if the string can be generated by the grammar, I should try to parse it from left to right, using the grammar rules. Parsing in CNF can be done using methods like recursive descent since it's ordered. The key is to see if each terminal can be derived using the current non-terminals, following the production rules.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the first few terms to see how they fit.\n\nThe first term is 't55'. Looking at the grammar, I see production rules for NT22 and NT42 both generating 't22' as a terminal. Wait, no: NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT54, but some rules have NT22 producing 't28', like NT22 -> 't28' from the given rules. Similarly, looking for 't55', I see that NT42 has several productions that eventually yield 't27' or 't54', but wait, 't55' isn't directly listed for any NT. Wait, let me check all rules for 't55'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't55' except NT22: wait, NT22's rules are:\n\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n- NT22 -> NT27 NT53 (Is that correct? Let me check the grammar again. No, looking back, I see NT22 can produce NT36 NT53 and another rule?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT22 has the following productions:\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nWait, I don't see any rule that makes NT22 produce something with 't55'. Check:\n\nLooking through all production rules, I see:\n\nNT42: several rules, including NT42 -> NT43 NT57 (Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT42 has multiple rules like NT42 -> NT43 NT57? No, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nThe rule NT42 is listed as NT42 -> NT42 NT41, which is confusing because that seems circular and might lead to non-termination. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me list all NT42 productions to check:\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar, it's quite extensive.\n\nLooking for 't55', I go through each rule's terminal outputs. I notice that many rules produce 'tX' directly. For example:\n\n- NT42 has several rules that produce 't27', 't54', etc., but no rule that produces 't55'.\nSimilarly, NT27: looking for 't55'? NT27 produces NT42 NT43 as a production, but NT42 has rules producing 't27' and 't54', and NT43 produces 't38', 't57', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's see if the string can be parsed step by step.\n\nStart with the string:\n\nt55 t22 t45 t49 t36 t11 t53 t48 t23 t38 t10 t53 t43 t6 t31 t31 t51 t36 t38 t22 t53 t10 t49 t12 t10 t57 t49 t40 t11 t10 t57\n\nI'll try to break it down using the grammar. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. The first term is 't55'. I need to see if any non-terminal can produce 't55'.\n\nLooking at NT5 -> NT23 NT57. Does that help? Maybe not. Let's check all production rules to see if any start with NTX that can produce 't55'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider which rules can generate each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work backwards, starting from the beginning symbol S and see how it can derive the entire string.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using memoization or recursive descent parsing, but that would require writing a parser, which I can't do here.\n\nAn alternative approach is to see if each term can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it would help to see that each NTX corresponds to a specific production chain. If I can map each 'tX' to a series of productions that can derive that term, then the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at 't55', can any derivation in the grammar end with 55? Looking through the rules, I see that:\n\nNT42 has a production NT42 \u2192 't27' (I need to check that). Wait, in the given grammar, looking at NT42:\n\nNT42 -> 't27' ?\n\nWait, let's list all NT42 rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT27 NT57\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT28 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT8 NT49\n- NT42 \u2192 NT28 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 NT43 NT57\n- NT42 \u2192 NT8 NT48\n- NT42 \u2192 NT54 NT54\n- NT42 \u2192 NT26 NT49\n- NT42 \u2192 NT28 NT55\n- NT42 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT45 \u2192 't10'\n- NT888... Hmm, I'm looking in the grammar, I don't see a direct rule that produces 't55'. Wait, looking at NT42's rules, I see one rule that ends with 't55':\n\nWait, NT42's production NT42 -> NT28 NT55. So, if NT28 can derive a string that ends with 't55', but actually, that's a production that results in NT28 and NT55. So, to get 't55', I think we'd have to have something like NT55 -> 't55', but checking the grammar, I don't see such a rule. Wait, let me see the NT55 list.\n\nWait, the grammar only goes up to NT58 or something? Wait, looking through the grammar, N terminals are from NT1 to maybe NT58. Let me check if there's an NT55 rule that produces 't55' directly.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT42 has a rule NT42 \u2192 NT28 NT55.\n\nWait, that's a production of NT42. So, if NT42 is generated by S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, perhaps in the derivation, S leads to NT18 NT42.\n\nWait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S starts as NT18 and NT42.\n\nNow, let's try to derive T55 t22 t45... step by step.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is 't55'. So, starting from S, can the initial NT18 and NT42 generate 't55' as the first symbol?\n\nLooking at NT18's productions.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 and NT18 -> 't10'.\n\nSo NT18 can produce 't10' or more non-terminals.\n\nTo produce 't55' as the first symbol, the first step is to have NT18 produce 't10' and the rest? But wait, 't55' is first, which doesn't match 't10', unless I have to look deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again: S\u2192NT18 NT42. So the initial step is to produce something from NT18, then something from NT42.\n\nSo the first terminal in the string is 't55', which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal and a non-terminal, or two non-terminals. That's helpful because I can apply specific parsing methods, like CYK, to determine if the string is valid.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar again to make sure I have it correctly. The non-terminals are T18, T5, T22, T41, T42, T2, T4, T18, T27, T9, T58, T42 again... Wait, no, actually, looking at the rules, the non-terminals are all the NT labels like NT18, NT23, NT5, etc. But in the string, we have terminals starting with 't', like t54, t53, etc. The grammar productions are the S, NT, and the rules with the non-terminals and the t's.\n\nSo, the given string is a sequence of terminals, which should be produced by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t54 t53 t43 t31 t9 t45 t40 t12 t43 t35 t33 t45 t36 t54 t27 t12 t55 t33 t10 t11 t27 t38 t22 t45 t35 t48 t54 t43 t53 t28 t33 t40`.\n\nI need to parse this string and see if it fits the grammar.

Wait, no, in the given grammar, almost all productions are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except some that directly produce a terminal. For example, NT2 -> 't28', so that's a terminal.\n\nSo the CYK table will have the string's tokens as the columns and the length as the rows.\n\nThe string is 31 tokens long. So the CYK table will have 31 columns and 31 rows, which sounds complicated, but maybe I can find the necessary productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token can be derived from the start symbol S. But since the string is long, it's better to try to parse it.\n\nLet me see the structure of the grammar:\n\nLooking at the start symbol S -> NT18 NT42. So the string must start with something that can produce NT18 followed by something that can produce NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18: its production is NT23 NT57 (from NT18 -> NT23 NT57). So after S, we have NT23 and NT57.\n\nWait, the string starts with t54 t53 t43 t31... Let me check.\n\nWait, let's try to find a possible parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use memoization to check possible derivations.\n\nBut this might take too long.

I can check which non-terminals can produce t54.\n\nLooking at the productions, the only terminal is 't54' in NT54's production (NT54 -> 't33').

This structure allows for recursive parsing, often managed by parsers likeLL(1) or recursive descent.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most of the productions are in CNF, but I might spot a few exceptions.

Some have cycles, like NT25 appearing in a production of NT23, but I think in this case, it's just leading to terminals.\n\nThe string to parse is a sequence of 't' followed by a number, like t7, t36, etc. These are terminals, which suggests that each 't' followed by a number is a single terminal symbol. So, each token in the string represents a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, the first step is to parse the string as a sequence of these terminal symbols and see if there's a derivation path that leads to the entire string.\n\nI notice that the start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. The string starts with t7, which is part of NT18 or NT42? Let's look at the productions for NT18 (if any) but wait, I check the given productions and I don't see any NT18 on the left side except in the initial S production as NT18. Then, looking at what NT18 produces: NT23 NT57. So, starting from NT18, we can go to NT23 and NT57.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t7. Let's see if t7 can come from any production. Scanning through, I see NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38, but that's not t7. Wait, but I notice that there's a NT57 \u2192 t31. So t7 is actually 't7' in the string. Wait, no, the string starts with t7. Let me see if there's a non-terminal that directly produces t7 or leads to it.\n\nLooking over the productions, the only 't' terminals are on the right-hand side of NT57: NT57 \u2192 t31. Wait, no, looking again, I see that NT57 is actually written as NT57 \u2192 t31. Similarly, NT51 \u2192 t7. So, NT51 directly produces t7, and NT57 directly produces t31.\n\nWait, let me confirm. In the list of productions, there are several:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 t7\n- NT53 \u2192 t31\n- NT27 \u2192 t22\n- NT38 \u2192 t12\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT23 \u2192 t6\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT27 \u2192 t22\n- NT28 \u2192 t55\n- NT42 \u2192 t54\n- NT47 \u2192 t21\n- NT38 \u2192 t12\n- NT58 \u2192 t41\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT26 \u2192 t23\n- NT28 \u2192 t55\n- NT13 \u2192 t11\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT57 \u2192 t31\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT36 \u2192 t36\n- NT43 \u2192 t47\n- NT42 \u2192 t54\n- NT47 \u2192 t21\n- NT38 \u2192 t12\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT26 \u2192 t23\n- NT28 \u2192 t55\n- NT13 \u2192 t11\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT57 \u2192 t31\n\nWait, looking at NT51 \u2192 t7, which is exactly the first token t7 in the string. So, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, then NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So S can expand to NT23 NT57 NT42. Or is it? Let me clarify.\n\nThe start production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Then, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, S can become NT23 NT57 NT42. Now, the string's first token is t7, which comes from NT51 \u2192 t7, but where is NT51 coming from? Unless I'm mixing up the NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. The productions for NTs are:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nLooking at NT23: the productions show NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Wait, and NT26 \u2192 NT23. That's a cycle between NT23 and NT26.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first part is t7 t36 t57... So, after NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, the first part is t7.\n\nBut where does t7 come from? Let's check all productions for any NT that can derive t7.\n\nLooking through the provided productions, I see:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 t7\n- NT57 \u2192 t31 (but that's not t7)\n- NT26 \u2192 t23\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- Wait, I don't see any other productions deriving t7 except NT51 \u2192 t7.\n\nSo, t7 must come from NT51. Looking back, how can we reach NT51?\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which is (T18, T42) pair.\n\nFrom S, T18 expands to (T23, T57). So, the S becomes T23 T57 T42.\n\nNow, T23 expands to (T26, T54). T26 can only produce itself, so it would have to be a chain of self- productions. But in the given grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT23 (from NT26's production: NT26 \u2192 NT23). So, if T23 \u2192 T26, which \u2192 T23 again. So this creates an infinite loop without progress.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t7 (which is NT51), the next token is t36, which implies that after NT18 has produced NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-624","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because all the rules have two non-terminals on the right side or directly produce a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t7 t49 t55 t28 t48 t54 t9 t57 t51 t31 t51 t6 t12 t31 t36 t31 t38 t50 t50 t6 t21 t22 t27 t36 t27 t43 t38 t22 t6 t35 t6 t9`.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's efficient to use the Earley-Corasick algorithm or something similar, but maybe I can manually parse the string.\n\nI'll start by listing all the terminal symbols in the string to see if any are missing, but more importantly, I need to see how they can be combined according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it's a sequence of t's with numbers. I need to match these to the productions. Let's look for the start symbol, which is S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first production must be NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with `t6`, so we need to see if t6 can be part of NT18 or NT42.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that some symbols are terminals and some are non-terminals. For example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 is another non-terminal, and NT57 is another.\n\nWait, but we need to track the entire string step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree for the string. Each rule in the grammar can branch into two non-terminals or, if a terminal, directly produce a token.\n\nLet me try to go step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 33 tokens. Starting with S, which is NT18 and NT42. So the string must start with the productions of NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 is a non-terminal, which can further split.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 NT27? Wait, no, NT26 is another non-terminal: NT26 \u2192 NT9 NT36. Wait no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules are such that each NT(X) is a production. So for example, NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22, etc.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string starts with NT18's production, which is NT23 NT57. Then the next part would be NT23 and NT57.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t6. So let's check which non-terminals have rules that can produce t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT42 can produce 't27', 't28', 't54', etc.\n\nWait, let me look for all the non-terminals that have terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 and also NT5 produces t40? Wait, let me check each rule to find which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, I think I need to list all the non-terminals that directly produce a terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT18 \u2192 ... wait, NT18's production is NT23 NT57. That's a non-terminal, not a terminal. Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's re-examine each rule:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nNT9 -> 't35'\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nNT36 -> 't48'\n\nNT38 -> 't53'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT8 -> 't47' (Wait, there's a rule NT8 -> 't47' as well? Or is that another?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT18's production is NT23 NT57: so if either of those non-terminals produces a terminal, then NT18 would produce that.\n\nBut I think this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to model this as a recursive descent parser.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the parsing as a top-down approach using the grammar.\n\nGiven the start symbol S, the first expansion is NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, the string should start with the expansion of NT18 followed by the expansion of NT42.\n\nSo, the first two symbols must be generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t6.\n\nLet me check if t6 can be part of NT18. Wait, no, because NT18's production is NT23 NT57, which doesn't produce a terminal, so NT18 must expand into NT23 and NT57.\n\nSo, after NT18, we expect NT23 and NT57, and then NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, after t6, the next tokens are t7, t49... so let's see:\n\nt6 could be part of NT23 or NT57.\n\nWait, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nBut I need to see if t6 is in NT23 or NT57.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT26 \u2192 't49' and NT57 \u2192 't31'. So:\n\nIf we have NT23, which expands into NT26 and NT54. If NT26 is 't49' and NT54 is 't33', then NT23 would produce t49 t33. But in the string, after t6, the next tokens are t7, t49, so maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t6 is part of NT26. Wait, NT26 is a non-terminal, so it must expand into its productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps I should look for the t6 in the grammar.\n\nLook through the rules to see which NT produces t6.\n\nChecking each rule:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t6. So perhaps t6 must be part of a deeper derivation.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce t6?\n\nLooking through all the right-hand sides:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT42 \u2192 't27', 't28', 't44'\n\nWait, no: NT42 has production to 't27', 't28', etc. Similarly, NT27 has productions to NT42 and NT43.\n\nBut I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t6. So maybe the string starts with a production that includes t6 as a terminal, but according to the grammar, there's no NT that produces t6 directly.

{"custom_id":"request-623","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That seems to be the case here since all the productions are followed by either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t9 t7 t45 t23 t28 t54 t38 t48 t55 t7 t23 t27 t21 t55 t35 t21 t10 t51 t54 t47 t31 t43 t43 t31 t54 t53 t47 t45 t31 t38 t45 t21`.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand how this grammar works. Since it's in CNF, the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps some productions have a terminal as the RHS. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (Wait, this seems different. It's NT42 \u2192 NT4 and NT13, which are both non-terminals? Or are these terminals? Hmm, looking at the list again, NT42 \u2192 't27'. No, in the given productions, some have 't' followed by a number, which I think are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to note that some NTs are terminals. The productions where the RHS is 't' followed by a number are terminal productions. So, for example, NT2 \u2192 't28' means NT2 can be replaced by the terminal 't28'.\n\nSo each production is either A \u2192 BC (where B and C are non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (where a is a terminal). That confirms it's in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. So all the elements in the string are terminals.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So the root of the parse tree would be S, and the two children would be NT18 and NT42. Each of these NTs will produce two other elements, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it alternates between terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014the entire string is a sequence of terminals: t53, t9, t7, etc., all 't's followed by numbers. So each element is a terminal. That might complicate things because in the grammar, most productions involve non-terminals, except when a production directly produces a terminal.\n\nSo I think each step in the parse must consume a terminal from the string.\n\nSo, let me start breaking down the string.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t53\n2. t9\n3. t7\n4. t45\n5. t23\n6. t28\n7. t54\n8. t38\n9. t48\n10. t55\n11. t7\n12. t23\n13. t27\n14. t21\n15. t55\n16. t35\n17. t21\n18. t10\n19. t51\n20. t54\n21. t47\n22. t31\n23. t43\n24. t43\n25. t31\n26. t54\n27. t53\n28. t47\n29. t45\n30. t31\n31. t38\n32. t45\n33. t21\n\nThat's 33 elements. So the parse tree must have a structure that, when expanded, produces 33 terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So each non-terminal at any point must be replaced by two elements, which can be a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is all terminals, the leaves of the parse tree must be all terminals. So each time we expand a non-terminal, we must be able to derive a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that result in terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT7 (Wait, do any of the non-terminals produce 't7'? Let me check. Looking at the productions: NT35 \u2192 't35' (no, that's NT35). Wait, looking through the list, I don't see any that produce 't7' directly. Hmm, but maybe NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and let's see what NT57 produces. Let me find NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. Wait, trying to find a non-terminal that directly produces 't7'. Looking back at the list, NT7 seems not present. Maybe there's a mistake. Wait, NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53; NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58; NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43; NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9; etc. Hmm, perhaps no non-terminal directly produces 't7' except maybe in one of the productions.\n\nWait, looking through the given productions again:\n\nLet me list all productions and see if any directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT23 \u2192 't49'?

{"custom_id":"request-649","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit long with a lot of production rules, so I need to carefully go through it. The string to evaluate is `t27 t51 t27 t36 t23 t10 t47 t21 t36 t11 t50 t43 t50 t55 t50 t40 t33 t35 t53 t6 t21 t27 t31 t10 t54 t11 t40 t9 t10 t38 t48 t9 t27 t23`. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing and can be checked using algorithms like CYK, but since the grammar and string are provided, maybe I can parse the string step by step using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S in the grammar: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with NT18 producing t10 because looking at the production for NT18, it's defined as NT23 NT57, which then both produce 't's. Wait, let me check the NT18 rule: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, NT26 \u2192 t49? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the rules for NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, but NT26 seems to have multiple rules, one of which is NT26 \u2192 t49. Oh, and looking back, there's another NT26 rule: NT26 \u2192 NT28. Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string using the CFG rules. The first step is to see what S can produce. S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols in the string must be derived from NT18 and NT42. Let me check what NT18 and NT42 produce.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT57 is another rule: NT57 \u2192 t31.\n\nSo NT18 produces t23 and t57 as terminals when certain other production rules are followed.\n\nWait, no, wait. Actually, in CNF, each rule replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, unless it's a terminal. So, for NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, NT23 and NT57 are both non-terminals that will produce their own symbols or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking again, the NT18's production is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, the NT23 is \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26: let's see, NT26 can be \u2192 t49, or it can be \u2192 NT28. NT28 has production \u2192 t50. So NT26 can become t49 or NT28, which is t50. Similarly, NT54 is \u2192 t33 or \u2192 NT35, but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each NT to what they produce in terminals or further non-terminals. Maybe making a tree for the string would help.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start with the string and see if it can be decomposed into the grammar rules step by step.\n\nLet me list the string again: `t27 t51 t27 t36 t23 t10 t47 t21 t36 t11 t50 t43 t50 t55 t50 t40 t33 t35 t53 t6 t21 t27 t31 t10 t54 t11 t40 t9 t10 t38 t48 t9 t27 t23`.\n\nWait, the first two symbols are t27 and t51. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t27 and t51?\n\nLooking for t27: looking through the rules, NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. So t27 is derived from NT27, which is \u2192 NT42 NT43. Then, NT42 \u2192 t27, so it's a terminal, and NT43 \u2192 t38.\n\nSo that would make t27 from NT27\u2192 t27 t38. Hmm, is that correct? Wait, let me check NT42 and NT43.\n\nWait, according to the grammar rules:\n- NT42 \u2192 NT27 NT43\n- NT43 \u2192 t38.\n\nSo NT42 produces NT27 and NT43, which in turn becomes t27 and t38, so overall NT42 can produce t27 t38. But wait, in the string, the first two symbols are t27 t51. So t27 would have to come from NT27, but that's derived from NT42. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t27, so for t27 to appear, it must be produced by NT27. NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nThen, T27: NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43 \u2192 t27 t38. So the production is t27 t38, but the first two symbols are t27 t51, so that seems incorrect. Unless t51 comes from another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm going the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbols t27 and t51 come from NT27 and NT51. Let me check:\n\nLooking for t51: NT51 \u2192 t7. So t51 is produced by NT51, which is a non-terminal that produces t7, a terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with t27 t51, so the first part is t27 (NT27) and t51 (NT51). But NT27 and NT51 are separate non-terminals. How are they connected? Because S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So to produce t27 t51, it would require NT18 NT42 to produce t27 and t51 in one step, but that's not possible because each non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, that suggests that t27 t51 cannot be produced directly from S because S is NT18 NT42, each of which would produce two symbols, not single terminals. So perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe the string isn't valid, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rules. Let me look for the production S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which produces two non-terminals. Each of those can then expand into two, and so on, until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the parsing would split the non-terminals into their expansions, leading to a binary tree structure where each node is a non-terminal and expands into two child non-terminals, until leaves are terminals.\n\nBut the string provided is linear, so maybe the overall structure is such that the expansion can be reduced to the string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a parsing process, but maybe it's easier to check for consistency.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the starting symbol S can derive the given string by substituting the rules step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string uses symbols that are not present as terminals in the grammar, but looking back, all symbols in the string are the t's, like t10, t27, t51, etc. So perhaps I should see if these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nSo let's take the first symbol t27. Looking at the grammar, t27 comes from NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. Then, NT42 \u2192 t27 t38, but wait, no: looking at the rules, NT42's production is NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41, or is it? Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, checking the rules again:\n\nLooking for NT42: the production rules for NT42 are:\n- NT42 -> NT27 NT43\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT42 -> 't42'\n\nWait, no, I think earlier, I might have confused NT42 with other rules.

The string is: t9 t7 t55 t55 t40 t35 t49 t9 t48 t43 t35 t48 t43 t35 t43 t35 t55 t57 t45 t33 t27 t28 t21 t9 t33 t57 t54 t40 t35 t6 t54 t35 t21 t9.\n\nSo the string starts with 't9', but in the grammar, the first step from S produces NT18 NT42. So if S produces NT18 NT42, these are non-terminals, so the next step would be to replace them with their respective rules.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol in the string is 't9'. So let's see: If NT18 can produce 't10' or other non-terminals. Looking at NT18:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 | 't10'\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't9', not 't10'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar rules again for NT18: Oh, looking back, there's another production for NT18: `NT18 -> NT23 NT57`. Wait, but the first part is NT18 -> 't10'... Or did I misread the grammar? \n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT18 NT42. Then looking at NT18:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- Also, NT18 -> 't10'\n\nSo NT18 can produce 't10' or other non-terminals which may further produce terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't9', which isn't 't10' or 't9'? Wait, looking at the grammar for 't9' symbols:\n\nLooking through the terminals, I see NT5 -> 't40', NT2 -> 't28', NT4 -> 't9', etc. So 't9' comes from NT4.\n\nWait, but if S produces NT18 NT42, which are non-terminals, the string should be built from expanding these into terminals through production rules.\n\nSo let's try to see if the string can be built step by step. The first symbol is 't9', so let's see which non-terminal can produce 't9'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 can produce 't9' (from the rule NT4 -> 't9').\n\nSo for the first symbol 't9', it must come from expanding NT4. But NT4 is part of the production S -> NT18 NT42. So how does that connect?\n\nWait, S is NT18 NT42. So the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT18 expands to and what NT42 expands to.\n\nSo the string is split into two parts: the first part comes from NT18, the second from NT42.\n\nBut looking at the string: \"t9 t7 t55 t55 t40 t35 t49 t9 t48 t43 t35 t48 t43 t35 t43 t35 t55 t57 t45 t33 t27 t28 t21 t9 t33 t57 t54 t40 t35 t6 t54 t35 t21 t9\".\n\nThat's a total of 39 tokens. Since S produces NT18 and NT42, each of these non-terminals should expand into a sequence of terminals, and the concatenation should be 39 tokens. So maybe the total number of tokens from NT18 and NT42 add up to 39.\n\nLet me check the production rules for each non-terminal involved.\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42. So the string will start with NT18's expansion followed by NT42's expansion.\n\nFirst, let's process NT18:\n\nLooking at NT18's rules:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 or 't10'\n\nBut the first symbol is 't9', which is not 't10' or part of NT23 or NT57. Hmm, this is confusing because 't9' is produced by NT4, but S starts with NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, maybe S can expand in a way that one part is NT4, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe NT18 can expand to a terminal 't9' somehow, but looking at the rules for NT18, I don't see that. NT18 can only produce 't10' or non-terminals that expand to 't10's.\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo or I'm misreading the rules. Let's re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at NT18:\n\nYes, it's only:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nand\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nWait, so NT18 can only produce 't10' as a terminal, not 't9'. That's a problem because our string starts with 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar because the first symbol 't9' doesn't match any production of the starting symbol S.\n\nWait, no. The starting symbol S is NT18 NT42, which are both non-terminals. So the entire string is derived by replacing NT18 and NT42 into their respective expansions, and the resulting string is all the terminals from both expansions concatenated.\n\nSo the string starts with NT18's expansion, and then NT42's.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't9', that 't9' must come from NT18's expansion. But looking at the production rules, NT18 can only produce 't10's or other non-terminals leading to 't10's. So 't9' cannot be part of NT18's expansion.\n\nThus, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first token is 't9', which doesn't appear in S's expansion.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nIs there a way for NT18 to produce a 't9'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT18 that results in 't9'. The only terminal for NT18 is 't10'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't9', but that can't come from NT18. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe S is expanded into NT18 and NT42, but in between, there are other non-terminals that can produce 't9'. Maybe the structure is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is being parsed as a sequence that can be split into two parts, each expanded from NT18 and NT42, leading to the 't9' somewhere else. But that would require the first part of the string being something else, but the first token is 't9', so it must come from NT18's expansion.\n\nGiven that, and NT18 not being able to produce 't9', the string cannot be generated.\n\nSo the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: \n\n`t51 t36 t27 t35 t50 t50 t22 t35 t23 t48 t38 t40 t27 t47 t49 t10 t9 t51 t11 t11 t10 t49 t23 t51 t7 t6 t43 t47 t43 t57 t9 t45 t22 t31 t47`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the strings are sequences of terminals, so we're checking if this string can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe grammar has multiple non-terminals and each rule seems to eventually lead to a terminal. To determine if the string is in the language, I think I should try to parse the string using the grammar, seeing if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t followed by numbers. The first step is to see how the start symbol S can split into NT18 and NT42, as per S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, first two parts should be NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string, it's t51. Wait, but NT18 is 't10'. So that's a problem. Because NT18 -> 't10', but the first token is t51. Wait, wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Let's look at the production rules for NT18. Looking back, the grammar rules, I see NT18 -> NT23 NT57 and also NT18 -> 't10'. Similarly for NT5: NT5 -> NT23 NT47 and also 't40'. So NT18 can produce either a sequence of two non-terminals or the terminal t10. The string starts with t51, which doesn't directly match any of these.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to backtrack. Let me check the productions for all NTs.\n\nLooking at NT5: It can produce NT23 NT47 or 't40'. So NT5 can be a terminal or a combination.\n\nSimilarly, each non-terminal might be able to produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with t51, which is a terminal. So perhaps NT18 or another non-terminal must be able to produce t51.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I notice NT35. Wait, there's no NT35 in the rules provided. Wait, maybe I'm looking for the right production. For example, NT18 -> NT23 NT57 or 't10'. So NT18 can only produce t10 or two non-terminals. Similarly, for other NTs.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through each rule, the terminals are:\n\nt10, t11, t21, t22 (appears multiple times), t23, t27, t28, t35, t36, t38, t40, t43, t45, t47, t49, t50, t51, t53, t54, t57, t36.\n\nSo, looking for t51. Checking if any rule has t51 as a terminal. I see:\n\n- NT38 -> 't51'\n- NT7 is not present, but wait, the string has t51 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, only NT38 can produce 't51'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first few ts include t51, which must come from NT38 -> t51.\n\nBut in the initial step, S produces NT18 and NT42. So how does NT18 or NT42 produce NT38?\n\nWait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me clarify:\n\nS produces NT18 and NT42. The string starts with t51. So to generate t51, that must come from NT38. Therefore, the NT38 must have been able to reach t51. But in the initial split, S splits into NT18 and NT42. So does that mean that the first part is NT18 generating t51? No, because S->NT18 NT42, meaning the first two tokens come from NT18 and NT42, respectively or vice versa? Wait, no, actually in context-free grammars, the productions are for the non-terminals, so NT18 and NT42 produce sequences of terminals and non-terminals. So the entire string is a concatenation of NT18's derivation and NT42's derivation.\n\nWait, let me clarify that. The start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT18's expansion and NT42's expansion. So the first part is whatever NT18 produces, and the second part is whatever NT42 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, it's the first token is t51, which likely comes from NT42's expansion, not NT18's, because S has NT18 first, then NT42. Wait no, the order is NT18 NT42, so NT18 produces the first part, and NT42 the second. Or maybe it's the concatenation of their expansions. So whatever NT18 can produce is first, then whatever NT42 can produce.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t51, which as I saw earlier is only produced by NT38. So how is that possible if S's expansion starts with NT18? Unless NT18 somehow can produce t51 and NT42 also produces something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if NT18 can produce a terminal, which is t51. But looking at NT18, the production rules are NT18 -> NT23 NT57 or 't10'. So NT18 only produces t10 or a combination of NT23 and NT57. There's no way for NT18 to produce t51. That suggests a problem because the first token is t51.\n\nWait, that seems like a dead end. Unless I got the initial step wrong. Maybe NT18 can expand to something that then further expands to t51. Like, maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, no. NT18's only options are to produce 't10' or NT23 NT57. So NT18 can only directly produce t10 or a combination. So to get t51, it has to come from NT23, perhaps, if NT23 can produce t51.\n\nLooking at NT23's production rules: It can be 't26', 't48' or NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, no, looking back: NT23 -> NT26 NT54 or 't48'.\n\nSo NT23 can only produce 't48' directly or a combination. So t48 is a terminal, but not t51.\n\nLooking for how t51 is produced. As I saw, only NT38 can produce 't51'.\n\nSo maybe I need to see if NT23 can go somewhere else, but no, NT23 is defined as:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54 | 't48'\n\nSimilarly, NT26 is:\n\nNT26 -> NT49 | 't23'\n\nSo NT26 can produce 't23' or NT49, which produces 't49'.\n\nWait, but how can we get t51? Because it seems that t51 is only produced by NT38. So unless a non-terminal can expand into NT38, which it can't because the productions of the non-terminals don't list NT38, except as a child of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking further, is there any production that leads to NT38 being a child of some other non-terminal? Let me check all the production rules:\n\nLooking through each rule, the NTs appear in pairings, like NT38 is only a terminal. The production for NT38 is 't38' which only happens sometimes, but the string has 't51', so which comes from NT38 -> t51.\n\nBut to get the string's first token t51, that must be from NT38. But S's expansion is NT18 and NT42. So how can NT18 produce t51?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the initial split. Wait, the grammar S has two parts: NT18 and NT42. So the entire string is the concatenation of what NT18 generates and NT42 generates.\n\nIn the given string, the first token is t51. But in the grammar, NT18 cannot produce t51 directly.

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow that structure since all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S->NT18 NT42, NT5->NT23 NT47, etc. At the bottom, some non-terminals directly expand into terminals like NT2->'t28'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t22 t12 t55 t11 t48 t47 t35 t55 t21 t33 t55 t45 t33 t50 t50 t35 t23 t6 t33 t23 t6 t54 t55 t51 t22 t35 t31 t51 t54 t22 t43 t55 t53 t9`. \n\nSo, I need to find a way to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing can be done using either top-down (like recursive descent or using a Pratt parser) or bottom-up methods. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent might be a good approach. Alternatively, I could look for derivations step by step.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, each separated by a space. The grammar's start symbol is S, which is a non-terminal. So the entire string must be a derivation starting from S and ultimately resulting in all the symbols of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string as a series of expansions starting from S and breaking down each non-terminal into terminals or other non-terminals until the entire string is covered.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and terminals:\n\nNon-terminals: S, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT9, etc. (Looking at the productions, I see NT2 to NT59, I think.)\n\nTerminals: 't12', 't22', 't12', etc., up to 't9'.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of these terminals. So, I need to see if starting from S, the non-terminals can be expanded such that each production eventually leads to matching terminal symbols in the given order.\n\nSince each production either has two non-terminals or one terminal, I need to process the string from left to right, matching the longest possible prefix at each step.\n\nWait, but how do I know if the string can be generated? Maybe it's easier to try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the string as a list and attempt to match against the grammar. Starting from S, the first step is S-> NT18 NT42. So the string starts with `t12`, but wait, according to the grammar, NT18 is 't10', right? Wait no, let me look at the grammar.\n\nWait, NT18 is 't10' because NT18->NT23 NT57, but wait that can't be. Wait, the terminal for NT18 is actually 't10'? Let me check the list of rules.\n\nLooking back: NT18 is rewritten as NT23 NT57, which are both non-terminals. Wait, but then why is NT18 written as 't10'? Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Wait, no, each non-terminal's production might have terminals, but not all. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the rules for non-terminals end with some terminals, but most have two non-terminals. Let me look for NT18's expansion. I see NT18->NT23 NT57. But I also see NT18->NT23 NT57, and another rule NT18-> 't10'? No, looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT18->NT23 NT57, and also another rule NT18->NT18 NT23, which is probably not correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, actually looking at the provided rules:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nBut earlier:\n\nLooking through the rules list:\n\n- S->NT18 NT42\n\n- NT18->NT23 NT57\n\nSo NT18 is a non-terminal that expands to two NT's. Hmm, but in the string, the first token is 't12', so perhaps S's first production NT18 must expand to 't12', but looking at the grammar, NT18 only expands to NT23 NT57, which are non-terminals. So that would mean that NT18 can't produce a terminal 't12' directly, which contradicts the string's first symbol.\n\nWait, but in the given rules I have:\n\n- NT18->NT23 NT57\n\nWait, where is the production that leads to 't12'? Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT producing 't12' directly except possibly in some cases.\n\nWait, let's list out all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22->NT36 NT53\n\nNT41->NT51 NT45\n\nNT42->NT2 NT38\n\nNT2->NT10 NT22\n\nNT4->NT8 NT10\n\nNT18->NT23 NT57\n\nNT27->NT42 NT43\n\nNT9->NT40 NT28\n\nNT58->NT42 NT41\n\nNT42->NT4 NT13\n\nNT22->NT2 NT9\n\nNT28->NT4 NT40\n\nNT8->NT54 NT49\n\nNT23->NT26 NT54\n\nNT8->NT47 NT4\n\nNT36->NT27 NT58\n\nNT28->NT43 NT5\n\nNT53->NT42 NT38\n\nNT9->NT40 NT28\n\nNT5->NT40\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted, maybe.

So, the first part of the string is 't12', which would have to come from the expansion of NT18 and NT42. But since NT18 can't directly produce 't12', that suggests that perhaps the string starts with 't12', which can't come from NT18. Therefore, it might be impossible, but I must verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-685","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. My task is to figure out whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has production rules where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I'll check if the given grammar follows this structure. Looking through the rules, I see that most are of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT... or NT... \u2192 't...'. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42 is a two-symbol production, and others are similar. The terminals are represented with 't' followed by some number. So, yes, the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to determine if the string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols: t51, t49, t11, ..., t51, etc. Each non-terminal in the grammar must be expanded into the correct sequence of terminals.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to parse the string from the top down using the grammar. Or perhaps to build a parse tree step by step, ensuring that each production is applicable. Since the string is quite long, this might take some time, but let me try.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first rule S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT18 followed by NT42. So, the first part of the string should correspond to NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t51. So, we need to see if t51 can be derived from NT18 and NT42. Let me find the production rules for NT18 and NT42 in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. That's a two-step non-terminal production. Similarly, NT42 has multiple productions. Let me see.\n\nLet me list out the productions for NT18 and NT42:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT57 \u2192 NT31 NT58\n- NT31 \u2192 NT49 NT45\n- NT45 \u2192 NT10 NT26\n- NT10 \u2192 NT43 NT4\n- Wait, but these go on and on, perhaps it's too deep.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to look for possible terminals in the string that match the production rules. Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to match it against the grammar.\n\nEach production in the grammar can be read as a possible step in the reverse direction. That is, if the string starts with certain symbols, we can check if those symbols can be replaced by a non-terminal according to the grammar.\n\nSo, let's split the string into tokens:\n\nt51, t49, t11, t53, t45, t36, t45, t7, t53, t35, t48, t38, t10, t47, t6, t22, t50, t9, t23, t28, t49, t50, t28, t50, t47, t38, t48, t21, t57, t35, t51, t21, t49, t22, t31, t49.\n\nBut I think I miscounted the string. Let me recount the tokens to make sure I have the correct sequence.\n\nThe string: t51 t49 t11 t53 t45 t36 t45 t7 t53 t35 t48 t38 t10 t47 t6 t22 t50 t9 t23 t28 t49 t50 t28 t50 t47 t38 t48 t21 t57 t35 t51 t21 t49 t22 t31 t49.\n\nYes, that's 39 tokens.\n\nTo parse this, perhaps I can start from the rightmost part and try to see if the non-terminals can derive these terminal symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production is two steps, so the string should be compatible with the leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The start symbol S has two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. So, the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT18 and NT42 in that order.\n\nI'll split the string into two parts: the first part derived from NT18 and the second part from NT42. So, let's say the first k tokens come from NT18 and the remaining (39 - k) tokens from NT42. I need to find a k such that the first k tokens can be derived from NT18 and the next (39 -k) from NT42.\n\nBut how do I determine k? Maybe I can try to find possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the two parts can derive into the string. Let me look at the strings generated by NT18 and NT42 separately.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT18:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nEach of these non-terminals can have their own productions, but this seems to go on and on, leading into a chain of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking at NT23 and NT57:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT31 NT58\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT49 NT45\n\nWait, this chain might continue until it reaches a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT45 \u2192 NT10 NT26.\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT43 NT4.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT47\n\nSo, NT43 becomes t47, which is the terminal. Similarly, NT4 is t9.\n\nSo, maybe the expansion of NT57 would lead to terminals through NT31, NT49, NT45, etc., down to t47, t9, and perhaps others.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT29 NT49 (Wait, no, let me check: Looking back, the productions for NT26: I think the rules are:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, double-checking:\n\nLooking back, when I look at NT23, it goes to NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT29 NT49? Hmm, wait no. Looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are more detailed. Let me list all the rules:\n\nHere are the relevant rules I can see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 NT29 NT49\n- NT29 \u2192 NT27 NT60 (Wait, but in the initial data, I see something like NT26 \u2192 t49, but that's a bit unclear.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should go step by step.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the string can be split into an S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and each non-terminal in NT18 and NT42 must expand into a sequence that, when concatenated, equals the given string.\n\nGiven the string, I can perhaps try building the parse tree from the start and see if it fits.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT18 and NT42.\n\nNow, let me look at the string. The first token is t51, which appears again later in the string (positions 30 and 33). This suggests that a non-terminal that expands into t51 might be appearing in both parts.\n\nLooking for possible starts with t51 in the string:\n\nt51 appears at position 1, 27.\n\nWait, position 1 is the first token, and position 27 is around the middle.\n\nBut perhaps t51 is derived from NT18, which would be the first part.\n\nBut perhaps I need a better method.\n\nLet me try a parse tree approach.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nSo, NT18 \u2192 ... and NT42 \u2192 ...\n\nThe first token is t51. So, perhaps the expansion of NT18 starts with t51, which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions of NT18, it goes to NT23 NT57. Both are non-terminals, so NT18 cannot be a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-704","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is `t51 t6 t31 t22 t47 t28 t36 t7 t49 t50 t11 t40 t28 t43 t57 t40 t31 t28 t43 t7 t45 t23 t31 t35 t40 t47 t21 t49 t27 t11 t38 t11 t43 t27 t10 t50 t35`. \n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal might be a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, some productions have terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string is composed of terminal symbols: t10, t11, t21, t22, t23, t27, t28, t31, t35, t36, t38, t40, t43, t45, t47, t49, t50, etc. So, the string is in the form of a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. Let me check if the grammar is in proper CNF. Each production seems to have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except some that end in a terminal. Wait, no, some have two terminals. Wait, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, but if a production has a terminal, it can only have one terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the productions are either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most productions have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Others, like NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, are also non-terminals. But I notice that some non-terminals have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, such as S \u2192 NT18 NT42, but others might have different combinations. Wait, no, in CNF, each production can only have two symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals. Wait, but in standard CNF, it's allowed to have A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, but in this case, perhaps the grammar is more like extended from CNF, allowing for more than two symbols in the right-hand side? Or maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Alternatively, perhaps it's still in CNF, and some non-terminals produce terminals with other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5 (is that correct?), and NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47. So each production is splitting into two parts, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So the grammar is in a form where each step can produce two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. However, in standard CNF, all productions are splits into two non-terminals, but perhaps this grammar is a mix.\n\nGiven that, it's a bit tricky. But since the grammar is presented, perhaps it's an extended form, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe string has many 't' symbols with indices: t51, t6, etc. I'll need to see if these can be generated by the grammar. Let's see if the string can be decomposed into the productions.\n\nWait, but the process of checking this manually seems quite tedious. But perhaps I can think about the structure of the grammar and whether the string can be generated by any subsequence of the productions.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps represent the grammar as a tree and check if the string corresponds to such a tree. But that might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, consider the fact that each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So for the string to be generated, each 't' must eventually be derived from a terminal production, and the non-terminals must expand into sequences that lead to these terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be generated step by step. Let me try to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can generate this string.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nWait, let me look at the first part: 't51 t6 t31 t22 t47 t28 t36 t7 t49 t50 t11 t40 t28 t43 t57 t40 t31 t28 t43 t7 t45 t23 t31 t35 t40 t47 t21 t49 t27 t11 t38 t11 t43 t27 t10 t50 t35'.\n\nLet me check if each terminal can be found by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain 't's are directly produced. For example, NT44 isn't present, but let's see the options. I might need a more structured approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string can be broken down into a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I can attempt to split it into segments that correspond to each production.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the string should start with NT18 and NT42 expanding into sequences that generate the first two terms, and so on.\n\nWait, let's try to see:\n\nThe string starts with t51 t6 ... So maybe NT18 expands to t51 and something else, and NT42 expands to t6 and the rest.\n\nBut I need to see if NT18 can produce t51 and something else, and NT42 can produce t6, possibly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So to get t51, perhaps NT23 or NT57 must produce t51.\n\nLooking at NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 t49 and others. Wait, NT23 could expand into sequences that include t49 and then more steps.\n\nWait, but this seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be parsed by the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a CYK parsing approach, but that's time-consuming.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of each 't' as a terminal that must be generated by some non-terminal, either directly or through the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 't's in the string and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t51: Looking for a production where the right-hand side includes t51. In the grammar, NT47 \u2192 t21, NT26\u2192t49, NT49 \u2192 t45, NT25? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 t49, but t51 doesn't seem directly produced. Wait, wait, checking the grammar, is any production causing a terminal t51? Looking through all the productions, I don't see any production that results in t51 except for cases where a non-terminal expands into t51. So perhaps NT31 \u2192 t31, or another?\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar rules, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. For instance, ND23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Hmm. Wait, perhaps t31 is produced by NT31? Let me check: does any rule have t31 on the right? Let's see: the rules are quite a few. Looking through the list:\n\nYes, for example, NT24 isn't listed, but the rules provided include things like NT31 \u2192 t31? Wait, let me check: in the provided grammar, I see NT36 \u2192 t36, NT43 \u2192 t47, etc. Wait, no, the rules are mostly non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see NT40 \u2192 t6, NT42 \u2192 t27, etc. Wait, in the given rules:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t36 (so that's t36)\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT9 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t54\n- NT7 \u2192 t45\n- NT31 \u2192 t31\n- NT43 \u2192 t47\n- NT28 \u2192 t50\n- Etc.\n\nWait, looking carefully, I realize that many of the non-terminals produce terminals directly.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.

For example, NT8 has multiple productions: NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49 and NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4. Also, some of the t's are directly given, like NT9 \u2192 't35', which is literal.\n\nI think I should represent this as a parse tree, starting from S. Each step, I'll replace a non-terminal with its possible right-hand side until all symbols are replaced and I reach only terminals.\n\nGiven the string, I need to process it from left to right. Let me write down the string to see its structure:\n\nt43 t57 t10 t31 t7 t11 t40 t6 t57 t31 t7 t54 t40 t40 t28 t43 t23 t33 t33 t38 t47 t21 t38 t9 t36 t9 t54 t12 t9 t55 t7 t31 t38 t33 t50 t35 t27.\n\nWait, actually, the string is space-separated, so each token is a terminal like t35, etc.\n\nI'll need to parse each token step by step.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, I need to derive the string starting with NT18 and NT42.\n\nI'll think recursively: to parse the string, first parse NT18, then NT42, and see if they match the string.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, I can look for the productions that directly produce 't' terms, perhaps starting from the left.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t43. So I need to see which non-terminal can produce t43.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for a NT that directly expands to t43.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't57'\n- NT43 \u2192 't12'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT57 \u2192 't31'\n- NT47 \u2192 't21'\n- NT35 \u2192 (Wait, I don't see NT35 in the productions. Hmm.) Maybe I'm missing something. Looking back, the given productions don't include NT35, but in the string, there's a 't35' perhaps?\n\nWait, no: Looking at the string, 't35' is present. Let me check if any NT expands to t35.\n\nLooking back, in the list of productions, I see NT45 \u2192 't10', NT26 \u2192 't49', NT13 \u2192 't11', etc. Hmm, does any NT produce 't35'? Let me check all.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41. Not t.\n- NT57 \u2192 't31'\n- NT43 \u2192 't57' and 't12'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' and others\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11' or NT47 NT4\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT23 \u2192 't26', which isn't a terminal but another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps there's no production that directly produces 't35'. So in the given grammar, 't35' is not present as a terminal, but there's a production NT26 \u2192 't49' and NT28 \u2192 't55'? Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, did I miss a production for a 't35'?\n\nWait no, in the given productions, 't35' does not appear as a terminal. So when I try to parse 't35', which isn't possible because no NT directly expands to 't35', unless it's via multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't35' in the string is a typo or maybe I missed a production. Let me re-examine the list.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't35'. So if the first token is t43, which is produced by NT43. Now, in the string, after t43 comes t57. So can NT43 produce t43, then t57...? Wait, NT43 can be either 't57' or 't12', right? But in the string, after t43 comes t57, so for the production NT43 \u2192 't57' would match t43 t57. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo, so far, the first two tokens are t43 t57, which would match NT43 \u2192 't57' (I think it's a production? Let me check: yes, NT43 can produce 't57' as per the list. So in the list, I see NT43 \u2192 't57' as production number 45. Yes, that's right. So after NT43, the next token is t57, which matches.\n\nNow, after that, the string continues with t10.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t6 t49 t48 t27 t51 t12 t45 t27 t51 t11 t53 t38 t40 t9 t51 t51 t33 t6 t45 t6 t49 t51 t45 t31 t50 t28 t22 t22 t23 t48 t7 t40 t43 t38 t54`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that Chomsky Normal Form grammars can be parsed efficiently using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which checks whether a string is in the language by attempting to build a parse tree. Since the string is quite long, I'll need a systematic approach.\n\nTo apply the CYK algorithm, I must first list all the non-terminals and terminals in the grammar. The terminals are all the strings that appear in the productions on the right side, excluding the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, as given.\n\nLet's list the terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are:\nt36, t6, t49, t48, t27, t51, t12, t45, t27, t51, t11, t53, t38, t40, t9, t51, t51, t33, t6, t45, t6, t49, t51, t45, t31, t50, t28, t22, t22, t23, t48, t7, t40, t43, t38, t54.\n\nSo, the terminals are: t36, t6, t49, t48, t27, t51, t12, t45, t11, t53, t38, t40, t9, t51, t28, t22, t23, t48, t7, t50, t31.\n\nNext, the non-terminals are all the symbols that are not terminals, which are S, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT1, etc. Wait, let me list them properly:\n\nLooking at the productions, the non-terminals are:\nS, NT1, NT2, NT3 (since NT2 is different from NT1?), Wait, no, in CNF, each production's right side must have two non-terminals. Wait, let me parse the productions given.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Then NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT57, NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22, NT3 \u2192 NT22 NT47. Wait, but the original provided list is a bit confusing. I think the user listed all the productions, each as the left-hand side (LHS) followed by the right-hand side (RHS) separated by \u2192, but I have to parse through each line to identify LHS and RHS correctly.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nEach line is separated by '->' so the LHS is on the left, the RHS is on the right, with commas or something. Wait, the user separated each production by an equals sign in the description, but each line is of the form \"NTx -> NTy NTz\". For example, the first line is S -> NT18 NT42, then NT5 -> NT23 NT47, etc.\n\nSo the non-terminals are all the symbols that appear as LHS in these productions. Let me list them:\n\n- S\n- NT1\n- NT2\n- NT3\n- NT4\n- NT5\n- NT9\n- NT18\n- NT22\n- NT27\n- NT28\n- NT36\n- NT38\n- NT4\n- NT42\n- NT43\n- NT45\n- NT54\n- NT53\n- NT58\n- NT8\n- NT26\n- NT49\n- NT36\n- NT53\n- NT42\n- NT47\n- NT51\n- NT18\n- NT26\n- NT28\n- NT43\n- NT45\n- NT40\n- NT26\n- NT28\n- NT13\n- NT49\n- NT27\n- NT28\n- NT55\n- NT57\n- NT8\n- NT44\n- NT5\n- NT36\n- NT43\n- NT47\n- NT42\n- NT47\n- NT38\n- NT54\n\nWait, but some are repeated. Let me list all unique non-terminals:\n\nS, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT8, NT9, NT1, NT18, NT22, NT27, NT28, NT36, NT38, NT40, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT47, NT51, NT53, NT54, NT55, NT57, NT8, NT26, NT27, NT40, NT8, NT13?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The important point is that the non-terminals are the ones that appear on the left side of the productions, regardless of how they appear on the right.\n\nNow, to apply CYK, I need to proceed step by step.\n\n1. Initialize a table where the rows represent the positions in the string, and the columns represent lengths of substrings.\n\n2. The string has 39 tokens. So we can represent it as a list of these tokens.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by considering substrings of the string, starting from length 1, then 2, up to the entire length.\n\nFor each substring, we check if it can be generated by any of the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity, it's time-consuming to do manually, but I can attempt to identify possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the entire string can be broken down into sub-strings that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t36 t6. So the substring is [t36, t6]. If there's a production that starts with t36 as the first symbol, maybe.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find where t36 is on the RHS. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT43 \u2192 NT47 NT38\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58 (duplicate)\n- NT38 \u2192 NT51 NT40\n- NT45 \u2192 NT47 NT27\n- NT55 \u2192 NT55? Wait, looking back, the productions list includes:\n\nLooking for RHS that are t36 followed by something:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\nBut in the string, the first two symbols are t36 t6.\n\nWait, t36 is a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, NT36 is a non-terminal because it's on the left side. So t36 is a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, the initial step is to see if any production's RHS starts with t36. Looking for RHS where the first symbol is t36.\n\nLooking through the RHS, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\nBut none of the RHS start directly with t36 as a terminal. Wait, no, the RHS are in terms of non-terminals. So, unless there's a production where the RHS starts with a terminal symbol, which in CNF, all productions on the RHS are non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in our grammar, are there any productions where the RHS is a terminal?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see lines like:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT58 \u2192 't42'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are given, and I need to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand how the grammar works. The CNF means that each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can be a terminal. In this grammar, many of the NT entries now have rules that produce terminals, which are terms ending in 't', like 't22', 't35', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' followed by numbers, for example, `t22 t35 t43 t43 t21...` up to `t9`. \n\nI think the best approach here is to try to derive the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two others. So, starting from the start symbol S, I'll try to apply the rules step by step, trying to match the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t22. So according to the NT18 rule, for NT18, the production is: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Because in the provided grammar, NT18 is replaced by NT23 and NT57. So we have to replace NT18 with NT23 and NT57.\n\nSo now, the first part of the string would be NT23 followed by NT57, which correspond to the tokens t23 and t57. Let me check the string: the first token is t22, but wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't22', but according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the first two symbols in the derived string should be NT23 and NT42, but the first token in the input is t22, not NT23. So perhaps S \u2192 NT18 NT42 \u2192 NT23 NT57 NT42 \u2192 and the first token should be NT23, which is t23. But the string starts with t22, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to see if there's another path. Let me check NT18's rules again. In the provided grammar, NT18 is replaced by NT23 NT57 (based on the entry \"NT18 -> NT23 NT57\"). So S initially gives NT18 and NT42. So the derived string starts with NT18 (t23) and NT42 (t27). Wait, but the input string starts with t22, which is not t23 or t27. Hmm, this suggests that the start symbol might be replaced differently?\n\nWait, no. S directly goes to NT18 and NT42. So the first two symbols should be the expansions of NT18 and NT42. Let me make a table of the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT49 NT23\n...\nWait, but the string starts with t22, which is an 't' token. So in the production chain, one of the symbols must be a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the rule. Since S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, then S \u2192 NT23 NT57 NT42. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t22. So perhaps one of the non-terminals in this expansion produces t22.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So that would produce non-terminals, not terminals. Similarly, NT57 \u2192 NT51 NTt1. Wait, looking at NT57's productions: I see that NT57 can produce NT51 NTt1 (but checking the list, the grammar hasNT57 \u2192 NT51 NT48? Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, there are multiple entries. Let me re-examine the parts:\n\nLooking at line by line:\n\n- S -> NT18 NT42\n- NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT22 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT40\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT58\n- NT28 -> NT43 NT5\n- NT53 -> NT42 NT38\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT43 -> 't57'\n- NT45 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't33'\n- NT38 -> 't51'\n- NT51 -> 't7'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT43 -> 't38'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT36 -> 't48'\n- NT38 -> 't53'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT13 -> 't11'\n- NT49 -> 't45'\n- NT27 -> 't22'\n- NT28 -> 't55'\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT36 -> 't36'\n- NT43 -> 't47'\n- NT42 -> 't54'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n- NT38 -> 't12'\n\nWait, so some of the rules produce terminals directly. For example, NT9 -> 't35', NT2 -> 't28', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps in the initial expansion, one of the non-terminals in S's expansion is a terminal.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S will produce NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nNow, NT18 is replaced by NT23 NT57, so NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nBut both of these are non-terminals. So NT18 becomes NT23 and NT57. So the first two symbols are NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 is replaced by NT26 and NT54 (from NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54). So NT23 becomes NT26 and NT54.\n\nBut again, both are non-terminals except for NT54, which is replaced by 't33'.\n\nWait, looking back: NT54 \u2192 't33' (from NT54 -> 't33').\n\nSo in NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54: NT26 is a non-terminal, but NT54 is a terminal.\n\nSo if we have 't23' would be represented as NT23, which breaks down into NT26 (another non-terminal) and NT54 ('t33'). But our derived string so far is starting with 't22', not 't23'.\n\nThis is confusing because the initial string starts with 't22', but according to S's first production, we should get 't23' and something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me take it step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nWe need to expand NT18 and NT42:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13.

Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT57 is on the right side of NT57 \u2192 't38', wait no, that's under NT38: NT38 -> 't51', NT39: not listed, but looking down... Hmm, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, under the given grammar:\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nBut NT57: I don't see an entry for NT57 in the grammar provided. Let me double-check. Here's the list:\n\nLooking for NT57 in the rules:\n\nI see NT45: NT45 \u2192 't10', etc. But no, I don't see an NT57. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\n\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\n\nNT9 -> 't35'\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT43 -> 't57'\n\nNT45 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT38 -> 't51'\n\nNT51 -> 't7'\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nNT43 -> 't38'\n\nNT10 -> 't43'\n\nNT36 -> 't48'\n\nNT38 -> 't53'\n\nNT40 -> 't6'\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nNT28 -> 't50'\n\nNT13 -> 't11'\n\nNT49 -> 't45'\n\nNT27 -> 't22'\n\nNT28 -> 't55'\n\nNT57 -> 't31'\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\n\nNT36 -> 't36'\n\nNT43 -> 't47'\n\nNT42 -> 't54'\n\nNT47 -> 't21'\n\nNT38 -> 't12'\n\nWait, so under NT18, the production is NT23 NT57.\n\nLooking for NT57, do we have 't31' as a terminal? Yes, under NT57 the rule is NT57 -> 't31'. So in NT18 -> NT23 NT57, both NT23 and NT57 will eventually derive to terminals.\n\nWait, but for NT18, the rule is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, but then NT26 is present in the grammar: NT26 \u2192 NT49. Wait, no: NT26 is under the initial grammar, looking at the list:\n\nNT26 -> NT49\n\nWait, no, let's check again:\n\nLooking for NT26:\n\nIn the rules, I believe NT26 is:\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nWait, yes, under NT26: NT26 \u2192 't49'.\n\nWait, no, looking again, my mistake. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the grammar has for example:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54,\nbut NT26 is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\nSo I believe NT26 is a terminal: no, that's under NT26: NT26 \u2192 't49', which would mean NT26 is a terminal, as it's replaced directly by a 't49'.\n\nSimilarly, let's clarify each production step.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nFirst, let's take each part and see how they derive.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nBut NT26 is a terminal: 't49'? Wait, no, let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nEach line starts with the non-terminal on the left side, and the right side is a combination of other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nBut NT26 is a terminal because in the list of grammar rules, I see NT26 \u2192 't49' \u2014 which is a terminal. So NT26 becomes 't49'. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 't33'. So when we have NT23, it's NT26 \u2192 't49' and NT54 \u2192 't33', so NT23 \u2192 t49 t33.\n\nSimilarly, NT57 \u2192 't31' is a terminal.\n\nSo, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 t49 t33 t31.\n\nOkay, so the first part of the expansion from S is t49 t33 t31.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part: NT42 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT42 is a non-terminal. Checking the grammar:\n\nNT42 has several production rules:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nWait, actually, the rules for NT42 are:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nBut there's also NT42 -> 't27' and NT42 \u2192 't27' in other rules?\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNo, the actual grammar has:\n\nLooking under NT42, there are multiple rules:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n\n- Also, wait, in the list, I think in the provided rules, there's:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41\n\nWait, no, that's under NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n\nBut for NT42, the rules are:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nSo actually, NT42 can be a terminal 't27', or can be broken down into NT2 NT38, or NT4 NT13.\n\nBut looking at the string, after the initial t49 t33 t31, the next token is t31, then t31, then t21.\n\nWait, let me parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt43 t31 t31 t21 t54 t9 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to do.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, and there are no \u03b5-productions. That structure should make parsing easier since each step in the derivation directly expands a symbol into two parts.\n\nThe grammar starts with S and has multiple non-terminals branching out into other non-terminals and terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-763","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is quite long with a bunch of 't' terms and numbers, separated by spaces. \n\nFirst off, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) production rules are structured such that each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it indeed seems to be in CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and all the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT18 is in CNF since it's a non-terminal generating two other symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t38 t36 t43 t22 t28 t27 t49 t21 t45 t35 t23 t21 t22 t35 t11 t22 t55 t49 t11 t7 t53 t11 t23 t55 t7 t7 t54 t35 t47 t10 t22 t11 t50 t50 t55 t10 t36 t57 t54 t54`. \n\nMy goal is to trace back from each 't' symbol to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. Therefore, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each of which must be matched by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual 't' segments: t38, t36, t43, t22, t28, t27, t49, t21, t45, t35, t23, t21, t22, t35, t11, t22, t55, t49, t11, t7, t53, t11, t23, t55, t7, t7, t54, t35, t47, t10, t22, t11, t50, t50, t55, t10, t36, t57, t54, t54.\n\nSince the string starts with t38 and ends with t54, I'll check where these 't's appear in the grammar. From the production rules:\n\n- t38 is referenced in NT8 \u2192 t54 NT49, but looking further, t38 also appears in NT8 \u2192 t11, and NT38 \u2192 t51, etc. Wait, let me see the full list.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t11\nNT4 \u2192 t9\nNT58 \u2192 t42 t41\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree or using a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if I can derive the string.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, perhaps it's better to look for the first symbol in the string and see which production rules can generate it, then recursively check the rest.\n\nThe first symbol is t38.

{"custom_id":"request-760","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form means. It's a set of rules where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and all other symbols are either non-terminals or terminals. The given grammar looks like it's in CNF because each production on the left has a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t51 t27 t6 t57 t49 t55 t45 t54 t22 t21 t47 t49 t40 t27 t22 t54 t45 t47 t45 t54 t6 t10 t27 t53 t31 t22 t6 t55 t45 t27 t51 t43 t51 t35 t53 t28 t53 t23 t43 t51`. \n\nI see that all these parts are connected with spaces, which probably separate the tokens. So, each 't' followed by a number is a separate token. Each token seems to be a terminal symbol because they are all single-character tokens that are either 't' or a number.\n\nIn a context-free grammar, the leftmost non-terminal expands step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. Each production in CNF contributes to the derivation in steps equal to the length of the string minus one. So, for a string of length n, we need n-1 steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts with NT18 NT42. Both of these are non-terminals. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which will produce two non-terminals. Then each of those can expand further.\n\nBut wait, the string I have is a linear sequence of terminals. So I need to see if the derivation tree can produce exactly this sequence of terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length can tell me how many productions I might need. Let me count the number of tokens in the string.\n\nCounting: 39 tokens. So the length is 39. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation length must be 39, which means the number of productions applied is 38. Because each production adds one more symbol (since it's A \u2192 BC, which replaces one symbol with two, increasing the length by one each time). Starting with a single non-terminal (S), after each production, the number of symbols increases by one. So, after 38 productions, we'll have 39 symbols, which should be all terminals if the string is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the string's length is 39, so the number of non-terminals in the derivation should go from 1 (S) to 39, which requires 38 productions. So, each production should be replacing a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI need to map each token in the string to a terminal in the grammar. Let me check which non-terminals expand into 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, any production that ends with a terminal is a leaf. So, let's list all terminals:\n\nEvery production where the right-hand side is a terminal is:\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT22 \u2192 t23 (if I remember correctly)\nWait, let me go through all the productions:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-789","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine whether a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal as the right-hand side. That's helpful because it simplifies some parsing aspects.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It consists of a series of productions, each starting with something like S -> NT18 NT42, and so on. At the end of the productions, there are several rules where the non-terminals on the left are replaced by terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't28' and NT9 -> 't35'. Each of these represents a terminal symbol in the string we need to evaluate.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t11 t11 t53 t12 t27 t11 t21 t53 t54 t31 t31 t47 t55 t7 t45 t10 t48 t45 t11 t51 t9 t49 t10 t50 t10 t11 t10 t50 t9 t45 t9 t7 t10 t22 t12 t36 t54 t33 t27 t6 t40`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the given grammar. That is, does the string consist of a sequence of terminal symbols that is a result of applying the productions starting from the start symbol S?\n\nGiven that this grammar is in CNF, I know that any string in the language must have a length that's a power of 2. Let me check the length of the string. Let's count the number of symbols (the number of 't's is the most straightforward since each terminal is separated by a space).\n\nBreaking it down:\n- t11 appears several times\n- t12, t21, t27, t31, t33, t40, t45, t47, t48, t53, t54, t55, etc.\n\nCounting each, the string seems to have 42 symbols. Since 42 is not a power of 2 (powers of 2 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,...), this makes me think that the string might not be possible to generate by this grammar, as according to Chomsky Normal Form, the length of any derived string should be a power of 2.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might miscount. Let's list all the symbols separated:\n\nt11, t11, t53, t12, t27, t11, t21, t53, t54, t31, t31, t47, t55, t7, t45, t10, t48, t45, t11, t51, t9, t49, t10, t50, t10, t11, t10, t50, t9, t45, t9, t7, t10, t22, t12, t36, t54, t33, t27, t6, t40.\n\nThat's 42 symbols. Yeah, 42 is not a power of 2. If the grammar is in CNF, the maximum length should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. So 42 isn't a power of 2. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut let me not jump to conclusions yet. Maybe the grammar has some rules that allow for non-powers of 2? Wait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is binary, so each derivation step increases the number of symbols by multiplying by 2. So starting with S (1 symbol), then 2, 4, 8, etc. So any string generated must have a length that's a power of 2.\n\nTherefore, since 42 isn't a power of 2, the string can't be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-787","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to decide whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the problem. A grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. The string provided is a sequence of terminals (like 't54', 't28', etc.). My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT18 NT42. So the leftmost symbols will be NT18 and NT42. Each of these can be non-terminals or terminals, but in this case, looking at the productions, NT18 and NT42 are both non-terminals because their productions are given.\n\nWait, let me check. The productions after NT in the grammar seem to have either NT or terminal symbols. For example, the first production is S -> NT18 NT42. Then, NT5 -> NT23 NT47, and so on. Each NT is either a non-terminal (like NT18, NT23) or eventually becomes a terminal (like 't35').\n\nLooking at the string: 't54 t28 t23 t27 t22 t11 t38 t11 t49 t45 t54 t33 t35 t45 t50 t21 t43 t50 t22 t47 t40 t54 t43 t35 t40 t33 t9 t47 t53 t38 t11 t55 t40 t50 t9 t47 t40 t49 t6 t45 t50'.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived starting from S. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, S must produce NT18 NT42. So the string should start with the derivation of NT18 followed by NT42. Let's look at NT18 and NT42 in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the NT18 production: NT18 appears in several places, such as S -> NT18 NT42, and also as NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and NT18 -> 't10'. So NT18 can be either two non-terminals or the terminal 't10'.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't54', which doesn't match 't10' or 't23' from NT18. That's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string backward. Sometimes, it's easier to start from the end of the string and see if it can be derived to the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, expanding each part.\n\nLet me try to approach it by seeing each symbol and figuring out what could lead to it.\n\nThe string starts with 't54'. Let's look at the NT that could produce 't54'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT54 is defined in several places, like NT54 -> 't33', NT38 -> 't53', NT53 -> 't54'? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT54 -> 't33' (from NT54)\nND38 -> 't53' (from NT38)\nBut NT43 -> 't57', NT8 -> 't54'.\n\nWait, wait: looking for 't54' in the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't54 NT49'. Wait, no, let's look carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT8 -> 't54' NT49\n- NT49 -> 't45'\n- NT45 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't33'\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, in the grammar, NT8's production is NT8 -> 't54 NT49'. So that would mean NT8 can produce 't54' followed by NT49. But in the string, the first token is 't54', so that would require that 't54' is the first terminal, but according to NT8's production, the first output is 't54' and then NT49, but I don't see NT49 in the string immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not looking correctly. Let me list all the productions where a non-terminal leads to a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT53 -> 't38' (so when NT53 is expanded, it becomes 't38')\nWait no, NT53's RHS is 't38' and something else, perhaps. Wait let's look.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), it's typically a good candidate for a recursive descent parser or maybe a simple bottom-up parser. But since I'm just trying to verify if the string is derivable, perhaps a top-down approach would help.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the given grammar, each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides either consist of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so the parser should start at the start symbol, probably S, and try to derive the string step by step.\n\nThe first step is to see if the string can be broken down into the productions. The start symbol S has the production S -> NT18 NT42, which means the first part of the string must start with NT18 and NT42. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't11'. So I need to see how 't11' can be derived. Let me check the productions for NT18. NT18 -> NT23 NT57. That gives 't51' and 't27' as those are the terminals for NT23 and NT57. Wait, no. Let me check the NTs.\n\nWait, the NTs for NT18: Looking back, I see NT18's productions. Oh, wait, in the grammar, many NTs have rules ending with t-something. For example, NT18 -> NT23 NT57, which means 't23' and 't57' because NT23 is 't26' and NT57 is 't31', but that might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, the first token is 't11'. Looking at NT tokens that produce 't11', I see NT26 -> 't49', but that's not 't11'. Looking at NT5-> 't40', but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs and their possible terminals. From the grammar, NTs have rules like:\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28, and looking further, NT28 is NT5 -> 't40', so that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace back from the string's starting tokens. The first token is 't11', which we need to find how it's generated. Looking through the grammar, the NTs that have 't11' as a terminal:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT50 doesn't exist; wait, the string token 't11' is in the string at position 20. Hmm.\n\nWait, no: the string is a concatenation of terminals, so I need to see how each 't' is derived. Maybe a better approach is to use a parsing table or the recursive descent method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a memoization approach, trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. The string starts with 't11 t6 t10 ...'.\n\n2. The first production is S -> NT18 NT42. So the first two non-terminals must generate the first part of the string.\n\nSo the first step: is 't11' derived by NT18? Let's see NT18's productions. Looking at NT18, it's NT23 NT57. So NT18 is 't10' and 't47' because NT23 is 't26' and NT57 is 't31'... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree. Let me try to trace the string backwards.\n\nThe string is: \nt11 t6 t10 t48 t6 t47 t54 t53 t27 t12 t21 t54 t9 t33 t10 t12 t28 t40 t57 t53 t38 t51 t11 t49 t51 t10 t6 t53 t36 t36 t7 t9 t9 t57 t49 t6 t48 t11 t10 t47 t28 t36.\n\nLet me see if I can find a way to associate these 't's with the productions. Each 't' corresponds to a terminal generated by an NT.\n\nFirst, the entire string is one sentence: each token is a terminal, and the non-terminals must be expanded into sequences of these.\n\nLet me think about the top-down approach: starting from S, which can only be NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols must be generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, the first 't11' must come from the expansion of NT18. Let's look at what produces 't11'. Looking through the grammar, do any NTs produce 't11' directly? Let me check each production for each NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT18 -> 't10' (from NT23 NT57, but wait NT23 is 't26'? No, wait, NT23 is a production that could be 't23' or NT26 NT54. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each non-terminal to the terminals they can produce.\n\nLet me compile a dictionary where each NT maps to the possible terminals it can produce:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- S -> NT18 NT42\n- NT5 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38 or NT42 -> 't27' or NT42 -> 't4' or ... Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nEach line is either NTX -> NTY NTZ or NTX -> a.\n\nSo for each NT, all the productions where NTX is on the left:\n\nLet me list each NT and their expansion rules:\n\n1. S: only S -> NT18 NT42\n\n2. NT5: NT5 -> NT23 NT57\n\n3. NT22: NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\n4. NT41: NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\n5. NT42: NT42 -> NT2 NT38, or NT42 -> 't27' (because in the production, ND42 -> 't27'?)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLine: NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nAnd another production line: NT42 -> 't27'.\n\nWait, so NT42 has two productions: NT42 -> NT2 NT38, and NT42 -> 't27'? But that can't be right because each production's left side should consist of one non-terminal, but in CNF, all productions are either N terminals or single terminals.\n\nWait, no: inCNF, productions are of the form NT -> a or NT -> NT NT.\n\nSo looking back, the grammar might have a mistake, but assuming it's given correctly, perhaps NT42 has both. So NT42 can either expand to NT2 NT38 or to 't27'. Hmm, that's confusing because that would allow NT42 to be a terminal in one case and a non-terminal in another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nLine 5: NT5 -> NT23 NT57\n\nLine 3: NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nLine 4: NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\nLine 2: NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nLine 7: NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n\nAnd so on.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the string to see how it can be broken down using the grammar rules. The string is a sequence of symbols like 't50', 't45', etc., which I assume are terminals. Since it's a rightmost derivation, I should break down the string starting from the rightmost parts.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals except the rules where a terminal is present. So, I'll work from the end of the string to see if each segment can be derived.\n\nLet me start by checking the entire string's length. The string has 50 symbols. Since each production in CNF either results in two non-terminals, the string length should be 2^n + 1 for some n. Let's see: 2^5 = 32, which gives 33 symbols if n=5 (counting the initial S). But our string is longer. Maybe the number of productions is higher, but I need to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing in CNF.

Looking at the string, I don't see that immediately.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for longer sequences that can form larger non-terminals.\n\nAnother point is that some rules directly produce terminals, like NT2->'t28', NT4->'t9', etc. So maybe the end of the string uses these.\n\nLooking at the string's end: ... t54 t55 t23 t22 t22 t55 t43 t22 ... etc. This seems complex. Maybe breaking down the string into smaller chunks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions. For example:\n\nStart with 't50'. Let's find which non-terminals can produce 't50'. Looking at the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't50'. So maybe it's part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, let me check all the production rules for terminals:\n\nNT2->t28\n\nNT4->t9\n\nNT8->t54\n\nNT9->t40\n\nNT2->t28\n\nNT4->t9\n\nNT8->t54\n\nNT26->t49\n\nNT27->t22\n\nNT28->t50\n\nNT5->t40\n\nNT38->t53\n\nNT42->t27\n\nNT43->t38\n\nNT51->t7\n\nNT54->t33\n\nNT35-> (needs to check if any rule ends with t35. Let's see NT57->t31, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see the entire sequence.\n\nThe string starts with 't50 t45 t31 t7 t9 t57 t21 t21 t6 t12 t50 t36 t35 t43 t9 ... etc.'\n\nWait, maybe I can match the end first. For instance, the very end of the string ends with ... t54 t55 t23 t22 t22 t55 t43 t22 t31 t35 t35 t6 t47.\n\nLooking at the rule NT57 -> 't31'. So 't31' is part of NT57. Also, NT45 -> 't10'. Let's see if the end matches any rules.\n\nLooking at NT42 -> 't27' and NT58 -> 't42 NT41'. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, looking for 't55', which comes from NT27. Wait, NT27->t22, but that's one level.\n\nThis approach is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step using the rightmost strategy.\n\nStarting from the end, perhaps the last few symbols are 't47 t36 t12 t50 t36 t35 t43 t9 t27 t31 ...'.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the entire string and see if each terminal can be derived.\n\nLet me see the first symbol 't50'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't50'? Checking all the rules for NT... -> 't50':\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any that produce 't50' directly except possibly from NT28: NT28->t50. So if 't50' comes from NT28, which can produce 't50'. So then, before 't50' we should have the other part of the production for NT28.\n\nWhat's NT28's rule? Looking at the rules: NT28->'t50' OR NT28->['t4', 't55'] OR ... Wait, from the grammar, NT28 has multiple rules: Check all NT28 rules.\n\nLooking through, I see NT28->'t50', and another rule NT28->'t4' 't55' and another NT28->'t55' 't43'?\n\nWait, let me confirm. From the given grammar:\n\nNT28 has rules like NT28 -> 't50', NT28->'t47' 't5', which seems wrong. Wait, no, let me re-examine.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT28->'t50 NT54'?\n\nWait, actually, according to the given grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nNT47 -> 't21'\n\nNT4->'t9'\n\nSo perhaps there's confusion here. Wait, the grammar is extensive, and I might have missed some rules. For NT28, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't50'\n\nand\n\nNT28->'t47' 't5'\n\nBut wait, the rules are given as, for example, NT28->'t47' 't5'? Or is it that NT28 can go to t47 and t5 another way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me go line by line:\n\nThe rules start with S -> NT18 NT10... etc. So each rule is separated by commas.\n\nLooking for NT28, in the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT23-> NT26 NT54\n- NT27->NT42 NT43\n- NT28-> 't50' (I think that's one rule)\n- ... Also, I see NT28->'t43' 't5' ? No, looking:\n\nI see:\n\nNT28 -> 't50' (probably one rule)\n\nAlso, let's check other rules:\n\nLooking all NT28 rules:\n\nFrom the given grammar, for NT28, the rules are:\n\nNT28 -> 't50'  (1)\nNT28-> 't43' 't5'  (2)\nWait, but in the given rules, the only NT28 rule I see is:\n\nLooking through the list: I see NT28->t50, and another line with NT28->'t43' 't5'. So, yes, NT28 can produce either 't50' alone or 't43' and 't5'.\n\nSo, in the given string, the part ends with t50. So, the last symbol is 't50', so it must come from NT28 -> 't50'. So the last symbol comes from that production. Therefore, the element before that must be the other part, but since 't50' is a terminal, there is no other part. So the last part is just 't50'.\n\nWait, but if a production is like A -> a B, then in the string, the a and B must be consecutive. But since 't50' is a terminal, the production for NT28 that produces 't50' alone can be used, and then nothing else. So that's the end of that branch.\n\nNow, moving to the symbol before 't50', which is 't35'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or a non-terminal produces a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. Then, each non-terminal like NT18, NT42, etc., can produce other combinations or terminals. The string provided is a series of terminals separated by spaces: `t40 t47 t28 t50 t55 t9 t36 t31 t49 t53 t21 t9 t33 t21 t7 t55 t10 t40 t40 t31 t47 t12 t27 t57 t38 t22 t35 t21 t27 t28 t49 t38 t27 t35 t53 t33 t40 t12 t11 t22 t50 t35 t48`.\n\nSo, my task is to check if this string can be derived from S by applying the grammar rules step by step. \n\nOne approach is to work backwards, starting from the bottom and reconstructing the parse tree. Let me list the symbols in reverse order to see if they can form a valid sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the string from the end: `... t12 t27 t57 t38 t22 t35 t21 t27 t28 t49 t38 t27 t35 t53 t33 t40 t12 t11 t22 t50 t35 t48`. Hmm, that's a lot of symbols. Maybe I can split it into parts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nStarting from the end, perhaps I can see if some combinations lead to terminals. Let's look at the last few symbols: t12, t27, t57, t38, etc. Wait, I see that NT38 generates 't53', so if I have t53, I need to see how it was derived.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's start with S -> NT18 NT42. So, the first step is to have S derive two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42. Then, each of those can derive more, and so on, until they result in terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t40, so I need to see if any non-terminal can directly produce t40. From the rules, NT9 -> 't35', NT2 -> 't28', NT4 -> 't9', NT5 -> 't40', NT8 -> 't11', NT18 -> 't10', NT22 -> 't28', NT26 -> 't49', NT27 -> 't22', NT28 -> 't50', NT36 -> 't48', NT38 -> 't53', NT40 -> 't6', but wait, in the string, t40 appears multiple times.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT40 -> 't6'?

Checking the terminals in the rules, NT42 -> 't27', NT58 -> NT42 NT41. Wait, NT58 isn't in the rules unless it's a typo. Wait, the rules given start with NT5, so perhaps NT58 is not a terminal but another non-terminal. So, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the rules.\n\nWait, looking back: the rules are given as lines like 'NT5 -> NT23 NT47', which is NT5 -> NT23 NT47. So, NT5 is a non-terminal, and those are non-terminals. Similarly, some rules have terminals, like NT9 -> 't35', so NT9 is a non-terminal that produces 't35'.\n\nIn the string, I see 't40', 't47', 't28', etc. Let's see which rules produce these terminals.\n\nFor example:\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT42 -> 't27' (directly)\n- NT54 -> 't33'\n- NT38 -> 't51'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't11' and 't11' again from another rule.\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 is 't27'\n\nSo, 't40' could come from NT5 -> 't40'.\n\nWait, that's a good point.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, actually in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar here, many rules have two terminals on the right, so actually, these are not in CNF but in a similar form. Oh well, maybe it's still Ok because the structure might allow for similar parsing techniques.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t28 t55 t40 t43 t6 t43 t53 t45 t21 t33 t7 t53 t9 t33 t38 t33 t9 t10 t49 t50 t6 t9 t43 t12 t28 t40 t36 t21 t21 t28 t12 t43 t23 t45 t12 t49 t7 t48 t40 t10 t9 t23 t47\".\n\nFirst, I'll note that each symbol in the string is a terminal, either starting from t... or a number. The grammar's production rules start from S and involve non-terminals which eventually derive to terminals.\n\nI think I'll need to parse the string step by step, checking if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. Both NT18 and NT42 are non-terminals. So the string must start with the derivations of NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't28'. Let's check where 't28' comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT2 -> t28. So NT2 can directly derive t28.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has a rule NT42 -> 't27' in one case and others. Let's see which NT42 rules produce 't28'. Hmm, I don't see a direct 't28' for NT42. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT42 has rules like:\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT23\nWait, I don't see a direct 't28' in the NT42 rules. Oh, but looking at the production rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's this rule: NT42 -> NT22 NT38, and NT22 -> NT29 NT..., no, wait, let me look. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe NT42 can derive into a combination that includes t28 through a series of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace how t28 can be formed. Let's look at NT2: NT2 -> 't28'. That's direct. So in the string, after some steps, maybe there's a segment that comes from NT2 derivations.\n\nWait, the string starts with t28, which matches NT2 -> t28. So the first part of the string is accounted for. But where does the left-hand side (LHS) of S come into play?\n\nWait, S is S -> NT18 NT42. So S starts with NT18 and NT42. So in the string, after the initial parts, the rest must come from the derivation of NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo let's see: the string starts with t28. If that comes from NT2, then perhaps the initial part is matched by NT2, but wait, S is NT18 and NT42. So maybe the initial t28 corresponds to the NT2 in either NT18 or NT42.\n\nWait, this might get confusing. Perhaps I should parse the string step by step, choosing which rules apply at each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into segments that correspond to each non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that each symbol in the string can be matched by the right-hand sides of the grammar rules. Since the grammar is somewhat involved, I might need to look for production rules that can generate these terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each part of the string can be broken down into the right-hand sides of the rules. For example, looking for 't28', 't55', etc., in the RHS of any rule.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT5 -> 't40', etc.\n\nSo t28 is directly from NT2, which appears in the rules.\n\nt55 is another symbol. Looking through the rules, is t55 a terminal that appears anywhere? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through, I see t55 mentioned in the string, but looking at the production rules, I don't see 't55' as a terminal. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the productions are all in the form of non-terminals deriving to other non-terminals or terminals. So perhaps I'm looking for each symbol in the string to correspond to a terminal production in some rule.\n\nWait, perhaps each symbol in the string must be the result of a production rule where the RHS of that rule includes that terminal.\n\nSo for example, to have 't28', there must be a rule where a non-terminal on the LHS can produce 't28' on the RHS. Looking through, we have NT2 -> 't28'. So that's a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nSo 't28' must come from NT2. Similarly, 't55' would need to come from some non-terminal that can produce 't55' as part of its RHS.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't55' directly. Hmm, that's a problem because 't55' is in the string but I can't find a rule that generates 't55'. Wait, perhaps I've misspotted a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, the given string is:\n\nt28 t55 t40 t43 t6 t43 t53 t45 t21 t33 t7 t53 t9 t33 t38 t33 t9 t10 t49 t50 t6 t9 t43 t12 t28 t40 t36 t21 t21 t28 t12 t43 t23 t45 t12 t49 t7 t48 t40 t10 t9 t23 t47\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let's check if any rule has 't55' as a terminal. Looking through all the rules:\n\n- Let's see: I don't see any NT production where RHS is 't55'. So that would mean that 't55' is not directly produced by any rule. But wait, perhaps it's produced indirectly through a series of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. So maybe the grammar can't produce 't55' because no rule has 't55' as a terminal. If that's the case, then the string has a symbol that the grammar can't generate, hence the answer is No.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because maybe I missed a production. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through all the rules again:\n\nLooking for a rule where a non-terminal on the LHS has 't55' as RHS. Looking through:\n\n- NT23 -> 't26' or 't54' etc.\n- NT27 -> 't42' or 't43'\n- NT36 -> 't48', etc.\n- NT28 -> 't4' or 't...'\n\nNo, I don't see any rule that ends with 't55' as a terminal. That suggests that 't55' isn't directly translatable from any non-terminal, which would mean the string isn't possible.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in copying the rules. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking under NT27: NT27 -> NT42 NT43 or NT57. Hmm, no 't55' there.\n\nUnder NT28: NT28 -> NT4 NT40 or 't50'.

Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the 't55' is a terminal that can be derived through a series of steps from other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-840","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing and analysis a bit easier.\n\nThe provided grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT18, NT5, etc.) and terminals. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t35 t45 t33 t27 t35 t35 t40 t53 t45 t35 t33 t48 t28 t27 t55 t28 t9 t53 t53 t11 t57 t31 t53 t22 t48 t49 t51 t43 t53 t45 t40 t48 t10 t43 t36 t36 t48 t43 t9 t10 t10 t43 t33 t27`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can probably build a parse tree and check if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. Alternatively, I can try to find a way to break down the string using the rules.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols derived from S should be from NT18 and NT42, respectively. Let's check the string: it starts with t35, which is NT18's production (since NT18 \u2192 't10'). Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't10' is correct. So the first part is t35, which is derived from NT18, but wait, NT18's production is 't10' but the first symbol is t35. Hmm, that's a problem. Because S \u2192 NT18 NT42 would mean the first part should be the terminal derived from NT18, which is 't10', but our string starts with t35. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, either the string isn't generated by the grammar, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, let me check again. NT18's production is NT23 NT57. Because in the grammar, it's defined as NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and then further down, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and so on. Each of these non-terminals eventually resolves to a terminal, perhaps. Let's see.\n\nBut for S, the first symbol should be derived from NT18, which starts with NT23, which might expand to 't35' eventually. Wait, no, because S is the start symbol, so the first two symbols must be from NT18 and NT42. Let me see what NT18 and NT42 are.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. But then, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT8. NT8 \u2192 NT47. NT47 \u2192 't21'. Wait, but NT8 is defined as NT54 NT49, which expands to 't54' and 't47'. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check each symbol in the string and see if it can be matched by any production after expanding the non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t35, which is the terminal in NT9's production (NT9 \u2192 't35'). Looking back, there's NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28, and also NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, etc. Hmm, perhaps the first symbol t35 comes from NT9. But how does that fit with S's production S \u2192 NT18 NT42?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The production S \u2192 NT18 NT42 means S generates a string where the first symbol comes from NT18 and the second from NT42. So both NT18 and NT42 must be non-terminals that can derive a single terminal symbol each. Alternatively, if they derive longer strings, the total string would have more symbols.\n\nHold on, the string I'm given is the entire string produced by S, so it should be exactly the concatenation of what NT18 and NT42 generate. But S \u2192 NT18 NT42 means that the entire string is the concatenation of NT18's derivation and NT42's derivation. So the entire string must be the union of the two.\n\nLooking at the string provided, the length is 30 symbols. Let me count: t35 (1), t45 (2), t33 (3), t27 (4), t35 (5), t35 (6), t40 (7), t53 (8), t45 (9), t35 (10), t33 (11), t48 (12), t28 (13), t27 (14), t55 (15), t28 (16), t9 (17), t53 (18), t53 (19), t11 (20), t57 (21), t31 (22), t53 (23), t22 (24), t48 (25), t49 (26), t51 (27), t43 (28), t53 (29), t45 (30), t40 (31), t48 (32), t10 (33), t43 (34), t36 (35), t36 (36), t48 (37), t43 (38), t9 (39), t10 (40), t10 (41), t43 (42), t33 (43), t27 (44). Wait, that\u2019s 44 symbols. But the string given is: t35 t45 t33 t27 t35 t35 t40 t53 t45 t35 t33 t48 t28 t27 t55 t28 t9 t53 t53 t11 t57 t31 t53 t22 t48 t49 t51 t43 t53 t45 t40 t48 t10 t43 t36 t36 t48 t43 t9 t10 t10 t43 t33 t27. Let me count: that's 45 symbols. Wait, how many? Let me list them:\n\n1. t35\n2. t45\n3. t33\n4. t27\n5. t35\n6. t35\n7. t40\n8. t53\n9. t45\n10. t35\n11. t33\n12. t48\n13. t28\n14. t27\n15. t55\n16. t28\n17. t9\n18. t53\n19. t53\n20. t11\n21. t57\n22. t31\n23. t53\n24. t22\n25. t48\n26. t49\n27. t51\n28. t43\n29. t53\n30. t45\n31. t40\n32. t48\n33. t43\n34. t9\n35. t10\n36. t43\n37. t33\n38. t27\n\nSo that's 38 symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-836","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is quite long, so I need to figure out a systematic way to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for a string to be generated by a CFG in CNF. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals. Since all productions are in CNF, the derivations are straightforward: each symbol in the string must be matched by such productions, and the left-hand sides (LHS) of the productions must expand into the corresponding symbols.\n\nThe approach would be to start from the start symbol and see if we can derive the given string step by step. The start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. That means the string should start with the symbols derived from NT18 followed by those from NT42. So, let's look at the string.\n\nThe string is: `t7 t51 t10 t12 t48 t7 t11 t23 t45 t55 t57 t9 t7 t48 t50 t54 t48 t28 t49 t51 t40 t7 t40 t45 t31 t21 t38 t28 t36 t35 t36 t28 t47 t40 t31 t36 t54 t33 t11 t47 t36 t49 t12 t33`.\n\nFirst, the initial symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols should come from NT18 and NT42. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, NT18 is the first non-terminal. In the string, the first symbol is `t7`. So, NT18 \u2192 t7?

The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which means the start symbol S directly leads to two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42. Both of these are terminals because they directly expand to 't' followed by a number. NT18 goes to 't10', and NT42 goes to 't27'. So S expands directly to 't10 t27'. Wait, but the string starts with 't45 t35...' which is longer and includes various other t-numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NTs.\n\nWait, looking closer, each NT (Non-Terminal) on the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions either expands to a terminal string or another non-terminal. The productions are right-hand side (RHS) of the form A \u2192 \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a sequence of non-terminals or terminals. \n\nBut upon looking at the productions, they all seem to have two parts: like NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 means NT18 is replaced by two non-terminals. The goal is to find if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with 't45', which suggests that the first production must expand to 't45...'. Let me look for any productions that result in 't45'. \n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see NT40 \u2192 't6', NT45 \u2192 't10', NT4 \u2192 't9', NT5 \u2192 't40', NT36 \u2192 't36', NT43 \u2192 't47', etc. Also, NT8 \u2192 't54 NT49', and some others expand into 't's followed by numbers. \n\nWait, I'm noticing that many non-terminals directly expand into two 't's. For example, NT5 \u2192 't40 t28', but some expand to just a single 't'. Wait, no, I don't see any that do. Most seem to expand to two 't's. For example, NT26 \u2192 't23', which is a single 't', but wait, looking again: actually, in the given productions, none seem to have a single 't' as a result. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT22 \u2192 't43', which is one 't' and a number. Others like NT27 \u2192 't42 t43'. So some NTs expand into one 't' plus a number, but the string starts with two 't's: 't45 t35'. So maybe the first step would involve NTs that lead to 't45' followed by 't35'.\n\nLooking for any NT that directly expands to 't45 ...'. Hmm, the productions I see don't have any NT directly expanding to a single 't45'. The NTs all either expand into two 't's with numbers or one 't' and a number. \n\nWait, let me check the productions again. \n\nNT45 \u2192 't10' \u2013 so NT45 becomes 't10'. \n\nIs there any path to get 't45 t35' as the first few symbols? Let's see. The start symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42. NT18 is replaced to NT23 NT57. So S \u2192 NT23 NT57 NT42, which then NT23 expands to NT26 NT54, and so on. But the string starts with 't45 t35', which would require two NTs, each expanding to those 't's.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps I can model how the string is built upon. The string is made up of a series of 't's followed by numbers. Each non-terminal seems to produce two other non-terminals or a 't' and a number. Wait, let me clarify each production.\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 NT40 NT28, which in turn expand further. \n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into a series of productions that start with S and reduce to the string.\n\nLet me try to see the first steps:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t23 (as per the production NT26 \u2192 t23). \n\nWait, looking back, in the list of productions, I see NT26 \u2192 't23'. So NT26 becomes 't23'. NT54 expands to 't33'. So NT23 \u2192 't23 t33'.\n\nThus, S \u2192 NT18 NT42 \u2192 (t23 t33) NT42.\n\nNow, NT42 \u2192 't27' per the production NT42 \u2192 't27'. So putting it together: S would expand to 't23 t33 t27'. But the string starts with 't45 t35...', which is different.\n\nHmm, that suggests that either the first part of the derivation is not aligned with the string, or maybe I made a mistake in finding the correct productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the start symbol S produces a certain combination that could eventually lead to the given string. Since the given string is quite long, maybe it's built by a series of expansions where non-terminals keep branching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a tree of productions.\n\nBut considering the string starts with 't45 t35', I need to find a way for the first two symbols to be 't45' and 't35'. Since the start symbol starts with NT18 and NT42, both of which need to expand into something else, perhaps 't45' doesn't come from NT18 or NT42.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at NT18, it expands to NT23 NT57. NT23 expands to NT26 NT54, which expand to 't23' and 't33', making the start symbol expand to 't23 t33 t57' or something like that. But in the given string, it's 't45 t35...'\n\nSo I'm starting to think that the given string doesn't start with something that the start symbol can produce. Because S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which immediately gives 't23 t33 t27', which isn't the start of the string.\n\nWait, but maybe the given string is longer and some non-terminals in the derivation produce the rest. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is just a concatenation of several derived symbols from the non-terminals, but I think the approach is to model the string as the output of a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the entire string is a sentential form derived from S.\n\nWait, but the string is very long, so it's easier to approach by seeing if the initial parts of the string can be derived step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token 't45' comes from a terminal in NT45, which itself is an NT, so perhaps the string is not generated correctly.\n\nWait, actually, considering that each production of a non-terminal either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, perhaps the given string has a mix that doesn't match the grammar's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a CYK algorithm approach to check if the string is in the grammar. But the string is very long, so it's practical to see if any initial part can be matched.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the first tokens can be derived from some NTs.\n\nLooking at 't45' in the string, the first token could come from some NT that can be reduced to 't45'. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly expanding to 't45'. Similarly, 't35' would need to come from an NT that expands to 't35', but looking at the productions, NT53 \u2192 't36', which is just one 't'.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals have to expand into a single 't' and then further expand. For example, NT43 \u2192 't57', which is another 't' with a number.\n\nWait, but in any"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

From the grammar, t31 comes from NT57, because NT57 -> t31. So that's the first part.\n\nLooking at NT57, the production is NT42 nt38, but no, wait, NT57 is a non-terminal or a terminal? Wait, looking at the production rules, every production starts with a capital letter, so NT57 is a non-terminal. Wait, no, NT57 isn't listed as a production rule. Let me check all the NTTs in the rules.\n\nLooking back, the rules provided include NT5, NT22, etc., but I look through them and I don't see NT57 as a non-terminal at all. Wait, but there's a rule NT58 -> NT42 NT41, which is a non-terminal, and NT27 is a non-terminal, etc. But my focus is on where 't31' comes from. The production for NT57 is probably the one that leads to t31.\n\nWait, the production NT57 -> t31 is not listed directly. Actually, the rules provided list NT53 -> NT42 NT38, and looking further down, I see NT57 -> t31. Wait, no, checking more carefully:\n\nNo, actually, in the rules, the NT57 is part of the NT rules, but NT57 isn't a starting point. Wait, looking again, I think I made a mistake. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT57 -> t31 is written in the last rule:\n\nNT57 -> t31.\n\nSo, NT57 is a non-terminal that produces only t31. So to use NT57, the string must have t31, which it does.\n\nSo, the initial production is S -> NT18 NT42. The first element is NT18 and the second is NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18's production, it's NT23 and NT57. So NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, to produce S, we need NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t31, which corresponds to NT57. Let me see how that connects.\n\nWait, let me diagram this. Starting from S:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38.\n\nContinuing from each sub-tree.\n\nSo, from NT23: NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nFrom NT26: NT26 -> NT49.\n\nSo, NT26 -> t49.\n\nTherefore, NT23 -> t49 NT54.\n\nThen, NT54 -> t33.\n\nSo, NT23 -> t49 t33.\n\nNext, NT23 is used again? Wait, no, NT23 appears once. So, the left-hand side is NT23, which leads to t49 and t33. So, the combination so far is t31 (from NT57) and t49 t33.\n\nBut the string starts with t31, then t45, so maybe that's a different branch. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Instead of starting at S, I can work backwards from the string. Each symbol in the string can be either a terminal or a non-terminal. If it's a terminal, it has to exactly match a production. If it's a non-terminal, I need to split it into two parts according to its productions.\n\nSo, starting with the entire string, it's a list of 38 symbols (counting the spaces as separators). Each symbol must come from a production.\n\nLet me take the first symbol: t31. From the rules, I see that NT57 -> t31. So, the first part of the string must come from NT57. Therefore, the next step is to look at NT57's production, which is a single symbol, but wait, does NT57 produce anything else? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the rules, I don't see NT57 being split. I see NT57 -> t31, which is a terminal. So, that means that t31 must be produced by NT57, and NT57 cannot be further split\u2014it must be exactly t31. Therefore, the first part of the string, t31, is fine.\n\nNow, moving to the next symbol: t45.\n\nLooking at what can produce t45. Checking the rules:\n\n- NT54 -> t33\n\n- NT24? No, NT54 is a non-terminal that -> t33.\n\nLooking at NT54: It produces t33. But t45 is the next symbol. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, t45 could be produced by NT15? But I don't think so. Let me look for t45 in the productions. Wait, perhaps NT42 can produce t45? Let me check.\n\nNT42's rules are:\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\n- NT42 -> t27\n\n- NT42 -> t27 (I think the third rule is redundant)\n\nWait, looking again: The third rule is NT42 -> NT4 NT13.\n\nSo, options for NT42:\n\n1. NT2 NT38\n\n2. t27\n\n3. NT4 NT13\n\nSo, NT42 can produce 't27' or split into NT2 and NT38, or split into NT4 and NT13.\n\nBut in our string, after t31 (NT57), the next symbol is t45."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Some of these are non-terminals (like t*, others are terminals. Wait, in the grammar, the non-terminals are things like S, NT18, NT5, etc., and the terminals are 't' followed by a number. For example, I see 't10', 't12', etc. So, when the parser tries to derive the string, it must replace the non-terminals using the productions, eventually matching all the terminals in the string.\n\nNow, the structure is such that each production either breaks into two non-terminals (left-hand side is a non-terminal) or it's a terminal (right-hand side has a terminal). Since it's in CNF, the parse trees are binary. So, for the string to be in the language, it must be possible to parse it using the grammar by replacing non-terminals step by step until all symbols are terminals matching the string.\n\nLet's start by trying to parse the string from left to right, using the productions. The top-level rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string must start with NT18 and NT42. Let's check the first few tokens.\n\nThe first token is t10, but that's part of NT18, which according to the grammar, is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Wait, the string starts with t10. But according to production NT18, it's NT23 NT57, not a terminal. So, maybe I misunderstood the initial rule. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back at the grammar: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. And NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Ah, so NT18 must first produce NT23 and NT57, which are non-terminals. Therefore, the first token in the string should be derived from NT23 or NT57, but in the string, it's t10. So, perhaps NT23 or NT57 can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Not a terminal. Hmm. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me see if any of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal or a t* token.\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals, I see that some produce terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 t28, NT4 \u2192 t9, NT5 \u2192 t40, etc. So, when a non-terminal like NT2 is used, it can be replaced by their respective terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the very beginning is t10. So, does any non-terminal produce 't10'? Let's check the productions.\n\nLooking at NT10: Wait, no, NT10 is a non-terminal. The rule for NT8 is \"t11\" but I'm looking for 't10'. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT18 \u2192 t10 (Wait, is that right? Let me look: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then looking at the right-hand side, none of those produce t10. Wait, no, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals. Let me find which ones.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 ?? Wait, no: Looking through all the productions, I think I might have to list all the terminals.\n\nLet me list all the right-hand sides that are terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\nNT4 \u2192 t9\nNT5 \u2192 t40\nNT8 \u2192 t11\nNT9 \u2192 t43\nNT10 \u2192 t43 (Wait, no: looking back, NT10 \u2192 t43).\nWait, no: NT2 \u2192 t28, NT36 \u2192 t48 is not a terminal but a production. Wait, in the grammar, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let's list all the terminals:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT36 \u2192 t36 (Wait, t36 is a terminal?)\n- Then, looking at the details:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT9 \u2192 t43\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT11 \u2192 NT? Actually, in the detailed list:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT29? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a list:\n\nIdentify all non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-869","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to be in CNF because each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which fits the first case, while some have a terminal like NT9 \u2192 't35' which fits the second case.\n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long, but I can handle it step by step. The string is: `t31 t53 t53 t36 t57 t40 t12 t23 t40 t9 t35 t55 t36 t53 t50 t10 t22 t48 t49 t23 t54 t45 t57 t43 t55 t33 t7 t36 t7 t40 t33 t51 t31 t40 t47 t48 t48 t12 t28 t50 t23 t31 t9 t47 t22 t54`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the starting symbol S using the given productions. Since it's a long string, I might need to parse it using either top-down (like recursive descent) or bottom-up (like using the CYK algorithm) approach. But I'm more comfortable with top-down for smaller strings, so maybe I can find a way to parse parts of it.\n\nLet me start by looking for the start symbol S. The first production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S starts with NT18 and NT42. So the first tokens after the initial non-terminals should be t31 (from NT18) and t53 (from NT42). Wait, looking at the string, the first part is t31 followed by t53. Let me check the productions for NT18 and NT42.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (wait, also NT2 is another production for NT42? Hmm, the grammar has multiple rules for NT42: NT42 \u2192 NT2, NT38 or NT27, NT43 or NT22, etc. Wait, actually looking back, I see that in the provided grammar, NT42 has several productions. Let me correct myself: Yes, NT42 has several rules. So it can go to NT2, NT27, NT38, etc. And we've already used the direct one NT42 \u2192 't27' as an example.\n\nBut in the string, after S, we get NT18 as t31. Let me check the production for NT18. From the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So after t31, we expect NT23 and NT57.\n\nLooking at the string after t31 t53, the next token is t53 (from NT42 \u2192 t53? Wait, NT42 has a production where it goes directly to t53. Let me check:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't53', so that means if NT42 is directly 't53', then that part is correct. But wait, in the initial production for S, it's S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so S starts with NT18 followed by NT42. So the first part of the string is t31 (from NT18) and then t53 (from NT42). That works.\n\nNow, after that, S expects the rest to follow. So after NT18 and NT42, we need to process the remaining tokens as per their own derivations.\n\nSo after t31 t53, the remaining string is t53 t36 t57 t40 t12 t23 t40 t9 t35 t55 t36 t53 t50 t10 t22 t48 t49 t23 t54 t45 t57 t43 t55 t33 t7 t36 t7 t40 t33 s51 t31 t40 t47 t48 t48\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let me clarify the start.\n\nLet me break the string into tokens separated by spaces:\n\nt31, t53, t53, t36, t57, t40, t12, t23, t40, t9, t35, t55, t36, t53, t50, t10, t22, t48, t49, t23, t54, t45, t57, t43, t55, t33, t7, t36, t7, t40, t33, t51, t31, t40, t47, t48, t48, t12, t28, t50, t23, t31, t9, t47, t22, t54.\n\nWait, no, that's 42 tokens long. But S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first two non-terminals should be NT18 and NT42, which correspond to the first two tokens t31 and t53, as per the production rules, because NT18 \u2192 t10 would have been a terminal, but here it's a production that results in t31. Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so it's a two-step process until it can be replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it methodically.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t31. Let's see what NT18 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT18 can produce NT23 NT57 or in other cases. Since t31 is a terminal, we need to see if any production for NT18 directly leads to t31. Looking at the productions for NT18, it has only one production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So that means NT18 cannot be a terminal; it must continue to expand. So the first token after S is t31, which comes from NT18's expansion. So t31 must result from NT18 resolving to something that ends in t31.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT23 and NT57 are non-terminals, meaning they themselves need to produce terminals or be resolved further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should build the parse tree bottom-up or top-down. Let's think of the string as a series of terminals, and see if each can be matched by a terminal production in the CFG.\n\nBut with 42 tokens, it's quite a lot. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if the grammar can generate such a string by looking at the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the root of the problem by looking at the grammar and the string's endings or the way certain non-terminals resolve.\n\nWait, maybe looking for recursive patterns. For example, if a non-terminal generates a substring that can loop back into itself, perhaps through a cycle. But it's not an easy task.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps certain non-terminals generate repetitions of certain terminals, leading to runs of specific tokens. For instance, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals might generate multiple 't's.\n\nWait, let's look at NT42 in the grammar. There's a production NT42 \u2192 't53'. So if the string has a 't53', that could come directly from NT42. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't40', NT2 \u2192 't28', etc.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built by various non-terminals expanding into different combinations of terminals. Let's see if the string can be broken down into sections matching different non-terminals.\n\nBut considering the time it would take to manually parse 42 tokens, maybe I can look for certain key patterns or see if the string can be split into parts that fit known production chains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a simpler approach: the CFG is in CNF, so it's unambiguous. If each step correctly replaces the non-terminals with terminals or intermediate non-terminals, we can see if the string is built.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to manually parse, I can look at the tokens that can't be derived from any terminal in the grammar, perhaps indicating a mismatch.\n\nWait, for example: in the string, I see 't31', 't53', etc. I need to check if any of these terminals are only produced by a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-878","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which suggests that these 't'X tokens are terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar production rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT18 and NT42. So, the first two symbols in any derived string should be NT18 and NT42. Let me check the start of the given string: it's \"t33 t35 t43 t47 t7 t33...\". Wait, the first tokens are t33 and t35, but according to the grammar, S -> NT18 NT42, which would start with NT18 and NT42. So the first two tokens should be 't' followed by 18 and then 't' followed by 42. Looking at the string, the first token is 't33', which doesn't match NT18 or NT42. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT18 -> 't10' and 't33'. Hmm, no, let me parse the rules correctly. NT18 -> NT23 NT57 and then in the production rules, I see NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and NT54 -> 't33'. So NT18 can derive into a path that ends with 't33'. But that's how it's derived, but for the top-level symbol S, it's not the start; the top-level is S, which can produce NT18 and NT42. So the initial step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first two tokens should be whatever NT18 and NT42 derive to.\n\nLooking back at the string, the first two tokens are t33 and t35. Let me see if NT18 can derive to t33. From NT18's production rules: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Then NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and NT26 -> t49, and NT54 -> t33. So yes, NT18 can produce t33. What about NT42? Looking at NT42's rules, one of them is NT42 -> 't27'. So the second part is t27. But in the string, after the first t33, the next token is t35. So that's a problem because the second part should be t27.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check all possible derivations. Let me think again. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first two tokens derived would be whatever NT18 gives and whatever NT42 gives. For the string to start with t33 and t35, let's see:\n\nNT18 can produce t33 (as the path I mentioned earlier: NT18 \u2192 NT23 \u2192 NT26 \u2192 t49 and NT54 \u2192 t33, so it ends with t33). NT42 can also produce t27 or other things. But in the string, the second token is t35, not t27. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way for S to generate these tokens. But in Chomsky normal form, each production is binary and either terminals or non-terminals. The string begins with t33, which is a terminal. So S must expand into NT18 and NT42, and both must expand into their respective terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and NT18 might produce t33, and NT42 might produce t35. But looking at the grammar, does NT42 ever produce t35? Looking through the NT42 production rules: I see NT42 \u2192 't27', and others like NT42 \u2192 't4', 't43', etc. So there's no production for NT42 \u2192 't35' or 't33'. So that's a problem. Therefore, the string starts with t33, but NT42 can't produce t35 as its second token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NT18 produces t33, and NT42 produces something else. But the string's second token is t35. So unless there's a way for NT42 to produce t35, the string shouldn't be acceptable. But in the rules, I don't see NT42 \u2192 't35'. So that's a red flag.\n\nWait, let me check all the production rules again to see if I missed anything. Looking through the NT42 rules: I see a few, like NT42 \u2192 't27', 't22', 't4', 't13', etc. But no 't35'. So unless there's a way for NT42 to expand into something that can derive t35, which I don't see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NT42 is somehow allowed to derive to something that starts with t35. But since in the string, it starts with t33, that's conflicting. So perhaps the answer is 'No' because the string doesn't match the start symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake about how the string is built. Each symbol in the string is a terminal, so each non-terminal must expand to that terminal in one step. So starting with S, which is NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols are t33 and something else. But the string starts with t33 and t35, which would require the second token to be derived from NT42 to be a terminal that matches. Since NT42 can't produce t35, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the second token doesn't match what NT42 can produce.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and see how the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I'll need to break it down into the right parts according to the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to NT18 and NT42. Let's check the string: it starts with 't22 t51...'. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, the NT symbols might eventually derive into terminals. For example, NT18 \u2192 't10', and NT42 might have multiple productions, including some that derive into terminals. Let's look at the NT42 productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT42 can be 't27', 't42', or others. Wait, let me list the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\nNT18 \u2192 't10' or others\nNT5 \u2192 ... which eventually leads to terminals\nSimilarly, other NTs have terminals or other NTs as productions.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions. \n\nThe string is: t22 t51 t6 t7 t10 t45 t33 t53 t23 t31 t47 t35 t49 t31 t27 t27 t40 t50 t11 t28 t40 t7 t48 t51 t51 t11 t10 t7 t36 t53 t10 t28 t33 t21 t50 t7 t9 t54 t48 t23 t7 t45 t40 t10 t33 t7.\n\nThat's a long string.

Let me check NT22's productions again. \n\nFrom the given grammar, the productions for NT22 are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT29 NT51\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nAlso, from NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9, which is NT2 \u2192 't28' and NT9 \u2192 't35', so overall 't28 t35'.\n\nBut none of these seem to produce 't22' itself. So that's a problem because the string starts with 't22', which can't be derived from NT22.

So, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, Chomsky normal form usually has productions where the left-hand side is a non-terminal and the right-hand side has two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit because each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t45 t9 t22 t22 t28 t12 t51 t23 t50 t21 t57 t27 t53 t53 t10 t21 t28 t40 t10 t10 t6 t50 t33 t28 t38 t28 t31 t7 t23 t21 t54 t54 t38 t54 t54 t7 t22 t51 t9 t49 t36 t6 t11 t27 t48 t35 t53 t36.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. NT18 and NT42 are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded through other productions. Each production eventually terminates in terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the parsing process. Starting with the entire string, we can check if it can be derived from the grammar by trying to match the top-level productions.\n\nLet me see: The start symbol S becomes NT18 NT42. So the string must be reducible to something that starts with NT18 NT42 and then each part is expanded similarly.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first few tokens are t45, t9, t22, t22, t28. But wait, the first production is S -> NT18 NT42, so the string should start with NT18 NT42. However, the first token in the string is t45, which is a terminal. So that doesn't match because NT18 and NT42 are non-terminals that eventually expand to terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to expand NT18 and NT42 further and see if they can generate the string when combined.\n\nLet me jot down the relevant productions:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n- NT26 -> t49\n- NT54 -> t33\n\nSo NT18 expands to NT23 NT57, which then expand to NT26 NT54. NT26 is 't49' and NT54 is 't33', so when fully expanded, NT18 -> t49 t33.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT42: There are two main paths.\n\nFirst, NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\n\nNT8 -> t47 or NT47?

I need to check all productions.\n\nWait, I don't see NT13 in the productions except in the one place:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nAnd NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nWait, perhaps NT13 is more complex.

{"custom_id":"request-890","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to check whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided, and it's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Also, there are some terminal symbols mixed in, which are individual 't's with numbers. So, each production can eventually derive a string of terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nThe target string to check is: \n`t57 t38 t45 t48 t21 t27 t54 t54 t38 t43 t51 t33 t10 t49 t36 t23 t36 t21 t49 t54 t55 t50 t47 t51 t55 t28 t28 t45 t33 t10 t11 t9 t35 t35 t48 t49 t22 t28 t35 t10 t49 t38 t54 t7 t27 t11 t50 t21`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string with 55 tokens. Each token is a terminal symbol except for the NTs (Non-Terminals) which have two parts separated by a hyphen, like NT5, NT22, etc.\n\nThe strategy I'll use is to trace the derivation from the start symbol S to see if I can reach the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production only expands into two non-terminals, so each step either adds one terminal or one non-terminal.\n\nLet's identify the start symbol, which is S: \n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nSo, the first part of the string should come from NT18 and the second part from NT42.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is `t57`, so let's see what NT18 can produce. From the grammar:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nSo, NT18 must derive into something that starts with NT23 and ends with t57. The next token after `t57` is `t38`, so let's see what NT23 can produce.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nThen, `t38` must come from NT54. Looking at NT54 in the grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT49 NT45\nNT54 can also be a terminal, but wait, no, I think in the grammar, NT54 is a non-terminal because it's written as NT54, not 't54'. So, NT54 must derive into its components.\n\nWait, in the given string, after `t38` is `t45`, but NT54's production is either NT49 NT45 or a terminal? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nOh, looking back, I noticed some entries like 't38' which are terminals, so NT54 can be a terminal? No, wait, NT54 is a non-terminal because it's written as NT54. Unless there's a production for NT54 that includes a terminal, but in this case, NT54's productions are:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT49 NT45, NT54 \u2192 ... Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33' (is that possible? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me list all NT entries and their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT49 NT45, or is it a terminal?\n\nWait, the grammar has \"NTx \u2192 'ty'\" where 'ty' is a terminal, so for example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't54' ?\n\nWait, no, let's re-examine:\n\nLooking for productions where NTx is a terminal:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't50'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't38'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't51'\n\nNT7 \u2192 Not defined, but perhaps others.\n\nWait, so in the grammar, some NTs are terminals (end in 't'), which is crucial because each step either introduces a new non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nSo, when we have a production like NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, that would mean NT18 = NT23 NT57. So, in the string, we should have the result of NT23 followed by NT57.\n\nSimilarly, for NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and so on.\n\nEach time we have a production, the non-terminals break down into smaller components until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, let's try to work through the string step by step, breaking it down from the start and verifying if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven the string: t57 t38 t45 t48 t21 t27 t54 t54 t38 t43 t51 t33 t10 t49 t36 t23 t36 t21 t49 t54 t55 t50 t47 t51 t55 t28 t28 t45 t33 t10 t11 t9 t35 t35 t48 t49 t22 t28 t35 t10 t49 t38 t54 t7 t27 t11 t50 t21.\n\nThat's quite long. Let me try to parse it as per the initial steps.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the string must start with the expansion of NT18 followed by the expansion of NT42.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t57 t38..., that suggests that the first component (NT18's expansion) is t57, but wait, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 is split into NT23 and NT57.\n\nThus, the first part of the string should be the result of NT23 and then NT57.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t57. So, the last production before t57 must be NT57, but in the grammar, NT57 appears as a non-terminal. Wait, actually, looking back, NT57 is a production:\n\nWait, I don't see a production for NT57. Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT57: No, I see NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, NT28 \u2192 NT42 NT43, etc. But I don't see NT57 as a non-terminal. Instead, there's NT57 in the string as a terminal because it's under the format t57.\n\nWait, so NT57 is a terminal. So, in the derivation, NT23 must somehow produce t57. But in the grammar, NT57 doesn't exist\u2014wait, in the grammar, the non-terminals are up to NT57. Let me check: the grammar starts with S, NT18, NT5 etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions are:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nWhich means NT18 breaks into NT23 and NT57. So NT57 must be a non-terminal. But in the grammar, I don't see NT57 as a non-terminal. Let me check the entire list again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nThen NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT49 NT45\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, do we have any NTx where x=57? No, because in the provided grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT54 is another non-terminal.\n\nSo, NT57 is not a defined non-terminal. Therefore, NT57 must be a terminal. So, the production NT18 is producing a terminal t57, but according to the grammar, the only way is that NT18's production breaks into further non-terminals, which would require NT57 to be a non-terminal. But since NT57 isn't a non-terminal, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the productions.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Here's part of it:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nYes, so NT57 is on the right side, meaning that NT18 must derive into those two non-terminals, which could then be further expanded.

{"custom_id":"request-905","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. Also, the start symbol here is S, and from the productions, I can see that S is derived into NT18 NT42. \n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long: it starts with t50, t50, t11, and ends with t9, t11, t21, etc. I remember that in CNF grammars, the leftmost derivation trees follow a particular structure, often leading to strings where the number of symbols is 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. Wait, no, actually CNF productions have two non-terminals, so the maximum number of symbols in a string is something like n times 2^{k}, but I might be getting that wrong. Anyway, the string length here is, let me count: the string has 43 tokens? Let me check:\n\nt50, t50, t11, t23, t55, t43, t40, t31, t54, t45, t31, t10, t40, t12, t57, t49, t47, t31, t12, t28, t10, t22, t31, t27, t53, t9, t55, t10, t47, t47, t48, t21, t55, t47, t27, t48, t9, t11, t21, t54, t43, t22, t21, t40, t36, t12, t53, t31, t38.\n\nCount: 38 tokens. Hmm, 38 is not a power of two, which makes me think that perhaps this string might not be directly generated by the grammar, as each step in CNF tends to double the number, but maybe that's not always the case because you can have multiple derivations or perhaps it's more about the structure.\n\nWait, but actually, each production can be applied in different ways. So it's possible that the string could be derived from S through various expansions. Maybe the string is composed of multiple symbols that come from the terminal rules. Looking at the grammar, each symbol seems to resolve to a single terminal or a combination of two. For example, NT18 \u2192 't10', and in the string it appears as t50, which is a terminal, so I need to see what NT50 resolves to, but wait, wait. Wait no, in the grammar, the non-terminals are all in brackets, like NT18, and the terminals are under the braces. Wait, sorry, looking back, the grammar is a list of productions. Let me parse it again to see which symbols are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is in the form Variable \u2192 Non-terminal1 Non-terminal2. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and then NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, etc. But when I see a production like NT9 \u2192 't35', that's a terminal. So 't35' is a terminal symbol in this grammar.\n\nSo the string consists of a bunch of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol in this grammar. So the task is to see if this sequence can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, 38 symbols, if the grammar starts with S and each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, the number of symbols would increase exponentially. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which are both non-terminals. Then each of those would be replaced, leading to four, then eight, etc. But 38 is not a power of two, so that suggests that perhaps the string isn't directly produced by this grammar because the length isn't a power of two. But wait, maybe the grammar allows for left or rightmost derivations, so maybe the number of symbols can vary more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S is replaced by two non-terminals, and each of those could be further expanded, and perhaps some replacements lead to terminals, while others remain as non-terminals. So the maximum possible number of terminals would be 2^depth, but the exact count could vary.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully. Each time you apply a production, each non-terminal can be replaced by two non-terminals, so the number doubles, but if some of them are terminals, then each non-terminal replacement adds one terminal per step. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model this as the string generated has length n where n is the number of non-terminals replaced as terminals plus one. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key here is that each production step in CNF grammar can generate a string that must have an even number of symbols since each step replaces a single non-terminal with two. So starting from S, the first step would produce two symbols. If each of those can then be expanded, each would produce two, so after two steps, four symbols, etc. Thus, the length of the string derivable from S must be a power of two, like 2,4,8,16,32,64, etc. \n\nLet me check the string length: 38 is not a power of two. The next higher power is 64, but 32 < 38 <64. So perhaps this suggests that the string is not generated by this grammar. But wait, perhaps the initial S is followed by expanding some non-terminals first, and then others. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Both NT18 and NT42 would have to be expanded until they become terminals. So each non-terminal in their productions would themselves expand. So, for example, NT18 \u2192 't10', which is a terminal, so that's one terminal. NT42 can be expanded into two non-terminals, which in turn can lead to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, wait, let's look at NT42 in the productions. Looking back:\n\nNT42 has multiple productions, like NT42 \u2192 NT27 NT43, and also NT42 \u2192 't27'. So in the grammar, NT42 can become a terminal 't27'. But in the given string, I see 't50', which is not directly mapped as a terminal. Wait, no, in the list of productions, it's all about the non-terminals. The terminals are under braces, like 't10', 't27', etc.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I misread the productions. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is given as a list of rules, each in the form Variable \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Then NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, and so on. Then, for some NTs, for example, NT9 \u2192 't35'. So 't35' is a terminal.\n\nWait, so the terminals are any strings under the braces, e.g., 't10', 't42', etc. So the string in question is all 't's followed by numbers, which are either terminals or non-terminals depending on the grammar.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I have to see which of the symbols in the string correspond to terminals in the grammar. So the string is: t50, t50, t11, t23, ..., down to t9, t11, etc. So each of these is a terminal, but to parse this, perhaps we need to see if these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut in the grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't35', NT5 \u2192 't40', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, none of the terminals correspond to the direct ones in the grammar. For example, the string has t50, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT that maps to 't50'.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, when I see a { 'tn' }, that's a terminal. So for example:\n\n- 't10' appears for NT9, NT2, NT7, etc.\n- 't27' appears for NT42, NT28, etc.\n- 't43' appears for NT8, etc.\n- 't31' appears for NT8, etc.\n- 't54' appears for NT43, etc.\n- 't35' for NT9\n- 't40' for NT5\n- 't12' for NT27\n- 't9' for NT2, etc.\nWait, but the string given has t50, which is not listed as any terminal in the grammar.

The string I'm given is a sequence of terminal symbols, each preceded by a space. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which is rewritten as NT18 NT42 (S -> NT18 NT42). So each production in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, except where the non-terminals resolve into terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that many non-terminals eventually resolve into terminal symbols, denoted by the presence of 't' followed by a number. For example, NT9 -> 't35' and NT2 -> 't28'. My goal is to replace all non-terminals in the string with their corresponding terminals and see if the overall string matches.\n\nLet me list all the production rules that replace non-terminals with terminals:\n\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT43 -> 't57'\n- NT45 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't33'\n- NT38 -> 't51'\n- NT51 -> 't7'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT50 -> 't50'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT36 -> 't36'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n- NT38 -> 't12'\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT33 -> 't33' (since NT33 is a non-terminal, but the production is NT33 -> NT33, which is a bit circular, but in the given rules, NT33 isn't listed as producing a terminal, so maybe it's part of a chain leading to a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, NT33 is actually part of a production, but in this list, NT33 isn't present. Hmm, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, let me check the given productions again. Looking through them, I don't see any rules for NT33, which is confusing because it's in the terminals list. Oh, perhaps it's a typo, or it's intended to resolve to a terminal, but in the provided rules, it's not listed. That could be a problem. The string has a 't33' in it, so if NT33 doesn't produce a terminal, that could be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, no, in the production rules, NT33 isn't present as a left-hand side. So maybe it's meant to be NT33 -> something else, but not provided. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be NT36 or another non-terminal that actually resolves. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with what I have.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string and replacing each symbol with what it becomes, using the given rules:\n\nThe string is: t35 t49 t43 t28 t10 t57 t33 t36 t55 t27 t33 t48 t22 t48 t45 t57 t22 t51 t23 t47 t48 t11 t54 t50 t10 t11 t57 t9 t47 t22 t7 t53 t40 t35 t40 t21 t6 t50 t57 t31 t50 t6 t38 t38 t55 t33 t53 t48 t9\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so I need to see if each of these 't...x' strings can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me go through each terminal and see its replacement.\n\n1. t35: NT9 -> t35. So 't35' comes from NT9.\n\n2. t49: Looking at the rules, NT26 -> t49. So that's NT26.\n\n3. t43: Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see NT43 -> something. Wait, the production for NT43 is NT43 -> t43? Because in the terminal list, there's 't43', but in the production rules, I don't see NT43 being rewritten. Wait, no, looking back: NT43's production isn't listed. Wait, let me check the given production list.\n\nLooking back: NT43 isn't a left-hand side of any production except in one rule? Wait, in the given rules, NT43 appears on the right side: for example, NT27 -> NT42 NT43. Also, NT43 is a right-hand side in other productions, like NT10 -> 't43' and NT38 -> 't43'.\n\nWait, in the 'rules' provided, I see NT43 -> t43? Or not? Let me scan through:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT4 -> 't9', NT5 -> 't40', NT36 -> 't36', NT43 -> 't38'? Wait no: \n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT43 -> t57? No, looking:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT42 -> t27\n- NT22 -> t43\n- NT28 -> t55\n- NT57 -> t31\n- NT8 -> t11\n- NT4 -> t9\n- NT5 -> t40\n- NT36 -> t36\n- NT47 -> t21\n- NT38 -> t12\n- NT51 -> t7\n- NT18 -> t10\n- NT26 -> t49\n- NT50 -> t50\n- NT45 -> t10\n- NT38 -> t53? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions I can find:\n\n- NT9 -> t35\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT42 -> t27\n- NT43 -> t57\n- NT45 -> t10\n- NT54 -> t33\n- NT38 -> t53\n- NT51 -> t7\n- NT18 -> t10\n- NT26 -> t49\n- NT50 -> t50\n- NT40 -> t6\n- NT36 -> t36\n- NT47 -> t21\n- NT38 -> t12\n- NT57 -> t31\n- NT8 -> t11\n- NT4 -> t9\n- NT5 -> t40\n- NT33 isn't directly a terminal, but wait\u2014is it? Let me check:\n\nIn the string, there are 't33's. Looking through the rules, is there a non-terminal that produces t33? For example, NT54 is t33. So 't33' is the production of NT54. So in the string, every 't33' comes from NT54.\n\nOk, I'll note that.\n\nPutting that aside for now, let me process each token step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start with the start symbol and see if I can derive the string. Alternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to parse the string by breaking it down into parts and seeing if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be parsed using the grammar's productions, replacing each symbol with the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if each can be matched to a production's right-hand side.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the initial expansion is NT18 NT42, each followed by more expansions.\n\nThe string starts with t35 t49... So let's see:\n\nt35 comes from NT9.\n\nt49 comes from NT26.\n\nSo the first part of the string is NT9 NT26.\n\nSo that would come from NT18 -> NT23 NT57 (looking at production rules: NT18 -> NT23 NT57). Wait, no, is that the case?\n\nWait, looking back at production rules:\n\nYes, production NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT18 can produce NT23 NT57.\n\nBut then t35 is from NT9, which must come from NT23?\n\nWait, that might not work because NT23, according to the production rules, can produce NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long, so I need to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. Then, each of these terminals is processed by other rules until they reach the 't' symbols, which are the actual terminal symbols in the language.\n\nI know that each non-terminal can only produce two other non-terminals, and each production involves two steps. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step should eliminate one non-terminal until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' symbols. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string. Parsing context-free grammars can be tricky, but since this is CNF and each production has two non-terminals, it's a bit more manageable.\n\nThe string starts with 't43', so I need to find where 't43' appears in the grammar as a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT43 produces 't57' and 't47'. Wait, that's not directly 't43'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules: \n- NT43 -> 't57' and 't47'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n\nWait, no, the string has 't43' at position somewhere. Wait, the first token is 't43', but looking at the rules, no NT directly produces 't43'. So that's confusing. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Looking for 't43'. The rules include:\n- NT43 -> 't57' and 't47'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n- NT45 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't33'\n- NT38 -> 't51' and others.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, NT36 can produce 't48' and 't38', but that's not 't43'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing the rule where 't43' is produced. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT8 -> 't54'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27' (a)\n- NT42 \u2192 't4' and 't13' (b)\n- Also, NT43 \u2192 't57' and 't47'\n\nWait, no 't43' seems to be directly produced by any NT. So perhaps the string contains 't43', but the grammar doesn't have a production for 't43' as a terminal. That could mean the string is invalid.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check the grammar. The rule NT43 is defined as NT43 -> 't57' and 't47' which means it can't produce 't43' itself. So if the string contains 't43', it's not possible because there's no rule that directly produces it. That would make the string invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Looking through the rules, the 't's are as follows:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT8 \u2192 't54', etc.\n\nLooking through the list, I see 't43' doesn't appear as a terminal anywhere. So if the string contains 't43', it can't be generated by this grammar because there's no production rule that results in 't43'. So the string cannot be generated, right?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the string was mistyped, or perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me go back.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, the NT43 (if any) is defined elsewhere? Wait, no, I don't see NT43 defined anywhere else. The rules for NT43 are under NT5, perhaps? Or some other NT?\n\nWait, no: The grammar has NT43 as a terminal only if the rule says otherwise. Looking through, NT43 is not defined as an NT; instead, it's only part of the production. Wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT43 appears as a terminal if any rule ends with it. Let's see:\n\n- Looking for NT43 in the production as the first symbol: I see NT43 in NT27 \u2192 't42' and 't43'. Wait, no, under NT27, the production is 't42' and 't43'? Let me check.\n\nYes, looking at the production: NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. Then NT42 is further broken down into 't27' and 't43'? Wait, no, NT42 has several productions:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT5'27' and NT42, but that's part of some other rule. Wait, no. Wait, looking again, under NT5, it's NT23 NT47, which doesn't help. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Each line represents a production for a particular non-terminal. So, for example, NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, and so on.\n\nWait, looking for any productions that directly have 't43' as a terminal:\n\n- Under NT23: it's 't49' and other NTs.\n- Under NT42: one production is NT42 \u2192 't27' (from NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, and NT4 \u2192 't9', which may lead to 't27' eventually? Not sure.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Since 't43' appears in the string, I need to see if any production can directly produce 't43'. Looking through all the terminal symbols:\n\nThe terminal symbols are the 't' labels: t10, t18, t2, t4, t5, t8, t9, t10, t11, t22, t23, t26, t27, t28, t29, t31, t33, t36, t38, t4, t40, t41, t42, t43, t45, t47, t48, t49, t51, t53, t54, t55, t57.\n\nWait, t43 is one of them, but looking through the grammar, is there a production that directly generates 't43'? Let's check each rule:\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to see if any production ends with 't43'. Let's go through the rules:\n\n- NT5: produces NT23 and NT47. Neither leads to 't43'.\n- NT2: produces NT10 and NT22. Neither leads to 't43'.\n- NT4: produces NT8 and NT10. Again, doesn't lead to 't43'.\n- NT18: produces NT23 and NT57. 't57' is a terminal, but NTT57 produces 't31', so 't57' can't generate 't43'.\n- NT27: produces NT42 and NT43. Oh, wait, NT27's production is NT42 and NT43, so 't43' is a terminal in NT27's production. Wait, no, the production is NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. So both NT42 and NT43 are non-terminals. So NT27 can't produce 't43' directly.\n\nWait, but maybe through the NT43. Let's check NT43's production:\n\nLooking for NT43: The rules are under other non-terminals, like NT43 is part of NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47. It's also part of NT27, which is part of NT9, which is part of NT2, etc. Wait, no, I don't think NT43 is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, any terminal symbols are the 't's. So, in the grammar, each 't' is a terminal. So the grammar includes all the production rules, but 't's are leaves. So, any 't' can be produced directly by an NT that has that terminal in its production.\n\nLooking at the list of 't's:\n\nLooking for 't43' in the production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-918","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are all like A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except when a production leads directly to a terminal, which marks the end of that path. So each production either sends us deeper into the non-terminals or directly to a terminal.\n\nNow, the string given is a series of terminals, which are 't' followed by numbers. The string is quite long, so I'll need to parse it step by step. The string is: \n\nt9 t33 t38 t43 t6 t23 t38 t31 t33 t9 t22 t9 t38 t53 t50 t28 t10 t12 t45 t57 t40 t48 t33 t50 t21 t28 t33 t53 t10 t51 t27 t35 t33 t28 t31 t48 t7 t33 t57 t28 t57 t55 t54 t50 t23 t6 t53 t40 t57 t48.\n\nMy plan is to write down the steps of the derivation, checking if it follows the production rules. But this string is 54 tokens long, which is manageable, but I might need to structure it.\n\nEach production in the grammar splits into two non-terminals or terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to find a way to split this string into a derivation tree where each node is a production, breaking down into two parts each time.\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals derive each terminal in the string. For example, looking at the string, the first token is t9. I need to find which production leads directly to t9. Looking at the grammar, NT9 is defined as NT40 NT28. Wait, no, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, each rule is in the form NT_x -> NT_y NT_z. But some rules go directly to terminals. For example, NT9 is given as 't43'? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production rules are listed as S -> NT18 NT42, NT5 -> NT23 NT47, etc., and some of these are productions to terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't43', meaning that when we expand NT9, we get the terminal 't43'. Similarly, other NTs lead to terminals.\n\nSo, for each token, I need to see if it's a terminal (like 't33') or a non-terminal. In the string, all tokens are terminals with prefix 't'. So, the string is built by successively expanding non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven that, each step in the String must be generated by a production that leads to a set of terminals, starting from the root S.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, so each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So in the string, each token corresponds to a terminal produced by one of these productions.\n\nTo parse the string, I need to find a sequence of productions that can split the string into the correct sequence.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the structure of the grammar.\n\nFirst, S expands into NT18 NT42, so the first split is into NT18 and NT42. Each of these will generate substrings that combine into the overall string.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t9. Let's see which NTs derive to t9. Looking at the grammar rules: NT9 -> 't43' (from NT9 -> 't43'), but I need to see if there's any NT that produces t9.\n\nWait, I'm looking through the rules, and I see NT9 -> 't43', but is there another NT that produces 't9'? Yes, I see at the end of the grammar: NT4 -> 't9'. Oh, right, so NT4 can produce 't9'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals in the string, like t33, t38, etc., each of these must be produced by some production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but no, in the grammar, some rules produce terminals. For each terminal in the string, I need to check if it's a directly produced terminal by some rule.\n\nLooking back, I see a few 't's:\n\n- NT9 -> 't43' (so t43 is a terminal).\n- NT22 -> 't28' (t28)\n- NT27 -> 't42' (t42)\n- NT42 -> 't27' (t27 is a terminal, which is 't27', and so on.\n\nWait, but when I look at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals directly:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT9 -> 't43'\n\nNT22 -> 't28'\n\nNT27 -> 't42'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT8 -> 't54'\n\nRT4 -> 't9'\n\nAnd others like NT58 -> NT42 NT41, but wait, in the list:\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 -> NT29 ->t38 wait no, perhaps I need to list all the 't' rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of all the rules that go directly to a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-11","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the string \"t10 t54\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by analyzing the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice the grammar has a series of productions where each NT symbol is broken down into two other NT symbols, except for some that directly produce terminal symbols (like 'tX'). The string we're evaluating is composed of two terminal symbols: \"t10\" and \"t54\". \n\nI'll start by looking at how \"t10\" can be derived. From the grammar, I see that NT18 can produce \"t10\" via the production NT18 -> NT23 NT57, but wait, actually, looking again, I think I got that wrong. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, no, upon re-checking, I see that NT18 has the production NT18 -> NT23 NT57, but also NT18 -> \"t10\" via another production. Let me check that. Looking through the list, yes, I see NT18 -> \"t10\" in the productions. So, that production allows NT18 directly to produce \"t10\".\n\nSimilarly, looking at \"t54\", I need to see if any non-terminal produces it. Checking the productions, I see NT26 -> \"t49\", and also others like NT28 -> \"t55\", but I'm looking for \"t54\". Wait, no, \"t54\" comes from NT28: NT28 -> \"t54\" via the production NT28 -> NT4 NT40, but wait, that's not the case for \"t54\". Wait, no, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT8 -> \"t54\" via NT8 -> \"t54 NT49\". Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT8 are: NT8 -> \"t54 NT49\", so actually, NT8 can produce \"t54\" when it's derived, but I think I got that wrong because \"t54\" is a terminal. So to produce \"t54\", the non-terminal must have a production that results in \"t54\".\n\nLooking again at the productions, I see NT54 is a non-terminal with a production NT54 -> \"t33\". So how do we get \"t54\"? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, wait, the productions are for the non-terminals, so the terminal symbols are single letters, like 't10', 't54', etc. So any non-terminal with a rule that directly produces \"t54\" would allow it, but I need to check if any non-terminal's production includes \"t54\".\n\nWait, let me go through each production and see if any of them directly produce \"t10\" or \"t54\". Looking at the list:\n\n- NT18 -> \"t10\"\n- NT2 -> \"t28\"\n- NT4 -> \"t9\"\n- NT5 -> \"t40\"\n- NT27 -> \"t42\"\n- NT42 -> \"t27\"\n- Wait, but no, wait, looking at each production:\n\nLooking for \"t10\": Only NT18 has a production NT18 -> \"t10\"\n\nLooking for \"t54\": Checking the productions, does any NT produce \"t54\"? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT8 -> \"t54 NT49\", but wait, that's not a direct production, that's a production of NT8 -> NT4 NT49 where NT49 -> \"t54\". Wait, let me check: NT8 has the production NT8 -> NT4 NT49. And NT4 -> \"t9\", NT49 -> \"t54\".\n\nWait, so to get \"t54\", NT49 can be used because it directly produces \"t54\". But in the grammar, I see NT49 -> \"t45\". Wait, no, let me check again. Looking back, the productions are:\n\n- NT49 -> \"t45\"\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because then NT49 cannot produce \"t54\", so where does \"t54\" come from? Let's see other productions for NT54: Oh, wait, the grammar has NT54 -> \"t33\", but I'm looking for \"t54\".\n\nMaybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all production rules again:\n\nLooking for strings that produce \"t54\":\n\n- NT42 -> \"t54\" via NT42 -> \"t54 NT41\"? Wait, no, I see:\n\nWait, in the productions, I have:\n\n- NT42 -> \"t27\"\n- Wait, no, looking at each production. Let me go through each rule and see if any directly produce \"t54\".\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT8 -> \"t54 NT49\" \u2013 this is a production where NT8 is split into NT4 and NT49. So to get \"t54\", we need to see how \"t54\" is generated. Wait, but NT8's production is NT4 and NT49, which are further expansions. So NT4 is \"t9\", and NT49 is \"t45\", as per the rules:\n\nWait, according to the rules, NT49 -> \"t45\", which is a terminal. So NT8's production would expand into \"t9 t45\", which is \"t9 t45\", not \"t54\". Therefore, how can we get \"t54\"?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confused about which non-terminals produce \"t54\". Let me check all the productions again carefully:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT42 -> \"t27\"\n- NT43 -> \"t57\"\n- NT45 -> \"t10\"\n- NT54 -> \"t33\"\n- NT27 -> \"t42\"\n- NT43 -> \"t38\"\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let's check the entire list again.\n\nLooking for any NT whose rule includes \"t54\":\n\n- NT54: \"t33\"\n- NT8: \"t54 NT49\" \u2013 Wait, is \"t54\" a terminal? Or is \"t54\" part of a production?\n\nWait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So \"t54\" is a terminal, so it must appear directly in a production rule.\n\nSo looking at all the rules, I need to find any NT that directly produces \"t54\". Scanning through the list:\n\n- NT8 -> \"t54 NT49\" \u2013 No, that's two terminals, not a single one.\n- NT8 -> NT4 NT49 \u2013 Wait, that's two non-terminals.\n- NT28 -> \"t54 NT44\"? No, I don't see that.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check each rule again:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT10\nWait, no, the initial rule is S -> NT18 NT18? Or maybe not. Wait, let's list all the rules properly.\n\nHere's the entire list again:\n\n- S -> NT18 NT57\n- NT5 -> NT23 NT58\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT22 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT40\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT58\n- NT28 -> NT43 NT5\n- NT53 -> NT42 NT38\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT2 -> NT43 NT9\n- NT42 -> NT54 NT41\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT5\n- NT28 -> NT43 NT55\n- NT57 -> NT31\n- NT8 -> NT11\n- NT4 -> NT9\n- NT5 -> NT40\n- NT36 -> NT36\n- NT43 -> NT47\n- NT42 -> NT54\n- NT47 -> NT21\n- NT38 -> NT12\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial list.

Let me start by understanding what the grammar looks like and how it can be used to generate strings.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the production rules, I can see a mix of non-terminals and terminals, with each production having exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right (except for the start symbol S which is followed by two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42).\n\nThe string to check is \"t10 t27\". Since t10, t27, etc., are terminals, we need to see if they can be derived directly from some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the first production rule, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, to derive the string, we must have both NT18 and NT42, each of which must derive to 't10' and 't27' respectively, or other combinations that can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at NT18, the production rules are:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> NT26 NT54\nNT18 -> NT23 NT54\nNT18 -> NT26 NT50\nNT18 -> NT23 NT36\nNT18 -> NT26 NT43\nNT18 -> NT23 NT38\nNT18 -> NT26 NT40\nNT18 -> NT23 NT49\nNT18 -> NT26 NT53\n\nWait, but none of these directly produce 't10' or 't27'.

{"custom_id":"request-24","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the string `t10 t28 t12` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, a grammar in CNF has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows us to use algorithms likeCYK, but since I'm just manually checking, I'll focus on the structure of the string.\n\nThe grammar provided has several non-terminals (NT) on the left side and other NTs and terminals on the right. Some non-terminals are directly tied to terminals: NT2 is 't28', NT4 is 't9', NT8 is sometimes 't54' or 't47' or 't4', and others. Similarly, other non-terminals are replaced by terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t10 t28 t12`. So, breaking it down into tokens, it's three terminals: t10, t28, t12.\n\nLooking at the possible production rules, I notice that NT2, NT4, and NT8 can be terminals or other production rules. Specifically, NT2 is 't28', which matches the second token directly. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the first token is t10. Looking at the grammar, NT46 isn't mentioned, but I see that NT26 is 't49' in one production, but that's not t10. Looking through the rules, I see NT10 is 't43', NT4 is 't9'... Wait, I need to see if any non-terminal directly corresponds to t10.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't28',\nNT4 -> 't9',\nNT8 -> 't54',\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54,\nNT26 -> 't49',\nNT2 -> 't28',\nNT4 -> 't9',\nNT5 -> 't40',\nNT18 -> 't10',\nSo, NT18 is 't10'. Got it. So, for the first token t10, that's NT18. Now, looking at NT18's production:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, t10 is generated from NT18, which requires that NT23 and NT57 are present. Now, let's look at NT23 and NT57.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT23 -> NT26 NT54. And NT26 is 't49', which is a terminal. But wait, in the string, the next token after t10 is t28, which is NT2, and then t12. Wait, no, the original string is t10 t28 t12. So, after t10, t28, comes t12.\n\nBut according to NT18 -> NT23 NT57, t10 is produced by NT23 and NT57. Let's look at NT23: it's NT26 and NT54. NT26 is 't49', which isn't part of our string. So that path might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. NT23 is NT26 NT54, and NT26 is 't49', which isn't in our string. But our string after t10 has t28. So, perhaps that path isn't correct. Maybe I need to look for another production.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps NT18 is 't10' via another production, but in the given grammar, NT18 is only defined as NT23 NT57. So, that seems fixed.\n\nSo, since NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and NT23 -> NT26 NT54, which then leads to 't49' and maybe something else. That doesn't fit our string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider whether there are other ways to reach t10, but in the given grammar, NT18's only production is NT23 NT57. So, that's fixed. Therefore, we must look for whether the string can be broken down according to this.\n\nWait, another thought: in the string `t10 t28 t12`, t10 is part of the original production. So, perhaps t10 is generated from a different non-terminal. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammars:\n\nNT2 -> 't28', which is t28.\n\nNT4 -> 't9'.\n\nNT8 -> sometimes 't54', but once it's 't47' or 't4'.\n\nWait, no. The string is `t10 t28 t12`. So, t10 is nt18, as per NT18's production.\n\nBut wait, what about the overall structure. Let's think about the initial production S -> NT18 NT42, but I don't think that's used here, because the string has three parts, which is odd because S's productions are always two parts since it's in CNF.\n\nWait, no. S's production is always two parts, but the string is three tokens. That suggests that the start symbol S must generate a string of two parts, but how does this string have three tokens? That seems conflicting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the given string has three tokens: t10, t28, t12. But the start symbol S in the grammar is S -> NT18 NT42, which is two non-terminals. So the entire string generated from S would consist of two parts, each possibly being a sequence of terminals. But the string here has three parts. So perhaps this is a problem. But in some cases, the production could have NTs leading to sequences of terminals and\/or other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is not being generated fully by the initial production. Let me think. The initial production is S -> NT18 NT42. So each of NT18 and NT42 must derive into a sequence of terminals. If the entire string is `t10 t28 t12`, that's three tokens. So, let me see.\n\nSo, if NT18 \u2192 ... and NT42 \u2192 ... and when combined, the concatenation has three tokens, that's possible. Let's check.\n\nFrom the rules, NT18 is defined as NT23 NT57, so that's two NTs. And NT42 can be 't27' or other paths.\n\nWait, let's explore that.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 can be 't27', which would make S generate NT23 NT57 and 't27' on the RHS.\n\nWait, no: because in NT42's production, if the production is NT27 is 't27'? Wait, no, NT42's production could be 't27' or 't42' via other paths.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's first get NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nLet\u2019s substitute S with NT18 and NT42.\n\nNow, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 can be either:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT42 -> 't27',\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13,\n\nNT42 -> 't28',\n\nSo, 't28' is one of the terminals.\n\nSo, let me consider that NT42 could derive 't28'. If that's the case, then the overall string would be NT18 (which is NT23 NT57) followed by 't28', producing a string that is (NT23 NT57) \u2192 ... and then 't28'.\n\nWait, but the overall string is three tokens: t10 t28 t12. So, perhaps the combination is:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t10, which is NT23\u2192 something, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each component of the string:\n\nThe entire string is `t10 t28 t12`. Let's split it into parts. Since S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which would produce a string that's the concatenation of NT18's expansion and NT42's expansion.\n\nSo, if NT18 can expand into a string that, when concatenated with NT42's expansion, gives the entire string.\n\nWait, let me check NT18 first. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, what does NT23 and NT57 expand into?\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49' (a terminal).\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33' (another terminal).\n\nSo, combining these, NT23 expands into 't49' 't33'.\n\nBut in our string, after t10, we have t28."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

All right, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t10 t28 t51`, which has three terminals. In Chomsky Normal Form, the leftmost derivation of a string must match it exactly, which means each production step should reduce exactly one non-terminal at a time until all terminals are laid out.\n\nLet's look at the start symbol: S.\n\nThe start rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S is derived into two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. Each of these must be derived into their respective parts.\n\nLooking at each of these non-terminals:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nWait, but looking further, in the NT42 production, I see it has two options: NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38 and NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. In the context of the given string, one of the NT42 productions is used. So which one is used?\n\nLooking at the string, we have t10, t28, t51. Let's see which parts match.\n\nWhen S \u2192 NT18 NT42, both NT18 and NT42 must produce a sequence of terminals that, when combined, are t10 t28 t51.\n\nLet's break down NT18. It's NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54, but also NT26 is derived into 't49' on one of the productions, but looking at NT26's rules, I see NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 and NT26 \u2192 t23. So maybe NT26 is either 't23' or goes to another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me go through each step methodically.\n\nStarting with NT18: must produce some terminals. Then NT42 must produce the rest.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT18 NT42, the string must be produced by NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nSo, NT18 must produce the first part of the string, which in the given string is t10, t28, t51.\n\nWait, but the string is t10 t28 t51, which is three tokens. So:\n\nIf NT18 -> t10, then NT18 must produce t10 at some point.\n\nLooking at NT18's rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, NT18 must be broken down into NT23 and NT57. So, NT23 must produce t10, and NT57 must produce t28 and t51?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because NT57 is actually the terminal 't57'. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT57 \u2192 t51. Because looking at the production:\n\nNT57 \u2192 t51.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me compile all the terminals and non-terminals:\n\nTerminals are the 't' followed by a number. So t10, t28, t51 are terminals. The rest are non-terminals, like NT18, NT23, etc.\n\nNow, let's see the given string: t10, t28, t51.\n\nWe have to get this in the order of the derivation. So, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the first non-terminal to be expanded is NT18, which should produce t10, and then NT42 should produce t28 and t51? Or maybe both NT18 and NT42 produce some parts, and together they form the entire string.\n\nBut wait, S generates a string that is the concatenation of NT18's output and NT42's output. So we need to see if NT18 can produce some terminals and NT42 can produce the rest.\n\nLet's look at NT18:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, NT23 and NT57 have to be expanded into their sequences.\n\nLooking at NT23's rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 can be 't49' or NT23 NT54 (wait, looking back: NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 and also NT26 \u2192 t23.\n\nWait, so NT26 can be 't23' or further broken down.\n\nIf NT26 is 't23', then NT23 becomes 't23' followed by NT54.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nFirst, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNow, NT26 can be:\n\nEither NT26 \u2192 t23, so if we choose that, then NT23 becomes t23 and NT54.\n\nThen NT54 \u2192 t33?\n\nWait, looking at NT54's production: NT54 \u2192 t33. Yes.\n\nWait, but NT26 could also go to NT23 NT54. Hmm, but in the current context, maybe choosing 't23' for NT26 would be the right path.\n\nSo, NT26 \u2192 t23.\n\nSo now, NT23 becomes t23 followed by NT54.\n\nThen, NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nWait, so NT23 would produce t23 t33.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nIf NT26 is t23, and NT54 is t33, so NT23 \u2192 t23 t33.\n\nBut in the string we have t10, t28, t51.

Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, in the productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nSo NT23 can only produce t26 and t54? Because if NT26 is a terminal, and NT54 is a terminal, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT26 -> t49\n\nSo NT26 is 't49' as a terminal. Similarly, NT54 -> t33? Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT26 -> t49\n\nNT54 -> t33? Let's check: Is there a production NT54 -> t33?\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT54 -> t33: Yes, under NT54 -> t54 which is t33? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, looking through, yes: there's NT54 -> t33, which is a terminal. So, NT54 is 't33'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 is 't49' and NT25 is 't25', wait no:\n\nWait, the productions include NT26 -> t49 (Yes, line: NT26 ->t49). So, NT26 is t49, and NT54 is t33. So, if NT23 -> NT26 NT54, that's t49 t33, which is \"t49 t33\". But our string has t23 as the first element. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, that suggests that t23 cannot be generated, which contradicts the string. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. Maybe the breakdown is different. Let's think again.\n\nThe string is \"t23 t33 t31 t54\". So four symbols. The grammar starts with S -> NT18 NT42. So each symbol must be derived from either NT18 or NT42.\n\nWait, no, wait: S produces NT18 and NT42, so the string would be the concatenation of the two derived strings from NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, but in our case, the string has four symbols, so perhaps each NT (18 and 42) produces two symbols each. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nSo, for instance, NT18 could generate t23 and t33, and NT42 generates t31 and t54. But that depends on the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT18 and NT42 each generate two symbols. Let me check the possible productions.\n\nFirst, NT18: in the grammar, we have NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and then NT23 -> NT26 NT54, but t23 is generated as NT23, which would require NT26 and NT54. But as per earlier, NT26 is t49, and NT54 is t33. So that would produce t49 t33, which is not what we have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps each symbol in the string is generated by a non-terminal, and each non-terminal needs to be produced in the correct order.\n\nWait, the string is four symbols: t23, t33, t31, t54.\n\nSo starting from S: S -> AB, where A is NT18 and B is NT42.\n\nSo, the overall string is A's derivation concatenated with B's derivation.\n\nThus, the first two symbols are from A (which is NT18) and the next two from B (which is NT42).\n\nWait, but our string has t23 as the first symbol, so A (NT18) must produce t23 as the first step, and then B (NT42) must produce t33, t31, t54. Hmm.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So NT18 can't directly produce t23 unless NT23 produces t23, which it doesn't because NT23 -> NT26 NT54, which we saw lead to t49 and t33.\n\nSo perhaps that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the split is different. Maybe the string is not necessarily in the order of NT18 followed by NT42, because the initial production is S -> NT18 NT42, which is a concatenation of two non-terminals. So, the string should be the concatenation of what NT18 can produce and what NT42 can produce.\n\nBut our string is \"t23 t33 t31 t54\", which is four tokens. So let me think about whether NT18 can produce two symbols and NT42 can produce two symbols.\n\nSo, starting with NT18:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. Now, NT23 is a non-terminal that produces NT26 NT54. So NT23 can't directly produce t23. Instead, it produces two terminals: t49 and t33. Wait, no, no\u2014I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and NT26 is a terminal, as per NT26 -> t49, and NT54 is a terminal, as per NT54 -> t33.\n\nSo, NT23 produces t49 and t33.\n\nSimilarly, NT57: NT57-> NT31 NT58, then NT58 can produce t33 or something else?\n\nWait, maybe the path from NT18 is:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\n- NT23 produces t49 t33\n\n- NT57 -> NT31 NT58\n\n-- NT31 is a terminal, as per NT31 -> t31 (though actually, looking back, I don't see that. Wait, let me check: I see NT31 pointing to something. Wait, in the productions, I don't see NT31 directly producing a terminal; perhaps I'm mistaken."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-37","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t10 t11 t43 t11\". Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze and sometimes parse.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NYT1 YT2, where NTX and NYT are non-terminals. A few are terminals, like NT4 -> 't9', etc. So, most of the non-terminals can produce other non-terminals, and some can produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string to analyze is \"t10 t11 t43 t11\". Let's split it into tokens: [t10, t11, t43, t11]. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nStarting with S, the initial symbol. From the grammar, S directly produces NT18 NT42. So, our first string after applying S -> NT18 NT42 would be \"t10 t11\", assuming NT18 and NT42 produce t10 and t11 respectively.\n\nWait, let's check what NT18 and NT42 produce. From the given rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\nHmm, that seems to loop between NT23 and NT26, producing more t's. But wait, in the string, after t10 comes t11, which isn't being produced by NT18. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to apply the productions. Let me think again.\n\nThe production S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So first, NT18 and NT42 each generate their own strings. So the entire string would be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, NT18 and NT42 each need to produce \"t10\" and \"t11\" respectively, but perhaps that's not the only possibility. Maybe the derivation is more involved.\n\nLet me try to see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLet's start from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals will need to generate their respective parts of the string.\n\nSo, NT18 needs to produce something that starts with \"t10\". Let's look at NT18's productions.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nThen, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 \u2192 which again leads back to NT23 and NT26.\n\nThis seems like a loop. Because NT23 and NT26 keep producing each other, so they might produce a string of t's. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the terminals, for example, NT26 \u2192 t49 (from NT26 \u2192 t49). Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see NT26 \u2192 t49. So, if NT26 is a non-terminal that can produce 't49', then maybe that can help.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking back, the given grammar includes several productions where non-terminals are replaced by terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\nNT38 \u2192 't51'\nNT51 \u2192 't7'\nNT18 \u2192 't10' or maybe not, looking at NT18's rules: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT57 \u2192 't31' (from NT57 \u2192 't31').\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminals directly, others only produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's check each production for each non-terminal:\n\nFor example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 \u2192 which loops\nNT54 \u2192 't33'\nWait, NT54 \u2192 't33' directly. So, if I can get to NT54 from NT23, which is part of NT23's production, then NT57 can produce 't31'.\n\nSo, if I can find a way for NT23 to eventually produce a 't' terminal, then that would be useful.\n\nWait, but NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, so NT26 needs to eventually produce something. Looking at NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. So if I keep applying these rules, it loops between NT23 and NT26, both producing NT23 and NT54. But NT54 \u2192 't33', so that would produce a 't' terminal.\n\nSo, starting at NT18:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\nSo, applying this recursively, we'll keep getting NT23 and NT26 producing more NT23 and NT54. Each time, NT54 gives a 't'.\n\nSo, for each application, we get a 't' from NT54, so maybe the number of 't's in the string relates to how deep this recursion goes.\n\nBut in the string, we have \"t10 t11 t43 t11\". So the first 't' is t10. Let's see where t10 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT8 \u2192 't54'\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and so on.\n\nWait, but I don't see a production for NT10. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a NT10 \u2192 't43', but wait, I see:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43' (Yes, line: NT10 -> 't43'). So NT10 produces 't43'.\n\nBut wait, in the string, we have a 't10', not 't43'. So that might not be relevant here. Wait, no, in the string, the token after the first one is 't11', then 't43', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the possible ways to get each 't' in the string.\n\nThe string is: t10, t11, t43, t11.\n\nSo, each of these must be generated by some production step.\n\nStarting with t10. Looking for non-terminals that produce t10:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT10 \u2192 t43. So that's a terminal, but that produces 't43', not 't10'. Wait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, let me go through each rule:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT1 -> Not shown, perhaps?\nWait, looking back, the given rules are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\nWait, wait, looking again at the rules:\n\nWait, line: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nAnd NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 \u2192 which loops, with NT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nBut none of these directly produce t10. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong line.\n\nWait, looking at the given rules, I notice that:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nSo, NT10 produces 't43', not 't10'. Hmm, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT1 \u2192 Not mentioned, perhaps it's not present?\nWait, I think I need to list each non-terminal and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm not correctly interpreting the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-54","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to check if the string \"t49 t33 t31 t9 t11\" can be generated. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars are nice because every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. For such grammars, the derivation of a string of n terminals must take exactly n-1 steps.\n\nThe given string has 5 terminals: t49, t33, t31, t9, t11. That means the derivation should have 4 steps, right? So the start symbol is S, and each step increases the count by one. Let me start by looking at the start symbol S and see how it can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S can produce NT18 and NT42. Both are non-terminals, so the next step must expand each of them.\n\nWait, but NT18 and NT42 are both non-terminals. Looking at NT18's production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. And NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. Hmm, or wait, there are multiple NT42 productions. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the rules for NT42 are: \n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT27\nIs that right? Oh, I think the grammar may have multiple options for NT42. So in the first step, S \u2192 NT18 NT42 can branch into different options.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a specific string, maybe each expansion leads closer to the terminals. So I need to find a path from S to the string.\n\nAlternatively, it might be easier to parse the string back using the grammar. So starting from the string, check which rules could have generated it.\n\nThe string is t49 t33 t31 t9 t11. Let me write it as a list: [t49, t33, t31, t9, t11]. \n\nIn CNF, every production is of length two or a terminal. But during derivation, the length increases by one each step. So to get to length 5, the derivation must have 4 steps.\n\nBut for parsing, maybe a bottom-up approach is better. Let me try that.\n\nLooking at the last token, t11. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t11.\n\nLooking through the rules: \n\n- NT51 \u2192 't7', no\n- NT13 \u2192 't11' (Yes! NT13 \u2192 t11)\n\nSo t11 must come from NT13. So the last symbol in the string, t11, comes from NT13.\n\nNow, looking at the string before t11: t36 t38. Wait, no. Wait, the string is t49, t33, t31, t9, t11. That's five parts. If the last symbol is t11, so the production before that would have two symbols leading to t11. Wait, I think I should consider the entire string as a sequence of symbols. Maybe I should restructure it.\n\nWait, in bottom-up parsing, we start from the highest level. Let me see.\n\nThe entire string is [t49, t33, t31, t9, t11]. Let me try to find two tokens that, when combined, could form a production leading to a non-terminal that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the rules, let's see which pair of symbols could come from a single non-terminal.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce two terminals. For example, NT31. Wait, looking back, NT38 \u2192 t53. Oh no, wait, I might be getting confused.\n\nLet me look for NTs that have productions ending with two or more terminals, but actually, in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, during a derivation, each symbol can only be expanded once. Therefore, the string must be a left or right derivation of such expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see each token in the string and find their parents.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\nt49: Let's see which non-terminal can produce t49. Looking for NT rules ending with t49.\n\nLooking through the rules: \n\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT8 \u2192 't54'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT13 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n\nWait, none of these produce t49 directly. So perhaps t49 is a terminal, but looking at the rules, I don't see any NT\u2192t49. So unless t49 is a terminal, which it is, but in the grammar, I don't see any production for a non-terminal that ends with t49. Wait, maybe I misread.\n\nLooking again, the rules include:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT13 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n\nSo there's no NT that directly produces 't49'. Wait, that can't be. Because in the string, t49 is the first symbol. So that would mean that the first non-terminal expanded must end with 't49'. But looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that ends with t49. So that would suggest that the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is t49 t33 t31 t9 t11. If t49 is a terminal, but in the grammar, there's no production that produces 't49' because all non-terminals either expand into other non-terminals or terminals, but none end in 't49'.\n\nSo in that case, the string can't be generated because the first symbol 't49' isn't the result of any production from a non-terminal. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each symbol:\n\nt49: No NT \u2192 t49 exists.\n\nt33: Looking for NT that produces t33.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nYes, NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nt31: Looking for NT that produces t31.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT31 isn't a non-terminal, but looking for NT where a production includes t31.\n\nWait, NT28 \u2192 't50', no. \n\nWait, looking for NT where production ends with t31.

Maybe the string isn't valid from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t49 isn't a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar: all the productions that end with a non-terminal are those like NT42 \u2192 t27. So 't' followed by numbers are terminals. So 't49' is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, in the string, the first symbol is a terminal, so it should be derived from a non-terminal that directly produces 't49'. But I don't see any such production.

{"custom_id":"request-53","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. The string to evaluate is `t23 t33 t31 t28 t51`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It looks like there are several non-terminals like S, NT18, NT42, etc., and some of them have productions that produce terminals and other non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, each separated by spaces, so each 't' followed by a number represents a terminal symbol.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me think about how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar provided is in CNF because each production on the right side has exactly one non-terminal except for the terminals.\n\nThe string given is `t23 t33 t31 t28 t51`. So the structure is five terminals: t23, t33, t31, t28, t51. I'll need to check if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to try to parse the string top-down, starting from S and seeing if each step can produce the respective terminal. Alternatively, maybe I can trace possible derivations or see if each terminal in the string can be matched by any production's right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S must derive to something starting with NT18 and then NT42. So the string should begin with the expansion of NT18 and followed by NT42.\n\nLet me write down the possible steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT42\nSo the first two symbols must be from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet's look at NT18:\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nSo that's the first expansion. NT23 and NT57. So in the string, the first terminal is t23, which matches NT23, right?\n\nBut wait, in the NT18 production, the right-hand side is NT23 and NT57. But in the string, after t23 comes t33. Hmm, so maybe there's a way to derive t33 from NT57?\n\nWait, let me think again. The production for NT18 is NT23 NT57. So the first two symbols after S would be t23 (from NT23) and then something related to NT57.\n\nLooking at NT57, I don't see it in the production rules provided. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the productions include NT57 \u2192 t31. Yes, there's a production NT57 \u2192 t31. So NT57 can produce t31. So after NT18 becomes NT23 and NT57, NT23 \u2192 t23, and NT57 \u2192 t31. So the first two symbols would be t23 and t31. But in the string, after t23 comes t33, not t31. So that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Because S \u2192 NT18 NT42. NT18 is NT23 NT57. So the string would have to start with t23 (from NT23) and then the next would be something from NT57, which is t31. But in the string, the third token is t33, not t31. So this suggests that perhaps this path isn't correct, or maybe I'm making a mistake in the derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT18 can produce something else. Let me check. The production for NT18 is only NT23 NT57. So no, it only goes to those two non-terminals. So that's fixed.\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which becomes NT23 NT57 NT42. Now, the next step is to have NT23 and then NT57 and then NT42. So the first symbol is t23, the second could be something from NT57. NT57 \u2192 t31, which would make the second symbol t31, not t33. But in our string, the second symbol is t33, which is different.\n\nSo maybe this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way for other non-terminals to contribute to this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that NT42 appears again after NT18. Let me see.\n\nWait, after S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which becomes NT23 NT57 NT42. So we have to expand these non-terminals. The first part is NT23 \u2192 t23, the second part is NT57 \u2192 t31, and then the third is NT42 \u2192 ... ?\n\nLooking at NT42, what does it produce? Let's check the productions:\n\nNT42 has several productions. One of them is NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38. Another is NT42 \u2192 t27. So NT42 can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, in the initial expansion, S is NT18 NT42. So after expanding NT18, we have NT23 NT57 NT42. Then, perhaps we can further expand NT57 and NT42.\n\nSo NT57 can produce t31, and NT42 can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nIf NT42 produces t27, then after that, the string would have t23, t31, t27. But our string is t23, t33, t31, t28, t51. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, if NT42 produces NT2 and NT38, then the next step would involve expanding NT2 and NT38.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string is t23, t33, t31, t28, t51. So perhaps the initial expansion isn't the only path. Maybe other non-terminals are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider a different approach, like parsing the string step by step and seeing if each terminal can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLet's consider the entire string: t23 t33 t31 t28 t51.\n\nI need to see if there's a way to reduce this string to the start symbol S, using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the right-hand side of S is NT18 NT42. So the first step is that S generates NT18 NT42. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to generate parts of the string.\n\nSo the string t23 t33 t31 t28 t51 is generated by NT18 NT42, so in the parse tree, the root is S with two children: NT18 and NT42.\n\nNow, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so that would produce the first terminal t23 and then something. So the first token is t23, which matches, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the next terminal is t33. But after t23, from NT23 we get t23, and then what comes from NT57.\n\nWait, NT57's production is NT57 \u2192 t31. So from NT57, we get t31.\n\nSo the second token would be t31, but the actual input is t33. So that's a problem. That suggests that either this path isn't correct, or there's another way to derive this string.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing other productions. Let me check NT18's production again. NT18 only has one production, which is to NT23 NT57. So no, that's the only option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the productions:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nSo NT18 can only expand to NT23 and NT57. There's no other path.\n\nSo after S expands, we have NT18 (which is NT23 NT57) and NT42. So the next expansion would involve NT23 and NT57.\n\nSo the first two symbols are t23 (from NT23) and t31 (from NT57), but the string has t23, t33, so that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the order. Because in CFGs, the leftmost derivation is typically used, but sometimes you can have different orders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the expansion, the NT42 can be expanded first. Let's think about that.\n\nWait, initially, S is NT18 NT42.

{"custom_id":"request-73","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t49 t33 t31 t11 t43 t11` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it appears to follow CNF since all rules are either producing two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe task is to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules to see if it can derive the given string. This is similar to a top-down parsing approach, like using a reduction or checking if the string can be built step by step.\n\nLet me start by identifying the structure of the string. The string has six symbols: t49, t33, t31, t11, t43, t11. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe start symbol of the grammar is S. The first rule for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S generates two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42. Hence, the start string after S is NT18 NT42. The first step in generating the string would be to expand S into these two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t49, which is a terminal. This suggests that either NT18 or NT42 must start with t49. Let me check the productions for NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18, the production is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 can't produce t49 directly. Similarly, NT42 has multiple productions, one of which is NT42 \u2192 't43'. Other productions for NT42 include 't27', 't54', etc., but the 't43' is directly a terminal.\n\nWait, but NT42 is part of the start's second component. So the start is NT18 (which expands to NT23 NT57) and NT42. Let me see what NT42 can produce. One of the productions for NT42 is 't27', but the string starts with t49, so that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each component can be expanded further. Let me think about the entire sequence.\n\nStarting from S, the symbol is NT18 NT42.\n\nLet me expand each non-terminal step by step, trying to match the string.\n\nThe string is t49 t33 t31 t11 t43 t11. Let's list them in order: [t49, t33, t31, t11, t43, t11].\n\nLet's start by trying to expand S into NT18 NT42. After S, the two symbols are NT18 and NT42. Now, the first symbol in the string is t49.\n\nLooking at NT18, it can be expanded into NT23 NT57. So NT18 can't produce t49 directly. Therefore, perhaps we need to keep expanding NT18 until we can derive a terminal.\n\nBut wait, if NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT23 has a production \u2192 t49. Let me check: yes, NT23 \u2192 't49'. So, the first part of NT18 can be expanded as NT23, which is t49. So NT18 becomes t49 followed by NT57.\n\nSo now, the expansion of S becomes t49 NT57 NT42. Now, the string starts with t49, which matches the first token. So we can consume t49, now we have to check if the next symbols match the remaining NT57 NT42.\n\nThe next symbol is t33. Let me look at NT57. The production for NT57 is 't31' as per the given rules: NT57 \u2192 't31'.\n\nWait, no, looking back, I see NT57 is another non-terminal. Let me check: The production for NT57 is 't31'. So NT57 \u2192 't31'.\n\nSo expanding NT57 gives t31, so now after processing t49 and NT57 (which becomes t31), the string is now t33, t11, t43, t11.\n\nNow, the next part after NT57 in the expansion is NT42. So we have NT42 after NT57, making the expanded part after S as t49 t31 NT42. But in the string, after t49 comes t33, not t31. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding. Let me try again.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49'.\n\nSo, the first part becomes t49 and then NT57.\n\nNT57 \u2192 't31'. So after NT18, we have t49 t31.\n\nBut the string after t49 is t33, not t31. So this path may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to continue expanding NT18 beyond NT23 and NT57.\n\nWait, NT23 \u2192 't49', but what about NT57? NT57's production is 't31', so it only generates a terminal. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, for NT57, the production is 't31', right? So NT57 can't be split further; it's just t31. So after t49, the next must be t31, but in the string it's t33. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the first expansion path might not be correct. Maybe I should consider a different approach, perhaps trying to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into two parts that correspond to the two non-terminals after S. Let me try to see if the string can be split such that the first part corresponds to NT18's expansion and the second to NT42's.\n\nLooking at the string: t49 t33 t31 t11 t43 t11.\n\nIf S expands to NT18 NT42, and then both are expanded into terminals, we can split the string into the first part matching NT18's expansion and the second part matching NT42's expansion.\n\nLet me check if the string can be divided into two parts that each match the possible expansions of NT18 and NT42.\n\nThe string has six tokens, so possible splits are:\n\n- 1st part of length 1, 2nd of length 5: t49 vs NT18; but NT18 after expansion produces something that starts with t49, but as we saw earlier, it leads to t31 next, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's consider that after S, the first non-terminal is NT18 and the second is NT42. So after S, it's NT18 and NT42, each generating some sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the entire string is a combination of what NT18 generates and what NT42 generates.\n\nLooking at NT18's expansion:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 't49' followed by NT57, which is 't31'. So NT18 generates t49 t31. But in the string, the next token after t49 is t33, not t31. So this suggests that perhaps starting with NT18 may not be correct. Maybe the string comes from expanding NT18 into something else.\n\nWait, perhaps NT18 can generate more than two levels. Let me see if I can expand further.\n\nWait, after NT23 \u2192 't49', and NT57 \u2192 't31', but maybe NT23 can be expanded again. No, NT23's only production is 't49', so it can't be expanded. So NT18 \u2192 t49 t31.\n\nBut the string starts with t49, then t33, which doesn't match. So this path is invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps S isn't the root here, or maybe I'm considering the string in the wrong order. Wait, the grammar is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first part is NT18 and the second is NT42. The string starts with NT18's expansion, so that's t49 t31, but the string's second token is t33. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me check all the possible expansions again.\n\nWait, maybe S doesn't directly expand into NT18 NT42, but perhaps I've misread the grammar.

Looking at the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't43', NT26 -> 't23', etc. Wait, let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43' (so t10 is produced by NT10)\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT43 -> 't38'\n- NT53 -> 't38'\n- NT38 -> 't51'\n- NT51 -> 't7'\n- NT23 -> 't11'\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n- Others seem more complex.\n\nBut let's focus on generating the string step by step. The first terminal is t10. From the grammar, t10 comes from NT10. So, to get t10, we need to expand NT10 to 't43'.\n\nNext, the second terminal is t43. Let's look at how t43 is generated. It appears in NT43 and NT42. The production NT38 -> 't51' is terminal, but t43 is not directly terminal. Wait, maybe via NT43's production.\n\nLooking back, NT43's production is 't38' (from NT43->'t38'?), wait no. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT43 can be 't38'? Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT43 -> 't38' is indeed a production, so t43 is 't38', which is terminal. So NT43 can produce 't38'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is t43, which would correspond to NT43->t43? Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the symbols. Each symbol in the string is a terminal, like t10, t43, etc. Each of these must correspond to the terminal symbols produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each non-terminal, the production could be to a terminal or a combination of non-terminals. So, each time we expand a non-terminal, it may result in one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nSo, S splits into NT18 and NT42. Now, we need to expand both of these.\n\nNT18 expands to NT23 NT57.\n\nThen, NT23 could expand further, or it might have a terminal. Looking at the productions, NT23 -> 't26', so that's terminal, so we take 't26'. Then NT57 -> 't31' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but wait, let me try to model the parsing process.\n\nI think it's better to consider that to get the string, we need the sequence of symbols to match the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should simulate the parsing process.\n\nThe string is t10 t43 t48 t54 t53 t51.\n\nIn terms of derivation, S must start with NT18 NT42, which expand into terminals and non-terminals. Each step, the leftmost non-terminal is expanded.\n\nBut since it's a context-free grammar, we can have different ways of expanding, so maybe we can track the stack or use something like the CYK algorithm, but since it's a small string, I can try to manually check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build the derivation sequence step by step.\n\nLet me attempt to map each symbol.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t10: This must come from NT10 -> 't43'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT10 -> 't43'? No, that's not right. Looking at the grammar, NT10 -> 't43' is correct. So t10 is 't43'? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, no:\n\nWait, NT10's production is 't43'. So, when we expand NT10, we get 't43'. But t43 is a terminal in the string. So the first symbol in the string is t10, which can't be NT10's production, because NT10 would produce 't43', not t10.\n\nWait, hold on. There's a mistake here. Let me re-express the grammar's productions to make sure I understand:\n\nThe grammar is given with each production as:\n\nFor example:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\n... and so on, with some non-terminals producing terminals, like:\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\n\nSimilarly, others produce terminals like 't10', 't43', 't48', etc.\n\nWait, so each non-terminal either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't10'. So, we need to find a production that produces t10 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43' is a production, but that gives 't43', not 't10'. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again. Oh wait, maybe I got the rule wrong.\n\nWait, the grammar as given includes:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT53 -> NT42 NT38\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT43 -> 't38'\n- NT45 -> 't10' (Wait, is this production present? Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking for where 't10' is produced. I see in the grammar:\n\n- NT45 -> 't10'\n\nYes, there's a production NT45 -> 't10', which is a terminal. So 't10' comes from NT45.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, S expands to NT18 and NT42. So, to get 't10', which is the first symbol, we need to derive 't10' from one of the non-terminals in the expansion.\n\nBut since in the first step, S is split into NT18 and NT42, neither of which directly produce a terminal. So perhaps it's impossible because the first symbol is t10, but the initial expansion doesn't have any terminals. Therefore, the string cannot start with t10 unless it's derived later through some other path.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the grammar might have left-recursive rules or something else, but all the rules seem to be non-terminals followed by non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, for example, NT45 -> 't10' is a production. So 't10' is directly produced by NT45. So if in some expansion, NT45 is present, it can produce 't10'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is 't10', which must come from NT45.\n\nSo, looking back, the initial step is S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nWe need to expand NT18 and NT42 in a way that eventually produces a 't10"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production doesn't have \u03b5 on the RHS.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is \"t10 t43 t36 t28 t12 t12 t12\". I notice it's a series of terminals, so each terminal should correspond to a production in the grammar. The task is to derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production from S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S can generate t10 and t42. The first character is t10, which matches NT18.\n\nNow, let's look at NT18. From the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, the second part after t10 should be NT23 NT57. The next parts are t43, t36, t28, t12, etc. Wait, after t10, the next is t43. Let me see if NT23 can produce t43.\n\nLooking at NT23, the production is NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So, after t10, we should have nt26 followed by t54. But in the string, after t10, it's t43. That doesn't match. It seems like there's a problem here.\n\nLet me double-check. The string is t10 followed by t43. But according to the grammar, after t10 (NT18), it's NT23 followed by NT57, which would expand to NT26 and NT54. NT26 is then t23, I think, because NT26's production is NT26 \u2192 t23. Similarly, NT54 is t33? Wait, no, NT54 \u2192 t33. Wait, no, looking back, NT54 \u2192 t33? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar shows NT54 \u2192 t33. So, if NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, then NT26 would produce t23, and NT54 would produce t33. But in the string, after t10, we have t43, which is part of the string. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to parse the string. Let's think differently. The string is t10 t43 t36 t28 t12 t12 t12. So after t10, the next should be t43. Let's see if there's a production that can generate t43.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can directly produce t43. Checking the grammar, I see NT43 \u2192 NT38. But that's just a non-terminal, not a terminal. So, NT43 must expand further. Let's see, NT43 \u2192 t38? No, wait, looking at the productions, NT43 only appears in one place: NT43 \u2192 t47. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT43 is used as a RHS in other productions, like S \u2192 NT42, but not directly as a terminal. Let me list all the NT productions to see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT13 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT57 \u2192 't31'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT36 \u2192 't36'\n- NT43 \u2192 't47'\n- NT42 \u2192 't54'\n- NT47 \u2192 't21'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT13 \u2192 't11'\n\nWait, looking at this, some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT18 \u2192 't10', so NT18 produces t10. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't43' (from NT27 \u2192 't27' and other expansions?), no, wait. Let's list all the non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT36 \u2192 't36'? Wait, no, NT36 is a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking at the productions, NT36's productions are to other non-terminals, so it's a non-terminal. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 't47', NT42 \u2192 't27' and others.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The only non-terminals that directly produce terminals are those where the RHS is a terminal. Looking again, I don't see any; all RHS are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, for example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42: that's two non-terminals. But in other places, like NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57: two non-terminals. But some non-terminals have productions that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, I think I need to check the entire RHS.

Let me re-examine NT42's productions.\n\nWait, the grammar's NT42 includes:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT42 -> NT22 NT27\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT42\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nWait, wait, looking more clearly:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT42's productions are:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT42 -> NT22 NT27\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT42\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nWait, actually, it's better to list all NT42's productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\n- NT42 -> NT22 NT27\n\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT41\n\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT42\n\nWait, no, I'm seeing:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT42: S->NT18 NT42\n\nNT5->NT23 NT47\n\nNT22->NT36 NT53\n\nNT41->NT51 NT45\n\nNT42->NT2 NT38\n\nNT2->NT10 NT22\n\nNT4->NT8 NT10\n\nNT18->NT23 NT57\n\nNT27->NT42 NT43\n\nNT9->NT40 NT28\n\nNT58->NT42 NT41\n\nNT42->NT4 NT13\n\nNT22->NT2 NT9\n\nNT28->NT4 NT40\n\nNT8->NT54 NT49\n\nNT23->NT26 NT54\n\nNT8->NT47 NT4\n\nNT36->NT27 NT58\n\nNT28->NT43 NT5\n\nNT53->NT42 NT38\n\nNT9->'t35'\n\nNT2->'t28'\n\nNT42->'t27'\n\nSo, yes, NT42 has a production to 't27' and also to NT4 NT13.\n\nSo, for the string's first element t23, which is generated by NT18 -> NT23 NT57, then each of these NT23 and NT57 must expand into t23 and t57 respectively.\n\nNT23's production is NT26 NT54. So, to generate t23, NT23 must be a terminal. But looking at the grammar, NT23's right-hand side is NT26 NT54, both are non-terminals. So, to produce t23, there's no direct production because NT23 doesn't produce a terminal. That seems like an issue because the string starts with t23.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar for NT23.\n\nIn the grammar: NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nSo, NT23 cannot produce t23 directly. Instead, it must expand further. So, how does t23 come into the string?\n\nWait, maybe the chain is different. Let's see:\n\nIf the string is t23 t33 t31 t43 t28 t35 t53.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, NT18 must produce t23 and NT57 produces t57? But NT23 can't produce t23 because its production is NT26 NT54. So, that would mean that t23 must come from NT26 NT54, but that's a non-terminal.

The string is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t48 t27 t12 t53`. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The start symbol is S, and I remember that in CNF, S can have at most two non-terminals. Let me check the rules for S: yes, S -> NT18 NT42, which fits the CNF.\n\nNow, to see if the string is in the language, I probably need to parse it through the grammar. The string has eight tokens, so each production step would have to expand into pairs, but since the process is step-by-step, I'll need to track how the non-terminals expand to terminals.\n\nLet me note that the grammar has some production rules that directly go to terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't28', so if a NT2 appears in a derivation, it becomes t28. Similarly, NT5 becomes 't40', etc.\n\nLooking at the string: t23, t33, t31, t43, t48, t27, t12, t53.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated step by step. Maybe I can reconstruct the derivation that leads to this string.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT18 NT42. So the string would start with the first symbol from NT18 and then the first symbol from NT42.\n\nBut wait, NT18 has a rule: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So the first symbol t23 must come from NT23. Let's check if NT23 is a terminal: looking at the rules, NT23 -> NT26 NT54. Hmm, so NT23 isn't a terminal. So that means the initial split might not be S directly expanding. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string as the result of a top-down parse. Let's see if each part of the string can be derived from non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is eight tokens, so each step must split into two, reducing the number of symbols by one each time until we get to the start symbol. Let me think in terms of a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see what the grammar produces. Let me look at the grammar's NT rules and their terminals.\n\nLet me try to track possible combinations that could produce the given string.\n\nFirst, NT18 -> NT23 NT57, which is 't23' and NT57 -> 't31'. So t23 followed by t31 would come from NT18.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has two rules: one is NT2 and another is 't27'. But in the string, after t31, we have t43, which suggests that the next part comes from NT43.\n\nLooking at NT43's rules: NT43 -> NT45 NT47 (which aren\u2019t terminals), or wait, wait. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar rules:\n\nNT43 is defined as NT45 NT47. Wait, but in the given rules, I see several NT43 production rules. Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me list out the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\nNT43 -> NT47 NT4\nNT42 could be t27, and NT43 could be t45 or something else. Wait, actually, the specific rules:\n\nNT43: look at the given rules, NT43 is present as:\n\nWait, in the given data, here's NT43: no, actually, I need to check each rule line.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nLine 14: NT27-> NT42 NT43\n\nLine 15: NT43-> NT47 NT4\n\nSo yes, NT43 can produce NT47 NT4. But wait, NT47 and NT4 are non-terminals. So NT43 isn't directly a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because in the string, we have t43, so it must come from a terminal, but if the rule for NT43 goes to other non-terminals, that might not work.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm confused. Wait, the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces 't43' directly. Looking through the rules, NT43 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, the given rules don't have a production that directly outputs 't43', so that's a problem because the string has t43 as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other terminals in the string:\n\nt23 is in NT23's rules: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. So NT23 isn't a terminal.\n\nt33 is in NT33? Wait, no, in the rules, do any non-terminals produce t33?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for any non-terminal that ends with t33. Hmm, that's another problem because t33 would have to come from a non-terminal, but if none of them produce t33, it's impossible.\n\nSimilarly, let's look for other terminals:\n\nt31: looking at the rules, none show a production for t31 directly.\n\nt43: as above, no production.\n\nt27: yes, NT27 can produce t27 via NT27-> NT42 NT43, but wait, NT42 can also be 't27' in another rule. Wait no: the rule for NT27 is NT27-> NT42 NT43. So NT27 would split into two non-terminals. But in the string, we have t27 appearing as a terminal directly, meaning that it must come from somewhere. Wait, no, in the string, t27 is present, so it must come directly from a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused again. Let me make a list of all the terminals in the string and check which rules produce them.\n\nString: t23, t33, t31, t43, t48, t27, t12, t53.\n\nTerminals present: t23, t33, t31, t43, t48, t27, t12, t53.\n\nNow, for each of these, I'll check if any rule in the grammar ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57: no terminal here.\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53: no terminal, but it does have NT53, which could be 't53' later.\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45: no.\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38 and also 't2', 't38' as in other rules. Wait, let me check: \n\nWait, looking through the list, for example:\n\nDoes any rule for NTx produce 't2'?

Looking through the 50 rules, I don't see such a rule for t43.\n\nt48: I see NT23-> NT26 NT54, so NT54 might be something that leads to t48, but no, looking in rules: NT28 -> NT4 NT40; NT40 is 't6' or something.\n\nWait, perhaps t48 comes from NT23's NT26 NT54.

{"custom_id":"request-132","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t48 t28 t53 t53 t51`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF has productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except maybe the start symbol, which can go to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of productions. The start symbol is S, which initially becomes NT18 NT42. Each of these Nterms can further split into other Nterms until they reach terminals, which are the 't' strings.\n\nI think I should approach this by trying to expand starting from S and seeing if I can reach the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should produce two symbols at a time. The input string has 9 tokens, which is odd. Wait, does CNF allow the production sequence to change the number of symbols by 2 each step? So starting from S, which becomes two symbols, each step producing two would make the length grow by one each time?\n\nWait, no. Each production in CNF is two non-terminals. So the initial expansion would produce two symbols. Then each of those can expand into two more, so each step from a single symbol to two, then each of those would cause the count to double. But the given string has 9 symbols, which is an odd number. Let me count: t23 t33 t31 t43 t48 t28 t53 t53 t51 \u2192 that's 9 tokens.\n\nHmm, starting from S: it's two symbols, NT18 and NT42. Each of those would produce two, so after the first step, we have four. Then the next step would make eight, but the string is nine, which suggests it might not fit. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string backwards, using the grammar to see if it can derive to S. Because sometimes reconstructing the parse tree from the string is easier.\n\nSo the string is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t48 t28 t53 t53 t51.\n\nLet me list the symbols in order: [t23, t33, t31, t43, t48, t28, t53, t53, t51].\n\nSince we're working backward, the top-level non-terminal would be S, which is NT18 NT42. So the string starts with t23, which must come from NT18. Let's see the production for NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo the first part, t23, comes from NT23, and the next term must be NT57's expansion. But in the string, the next symbol is t33, which should be the second part from NT18's expansion. But wait, in the production, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so the next symbol should be t57.\n\nLooking at the string: after t23 comes t33, which is not t57. So maybe this approach doesn't work. Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the first part comes from NT18.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is NT18 NT42, but maybe each of those can be explored separately. So I need to see which parts of the string can come from which Nterms.\n\nLet me try to see the possible expansions:\n\nThe string is t23 ... So possible that t23 is from NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so t23 is the first part, and the next part should be from NT57's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT57: In the grammar, I see NT57 \u2192 't57'. So NT57 is a terminal, so its expansion is just t57.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string would need to be t23 followed by t57, but in the given string, after t23 is t33. Therefore, this path is invalid. So the first part cannot be NT18.\n\nWait, but there are multiple possible expansions, so maybe the first part of the string comes from NT42. Let's see: NT42 can expand into NT27 or NT2. For example, in the grammar: NT42 \u2192 NT27 NT43, or NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, or NT42 \u2192 't27', etc.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t23. Looking back at the grammar, I don't see a production where NT23 expands directly into a terminal, except perhaps through longer expansions. Wait, in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 can't produce a terminal directly. Similarly, NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38, but NT38 \u2192 t53. Wait, no, NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38, and NT38 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting somewhere. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down starting from the middle.\n\nAnother approach is to list all the possible ways the string could be broken into Nterm productions. Alternatively, maybe I can look for which Nterms generate each part.\n\nLet me list the Nterms and their terminal expansions:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 t53 (because NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38, and NT38 \u2192 t53, but NT42 also has productions. Wait, let me check: NT53: rule is NT42 NT38. So to reach t53, we'd need NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38, and then each of those would have to be terminals. But NT42 is a non-terminal, so how does it reach a terminal? Wait, no, NT53 can only produce two non-terminals, so it can't produce a terminal directly. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the rule for NT53: NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. So it doesn't produce a terminal; it requires both NT42 and NT38 to produce terminals. So for NT53 to produce a terminal, both NT42 and NT38 must produce terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT38 \u2192 t53. So the production for NT38 is just t53, a terminal. Therefore, if NT38 appears in a production, it directly produces t53.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, but NT26 \u2192 t49, and NT54 \u2192 t33. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let's check the rules again to find which Nterms expand to a single terminal:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40: which would produce symbols, not terminals.\n- NT26 \u2192 t49: so NT26 is a terminal.\n- NT49 \u2192 t45: so NT49 is a terminal.\n- NT54 \u2192 t33: terminal.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43: which expand further.\n- NT43 \u2192 t38.\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58: which expand.\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41: which expand.\n- NT42 \u2192 't27': Wait, no, looking back at the rules, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, I see that some Nterms expand to 't' followed by a number. So for example, NT42 \u2192 't27' is one of the productions. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 't57', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's list all Nterms and see which ones expand to a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't27' (production exists)\n- NT43 \u2192 't57' (exists)\n- NT47 \u2192 't21' (exists)\n- NT53 \u2192 't53'??? Wait, no: looking back, I see NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. So it depends on both NT42 and NT38. But NT42 can produce 't27' or other non-terminals, and NT38 can produce 't53'. So NT53 would produce t27 followed by t53 via NT42 \u2192 't27' and NT38 \u2192 't53'. So NT53 can produce 't27t53'.\n\nWait, but I'm probably overcomplicating.\n\nLet me go back to the string: [t23, t33, t31, t43, t48, t28, t53, t53, t51].\n\nI need to find a way that each part of the string is generated by the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t23.

The string is \"t10 t43 t22 t28 t53 t7 t10 t54 t53 t51\". \n\nFirst, I need to remember how Chomsky normal form works. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar has all these structures.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since S starts as NT18 NT42, the string has to be formed from these two parts.\n\nLooking at the string: t10 t43 t22 t28 t53 t7 t10 t54 t53 t51. It's a sequence of terminals. Each non-terminal in the grammar can expand into a sequence of terminals and\/or non-terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from left to right, matching each part with the possible non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42. So, the string should be split into two parts, each starting with NT18 and NT42.

So, does NT18 derive to t10? Let's look at the rules for NT18.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Wait, that's not helpful because it's non-terminals. Let me check all rules for NT18. Oh, I see, NT18 has a rule: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Wait, but in the given list, I think NT18 has two options: one is NT23 NT57, but then I see elsewhere that NT18 -> 't10'.

Actually, I need to consider all possible splits where Part1 and Part2 are generated by NT18 and NT42 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem, trying to match the string by successively applying the grammar rules.\n\nLet me consider NT18 first. NT18 can be either NT23 NT57 or 't10'. In the string, the first token is t10, so NT18 must derive to 't10'. So that's matched: t10.\n\nThen, the rest of NT18's expansion would require that after t10, we have NT23 NT57, but since NT18 can only produce 't10', the NT23 NT57 rule isn't used here because it's a direct production.\n\nSo, after NT18 -> t10, the next token is t43. That should come from NT42, right? Wait, no. Because S is NT18 followed by NT42, so the entire string must be generated by NT18 expanding into t10 and then NT42 expanding into the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S is NT18 followed by NT42. So, the entire string is [NT18 derivation] followed by [NT42 derivation]. So, the string must be split into two parts at some point, but the split must be such that the first part is NT18's derivation and the second is NT42's.\n\nSo, the string is a concatenation of the two parts. Let me check the grammar for NT42. Looking at the grammar, NT42 has multiple rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT43 (but that's only if certain conditions are met, but more likely, we have terminal rules)\n- Wait, in the given grammar, NT42 has these rules:\n  - NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n  - NT42 -> NT42 NT43\n  - NT42 -> NT22 NT28\n  - NT42 -> NT8 NT10\n  - NT22 -> NT2 NT9\n  etc.\nWait, but in the given list, the NT42 rules include NT42 -> NT42 NT43, which is left-recursive. So, perhaps we have to handle that, but maybe it's easier to think about the direct terminals.\n\nLooking at NT42, do any of its rules directly produce a terminal?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT8 -> 't11'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n- NT7 -> 't7' (wait, is there a rule for NT7? Looking through, I don't see any. Maybe that's an error, or perhaps it's part of another non-terminal)\nBut wait, in the string, there are t7, t10, etc. So I need to see how these are generated.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal is expanded until it becomes terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S->NT18 NT42. NT18 can be t10. So the string starts with t10, which matches the first token.\n\nThen, the next part must be NT42's derivation. So the remaining string is t43 t22 t28 t53 t7 t10 t54 t53 t51.\n\nSo, we need to see if NT42 can derive this string.\n\nBut NT42 can have multiple productions. Let me see its rules again.\n\nLooking at NT42's rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT42 -> NT22 NT28\n- NT42 -> NT8 NT10\n\nOther rules that might be relevant?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT42 also has a rule: NT42-> NT42 NT43. That's left-recursive, which can cause issues, but perhaps we can handle that by eliminating left recursion, but maybe it's easier to just focus on the direct productions.\n\nAnother direct production is:\n\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n\nWait, that's helpful. So one of NT42's rules directly produces 't27'. So let's see if in the string, t27 appears as a terminal. In the string, after t10 (from NT18), we have t43, t22, t28, etc. Hmm, I don't see t27. Alternatively, perhaps the production is NT42 -> 't42', but I don't see that. Wait, looking back, maybe I missed a terminal for NT42.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only direct terminal I see is 't27' for NT42, but in the string, the next tokens after t10 are t43. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. The string starts with t10 t43 t22 t28 t53 t7 etc. So, if the first part is t10 from NT18, then the rest should be generated by NT42. But the second token is t43. So NT42 needs to produce t43 at some point.\n\nBut looking at the rules for NT42, none directly produce t43.\n\nWait, perhaps in the rule NT42-> NT4 NT13, and those can derive to terminals or other non-terminals. So, let's see.\n\nLet's think of NT42 as generating t43 somewhere. So perhaps we need to see a chain where NT42 expands into something that produces t43.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT42, maybe NT42 can produce NT4 and NT13. So, let's look at NT4 and NT13.\n\nFor NT4, the rule is NT4-> 't9'. So NT4 can produce t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For example, NT43 has two different production rules: one as NT42 and NT38, and another as NT57. Also, the start symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which leads to terminals. Let me try to parse the given string step by step.\n\nThe string is t10 t43 t43 t36 t27 t53 t6 t9 t6 t51. Let's count the tokens: 10 elements. So, the structure should be a sequence of non-terminals that expand into these terminals.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which has two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. So the string should be an interleaving of the strings generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt10 is the first token. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t10.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' (so it directly produces t10)\n- NT4 \u2192 't9' (no)\n- NT29? Wait, no, T10 is 't10', so NT18 can produce t10.\n\nSo the first part is generated by NT18 \u2192 t10.\n\nNext token is t43. So after t10 comes t43. So NT18 produces t10, and then NT42 must produce the remaining part. Wait, S is NT18 NT42. So NT18 produces the first terminal, then NT42 produces the rest.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So NT18 produces t10, then NT42 must produce the rest: t43 t43 t36 t27 t53 t6 t9 t6 t51.\n\nBut let's check: t10 is generated by NT18. Then, NT42 should generate the remaining part. So let's see if NT42 can produce t43 t43 t36 t27 t53 t6 t9 t6 t51.\n\nWait, but NT42 has two production rules: one is NT2 NT38, and another is NT4 NT13. Let's check which one applies.\n\nLooking at NT42's rules:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\nAh, so it can branch into either path. So we need to see if either of these paths can generate the required sequence.\n\nLet's try NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38.\n\nSo first, NT2, which can produce t28 or more non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT2's production: NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22.\n\nSo NT2 \u2192 NT10 and NT22.\n\nNT10 produces t43. So t43 is the first token after t10, which matches. Now, we have to expand NT10 and NT22.\n\nWait, NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22. So the expansion is t43 (from NT10) followed by NT22.\n\nNT22 has the production NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53.\n\nSo NT22 becomes NT36 and NT53.

Hmm, the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a convenient form for parsing, but I'm not actually doing parsing here, just checking if the string is in the language.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which immediately goes to NT18 NT42. So the string we're examining should start by deriving from NT18 and NT42. Let's reconstruct how this could work.\n\nThe string starts with \"t49 t33 t31...\" Let me see the productions for the N terminals in the grammar. Looking at the rules, NT49 is \"t45\", but wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, in the list, I see NT8 -> NT54 NT49, which is 't33' and 't45' maybe? Let me check NT49. Oh, I see NT8 -> NT47 NT4, but that's not NT49. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's list the N terminals by their index.\n\nLooking through the N terminals:\n\n- NT49: looking for an NT that produces 't49'. Scanning through, I see NT26 is 't49', since NT26 -> 't49'. So in the rules, NT26 is defined as 't49'.\n\nSimilarly:\n- NT33: Looking for an NT that leads to 't33', which is NT54, because NT54 -> 't33'.\n- NT31: Looking for NT that produces 't31'. Let's see, NT57 -> 't31'.\n- NT43: NT43 can be 't57', but wait, in the rules, I see NT43 is being rewritten in some cases. Let's look, actually, NT43 is defined as NT47 NT45. Or wait, looking through the productions:\n\nWait, let's make this systematic.\n\nEach N terminal is an NT (non-terminal) that can produce other NTs or 't's.\n\nSo to process the string, I need to break it down into its components and see if each can be derived from an NT.\n\nThe string is: t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t54 t53 t6 t50 t12.\n\nLet me parse this string token by token, but perhaps from the end. It might be easier to build from the start, but sometimes it's helpful to know the structure.\n\nSince S -> NT18 NT42, the string should start with NT18. Let's check what NT18 can produce. NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Both of these are Ns.\n\nLooking at NT18's right-hand side, NT23 and NT57. So the first part of the string should start with NT23 and NT57.\n\nWait, no, the entire string is derived from S, which splits into NT18 and NT42. So the first token of NT18 would be from its left, but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is broken into components through leftmost or rightmost derivations. Maybe I should try to see if the string can be broken down step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet's try to see the entire string as a concatenation of Ns and Ts. So the first token is t49. Let's see which NT could produce t49.\n\nLooking at the N productions, I see NT26 -> t49. So NT26 can produce 't49'.\n\nSo t49 comes from NT26. Now, in the grammar, NT26 is defined as NT27 NT54. Because looking at the productions:\n\nNT26 -> NT27 NT54.\n\nSo, for NT26, it requires two sub-productions: NT27 and NT54.\n\nNow, NT27: in the rules, NT27 is defined as NT42 NT43. So each step down from NT27 requires NT42 and NT43.\n\nSo, in the string, after t49 comes NT26, which is 't49', then the next token is 't33', which should come from NT54.\n\nLooking at NT54: in the productions, NT54 -> NT45 NT4. So NT54 has two parts: NT45 and NT4.\n\nWait, but in the string after 't49' is 't33', which would require NT54, right? Because NT54 produces 't33' because NT54 -> 't33' because looking at the rules, yes: NT54 -> 't33' as per NT54's production.\n\nSo, the breakdown so far is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT23: Let's see, in productions, NT23 is defined as NT26 NT54.\n\nSo from NT23, we get NT26 and NT54.\n\nThen NT26 is 't49' as per the token.\n\nNext, after 't49' comes 't33', which would be NT54.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the current production tree is:\n\nS\n|\nNT18 NT42\n\/   \\\nNT23 NT57 NT42\n\nWait, S splits into NT18 and NT42. Then NT18 splits into NT23 and NT57, and NT42 would split into its components.\n\nBut maybe building the string step by step from the start symbol.\n\nLet me try to split the string into components based on the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t54 t53 t6 t50 t12.\n\nI'll start with S, which is NT18 NT42. So the string has to come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet's break down the string into two parts: one part from NT18 and another from NT42.\n\nBut where to split? It depends on how the productions go.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo the string from NT18's part would be the first two tokens: t49 and t33, perhaps?\n\nWait, but NT23 is NT26 NT54, as per the production.\n\nSo the initial part from NT18 is NT23 and NT57, which would generate more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent the string as a sequence of N terminals and Ts, and then try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet's denote the string as a list:\n\n['t49', 't33', 't31', 't43', 't43', 't54', 't53', 't6', 't50', 't12']\n\nI'll process each token and see if it can be generated by expanding the corresponding NT.\n\nStarting with 't49', the first token is t49, which comes from NT26.\n\nBut NT26 is part of NT23's production. Let me see the flow.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each NT can only produce a single token or a combination.

{"custom_id":"request-171","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Chomsky Normal Form is a specific structure for CFGs where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because it simplifies the analysis, especially when using parsers or certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But I might not need that for this specific case.\n\nThe grammar provided has several production rules, all of which are in CNF. Each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. The string to evaluate is \"t10 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\". \n\nFirst, I think I'll look at the grammar and see which non-terminals can directly produce terminals. From the rules given, some of the productions directly result in terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't28', NT5 \u2192 't40', and so on. Some are two-step productions, like S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which then each go to their respective terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string step by step, trying to find a sequence of productions that can generate each part of the string. Starting from the beginning, the first symbol is 't10'. Looking at the non-terminals, I check which can produce 't10'. For example, NT45 \u2192 't10', and NT36 \u2192 't48' (wait, that's not 't10'). Hmm, maybe NT5? NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, but that's a non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps NT10 is a non-terminal that produces 't43' (no). Wait, in the rules, NT2 has to 't28', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe looking for NTs that produce 't10' directly... like NT40? Wait, no. Wait, let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice NT40 \u2192 't6', which is a terminal. NT9 \u2192 't40', which would produce 't40'. Then NT53 \u2192 't42', which is another non-terminal. Wait, but 't10' is a terminal, so it's directly produced by some NT. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces 't10':\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' (no)\n- NT5 \u2192 't40' (no)\n- NT8 \u2192 can produce 't54' and 't49' in different productions. So no.\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' directly. Yes! So NT18 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo the first symbol 't10' can be produced by NT18. Now, looking at the next symbol, which is 't43'. I need to find a production for NT18 that leads to 't43'. Wait, NT18 \u2192 't10' is already handled, so looking at NT18's other productions... Wait, actually, looking at the rules, NT18 appears in several places, but in this grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 and NT18 \u2192 't10' (so that's where the 't10' comes from). The other production of NT18 is more about other non-terminals, so we've used that.\n\nSo after 't10', the next symbol is 't43'. So now, after 't10', the remaining string is 't43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12'. The next symbol is 't43', so in NT18 (since after 't10', the next symbol comes from the second part of NT18's productions? Wait, no. Wait, NT18 is a non-terminal that produces t10 or some other non-terminals. So after producing t10, the rest comes from the second part of the production rule. So the original rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so after producing NT18, I need to produce NT42, which would then produce t28, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a way to parse the given string as a leftmost derivation. So starting with S, which produces NT18 NT42, then each of those can be expanded further. But perhaps it's easier to represent the string as a series of expansions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for the entire string and see if it can be generated by the given grammar. The string is \"t10 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\".\n\nLet me write down the steps:\n\n1. The first symbol is 't10'. Looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't10' directly. As identified, NT18 \u2192 't10'. So I consume 't10' and now have to handle the rest: \"t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\".\n\nSo now, the remaining part is generated by the second part of the S rule, which is NT42. So after NT18, we have to generate NT42.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first symbol comes from NT18, and the rest comes from NT42 and any further productions. Wait no, S's production is that it's split into NT18 and NT42, so the entire string must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nOh! That's a key insight. Because S \u2192 NT18 NT42, the entire string must be the concatenation of the languages of NT18 and NT42. So, the string starts with a string derived from NT18, followed by a string derived from NT42. So in our case:\n\nThe entire string is:\n\n\"t10 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\".\n\nSo first, it's \"t10\" followed by \"t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\".\n\nThus, NT18 must generate \"t10\", which it does, and then NT42 must generate the remaining part: \"t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\".\n\nWait, no, because NT42's production is used in S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT18's string and NT42's string. So the total string is NT18.derived_string + NT42.derived_string.\n\nBut the given string is t10 followed by t43 t43 ..., so the derived string of NT18 is \"t10\", and the derived string of NT42 is \"t43 t43 ...\".\n\nWait, so first, let's confirm that:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10' can do that via its production NT18 \u2192 't10' (since it's a terminal). So that's one symbol. Then nt18's production is done, and now nt42's derivation must produce the rest.\n\nSo, let's check if \"t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\" can be generated by NT42.\n\nLooking at NT42's productions:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 't28' (no)\nWait, let's list all the NT42's rules:\n\nLooking back, the given rules:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 maybe, but no, NT42 has two types of productions:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT58, and NT42 \u2192 't27' \nWait, let's look at the original list:\n\nLooking through the original grammar: I see NT42 \u2192 NT58 OR \"t27\"\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar, one of the lines is:\n\nNT42 -> 't27' (line 55)\n\nSo NT42 can produce 't27' directly or can produce NT58. So let's take that.\n\nWait, the production rule is: NT42 \u2192 NT58 or NT42 \u2192 't27'\n\nSo for generating \"t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12\" with NT42, let's see:\n\nFirst symbol after 't10' is 't43'. So NT42 needs to produce 't43' as the first step. But NT42's only terminals are 't27' and others via other NTs.

{"custom_id":"request-194","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t10 t43 t43 t22 t54 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t50 t53`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific way a grammar is structured where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This is helpful because it has certain properties that make parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.\n\nThe grammar provided has several non-terminal symbols (NTx) and each rule as either two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals seem to be all the tokens in the string, which are the t followed by numbers. The non-terminals are like NT1, NT2, up to NT58, etc.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a derivation path that turns the start symbol S into this string. The start symbol S is \"S\" and the rule for S is given as S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which means S can produce a sequence of NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nSo my first step is to see if the string can start with NT18 and NT42. Let me parse the string into pairs, since each production might generate two non-terminals followed by terminals. Wait, actually, the grammar rules might build the string in a way where each production step adds pieces together, but the string is a single linear sequence of terminals. So it's more about whether the entire string can be broken down into the right sequence of non-terminals that the grammar can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is to see if each part of the string corresponds to the productions. Let me break the string into parts as per the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t10 t43 t43 t22 t54 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t50 t53.\n\nLooking at each token:\nt10 is in the production of NT53 as per the grammar rules (NT53 -> 't36'), but wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT53's production is 't36', but that can't be because t10 is the token. Wait, maybe I should look at whether any non-terminals can produce t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT8 \u2192 't11' and NT4 \u2192 't9', but where is t10 derived from? I see NT18 \u2192 't10' as per the rule, so that's how t10 can appear. Also, looking at other NT rules, maybe NT10 \u2192 't43', wait no, NT10's production is 't43' from the rule NT10 \u2192 't43', which sounds odd. Hmm, let's see, perhaps I should build a list of where each terminal can appear based on the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list all the production rules for the non-terminals and see where each terminal can come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50' (twice)\n- NT38 \u2192 't51'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27', 't26', etc. Wait, looking at all the NT42 productions: NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, NT42 \u2192 't27', NT42 \u2192 't42'? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT42 has multiple productions. Let me list them all to clarify:\n\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT42 -> NT22 NT38\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT53\n- NT42 -> 't27' (duplicate)\n- NT42 -> 't54'\n- Another NT42 \u2192 't54'?\n\nWait, perhaps the list is more complex. Maybe it's better to approach this step-by-step.\n\nEach non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals or one terminal. The string is a series of terminals: t10, t43, t43, etc., so I need to see if these terminals can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S directly expands into NT18 followed by NT42. So the string starts with NT18 (which can produce t10) and then NT42 (which can produce other things). But the string starts with t10, which is exactly produced by NT18. So that's good.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t10, which is NT18's production. So the S productions start correctly.\n\nNow, next is t43. So after T18 (t10), we have T42. So T42 needs to produce a sequence of terminals that includes t43, but looking at T42's productions, let's see what it can generate.\n\nLooking at NT42, the productions are:\n\n1. NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n2. NT42 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 terminal? No, NT5's production is 't40'.\n3. NT42 \u2192 NT22 NT38 (each non-terminal)\n4. NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41 (so recursive production)\n5. NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT53 (another recursive)\n6. NT42 \u2192 't27'\n7. NT42 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 't28'\n8. NT42 \u2192 NT4 \u2192 't9'\n9. NT42 \u2192 NT53 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, let's clarify each production:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (non-terminals)\n- NT42 \u2192 't27' (terminal)\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT53\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (wait, perhaps that's different?)\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Looking through the grammar, the production rules for NT42:\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT42 -> NT22 NT38\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT53\n\nNT42 -> 't54'\n\nWait, somewhere the grammar has NT42 rules where it's NT42 \u2192 't54'? Let me check:\n\nYes, in the grammar, there's a rule NT42 -> 't54' and another one NT42 -> NT42 NT41, and then again, I think another rule: NT42 -> NT22 NT38. Wait, perhaps I'm getting multiple entries.\n\nBut regardless, important is that NT42 can produce several non-terminals, or 't27', 't54'.\n\nNow, in the string, after t10 (from NT18), the next is t43. So the NT42 needs to produce a sequence that starts with t43, but looking at NT42's productions, none directly produce t43. The terminals it can produce are 't27', 't54' or other non-terminals. So perhaps the next step is that NT42 has to derive a terminal that is t43, which doesn't seem possible from NT42. Alternatively, perhaps the next symbol is part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the NT42 can produce a sequence that includes t43, perhaps via recursion or other intermediates.\n\nLet me think: the string after t10 is t43 t43 t22 t54 t7..., etc. So the next part is t43. So in the NT42's expansion, perhaps there's a way to get a t43 through multiple steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what produces t43?\n\nHmm. The t43 seems to come from NT43, but in the grammar, the rule for NT43 is:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't38'\n\nWait, but that's a terminal. Wait, no: looking back, the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at NT43, the production is:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT43 appears in a rule: NT24? Wait, no.

So, I need to see if starting from S, we can expand step by step to reach this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42 according to the first rule: S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string must be the results of expanding NT18 and NT42.\n\nThe string starts with `t10`, so I need to check if NT18 can produce a string that includes `t10` as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT18's possibilities, from the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nSo, NT18 must expand to NT23 and NT57. Now, NT23 and NT57 are non-terminals, so I need to see what they produce.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nAgain, NT26 and NT54 are non-terminals. Let's expand NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49\n\nHmm, so NT26 becomes NT23 and NT49. Now, expand NT23 and NT49.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 (which I just saw)\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT33 (Wait, checking the rules, NT54 \u2192 't33').\n\nSo, NT26 is expanding into NT23 and NT49, which then needs to be expanded further.\n\nWait, this seems a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should reconstruct the parse tree step by step, checking if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using leftmost derivation to see if the string matches.\n\nThe string is: [t10][t43][t43][t43][t36][t54][t51][t6][t50][t6][t55][t51].\n\nSince the string is quite long, it's easier to think in terms of how the non-terminals can expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nWe have t10 as the first terminal, but according to the rule, NT18 generates NT23 NT57. So, after S, we get NT23, which is NT26 NT54. Then NT26 is NT23 NT49, so it's NT23 and NT49.\n\nNT23 leads to NT26 NT54, which again leads to NT23 and NT49. This seems to loop, but let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck in recursion. Let me see if any NT can directly produce a terminal in the initial steps.\n\nLooking at NT42, the rule S \u2192 NT18 NT42 must produce something. In the string, the second element is t43, which is a terminal. So, perhaps NT42 must directly produce t43 somewhere.\n\nLooking at NT42's production: there's a rule NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. So, NT42 can't directly produce t43. But looking at other NT42 rules, I see NT42 \u2192 't47', so perhaps another way.\n\nWait, no, looking back: the grammar has several rules for NT42. Let me check all rules where NT42 appears as the left-hand side.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nWait, sorry, looking at the rules provided:\n\nThe rules for NT42 are:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT42 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rules are listed as:\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 -> NT27\n\nNT42 -> 't47'\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLine 2: NT42 \u2192 NT27\n\nWait, no, the given grammar lines are:\n\nLine 3: NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nLine 4: NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nLine 5: NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n\nLine 6: NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n\nLine 7: NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nLine 8: NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nLine 9: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nLine 10: NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nLine15: NT42 -> 't43'\n\nWait, I think I might have misread some lines earlier. Let me list all the rules for each NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that the provided rules include several for NT42, including NT42 \u2192 't47' at some point. Let me verify that.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLine 4: NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nLine 6: NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22, which from the initial S leads to NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

The string is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t9 t11 t51 t53`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string should start with whatever NT18 and NT42 generate, each expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 is a terminal, 't23', so that would be the first part. But let's check if the string starts with 't23'. Yes, the string starts with 't23', so that's a match.\n\nNext, NT57 has a production NT57 \u2192 NT42 NT43. Wait, looking at the given grammar, I see NT58 is 't42' and 't41' or something, but wait, the grammar provided has some entries. Actually, in the provided grammar, I see NT57 isn't directly a terminal; wait, on second look, the productions for NT57 might not exist. Wait, let's check the grammar rules carefully.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see NT57 as a terminal or as a production. Instead, checking the rules, I see NT27 is 't22', but I'm confused because in the string, after 't23', it's 't33', not 't22'. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t9 t11 t51 t53`. Let me try to parse this step by step, building the parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must be the concatenation of what NT18 and NT42 generate. Let's break it down:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 should generate 't23' followed by NT57.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT57 isn't a terminal; let me check if any rule leads to a terminal. I see NT38 \u2192 't51', but no NT57 as a terminal. Wait, in the given rules, I see NT57: does it have a production? Or is it a terminal? Looking back: the grammar has NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT43, which is a production to terminals. I don't see NT57 as a terminal, so maybe it's derived from another production. Hmm, but in the string, after 't23', the next is 't33'. That would suggest that NT57 is 't33', but looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT57 \u2192 't33'. So perhaps this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar rules again:\n\n- NT23 is a terminal 't23' (Yes, as per the rules, NT23 \u2192 't23').\n- NT33: isn't there a production for that? Let me check the grammar rules. I don't see NT33 as a non-terminal with any production; instead, the string has 't33', which would only be possible if NT33 is a terminal. But I don't see it as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's a non-terminal. Let me see if any production leads to 't33'. In the rules, I see NT49 \u2192 't33'. So if NT33 is derived from a production that eventually leads to 't33', perhaps through NT49. But in the string, after 't23', it's 't33' directly. So that would mean NT57 \u2192 't33', but in the grammar, there's no such production. So this seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let's think again about S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So after NT23 ('t23'), NT57 must generate the rest of the string starting at 't33'... Wait, but the next part of the string is 't33 t31...'. So from 't23', what does NT57 produce?\n\nSince NT57 isn't a terminal in the grammar (from the given rules, I don't see NT57 as a terminal, but I do see NT45 \u2192 't10', etc.), but that's leading to terminals. It seems NT57 must produce some non-terminal that can derive into terminals. But in the string, after 't23', it's 't33', which would need to be generated by NT57.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the only way to get 't33' is from NT49 \u2192 't33'. So perhaps NT57 \u2192 NT49. But in the grammar, there's no rule that says NT57 \u2192 NT49. So that suggests that NT57 can't produce 't33' directly because it doesn't have that production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to track more steps. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 't23' NT57\n\nNT57: let's look for any production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT57: I don't see it, but perhaps it's derived from a production. Wait, in the rules, I see NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT43, but that's for NT58, not NT57.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, non-terminals are:\n\nS, NT1, NT2,... up to NT58, etc.\n\nBut maybe I should look for any NT that can produce 't33'... which is NT49, but since NT57 isn't that, maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t9 t11 t51 t53`.\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT23 is 't23', and NT57 needs to generate the sequence `t33 t31 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t9 t11 t51 t53`.\n\nSo now we have to parse `t33 t31 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t9 t11 t51 t53` from NT57.\n\nLooking at NT57 in the grammar:\n\nI don't see any production for NT57 leading directly to a terminal. The closest is NT36, NT22, etc., but no NT57.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT57 can be derived into NTs.\n\nLooking through the rules, let's see if any production starts with NT57.\n\nSeems not, because the rules for NT58 are defined as NT42 NT43.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's see if any NT57 is present.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals and their productions again to see if I missed something.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'?\nNo, wait, looking back, the rule for NT5 is: NT5 \u2192 NT40 NT28. Not a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me take it step by step.\n\nAfter NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, the first part is 't23' (NT23 is terminal), so now we need to parse 't33 t31 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t9 t11 t51 t53' using NT57.\n\nNow, looking for a production where the first symbol is a terminal.\n\nIf NT57 is followed by a terminal, but none seem like that. So perhaps NT57 must derive to some sequence of non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string after 't23' is 't33', so NT57 must produce 't33' followed by the rest.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only way to get 't33' is via NT49 \u2192 't49'... No, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT49 \u2192 't33'?

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the specific string we're evaluating. The grammar consists of a series of production rules, each non-terminal symbol on the left side expands into two other non-terminal or terminal symbols. The string to check is \"t10 t43 t27 t47 t43 t28 t35 t12 t7 t10 t27 t53 t53\". \n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S can only produce NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols in the string must match these. The string starts with \"t10 t43\". Let's see if that matches NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT18 is defined as NT23 NT57. And NT42 has two rules: one is NT2 and another is NT18. Wait, NT42 can produce either NT2 or NT18. But in the string, after NT18, we have t43. Let's see:\n\n- NT18 is NT23 NT57, so t23 and t57. But the string after t10 is t43. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should work from the string and see if it can be reduced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol and trying to match the string. But with the string length being 13 tokens, that's going to involve a lot of backtracking. Each step should involve replacing a non-terminal with its right-hand side until we get to terminals.\n\nLet's start with the string: t10 t43 t27 t47 t43 t28 t35 t12 t7 t10 t27 t53 t53\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So the string should start with the expansion of NT18 followed by NT42. \n\nNT18 expands to NT23 NT57. So the first two tokens would need to be t23 and t57, but the string starts with t10 and t43. That doesn't match. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the production of NT18 again. Looking back at the grammar, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So yes, it's NT23 and NT57. So the string must start with t23 and t57. But in the given string, the first token is t10, which isn't t23 or t57. \n\nSo that suggests that either the string isn't generated by this grammar, or I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the string can be generated by another path, but I seem to be stuck because the first symbol doesn't match. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the string starts with a different path because of chain rules. Let's check the start symbol S: it's only NT18 NT42, so the first two symbols must come from NT18 and NT42. \n\nNT18 is NT23 NT57. So the first token must be t23 and the second t57. But the string has t10 and t43. Hmm, unless I'm misapplying the rules. Wait, could there be confusion between NT and the actual symbols? Or maybe I need to consider that NT18 is a non-terminal that can't be directly matched by a token, so perhaps I need to look for other productions or see if the string can derive from a different route.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sentential form and I need to reduce it. Let me try to see if I can reduce the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t27 t47 t43 t28 t35 t12 t7 t10 t27 t53 t53\n\nGiven that S -> NT18 NT42, and NT18 -> NT23 NT57, which are terminals, but in the string, the first two tokens are t10 and t43. So that doesn't match NT23 NT57 because t10 is not t23, and t43 isn't t57 either. Hmm, that seems incompatible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S production has another option, but looking at the grammar, S only has one production: S -> NT18 NT42. So there's no alternative.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that NT42 only has one rule? Let me check: looking back, NT42 has two rules: NT2, or NT18.

{"custom_id":"request-234","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a specific string to evaluate. The goal is to determine whether the provided string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, most of the rules indeed fit this form. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- ... and so on.\n\nHowever, I notice some rules have a single terminal on the right-hand side, like NT2 \u2192 't28' and NT4 \u2192 't9'. So these are the base cases that will eventually generate terminal symbols. The string to evaluate is all terminals, so each production must eventually reduce to these terminals.\n\nThe string provided is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t33 t45 t43 t11 t53 t51.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a tree or use the Pratt parsing method, but given the time constraints, perhaps a better approach is to use the concept of the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for recognizing context-free languages. However, since the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm can be adapted to work more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the problem using the parse table approach or simulate the parsing process step by step.\n\nBut another thought: each production starts with a non-terminal and leads to two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are the leaves. So each step combines the top parts of the grammar and breaks down into smaller components.\n\nLet me take the given string and try to represent it as a parse tree, working my way from the leaves up.\n\nBut perhaps starting from the top-level symbol S and seeing if the string can be derived from it.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which expands to NT18 and NT42. So the string must start with NT18 and NT42, each of which are non-terminals that eventually expand to terminals.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string: t23. Let's see which non-terminal can derive t23.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. And NT26 \u2192 t49, and NT54 \u2192 t33. So the sequence for NT23 would be t49 t33.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after t23 comes t33. However, let's see what comes last. The entire string is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t33 t45 t43 t11 t53 t51.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting me confused. Let me start breaking it down.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the parse process step by step, checking each symbol against the grammar.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t23. Hmm, but t23 is a terminal. So the question is: which non-terminal can produce t23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So to derive t23, that production is NT23 \u2192 t49 t33. Wait, no, because NT26 \u2192 t49, and NT54 \u2192 t33. So t23 is part of NT23, and that leads to t49 and t33. But t23 itself is not a terminal; you can't have a production that goes directly to a terminal in CNF. All productions are either to two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So that's two non-terminals. Then NT26 \u2192 t49 and NT54 \u2192 t33. So the combination would be t49 t33. But in the string, the first symbol is t23, which is a terminal. So that suggests that the production for NT23 might not be the correct path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Are there any rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal? Yes, several: for example, NT2 \u2192 't28', NT4 \u2192 't9', etc. So the production NT2 \u2192 't28' means that NT2 can immediately produce the terminal t28. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, which are both non-terminals that produce their own symbols.\n\nSo the first step is to see if t23 can be the leftmost symbol in the string, which is the case here. So the initial step would involve matching t23 to the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nBut t23 is a terminal, meaning it's the result of some non-terminal production that directly yields it. Looking through the grammar, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal directly produces t23. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules... I don't see a rule for NT producing t23. The only terminals are things like t28, t33, etc. So this suggests that t23 cannot be a terminal since it's not directly produced by any production rule. But in the given string, t23 is the first symbol. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the production order is different. Let's see the first production: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S expands to two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. Then, each of those must expand into a sequence that can eventually produce the entire string.\n\nLooking at the string starting with t23, perhaps it's part of NT18 or NT42.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst token: t23.\n\nIs there any rule that produces t23 directly? It doesn't seem so. Because in the given rules, all the terminals are like t28, t33, etc. So t23 is part of NT23, which is derived from NT26 and NT54. So the production for NT23 would yield something like 't49 t33' as a sequence of symbols.\n\nBut the string starts with t23, which is a single terminal, implying that the parser would have a node producing t23. But since there's no rule that directly gives t23, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot start with t23 because it's not produced by any rule in the grammar. Hence, the entire string is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me verify by checking all rules again.\n\nLooking at all the rules, the only terminals are the ones ending with 't', like t28, t33, t45, etc. So there's no rule where a non-terminal directly goes to t23. Therefore, the first symbol t23 can't be produced by any rule, which would make the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 produces two non-terminals: NT23 and NT57.\n\nThen NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t49, NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo combining these, NT18 \u2192 (t49 t33) followed by NT57? What's NT57?\n\nLooking at NT57: NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28 (from NT57 \u2192 NT42 NT41). Wait, perhaps I should trace back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting point is S, which produces NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo the entire string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo NT18's expansion starts with t23, but based on the productions, that implies the string should contain t23 as an intermediate.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the first symbol is t23, which is not directly produced by any rule, hence the string is invalid. So the answer should be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first step is to see if the string can be built from the bottom up. Let's try that.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: t51. Let's see which non-terminal can generate t51.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT51 appears in NT51 \u2192 't7'.\n\nIs there a rule where a non-terminal directly produces t51? Yes, NT51 \u2192 't7'. So t51 is a terminal.\n\nLet's move to the end of the string: t51 is preceded by t11. So the penultimate token is t11.\n\nLooking for a production that leads into t11 and t51.\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. Wait, not directly related. Wait, let's check each rule that ends with t51.\n\nBut wait, t51 is a terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of a series of production rules, each replacing a non-terminal (NTx) with two other non-terminals or terminal symbols (tX). \n\nFirst, I'll note that since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing because each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, and the total length of the derivation will be logarithmic in relation to the length of the string.\n\nThe string to analyze has 14 symbols, all of which are terminals, except for the non-terminals but given the rules, the non-terminals must be replaced by terminals. So, the string needs to be built up by expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, expands to NT18 NT42. So, the first step in any derivation is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Since the string starts with \"t49\", I need to see if \"t49\" can come from NT18 or NT42.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT18, I see that NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, expanding NT18 gives two non-terminals, which then need to produce \"t49\" through further expansions. But wait, \"t49\" is a terminal, so that must come from one of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT57 \u2192 NT31 NT48\n- NT48 \u2192 NT44 NT42 (Wait, no NT44 is not a terminal, I think I might have to check again. Let me look back.\n\nWait, NT57 \u2192 NT31 NT48. NT31 is a non-terminal, and NT48 is also a non-terminal. But in the given string, after NT18, the first terminal is t49, which must come from either NT23 or NT57.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step, building the parse tree.\n\nStep 1: Start with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNow, the string starts with t49. So, either NT18 or NT42 must derive to t49. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT18 expands to NT23 and NT57. Neither of these are terminals yet, so we'd have to expand them further.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has several productions. Looking at NT42, one of the productions is NT42 \u2192 t27, another is NT42 \u2192 t22, etc. So, one of the NT42 productions is a terminal.\n\nWait, the productions for NT42 are:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 (this might be a typo; in CNF each production should have two non-terminals on the RHS or terminals)\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the production NT42 \u2192 t27 is a terminal, same with NT45 \u2192 t10, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, several NTx have terminals:\n\nFor example,\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT58 \u2192 t42 NT41? Wait no, let's check:\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nNT27\u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT42\u2192 t43 is one of its productions, wait no, the lines are:\n\nWait, I might have miscounted. Let me list all the productions with terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT4 \u2192 t9\n\nNT9 \u2192 t40 t28? Wait, no, NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28.\n\nWait, no terminals there. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t54 t49\n\nWait, NT8 \u2192 t54 t49, so that's a terminal: NT8 produces t54 and t49.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT26 \u2192 t49\n\nSo NT26 is a non-terminal, which leads to t49 as a terminal.\n\nLet me get a clearer list:\n\nTerminals:\n\n- t28 (NT2)\n\n- t49 (NT26)\n\n- t9 (NT4)\n\n- t54 (NT23, NT26)\n\n- t33 (NT54)\n\nLooking for where t49 comes from:\n\nFrom NT26: NT26 \u2192 t49, so t49 must come from NT26.\n\nSo the path to t49 starts with NT26 \u2192 t49.\n\nBut how do we get to NT26?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 is produced by which productions? Looking through the list, I don't see NT26 being the left-hand side except in:\n\nWait, NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nWait, perhaps NT26 is produced by a production that includes it, but looking through, I think NT26 is only on the right-hand side, meaning it's used as an intermediate.\n\nBut wait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nSo, NT23 can produce NT26. Since NT26 can produce t49, that would mean NT23 can produce t49 in two steps.\n\nWait, but how does this affect the top-down parsing? Let me think.\n\nIn this case, when S expands to NT18 NT42, which then gives NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the expansion steps. Let me outline a possible parse tree.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt49 t33 t31 t43 t28 t51 t47 t28 t51 t7 t10 t27 t51 t53\n\nThe string is of length 14. Each step in the expansion increases the number of symbols by 1, so for a string of length n, the number of steps is log(n).\n\nBut since in each step, each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So for a string of 14 symbols, we'd need to expand until we have 14 non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the initial string has 14 terminals, so the parse tree must have a structure that, when fully expanded, yields 14 terminals.\n\nEach step doubles the number of symbols. So, for the initial S, which is a single symbol, after k steps, the number of symbols is 2^k. Therefore, to get 14 symbols, we need k such that 2^k >=14, so k=4 steps. 2^4=16, which is close to 14. But this logic isn't precise because some productions may produce terminals directly, but for clarity, perhaps I can reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nThe string starts with \"t49\", which must come from NT26 (since NT26\u2192t49). So, within the expansion, one of the NT26's is in the expansion.\n\nWait, let me try to approach this by working backwards. Let's start from the string and see if it can be split into substrings each derived by a production.\n\nThe string is: t49 t33 t31 t43 t28 t51 t47 t28 t51 t7 t10 t27 t51 t53.\n\nWe can try to parse the string using recursion on the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nThe first non-terminal is S, which expands to NT18 and NT42. So, in the parse tree, S's two children are NT18 and NT42.\n\nThus, the string should be split into two parts, each being a constituent derived from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, starting with t49. So, the first part must be t49 ... something, while the second part is another t...something, derived from NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to parse the entire string as per the grammar.\n\nLet me start:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nSo, the string starts as t49 ... so t49 must come from NT18 or NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which would produce two non-terminals, so their expansion would produce t49 and something else.

The string is \"t10 t43 t43 t43 t54 t47 t27 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t50 t35 t51\". \n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure will help me perform a parsing approach, perhaps using a recursive descent method or checking possible derivation paths.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. So, each token must match the terminals in the production rules of the grammar. The string has 15 tokens, so the derivation must result in exactly 15 steps if it's following a binary split each time.\n\nI'll start by identifying the top-level production. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string must start with the concatenation of the two parts derived from NT18 and NT42. \n\nLet's check if the first two tokens \"t10 t43\" correspond to NT18 and NT42. \n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Wait, the string starts with t10, which is a terminal. So I need to see which NT rule produces t10. \n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 is another non-terminal. So t10 is produced by NT23's rule. Wait, no, looking at NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 is another non-terminal. So that doesn't produce 't10' directly. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols directly. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, but also looking through, for NT2 \u2192 't28', and NT4 \u2192 't9', etc. So I need to find which non-terminals can produce 't10', 't43', etc.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals (i.e., those with productions ending in a terminal, not another non-terminal):\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT8 \u2192 't54' and 't47'\n- NT9 \u2192 't40', 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23', 't9'\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n- NT27 \u2192 't42', 't43'\n- NT28 \u2192 't43', 't50'\n- NT35 \u2192 NT9\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT38 \u2192 't51', 't36', 't53', 't10'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27', 't4', 't28', 't41', 't43', etc. Specifically, looking at the rules, NT42 has several: NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41 (wait, no\u2014it says NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41 but that must be a typo because that's a left recursion. So perhaps I need to correct that\u2014looking back, in the given grammar, the lines starting with \"NT42 ->\" are:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41 (probably a mistake because it can't produce anything else), but perhaps that line is wrong or incomplete. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to be other rules. For example, in the given, under NT42 \u2192 't27', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, let me try to parse this correctly. Each NT rule is given as \"NTx -> ...\"\n\nSo, for example, NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22, and also NT2 \u2192 't28'. So for NT2, the possible expansions are NT10 NT22 or 't28'.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has several rules, like NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41, which seems problematic because it's recursive and would lead to infinite loops, but that's unlikely because in the given, other rules for NT42 are present.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar.

Hmm, let's see. I'm not very familiar with all the details, but I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like all the production rules are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal symbol. That's typical for CNF. The non-terminals are all the capital NT followed by numbers, except for the terminals which are lowercase t followed by numbers. Wait, actually, the terminals are words like t23, t33, etc. So, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t54 t57 t33 t45 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t53.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S -> NT18 NT42. So the first step is to see if the string starts with NT18 and NT42. But looking at the string, it starts with t23, which is a terminal. So, wait, in the first production, S produces NT18 and NT42. But in the string, the first tokens are t23, t33, etc. So I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, maybe the string is just the sequence of terminals generated by the grammar, so I need to parse the string as such. So, each step of the derivation will involve replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to build it by breaking down each non-terminal into its components.\n\nLet's list out the productions again to see which non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t23, t33, t31, t43, t54, t57, t33, t45, t43, t11, t7, t10, t54, t53, t53.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal is defined as a production of other non-terminals or terminals. So, let's list some key productions that produce the terminals we have.\n\n NT18 -> NT23 NT57: So NT18 can produce t23 and t57. Wait, no, looking at the list: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. But wait, NT23 is another non-terminal. Hmm, let me check. The productions given are:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57: So, when NT18 is expanded, it becomes NT23 and NT57. Are those terminals? Let's see. NT23 is another non-terminal. So, we'd need to look at what NT23 produces. Checking the list: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. So NT23 becomes NT26 and NT54. Then, NT26 -> t49, so t49 is a terminal. Similarly, NT54 -> t33. So, NT23 would produce t49 t33.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 would expand into NT23 NT57, but NT57 is a terminal. Check: NT57 -> t53. Wait no, looking back, NT57 isn't in the list. Wait, checking the productions: I see NT57 -> t31. Yes, because line says NT57 -> t31. So NT57 is a terminal. So putting it together: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 -> t49 t33. NT57 -> t31. So, expanding NT18 gives t49 t33 t31.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first tokens are t23 t33 t31... which doesn't match this. Hmm, so perhaps NT18 isn't the start point. Or maybe I'm getting something wrong.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which is NT18 NT42. So the first expansion would produce NT18 and NT42. Each of those can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t23, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, let's try to see if there's a way to derive t23 as part of the start symbol's expansion.\n\nWait, S produces NT18 and NT42. For the first token t23, we need to have t23 as the first symbol in the string. So that would come from either NT18 or NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. NT23 -> NT26 NT54. NT26 -> t49, NT54 -> t33. So NT18 would expand to t49 t33. But the string starts with t23, so that comes from NT42 perhaps.\n\nLooking at NT42's production: there are multiple options. One is NT42 -> NT2 NT38. NT2 -> t28, and NT38 -> t53. So that could produce t28 t53. Another is NT42 -> NT4 NT13. NT4 -> t9, NT13 -> t11. So that would be t9 t11. Another option is NT42 -> t27, since line says NT42 -> t27. Or NT42 -> NT44 NT45, but wait, is there a production for NT44? Looking through, I don't see NT44, except for NT44 itself. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the productive rules are as follows. Let me go through each line:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT42\n2. NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n3.

That's allowed as long as the non-terminal is reducible.)\n\nOkay, so from this, some non-terminals are actual terminals.

Hmm, this looks a bit intimidating with all those non-terminals, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That might help in parsing.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of symbols, all of which are terminals (like t23, t33, etc.), except for some non-terminals (like NT2, NT4, etc.). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the grammar, I think the non-terminals are things like NT1, NT2, etc., and the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, in the grammar, some rules have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT2 \u2192 't28'. So, the terminals are the ones that appear directly, while the others are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, hold on. In the grammar, each rule like S \u2192 NT18 NT18 means that S can be replaced by two non-terminals, and each of those can eventually be replaced by terminals. So, the production rules can generate strings of terminals when fully expanded.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, we need to see if we can derive the entire string from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, since building the parse tree from the string might be easier, let's try that approach. Parsing can be done using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since I might not remember that exactly, let's think about backtracking.\n\nThe string has 16 symbols. Let me write them out in order: t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t21 t21 t9 t43 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t51 t51. That's 16 symbols, so the parse tree would have a height corresponding to this.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar step by step. Let's look for each step where a non-terminal can be replaced by the corresponding symbols.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to reconstruct the parse tree for the given string. Let's try to see which parts of the string can correspond to which productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t23. Let me check which productions have t23 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28' \u2192 no.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9' \u2192 no.\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40' \u2192 no.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53. Wait, no, that's a non-terminal production, not a terminal. Hmm, maybe we should look for places where t23 is on the RHS of a production. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nWait, that's NT27 on the LHS, not t23. Hmm.

Or is it NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43?\n\nWait, no, the production is NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, which are non-terminals. So no t23 there.\n\nWait, looking back through all the RHS:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal on the RHS expands to a terminal t23.\n\nWait, looking at:\n\nIs there any production where RHS contains t23?\n\nLooking through each RHS:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT18 \u2192 no, both are non-terminals.\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53 \u2192 non-terminals.\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45 \u2192 non-terminals.\n\n- NT42 \u2192 is there any production for NT42?

{"custom_id":"request-291","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers, like `t10 t43 t43...` and so on.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for both theoretical analysis and parsing algorithms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it consists of a set of NT (non-terminal) symbols on the left-hand side and right-hand sides. The terminals are the strings that are not preceded by non-terminals; they look like 'tX' where X is a number. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of these production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t43 t43 t22 t28 t51 t7 t10 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t53 t35 t51`.\n\nI should note that the string is a sequence of terminals, and each step in the derivation must consist of replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides until all that's left are terminals, which should match the string exactly.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S directly expands into NT18 NT42.\n\nNext, each of these non-terminals will expand according to their own production rules. For example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, NT42 has multiple production options, like NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, etc. Similarly, each step requires choosing which production to apply for each non-terminal.\n\nSince the string starts with 't10', I need to see if the first symbol 't10' can be reached from the initial NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet's break down NT18. The production for NT18 is \u2192 NT23 NT57, and looking at NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT54 \u2192 't33'. So, the derivation from NT18 would be NT23 NT54 \u2192 't26 t33'? Wait, no, each non-terminal can only expand once per step, or perhaps I need to consider the order of replacement. Wait, perhaps I should consider each production rule step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step-by-step, starting from the given string and trying to reverse-engineer the derivation, seeing if it can be built from the start symbol using the grammar.\n\nThe given string is a series of 't's with numbers, so the string is: t10, t43, t43, t22, t28, t51, t7, t10, t21, t33, t45, t43, t43, t11, t53, t35, t51.\n\nTo reverse engineer, starting from the end, perhaps.\n\nThe string ends with t51, t35, t51. So the last part is t51 t35 t51. Looking at the grammar, is there a production that leads to t51? Let's check the terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some of the NT symbols are terminals. For example, NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, and these have productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking for t51, in the grammar, I see NT40 \u2192 t6, NT18 \u2192 t10, NT26 \u2192 t23, NT28 \u2192 t50, NT13 \u2192 t11, NT49 \u2192 t45, NT27 \u2192 t22, NT43 \u2192 t38, NT38 \u2192 t53, NT40 \u2192 t6, NT26 \u2192 t23, NT28 \u2192 t50, NT13 \u2192 t11, NT49 \u2192 t45, NT27 \u2192 t22, NT43 \u2192 t38, NT10 \u2192 t43, NT36 \u2192 t36, NT43 \u2192 t47, NT42 \u2192 t54, NT47 \u2192 t21, NT38 \u2192 t12, etc.\n\nWait, looking for t51, is there any NT that directly goes to t51? Checking the right-hand sides, I see that NT45 \u2192 't10', so that's a terminal. Other NTs: NT54 \u2192 't33', NT43 \u2192 't38' or others. Hmm, I don't see a production that ends with t51. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, NT42 has several productions, one of which is \u2192 't28'. Oh, wait, from the initial grammar, NT42 has a production to 't28', and in the string, there's a 't28'. Let's note that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a derivation tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to attempt to parse the given string according to the grammar, step by step.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, perhaps breaking it down into parts.\n\nStarting with the first part: t10, t43, t43.\n\nGiven that, starting from S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the initial step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNow, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so now we have NT23 NT57, NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal must be replaced in some order.\n\nSo, the current symbols after S are NT23, NT57, NT42.\n\nWait, NT57 \u2192 't35' according to the grammar.

Wait, in the grammar, the rules ending with 't' are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the given grammar lists many rules where non-terminals go to terminals, like:\n\nLook at the list:\n\nNT6? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the list is like:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nWait, the list seems to be longer. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The string is: `t10 t43 t43 t43 t9 t11 t53 t6 t50 t6 t21 t11 t43 t43 t6 t12`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals and non-terminals. The given grammar has multiple NT rules.\n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first two non-terminals are NT18 and NT42. Each of these needs to be expanded into something else, and so on, until we get to the leaves, which will be terminals.\n\nLet's break down the string. It starts with t10. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT57 \u2192 NT38. NT38 \u2192 t51. Wait, actually, for NT57, the production is not directly given; I need to check all the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 t49 or NT28 \u2192 t28\nWait, hold on. Let's map out the possible steps.\n\nThe string starts with t10, which seems to be in the grammar. Looking for where NT18 \u2192 t10: yes, in the production rules, NT18 \u2192 t10.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT18's production is: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the t10 must come from some rule, but looking at the productions, I don't see NT18 directly producing a terminal other than through other productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check the productions again. Oh, here's NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nBut in other rules, like NT58, we see NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41. NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45, NT51 \u2192 t7, and NT45 \u2192 t10. Wait, so maybe NT51 \u2192 t7, and NT45 \u2192 t10, but that's under NT45, not NT18.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think differently. The string starts with t10. Let's see if that can be the result of a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, are there any N terminals that directly produce t10? Yes, for example:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't43' because in the production, NT10 \u2192 t43?\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through each NT's production:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT43 \u2192 NT47\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT38 \u2192 t51\n- NT51 \u2192 t7\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t49\n- NT43 \u2192 t38\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT36 \u2192 t48\n- NT38 \u2192 t53\n- NT40 \u2192 t6\n- NT26 \u2192 t23\n- NT28 \u2192 t50\n- NT13 \u2192 t11\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT27 \u2192 t22\n- NT28 \u2192 t55\n- NT57 \u2192 t31\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n\nWait, so looking for which NTs directly produce t10. There's NT45 \u2192 t10. Also, NT18 \u2192 t10. Hmm, but NT18's production is actually NT23 NT57, not directly t10.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT18 has a production that ends in t10 via other steps. So, the string starts with t10. That would mean that either NT18 or another NT eventually produces t10.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t10 comes from NT18 \u2192 t10... but no, looking again, the production for NT18 is NT23 NT57, not a terminal. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, the production for NT18 is: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so t10 can't come directly from NT18. But looking through all the productions, I see NT45 \u2192 t10. So is there any NT that eventually leads to t10?\n\nWait, maybe the string's t10 is from NT45 \u2192 t10. So perhaps the expansion started with NT45, which produces t10.\n\nWait, but earlier the start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first two are NT18 and NT42. Let's see what each of them can produce.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 maybe 't49' or other options. Also, NT57 \u2192 NT38. Then NT38 \u2192 t51.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t10, which would have to come from a terminal production in a lower derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree for the given string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nLet's try to break down the string: `t10 t43 t43 t43 t9 t11 t53 t6 t50 t6 t21 t11 t43 t43 t6 t12`.\n\nThe length is 16 tokens. Each non-terminal in the grammar produces exactly two terminals or non-terminals, which would split the string into an even number of tokens. Since 16 is even, it's possible.\n\nLet me attempt a top-down approach.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThen, I need to derive t10 t43 t43 t43 ... starting from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLet's see what NT18 and NT42 can produce.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 \u2192 let's check its productions: NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, from the productions:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT38 \u2192 t51\n\nAlso, NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT8 \u2192 t54 NT49\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n\nAnd NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 \u2192 which could lead to t10, but not sure yet.\n\nSo, let's see: S \u2192 NT18 NT42 \u2192 (NT23 NT57)(NT2 NT38). So, we have four non-terminals: NT23, NT57, NT2, NT38.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t10, which is a terminal. So perhaps one of these non-terminals in the expansion leads to t10.\n\nLooking at NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT38 \u2192 t51. So t51, which isn't present at the beginning.\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22.

{"custom_id":"request-313","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t10 t43 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t57 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t12 t53`. Hmm, that's a bit long. \n\nFirst, I should remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or the start symbol can produce a terminal directly. Wait, actually, in a proper CNF, the start symbol can also produce a terminal, but in the given grammar, I see several terminals like 't35', 't28', etc., which are likely terminal symbols. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, most of them have two non-terminals on the right side, like S \u2192 NT18 NT42, NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, etc. But some have terminals, for example, NT42 can produce 't27'. So, the grammar allows terminals as part of the productions, which is fine.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is all terminals, so we need to see if there's a derivation path from the start symbol S that produces exactly this string. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminals. So, the length of the string should be related to the number of steps in the derivation. For a context-free grammar in CNF, the maximum number of symbols in the string at each step is exponential in the number of steps. But given the string length here is 17, I can try to see how the derivations could lead to that.\n\nWait, no. Let me rethink. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. But typically, in CNF, you have A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. However, sometimes terminals can appear in the productions, especially on the right-hand side, which is allowed in the form of A \u2192 B t, treating t as an input terminal.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So, the grammar should have all productions either replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or replacing it with a single terminal. That's correct.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that some rules have two non-terminals, others have one terminal on the RHS. For example, NT42 can produce 't27', which is a terminal. So, the grammar is a mix of CNF (left-hand side being a non-terminal) and allowing terminals. So, this should be a valid CNF grammar, I think.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. We need to check if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. The approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if, through a series of productions, we can derive the given string.\n\nGiven the string has 17 symbols: `t10 t43 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t57 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t12 t53`. Wait, wait, I count 17 t's and numbers, but let me check.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t57 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t12 t53. Yes, that's 17 symbols.\n\nIn CNF, each step in a derivation can double the number of symbols in a sentential form, except when terminal symbols are involved.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first expansion of S gives us NT18 NT42. Each of these is a non-terminal, so now we have two non-terminals. To make progress, each of these must be expanded further until we get all terminals.\n\nBut given the string has 17 symbols, perhaps the derivation has gone through multiple steps, replacing non-terminals until all that's left are terminals.\n\nBut 17 is a prime number, and in CNF, the number of terminals should be a power of 2 multiplied by some combinations. Wait, or maybe not necessarily, because some productions can introduce terminals early on.\n\nAnother approach is to backtrack from the string and see if we can factor it into the productions. Each step from the string backward should split into two parts, which can be matched by a production of a non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting from the full string, which is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. NT18 should produce the first half of the string, and NT42 should produce the second half.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first step, NT18 and NT42 are each non-terminals, so each needs to be expanded. So, maybe the string can be divided into two parts by NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo, the first part of the string, corresponding to NT18, and the second part corresponding to NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: [t10] [t43] [t21] [t33] [t45] [t43] [t43] [t11] [t57] [t21] [t9] [t43] [t11] [t7] [t10] [t27] [t12] [t53].\n\nBut that's 17 elements, so the first NT18 would produce 9 terms, and the second NT42 would produce 8 terms? Or perhaps it's variable. Wait, in CNF, each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals, leading to an exponential number of steps. But given the string is 17, which is odd, and each expansion would potentially split into two parts, the lengths can vary.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by recursively checking each non-terminal and seeing if the corresponding substring can be derived from it.\n\nFirst, the entire string is derived from S, so we need to split it into two parts, each derived from NT18 and NT42 respectively. Let's see what the production for NT18 is: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, the first part of the string would be NT23 NT57, which would be [t10], [t43], [t21], [t33], [t45], [t43], [t43], [t11], [t57]. Wait, that's 9 terms. Hmm, but NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, the first part is NT23, which should produce some string, and the second part is NT57, which should produce another. Alternatively, maybe NT18 can have more expansions, but this might get complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think recursively. For each non-terminal, check if the given substring can be produced by expanding it.\n\nSo, to check if the given string is produced by S, we can split it into two parts according to each production of S. S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the first part is from NT18 and the second from NT42. Let's verify if the first part, which is the first few symbols of the string, can be generated by NT18.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, the substring generated by NT18 would be [NT23] [NT57]. Now, let's see what NT23 and NT57 produce.\n\nLooking at NT23's production: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nSo, NT23 expands into NT26 and NT54. Each of these may expand further.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT49, as per the rule NT26 \u2192 NT49. Wait, no: looking back, the grammar has NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 and NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40, etc. Wait, no, wait: I need to look at the production rules carefully.\n\nWait, let me clarify the grammar rules provided:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 NT49\n- NT54 \u2192 NT33\n\nSo, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.

{"custom_id":"request-311","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a terminal symbol. But wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production can have at most two non-terminals, but sometimes terminals are allowed in certain positions, right? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Either way, the grammar as presented seems to have rules that sometimes produce terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t33 t45 t43 t11 t38 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t12 t12`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me recall that the start symbol is S, and each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with the right-hand side of a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S is transformed into NT18 NT42. So the first step is that S becomes NT18 NT42. Then, each of these non-terminals must be expanded further until we reach terminal symbols only.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and see if they produce terminals or other non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT42 has several options, like NT2 NT38 or NT4 NT13 or others leading to 't's.\n\nWait, some of the NTs directly produce terminals. For instance, NT2 -> 't28' and NT42 -> 't27' in one of the rules. So that would produce a terminal string part.\n\nBut the first thing is to see the structure of the string. Let's break down the string into parts:\n\nThe string is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t33 t45 t43 t11 t38 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t12 t12.\n\nI notice a lot of t's, so probably these come from the terminals in the grammar. I think each 't' is a terminal symbol, so the string is a sequence of these t terms.\n\nNow, to see if it's generated, I can try to see the possible expansions.\n\nThe start symbol S expands to NT18 NT42. So after the first expansion, we have two parts: NT18 and NT42. Let's denote each part as needing to expand.\n\nLet me focus on NT42 first because it has multiple production rules leading to terminals. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38 (or others)\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nAnd another rule: NT42 -> 't27' (from the earlier rules, like NT42 -> 't27').\n\nWait, no, in the initial part, the grammar for NT42 is:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> NT2 NT43\nNT42 -> NT51 NT43\nNT42 -> ... etc., and actually, in the later part, there's a rule: NT42 -> 't27'.\n\nWait, no, let me recheck:\n\nWait the grammar provided has for NT42 multiple production rules to other NTs, but also in the initial list, I see:\n\nNT42 -> NT27? Or perhaps I should list all the production rules for NT42.\n\nWait, going back through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT42:\n\nNT42 appears in several places:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT42 rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT43\n\nWait, no, in the initial list, I see:\n\nLooking again, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nThen, later:\n\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\n\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, later entries like:\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT43 -> NT22 NT5\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT42 -> 't27' ?\n\nWait, in the initial list, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some rules directly produce terminals. For example, some of the NTs seem to directly go to a single terminal.\n\nFor instance, looking through, I find:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n\n- NT58 -> 't42'\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs and see which ones produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some of the rules have a terminal on the right side, like:\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT38 -> 't53'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nNT28 -> 't50'\n\nNT13 -> 't11'\n\nNT49 -> 't45'\n\nNT27 -> 't22'\n\nNT28 -> 't55'\n\nNT57 -> 't31'\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\n\nNT36 -> 't36'\n\nNT43 -> 't47'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT47 -> 't21'\n\nNT38 -> 't12'\n\nSo, wait, for example, NT42 has a rule that turns into 't27' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 -> 't22'\n\nNT22 -> 't2' or similar? Let me see:\n\nNT22 rules:\n\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\n- NT22 -> NT2 NT9\n\nLooking through, I don't see a direct terminal for NT22. Wait, no: NT2 -> 't28', but NT22 is a non-terminal that can expand into other NTs.\n\nSo, going back to the string: It starts with t23, which corresponds to N T23. Looking through the grammar, NT23 is present multiple times.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 occurs in:\n\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\n- Other rules, like NT8 -> NT23 NT47\n\nSo perhaps that's part of a chain.\n\nWait, let me think of an approach. Perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals and attempt to break it down step by step.\n\nBut this might take a while, as the string is 17 tokens long. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the first token is produced by any of the NTs.\n\nThe first token is t23. Which NT could produce t23? Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT23 has rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 appears in:\n\nNT8 -> NT23 NT47\n\nSo that might mean NT8 could go to t23 and t47.\n\nWait, no. NT8 is a non-terminal, and its production rules are:\n\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n\n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nSo, it doesn't directly produce t23. Wait, perhaps looking through NT23's production:\n\nNT23 can be derived from:\n\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nAlso, I think NT8 can go to NT23, as in the production NT8 -> NT23 NT47.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see which NS produce t23. I should look for NTs whose production rules include 't23' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT23's right-hand side is NT26 NT54, so it's a non-terminal production. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: Which rule(s) produce 't23'? Checking all the terminal rules, I don't see a 't23' terminal; instead, all the terminals are like 't5', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. The grammar has rules where some NTs produce terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT27 -> 't22'\n\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n\n- NT9 -> 't40'\n\nWait, no, for example, looking here:\n\nEarlier,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-332","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating with all the rules, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember what a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar looks like. CNF is a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided should follow this structure, but I should check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production seems to be in the form of either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Check. NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT47. Check. The only non-terminal leading to a terminal is when the right side is a single non-terminal, but that's covered because the production will eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals or one terminal. But in our case, the productions either have two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT18 NT42) or sometimes a terminal on one side (like NT45 \u2192 t10), but actually, in CNF, the only terminals allowed on the right-hand side are single terminals, not non-terminals. So perhaps in this grammar, some rules might have one terminal and one non-terminal, which isn't strictly CNF. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing myself.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So maybe it's indeed in CNF. Okay, moving on.\n\nThe target string is: `t23 t33 t31 t43 t28 t51 t38 t27 t7 t10 t21 t21 t11 t43 t43 t43 t11 t12 t51`.\n\nI need to parse this string into the non-terminals of the grammar. Since it's a top-down parser, I'd probably use the leftmost derivation method. But since the grammar is small, maybe I can represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if I can backtrack using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check if the string can be derived starting from S by following the productions. Let's see.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So the initial step is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Thus, the first two symbols should correspond to NT18 and NT42, but wait, in the string, the first symbol is t23. So NT18 must expand to t23 something else? Wait, no, because expanding NT18 would produce a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but the first symbol is t23. Let me see if NT18 can derive t23.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 can't derive directly a terminal. Oh, maybe I need to look further.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t23 as part of a production chain. Let me check the productions that produce t23.\n\nLooking up NT23's productions: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 and NT23 \u2192 t26. Wait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, NT23 has a production NT23 \u2192 t26.

Wait, no, \"NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\" and \"NT8 \u2192 t54 NT49\". Wait, maybe I'm not looking correctly.\n\nWait, looking back: the productions are given, for example:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT8 \u2192 t54 NT49\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production list:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, but also: looking for t23, does any production produce t23? Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT23 \u2192 t26. Oh, wait, \"NT26 \u2192 t49\" and \"NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\".

So maybe the initial NT18 is being expanded, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is S -> NT18 NT42. So the string should start with the sequence of NT18 and NT42. But the given string starts with 't10', which is 't10', a terminal. So perhaps NT18 is being expanded to something that starts with 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Then, each of these can be terminals or other non-terminals. Let's see NT23: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. NT25? Wait, no, NT23 is NT23, and looking up its production: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. So NT23 is a non-terminal, which means it needs to be expanded. Similarly, NT57: looking up NT57, which isn't in the provided rules, but according to the provided rules, NT57 isn't a terminal. Wait, no, in the provided rules, I don't see NT57. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT26 -> NT26 NT49\nNT26 has another rule: NT26 -> t49. Oh, so NT26 can be either NT26 NT49 or t49. Since t49 is a terminal, that's how it's used.\n\nWait, so let's break this down step by step, maybe using Leftmost Derivation or some kind of top-down parsing.\n\nStart with S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nFirst, derive the leftmost symbol, which is NT18.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. So now the string starts with NT23 NT57 NT42, but 't10' is the first symbol, which is a terminal. Hmm, but NT23 can expand into other symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how each NT can lead to terminals.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Now looking at NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 becomes NT26 NT54.\n\nNow, we have: NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54 NT57 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT26: NT26 can \u2192 t49 or NT26 NT49. So if we expand NT26 to t49, then one part is consumed.\n\nWait, but wait: NT18's expansion is NT23 NT57. NT23\u2192NT26 NT54. NT26 can be either t49 or NT26 NT49. Let's say we choose the t49 option.\n\nSo NT26 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo now, we have: t49 NT54 NT57 NT42.\n\nNext, NT54: Looking up, NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo now: t49 t33 NT57 NT42.\n\nThen, NT57: Looking for its production. I don't see NT57 in the provided rules. Hmm. Wait, maybe that was a typo and should be NT37? Or perhaps I missed a rule. But in the given rules, NT58 is defined as NT42 NT41, and NT42 \u2192 t27. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all the rules again. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT57 is not listed as a production target. Oh, wait, NT57 is a terminal? In the initial list, the rule NT42 \u2192 t27 is present, but not NT57. So perhaps I made a mistake in expanding NT23 NT57.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me try to parse the string step by step, trying to match the productions.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t28 t35 t35 t35 t6 t21 t9 t43 t6 t6 t47 t40 t12.\n\nWe know that the start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the first symbols derived from S are NT18 and NT42. So the string starts with whatever NT18 produces and NT42 produces.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 could be further expanded. Let's see where this leads.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't10', so perhaps NT18 must somehow derive 't10' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Now, NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26's production: NT26 \u2192 t49 or NT26 NT49.\n\nIf we choose NT26 \u2192 t49, then we have NT23 \u2192 t49 NT54. Then NT54 \u2192 t33. So the expansion is t49 t33, but our string starts with 't10', so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we shouldn't expand NT26 here. Wait, no: NT26 must be expanded since it's a non-terminal. So we can't keep it as is. Therefore, the production of NT23 leads to NT26 NT54, which further leads to non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to see if 't10' appears as a terminal anywhere.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see NT10 \u2192 't43' and NT2 \u2192 't28', etc. Wait, is there any non-terminal that directly expands to 't10'? Yes: looking at NT10's production, it's only defined as NT10 \u2192 't43', so unless it's derived from another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if 't10' is a terminal in some other place. Wait, NT10 is not a terminal but a non-terminal because it's on the left of a production. Wait no: in the CNF, terminals are the leaves. So 't10' is a terminal symbol. Do any of the non-terminals have a production that ends with 't10'? Let's check.\n\nLooking through each production ending:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 t49 or NT26 NT49\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t11 (appears twice)\n- NT9 \u2192 t40\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT22 \u2192 various productions; none ends with t28 except NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT27 \u2192 t42 and t43\n- NT28 \u2192 t4 and t40, t43, t5 etc.\n- NT36 \u2192 t48 or t36 in some places\n- NT38 \u2192 t51 or t53\n- NT40 \u2192 t6\n- NT42 has multiple productions, some leading to terminals like t10 (NT42 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t23 t33 t31 t43 t11 t43 t11 t47 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t28 t35 t51 t53 t53`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, the top symbol is S, and S can only produce NT18 NT42 as per the rules.\n\nGiven the string starts with 't23 t33', which suggests that the first non-terminal to produce these is probably NT23 or something related, but let me step through it step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice several 't's, which are terminals. Each 't' is followed by a number. Let's list all the terminals with their corresponding non-terminals or what they represent.\n\nLooking through the rules, several NTs produce terminals. For example:\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT43 \u2192 't57'\n- NT47 \u2192 't21'\n- NT31 \u2192 Is 't31' a terminal? Wait, in the rules I see NT57 \u2192 t31, so 't31' comes from NT57.\n- NT11: Wait, looking at the rules, for example, NT8 \u2192 t11. So 't11' is from NT8.\n- NT10: Looking through rules, NT18 \u2192 t10, so 't10' is from NT18.\n- NT13: NT13 \u2192 t11? No, wait, the given rules show NT11: let me check. Looking through the rules, there's a line NT13 \u2192 't11'. So NT13 produces 't11'.\n- NT28: I see NT28 \u2192 t50, so 't50' comes from NT28.\n- NT21: NT27 \u2192 t22, but that's not relevant here. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me map each terminal to the non-terminals that produce them.\n\nFrom the rules, the productions that result in terminals are:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT43 \u2192 't57'\n- NT47 \u2192 't21'\n- NT31 \u2192 't31' (NT57 \u2192 t31? Wait, looking back, the rule is NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, but the terminals are:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I should note which NT produce which terminals.\n\nLet me list the rule where a non-terminal becomes a terminal:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, which have terminals t27 and t28? Wait, the rules given are a bit complicated. Let me go through each rule and see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT42 \u2192 't27' (yes, line NT42 \u2192 't27')\n\nNT43 \u2192 't57' (yes, line NT43 \u2192 't57')\n\nNT47 \u2192 't21' (line NT47 \u2192 't21')\n\nNT31 \u2192 't31'? Looking at the rules, I don't see a production where NT57 \u2192 't31', wait line: NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, which are t27 and t28.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me parse each rule and note terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT42: NT18 and NT42 are non-terminals.\n\n2. NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n\n3. NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\n4. NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n\n5. NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n\n6. NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\n7. NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\n8. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\n9. NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43: NT42 and NT43 are non-terminals (since they have two NT symbols).\n\nWait, NT42 \u2192 't27' is a terminal. So when S expands to NT18 NT42, that first step would have NT18 \u2192 something and NT42 \u2192 t27.\n\nWait, let me correct: S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which then needs to expand. But before that, perhaps I need to build a parse tree. Let me think of the string as a sequence of 't's and construct a possible derivation.\n\nThe string is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t11 t43 t11 t47 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t28 t35 t51 t53 t53.\n\nI notice that the first two terms are t23 and t33. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 (so NT23 splits into NT26 and NT54.\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t33 (line: NT54 \u2192 't33').\n\nSo 't23' must come from NT23, and then 't33' must come from NT54.\n\nWait, no, the way the grammar works is that each non-terminal generates two terminals or non-terminals. So the production rules are from non-terminals to two symbols, which could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for t23 t33, perhaps the first NT is NT23 and the second is NT54.\n\nSo the first part of the string starts with NT23 producing t23 and NT54 producing t33.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So the first step is that NT23 becomes NT26 and NT54.\n\nThen, for t23, the production would be NT23 \u2192 t26 t54? No, that's not how it works. Each production is two symbols, either NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, if NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, then the NT26 would produce something, and NT54 would produce something else.\n\nLooking into NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 t49 (from the rule: NT26 \u2192 t49? Let me check: yes, line NT26 \u2192 't49').\n\nNT54 \u2192 t33 (from NT54 \u2192 t33).\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT18 NT42, then perhaps the derivation needs to be followed step by step.\n\nWait, but S is the start symbol, and each production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, then those can further produce other symbols.\n\nBut given the string's complexity, I think it's more efficient to work from the string backward, using the reverse approach for checking if the string can be generated.\n\nReverse approach: starting from the end, the last token is t53. So, the last non-terminal in the derivation must produce t53.\n\nLooking for production rules where a non-terminal can produce t53.\n\nFrom the rules, let me look for any non-terminal that can produce t53:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38 (line: NT53 \u2192 't42' and 't38'? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't53'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't53'. The only t53 is in NT38 \u2192 t53 (line: NT38 \u2192 't53').\n\nWait, no, looking through all rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly results in t53. So the only t53 comes from NT38.\n\nWait, but if t53 is in the string, it must be produced by a NT that eventually produces it. Let's see: if we have 't53' at the end, it must come from a NT that can directly produce t53, but from the rules I don't see any. So it must come from NT38 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, but then the previous symbol before t53 would need to be the other part of the production.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nThe string ends with ... t55, but in the given string, it ends with t53 t53.\n\nWait, in the given string, it's 't... t53 t53' as the last two symbols.\n\nWait, no, the string is 't23 t33 t31 t43 t11 t43 t11 t47 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t28 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the grammar to see what each production rule looks like. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which means any string derived from this grammar should start with two tokens connected by these NT symbols. My task is to see if the given string starts with two tokens that can come from NT18 and NT42, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t49 and t33. I'll need to check if these correspond to the productions of NT18 and NT42. Scrolling through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT42 \u2192 various things, including one that leads to t27.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t49 (which is from S's first NT18), the next is t33. Let me check NT18's productions:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but that gives me two new tokens. But t33 isn't in there. Alternatively, looking further down, I see NT26 \u2192 t49, so perhaps another path. Hmm, maybe I should backtrack.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. The initial S produces NT18 and NT42. So, the string should be generated in a way that each symbol in the string corresponds to the left-hand side of a production or a terminal.\n\nLet me list the string's tokens again for clarity: t49, t33, t31, t43, t43, t22, t21, t9, t43, t11, t7, t10, t33, t45, t43, t11, t51, t6, t55, t51.\n\nWait, the first token is t49. That's a terminal. So, which production rules produce t49? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT26 \u2192 t49\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t54\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT42 \u2192 t27\n- NT27 \u2192 t22\n- NT28 \u2192 t50\n- NT9 \u2192 t35\n- NT2 \u2192 t43\n- NT42 \u2192 t54\n- NT43 \u2192 t38\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT36 \u2192 t48\n- NT38 \u2192 t51\n- NT40 \u2192 t6\n- NT26 \u2192 t23\n- NT28 \u2192 t55\n- NT57 \u2192 t31\n- NT43 \u2192 t47\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT38 \u2192 t12\n- NT27 \u2192 t22\n- NT55 \u2192 t55\n- Other t's are assigned, like NT22 \u2192 t28, etc.\n\nSo, t49 comes from NT26. So for the first symbol of the string, which is t49, that must come from NT26. So the first rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first symbol must come from NT18, which is then NT26 in this case.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S generates a string where the first NT is NT18 and the second is NT42. Each of these NTs can generate sequences of tokens. So, each symbol in the string should be part of the expansion of NT18 or NT42.\n\nStarting over, the first token is t49, which is from NT26. So NT18 must produce a sequence that includes t49 as its next symbol. But looking at NT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which are non-terminals, and NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT26 is where t49 comes from.\n\nSo, let's see: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. The first symbol is t49, so it's from NT26, which is part of NT18's expansion path. So, let's go through the production.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 NT26 NT54 NT57 \u2192 t49 NT54 NT57.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to reconstruct the entire derivation.\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the string generated must be a sequence derived by expanding NT18 and NT42 separately, and then concatenating their expansions.\n\nEach expansion is done by replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string, let's try to see if it can be broken down into two parts: one that starts with t49 and corresponds to NT18, and the other that corresponds to NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t49. Let's see what comes after t49.\n\nThe string is: t49, t33, t31, t43, t43, t22, t21, t9, t43, t11, t7, t10, t33, t45, t43, t11, t51, t6, t55, t51.\n\nSo after t49 (from NT18), the next tokens should come from the expansion of NT18. Let's follow that path.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and so on.\n\nWait, let's try to expand NT18 step by step.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNow, expand NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nExpand NT26: NT26 \u2192 t49.\n\nExpand NT54: NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo, so far, NT18 \u2192 t49 t33, right?\n\nBut in the string, after t49 is t33, which matches.\n\nSo, the first two symbols t49 t33 could be the expansion of NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54 \u2192 t49 t33.\n\nBut wait, NT54 also has other productions: NT54 \u2192 t33 is one, but check the grammar: yes, NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo, after t49 comes t33, which is correct for NT54.\n\nSo, the first two tokens match.\n\nMoving on, the next token after t49 t33 is t31.\n\nSo, after t33 from NT54, what comes next? Wait, perhaps the expansion continues.\n\nWait, no, because NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Expand NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nSo after t49 t33, the next step would be looking into NT57, but NT57 \u2192 t31. Because in the grammar, NT57 \u2192 t31.\n\nSo after t33 (from NT54), the next token is t31, which is from NT57.\n\nSo, the first four tokens are t49, t33, t31, which would correspond to NT18 expanding as t49 (NT26) + t33 (NT54) + t31 (NT57). But wait, how does NT57 fit into the production of NT18?\n\nWait, the production sequence for NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 NT26 NT54 NT57 \u2192 t49 t33 t57. Wait, but t57 is another terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT57 \u2192 t31. So, yes, after t49 t33 comes t31.\n\nSo the first three tokens after the initial part of the string are t49, t33, t31, which correspond to NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54 NT57 \u2192 t49 t33 t31.\n\nOk, so the first three tokens are correct.\n\nNow, the next token after t31 is t43.\n\nSo, after NT57, which is t31, the next symbol is t43.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about how the NTs are structured. Since S produces NT18 and NT42, and NT18 has expanded as t49 t33 t31 so far, the next symbols should come from NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so we'll need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So, the string starts with t10 from NT18 and t27 from NT42 (since NT18 -> 't10', NT42 -> 't27'). Wait, let me check:\n   NT18's production: NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and so on. Wait, no\u2014the direct productions for terminals are listed at the end. So, for NT18, I see that it can eventually produce 't10' via NT18 -> 't10' directly. Similarly, NT42 can produce 't27' or 't26', etc.\n\nSo, the first terminal in the string is t49. Wait, the string starts with t49. But according to the CFG, NT18 is the first production, so the first two symbols should come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, wait, no: S -> NT18 NT42, so the first symbol is NT18, second symbol is NT42. But in the string, the first symbol is t49. Let me check the productions for NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18: it has a production NT18 -> NT23 NT57 and also another production NT18 -> 't10'. So, to get t49 as the first symbol, maybe I need to look at NT42. nt42 has several productions, including NT42 -> 't27', 't28', etc. Wait, let me see:\n\nNT42's productions:\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13,\nNT42 -> NT4 NT28,\nNT42 -> 't27',\nNT42 -> 't28',\n... Also, looking at the given string, I see that NT42 can produce 't27' or 't28', but the string starts with t49, which isn't any of those. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write down the first few steps.\n\nThe string starts with t49. But looking at the start symbol S, the first step is to produce NT18 and NT42. So, the first symbol must be generated by NT18, and the second by NT42. But in the string, the first symbol is t49. Let's see if NT18 can produce t49.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions, I see NT18 -> NT23 NT57, NT18 -> NT23 NT57, etc., and also NT18 -> 't10'. Wait, the only direct terminal for NT18 is 't10', so how does NT18 generate t49? That doesn't make sense. Because in the given string, the first symbol is t49, which would require NT18 to produce t49, but according to the grammar, NT18 can only produce 't10'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the productions. Let me check again. The NT18 productions are:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT18 can only go to 't10' directly. Therefore, if the string starts with t49, which isn't 't10', then S can't produce t49 as the first symbol. Thus, the string isn't in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mixing the non-terminals and terminals. Let me double-check: NT18 is a non-terminal that can generate 't10'. So, if S starts by producing NT18 and NT42, then the first symbol must come from NT18, which is t10, but the string starts with t49, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the production for NT27 as well. NT27 can produce 't22' and 't28'. But in the given string, the second symbol is t33, which would come from NT42. NT42's options include 't27' and 't28', but the string's second symbol is t33. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, no: the string is t49, t33, t31,... So the first symbol is t49, second t33, etc. But if S produces NT18 and NT42, then the first symbol should be from NT18 and the second from NT42. But NT18 only can produce 't10', so the first symbol is t10. But string starts with t49, so that's impossible. Therefore, the answer must be No.\n\nI think I'm correct. The string can't be generated because the first symbol should be 't10' but it's 't49' instead.\n<\/think>\n\nThe grammar starts with S, which produces NT18 and NT42.

So starting from S (1 symbol) and ending with 21 symbols, that implies 20 steps, since each step adds one symbol.\n\nSo the grammar needs to generate a string of length 21, which this does. So next, I should map each terminal in the string to see if they can be derived from non-terminals or if there are possible substitutions.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminals in the string and see if they have corresponding productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 | NT27 | NT43 | NT36 | NT22 | NT28 | NT42 (many others), and finally to terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11' (from two different productions)\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT22 \u2192 't23'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT41 \u2192 't10'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27', 't43', 't54', 't42' (multiple)\n- NT43 \u2192 't38', 't47', 't42', 't36', 't28', 't12', etc.\n- NT45 \u2192 't10'\n- NT51 \u2192 't7'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n- NT57 \u2192 't31'\n- NT58 \u2192 't42'\n- NT8 (another production) \u2192 't47'\n- NT23 \u2192 't26'\n- NT43 \u2192 't38', etc.\n\nSo many of these non-terminals produce terminal symbols directly. So the string's symbols must be matched by these terminals. Let's check each symbol in the string to see if it's present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string: `t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t28 t12 t57 t54 t7 t10 t43 t48 t54 t51 t12 t12 t6 t50 t35 t51`.\n\nWait, wait, that's 21 symbols. Let me count: actually, the string provided is:\n\nt49, t33, t31, t43, t43, t43, t28, t12, t57, t54, t7, t10, t43, t48, t54, t51, t12, t12, t6, t50, t35, t51.\n\nHmm, but that's 22 symbols. Wait, wait, let me count again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's write the string again:\n\nOriginal string: \"t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t28 t12 t57 t54 t7 t10 t43 t48 t54 t51 t12 t12 t6 t50 t35 t51\".\n\nSo separating each, that's 22 symbols. Hmm, earlier I thought it's 21, but now it's 22. That's an issue because starting from S (1 symbol), each production adds one symbol, so the number of symbols should be 1 + number of productions. So for a string of length N, there must be N-1 productions.\n\nIf the string has 22 symbols, then the grammar would need to produce it in 21 productions starting from S. So that's feasible.\n\nNow, going back to checking if the terminals exist in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT2 can produce 't28'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't50'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11' (twice, so can produce t11)\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't27', 't43', 't54', 't42' (multiple)\n\nNT43 \u2192 can produce 't38', 't47', 't42', 't36', 't28', 't12'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT8 (another production) \u2192 't47'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo, the terminals present in the grammar are:\n\nt2, t7, t8 (t11?), t9, t10, t12, t23, t26, t27, t28, t31, t33, t38, t42, t43, t47, t48, t50, t51, t53.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT2 can produce 't28', which is t28.\n\nBut in the string provided, we have:\n\nLooking at each symbol:\n\nt49: Not in the list above.

{"custom_id":"request-396","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to work through it carefully.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal symbol. That should make things a bit easier since each production step either introduces two symbols or a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules starting with S, NT1, NT2, etc. The target string is `t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t36 t54 t53 t12 t38 t28 t53 t7 t10 t54 t12 t35 t6 t50 t35 t51`. That's a pretty long string, so I'll have to parse it carefully.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string starting from the beginning and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can do this step by step, replacing non-terminals with their productions.\n\nLet's list the non-terminals: S, NT1 (which is NT5), NT2, NT4, NT5, NT9, NT10, NT18, NT22, NT23, NT26, NT27, NT28, NT36, NT38, NT40, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT47, NT51, NT53, NT54, etc. But since the string uses terminals up to t9 and some t numbers, I don't think we'll need all of them.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT1 followed by NT42, i.e., S \u2192 NT1 NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t10 and t43. But in the grammar, NT1's production is NT23 NT57. Does that mean the first step is S \u2192 NT1 NT42 \u2192 (NT23 NT57) followed by something? Wait, that can't be right because t10 isn't produced by NT1. Wait, maybe I got the productions wrong.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT1 is defined as NT5. Looking back: NT1 \u2192 NT5? Or maybe it's NT5? Let me recheck the grammar. The user provided:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT18 NT42\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n...\nThen, looking at the list of NT rules, I see:\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\n...\nAnd so on. Wait, I think I need to list all the productions. The provided grammar is a long list. Let me try to list some key productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nNT25 isn't here, but let's focus. The string starts with t10, so I'm wondering if any non-terminal produces t10 in one step. Looking at the grammar, NT10 is a terminal, right? Because in the list, there are a lot of terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some of the non-terminals are actually terminals according to the string. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28' (so this non-terminal produces t28 directly)\n\nSimilarly, NT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the string, we have t10 appearing multiple times. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT10 is a terminal because NT10 \u2192 't43', right?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nBut wait, is that a rule where NT22 produces 't28' or is it an error? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nWait, but then NT10 itself is a terminal because it's rewritten to 't43'. Hmm, perhaps I need to parse the grammar correctly. Some of these are non-terminals that expand to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, the grammar is recursive and contains both non-terminals and terminals as productions. My plan is to parse the string step by step, trying to match it to the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the target string: t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t36 t54 t53 t12 t38 t28 t53 t7 t10 t54 t12 t35 t6 t50 t35 t51.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t10\n2. t43\n3. t43\n4. t43\n5. t43\n6. t43\n7. t36\n8. t54\n9. t53\n10. t12\n11. t38\n12. t28\n13. t53\n14. t7\n15. t10\n16. t54\n17. t12\n18. t35\n19. t6\n20. t50\n21. t35\n22. t51\n\nI need to figure out how the grammar can produce this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either introduces a terminal or a non-terminal, but since each production is two symbols on the RHS, we can only have two symbols at a time until they resolve to terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol, t10. So, I need a production that starts with t10. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT40 \u2192 't6' (so that's a terminal production), NT7 \u2192 't50' (is there an NT7?), wait, maybe I'm missing some. Wait, maybe I need to list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a mapping of which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let me go through each production rule and note if it's a terminal (e.g., NT2 \u2192 t28, so when NT2 is derived, it becomes t28).\n\nProduction rules (abbreviated for clarity):\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT9 \u2192 't35'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT43 \u2192 't57'\n- NT45 \u2192 't10'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n- NT38 \u2192 't51'\n- NT51 \u2192 't7'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT13 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT57 \u2192 't12'\n- NT7 \u2192 't50'\n- NT28 \u2192 't55'\n- NT35 \u2192 't35' (but this can't be, unless it's a terminal)\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.

I'll try the top-down approach.\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42. So, S must expand into two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42. Each of these needs to be expanded into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with t10. So, in the expansion of NT18 or NT42, the first symbol is t10. Let me check the productions for NT18:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. So, NT18 can produce two non-terminals. The first is NT23, and the second is NT57.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 has several productions.

Let me check which production of NT42 starts with t.\n\nLooking at NT42's productions: There's NT42 -> 't27', so that's a rule where NT42 immediately becomes 't27'. So, if the first symbol is t27, then NT42 is 't27'. \n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t10, which doesn't match NT42's t27, so I must consider NT42's other productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

But wait, the string has t10, so perhaps NT26 can produce another non-terminal, but in the given string, the next symbol is t43, so maybe I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the productions for NT42.

NT23 expands to NT26 NT54, and NT54 is t33, which isn't t10. Alternatively, maybe NT18 can produce t10 elsewhere? Looking at NT18's productions, the only terminals are t10 and t18. But in the given grammar, NT18 can produce NT23 NT57, which don't produce t10. Wait, looking back, I see NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and NT23 -> NT26 NT54, which are both non-terminals except for NT26 and NT54.\n\nWait, NT26 appears in other productions. Let me check NT26's productions: NT26 -> t49 or NT27. Hmm, but the string has t10, so perhaps NT26 is t10? Let me check the given productions. Oh, wait, in NT26: NT26 -> t49 or NT27. None of these produce t10. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at NT42's productions: I see NT42 -> 't27' and others like 't42'. Are there any productions for NT18 that end with t10? Let me look at NT18's productions again.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. NT23's production is NT26 NT54, which are non-terminals except for NT26 and NT54. NT26 in the given grammar is NT26 \u2192 't49' or NT27. NT27 is another non-terminal. So, how do we get t10?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce t10. For example, NT10 -> 't43', but that's in another part of the grammar. Wait, let me look.\n\nIn the given grammar, NT2 -> 't28', which is in two places: NT2 -> 't28' and NT23 -> 't26'? No, wait, checking NT23: NT23 is either NT26 NT54 or something else. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 becomes t28 in one case, but in another, NT23 becomes t26? Or no, wait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminals that directly produce t10.\n\nLooking through the productions, I can see that NT8 \u2192 't54' and NT8 \u2192 't47' etc. Let me scan through all non-terminals and their terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals mentioned are t10, t28, t36, t47, t54, etc. Wait, looking for t10.\n\nI see NT10 \u2192 't43', which isn't t10. NT2 \u2192 't28', which is t28, not t10. NT4 \u2192 't9', not t10. NT5 \u2192 't40', no. NT7 \u2192 't7'? Or wait, looking for production rules where the non-terminal directly becomes t10.\n\nWait, I need to see if any non-terminal in the grammar directly expands to t10 as a terminal. Let's go through each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't54' and 't47'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't27', 't42', etc.\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't42', 't41'\n\nHmm, I think I overlooked that NT8 can sometimes produce t11? Wait, no, looking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49 and NT8 \u2192 't47' and 't4'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, some non-terminals produce t11:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT42 -> 't27', 't43', etc., NT27 is another.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has specific rules where each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit because all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC except for the terminals which are present as single symbols, like \"t10\".\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \"t10 t43 t28 t12 t57 t43 t43 t28 t51 t38 t27 t7 t10 t27 t12 t35 t51 t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t53\". I notice that this string is a sequence of terminal symbols and some non-terminals. My goal is to find a derivation that leads exactly to this string.\n\nFirst, I should look for non-terminals in the grammar. The given grammar only uses letters like S, N, T, and some numbers as terminals. Wait, no, actually all the non-terminals are two-digit numbers like S, NT18, NT5, etc. Because in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, so each rule is A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B and C are also non-terminals. The terminals are sequences of letters or 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. To parse it, I should see if each non-terminal can be expanded into the following symbols in the string.\n\nStarting from the top, the start symbol is S. The first rule for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So S is split into NT18 and NT42.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first two symbols are t10 and t43. But wait, the first part should be NT18 and NT42. So I need to check if NT18 can derive to t10 and t43, and NT42 can derive to t28 and something else? Wait, no, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it step by step. Each production in the grammar represents a step in the derivation. So starting from S, we replace S with NT18 NT42. Now, the string we have is \"nt18 nt42 ...\", so the first two non-terminals need to be expanded into the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t10 and t43, but NT18 and NT42 need to be expanded into some sequences. Let me check the productions for NT18 and NT42.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 can only split into NT23 and NT57. Then NT23 can split into NT26 NT54, right? Because NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So NT23 becomes NT26 NT54. Wait, but NT26 has a production NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT49. So that's getting more symbols.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should list out all the productions and see how each non-terminal can be reduced.\n\nWait, another approach is to check if each element in the string matches one of the terminals in the productions. Let me list all the productions with their left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) productions again to see which ones can match.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't35', which could generate t35. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 't47', t28, etc.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t10 and t43. Let me check if any non-terminals produce t10 or t43.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT26 \u2192 t49, NT28 \u2192 t50, NT4 \u2192 t9, NT5 \u2192 t40, and so on. But none directly produce t10 or t43. Wait, do any non-terminals produce t10 or t43?\n\nLooking through the rules, NT5: Hmm, no. Wait, let me go through each non-terminal and see their terminal productions.\n\nWait, NT2 \u2192 't28' and NT28 can derive to t50, but nowhere directly does a non-terminal produce t10 except in the productions of NT4: NT4 \u2192 t9. But does any non-terminal produce t10 directly? Wait, the initial S is NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT2: S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which is t10 is possible because NT2's production is 't28' but in NT42's production, there's a path leading to 't28'. But this is getting tangled.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it as a parsing problem. Each step in the derivation must produce a substring that matches a production's RHS.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to see what the full expansion could be. Since the grammar is small, maybe it's possible to list all possible expansion steps for a small string.\n\nThe string has 21 symbols, from t10 up to t53. Given that each production is two non-terminals on the RHS, except for the terminals, perhaps the string needs to be broken into segments corresponding to the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string: t10 t43 t28 t12 t57 t43 t43 t28 t51 t38 t27 t7 t10 t27 t12 t35 t51 t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t53. Wait, no, the string is 21 elements.\n\nWait, let me write it out clearly:\n\nt10 t43 t28 t12 t57 t43 t43 t28 t51 t38 t27 t7 t10 t27 t12 t35 t51 t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t53.\n\nWait, that's more than 21 elements. Let me recount: between the quotes, it's t10, t43, t28, t12, t57, t43, t43, t28, t51, t38, t27, t7, t10, t27, t12, t35, t51, t7, t10, t9, t11, t53, t53. That's 22 symbols.\n\nHmm, okay. So the string is 22 elements long. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of non-terminals and terminals must align in a certain way.\n\nIn a typical context-free grammar, a derivation starts with the start symbol and, at each step, replaces a non-terminal with its RHS. Each application of a production replaces one non-terminal with two others. So the total number of symbols increases by one with each step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is a single non-terminal. So for n steps, the total number of symbols would be 1 + n. For example, after one step (n=1), we have two symbols (N1 N2). After n steps, we have n+1 symbols.\n\nNow, if the final string has m symbols, then the number of steps taken should be m-1. So for a string of length 22, it would take 21 steps, meaning the parse would involve 21 productions.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps, but perhaps it's something to consider later.\n\nFirst, let's think about each non-terminal and see which production they might match.\n\nLooking at the string: t10 t43 t28 t12... and so on.\n\nLooking at NT10: Where does it appear? Looking through the grammar, NT10 \u2192 't43', which would generate t43. Also, NT28 \u2192 't50', so no, so maybe t10 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal except possibly via another production.\n\nWait, looking at NT53: It's in the productions as having 't51' and 't38' or something else? Let me see: from the grammar:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT53 NT45\n\nBut then NT45 is 't10'\u2014so wait, does that mean something's going on there?\n\nWait, maybe the string can be broken down into some substitutions. Let's try to start from the end and work backwards.\n\nLooking at the last part of the string: ...t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t53.\n\nSo, the last two symbols are t53 t53.\n\nLooking at NT53's productions: NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. Does that help? So t53 could come from NT53, which is derived from NT42 and NT38. Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the earlier parts, let's see.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is a single non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLet me start by understanding the structure of the grammar. The given grammar starts with S -> NT18 NT42. So, the entire string must start with the symbol corresponding to NT18 followed by NT42. I notice that NT18 can be replaced by NT23 NT57, which again can break down further until we get to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t54 t38 t27 t7 t10 t28 t12 t12 t35 t35 t6 t50 t6 t9 t6 t35 t12`. \n\nFirst, let's break down the grammar's start symbol S. It must expand into NT18 NT42. Let's see what each of these can generate.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 can go to NT26 NT54. NT26 is NT26 \u2192 NT49, and NT49 can be NT45 \u2192 t10 or another decomposition. Wait, let me check the productions again. Wait, NT26 \u2192 NT23? No, looking back, NT26 is actually \u2192 t49, not sure. Let me list the relevant productions.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that NT42 has several productions. For instance, NT42 can be NT42 \u2192 't27' (which is a terminal), or it can break down into NT2 \u2192 't28', NT4 \u2192 't9', etc. Similarly, NT18 can be 't10', and NT23 can break down into NT26 and NT54, which in turn can go to terminals or other non-terminals. \n\nWait, it's a bit confusing. Let's try to map this out. The string starts with t10. Let's check where t10 comes from. Looking through the productions, I see NT18 -> 't10', so maybe NT18 can be directly t10. Alternatively, if the string starts with t10, it could come from NT2's production: NT2 can be 't28' or decompose further. Let me check NT2. The productions for NT2 are: NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22, NT10 \u2192 't43', and NT22 can break down or go to t28.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t10, which is a terminal. Looking at the terminal productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\nNT42 \u2192 't27'\nNT43 \u2192 't38'\nNT54 \u2192 't33'\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\nNT38 \u2192 't51'\nNT51 \u2192 't7'\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\nNT47 \u2192 't21'\nNT40 \u2192 't6'\nNT35 \u2192 't35' (wait, not in the productions. Wait, NT35 isn't listed; maybe that's a typo. Let me double-check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT35 isn't present. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe it's another non-terminal? Or perhaps it's a mistake. Well, regardless, I need to see what terminals are present.\n\nIn the given string, t10, t43, etc., are terminals. So, to generate the string, the grammar must eventually produce these terminals in order.\n\nBut let's step back. The string starts with t10, t43, t43, etc. Let's check what comes after t10. Wait, the string is a list of terminals, so I need to see how the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT18 NT42. So, after expanding, the first symbols are from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the NT18 \u2192 't10' and the NT42 can expand. So if S expands directly into 't10' and whatever NT42 produces.\n\nBut wait, S is NT18 NT42, so both NT18 and NT42 must be expanded. The first token in the string is t10, which would correspond to NT18 producing 't10', and then NT42's expansion should produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut wait, the string after t10 is t43, t43, t43, t43, t43, t43, t54, t38, etc. So, after t10, we have six t43s, then t54, t38, t27, t7, t10, t28, t12, t12, t35, t35, t6, t50, t6, t9, t6, t35, t12. That's quite a long string, so S must expand to something that can generate that.\n\nBut S is NT18 NT42. So, suppose NT18 is 't10', and NT42 is 't43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t54 t38 t27 t7 t10 t28 t12 t12 t35 t35 t6 t50 t6 t9 t6 t35 t12'. But in the grammar, each step breaks down into two symbols, but terminals are produced directly.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar by checking each step.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to reverse engineer the parse tree. Let's see.\n\nThe first token is t10, which could be from NT18 -> 't10', so that's acceptable.\n\nNow, the next part is t43 repeated six times. Let's see how t43 can be generated. Looking at the grammar, NT43 is defined as \u2192 t38, but wait, actually looking at the grammar, I don't see NT43. Wait, looking back, the productions include NT43 \u2192 t38, and also NT45 \u2192 t10, etc.\n\nWait, the string has t43 appearing multiple times. Let me check if there's a production that can produce t43. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t43.

{"custom_id":"request-439","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to CFGs, but I'll try to figure this out. So, the task is to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t10 t43 t43 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t47 t33 t45 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t51 t6 t57 t23 t33 t21 t51`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two other non-terminals or terminals. The given grammar does follow that structure, as each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, which is allowed as it's a single terminal.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string to see if each terminal can be derived through the non-terminals as per the grammar. Alternatively, I can reconstruct the derivation tree from the string backward, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT18 NT42. So, the first step is to check if the string starts with 't10 t43 t43...'. Let's look at the production rules.\n\nLooking at NT18: the rule is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. This suggests a loop where NT23 and NT26 produce the same sequences. So, let me see what each of these resolves to.\n\nWait, but looking at the production rules, NT23 -> NT26 NT54. Then NT26 -> NT23 NT54. Hmm, that seems like an infinite loop if not handled properly. But in CNF, we usually derive a string by replacing non-terminals step by step until all are terminals. So, perhaps it's important to trace back the replacements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to reconstruct the derivation. The string starts with t10, which is a terminal. Let's find which non-terminal can produce t10. Looking at the rules, NT10 -> 't43' and NT26 -> 't23', but some others have t10.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions to know their possible sources:\n\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT2 -> 't28' and 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't9' and 't47'\n- NT8 -> 't54', 't49', 't47' etc.\n- NT58 -> 't42', 't41'\n- NT27 -> 't42', 't43'\n- NT9 -> 't40', 't28'\n- NT58 -> 't42', 't41' (also 't36')\n- NT42 has several terminals, like 't42' (so rule NT42 -> 't27' somewhere)\nWait, looking back, it's a bit confusing. Let me create a list of all terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nNT2 can produce 't28' (from rule NT2 \u2192 't28'), and also 't43' via some other rule. Wait, no. In the given rules, NT2 is defined as NT10 NT22, but also, the terminal 't28' comes from which non-terminal? Let me check each production:\n\nLooking at all the rules, the direct terminals are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' (from NT25 or similar? Wait, no. Looking at the rules, the terminal 't's are assigned to specific non-terminals:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' (the rule for NT2 is NT10 \u2192 't43'? Wait, no, checking each rule:\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules. Let me list the direct productions where a non-terminal directly results in a terminal:\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT2 -> 't28' [Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I see NT2 -> 't28'? Wait, the rules are from earlier:\n\nWait, in the user's message, looking at the terminal productions:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28' (I think I might have misread earlier). Let's check each rule line.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT9 -> 't40', 't28' (from \"NT9 -> NT40 NT28; NT9 -> 't35'? Wait no, let me list each rule:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT42\n2.

NT53 -> NT42 NT38\n21. NT9 -> 't35' (or wait, no: in the rules, is it a direct production or a transition? Let me parse each production line.\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nAt line 10: NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n\nWait, that's a production for NT9, which leads to NT40 and NT28. But in line 21: NT9 -> 't35'. So, actually, NT9 can produce either 't35' or NT40 NT28.\n\nSimilarly, checking other rules:\n\nLooking at line 14: NT28 -> NT4 NT40. So NT28 can produce NT4 and NT40, but also NT8 can produce other things.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Let me try to make a list of all terminal symbols and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, wherever a non-terminal is followed by '->' and a terminal, that's a production for that non-terminal into that terminal.\n\nSo, from the rules:\n\n1. NT5 \u2192 't40' (from NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT57 and NT23\u2192 't26' or so, but actually, this is one step production)\nNo, wait, NT5 can produce NT23 and NT57, which are non-terminals, but looking elsewhere, let's find direct terminals.\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' (from rule 8)\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' (from rule 6? No, rule 6 is NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22. Hmm, perhaps more accurate:\n\nWait, in the given rules, the non-terminals are followed by transitions to other non-terminals. But sometimes, a rule directly produces a terminal. For example, looking at the given rules, at line 21: NT9 \u2192 't35' (yes, line 21 says NT9 \u2192 't35'). So NT9 can produce 't35' or NT40 NT28.\n\nSimilarly, other rules produce terminals:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Line 10: NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- Line 21: NT9 \u2192 't35'\n\n- Line 5: NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- Line 7: NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- Line 15: NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- Line 23: NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n\nWait, this might take a long time, but perhaps it's better to note each non-terminal that can produce terminal symbols:\n\n1. NT5 \u2192 't40' (since line 10? No, line 10 is NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28.

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure this out. I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's in the language. The grammar is a bit complex, so I'll need to go step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all production rules start with non-terminals on the left side.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S. S \u2192 NT18 NT42. Both of these seem to be non-terminals, and in this case, they should expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nThe string to check is: `t10 t43 t11 t43 t11 t38 t43 t36 t21 t9 t43 t11 t12 t12 t7 t10 t43 t48 t11 t43 t11 t12 t51 t51 t12`.\n\nI notice that each 't' represents a terminal symbol, which is the actual letter in the string. The non-terminals are represented by NT followed by numbers, like NT10, NT18, etc.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards from the string, trying to see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will involve two non-terminals. I'll start from the beginning of the string and work towards the end or vice versa. Maybe it's easier to build a parse tree.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and their production rules to see which ones can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nFirst, focusing on the non-terminals that appear in the string: I see t10, t43, t11, t38, t36, t21, t9, t12, t51, t48, t51, etc. So the relevant non-terminals here are NT10, NT43, NT11, NT38, NT36, NT21, NT9, NT12, NT51, and NT48.\n\nLooking through the productions, let's write down the relevant ones:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT53\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT39 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT40 \u2192 NT6\n- NT38 \u2192 NT53\n- NT51 \u2192 NT7\n- NT48 \u2192 NT45\n- NT10 \u2192 NT43\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT13 \u2192 NT11\n- NT49 \u2192 NT45\n- NT27 \u2192 NT22 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT57 \u2192 NT31\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9\n- NT5 \u2192 NT40\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT43 \u2192 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT54\n- NT47 \u2192 NT21\n- NT38 \u2192 NT12\n- NT12 \u2192 NT12\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The grammar is a list of production rules starting with NT and some numbers. For example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, etc. So each production is of the form NTnumber \u2192 something.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should list each non-terminal and their possible productions.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nSo S can only start a string by producing NT18 and NT42. So the entire string must be a sequence of symbols starting with NT18 and NT42.\n\nNow, the string starts with t10, which is a terminal, so in the parse tree, the root must produce a string starting with t10. But S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so let's see what NT18 can produce.\n\nLooking for NT18's productions:\n\nIn the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, NT18 can only produce NT23 and NT57. Both are non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT42 \u2192 ... Looking at the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (repeated perhaps)\n- NT42 \u2192 ... wait, I need to list all NT42 productions.

The string I need to evaluate is `t10 t43 t43 t43 t54 t47 t9 t11 t7 t10 t43 t28 t35 t12 t12 t53 t57 t9 t11 t7 t10 t27 t12 t35 t53`.\n\nI should check if this string can be derived using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production leads to exactly two symbols, terminals or non-terminals. So, the string should have a length that's 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of non-terminals, but I don't know n here. Alternatively, I can see if each production leads to the correct terminals.\n\nThe strategy I'll use is to start with the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string by applying the productions step by step. Since the grammar is context-free, the string should be a leftmost derivation or any other derivation path.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is S -> NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols in the string should be the results of NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, the string starts with t10, but S produces NT18 and NT42. So, NT18 should produce something ending with t10, and NT42 should produce something ending with t42. Let me check the NT productions.\n\nFirst, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So, NT18 is a non-terminal. We need to see if NT18 can derive to something that ends with t10. Let's look at NT23: NT23 -> NT26 NT54. Then NT26. NT26 is given as 't49' according to the grammar, right? Wait, checking the productions: NT26 is 't49' yes. So NT26 is t49.\n\nThen NT23 would have to produce t49 and then NT54. NT54 is given as 't33'. Wait, the NT production for NT54 is 't33', so NT54 -> 't33', which is a terminal. So, NT23 would derive t49 and then 't33', making it t49 t33. But wait, in the string, the start is t10 t43..., but NT18 is trying to produce something starting with t23's output. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let me correct. Since S is the start, S -> NT18 NT42. So, the string should be NT18 NT42, but the string provided is a concatenation of terms like t10, t43, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me list all the productions for each NT.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is to map each production to their possible terminals and see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nFor example, the start symbol S is NT18 NT42. So, we can think of S as the concatenation of two non-terminals. The string being evaluated is a series of terminals, so each non-terminal must derive into a sequence of terminals.\n\nI should start from the end of the string and work my way back, since some chains can be longer. But perhaps a better approach is to try to see if each production step can match the string.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, each production is binary, so each step in the tree would split a node into two children, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization or recursive descent parsing would help, but since this is a manual process, let's see.\n\nLooking at the string, the initial symbols are t10, t43, t43, t43, t54, t47, t9, etc. Let's see if the productions can generate such a sequence.\n\nI need to see if there's a path for each production to reach the given string.\n\nFirst, let's see what the first two symbols are: t10 and t43. Let's assume that the first part of the string comes from NT18 and the second from NT42.\n\nSo, NT18 starts with t10? Or is it some other path.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for each NT:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nWait, the string starts with t10, which is a terminal. So, to produce a terminal, either it's directly a production or a non-terminal that eventually produces that terminal.\n\nLet me look at the non-terminals that can produce t10.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT40 -> t6, but that's a different terminal.\n\nWait, actually, I'm misreading. NT40 -> t6. But the string starts with t10, so I need to see if any NT can produce t10.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT10 -> t43\nNT2 -> t28\nNT4 -> t9\nNT5 -> t40\nNT7 -> t35\nNT8 -> t54\nNT9 -> t40\nNT11 -> t12\nNT12 -> t12\nNT13 -> t11\nNT18 -> t10\nWait, no: NT18 has a production to 't10'? Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I may have a mistake here. Let me go through each NT production:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT5 -> NT45 NT47\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n- NT10 -> t43\n- NT22 -> NT27 NT53\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nWait, I think I misread the earlier productions. Let me correct:\n\nLooking back at the grammar given:\n\nNT18 is NT23 NT57.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps the NT productions are as follows. Maybe I'm conflating NTs with A's. Alternatively, perhaps each NT is a non-terminal symbol, and each production for NT is a pair of NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, the initial part of the grammar was:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nThen, each NT seems to have a production like NT18 -> NT23 NT57, etc.\n\nSo, each NT is a non-terminal, and their productions are to other NTs or to terminals. For example, NT18 can be NT23 NT57, or other possibilities.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting NT9 as 't35', but actually, NT9 could derive to something else, and the actual production for NT9 could be to t35 as a terminal, or perhaps not.\n\nLet me try to tabulate each NT and its possible productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals (NTs) and their productions are as follows:\n\n- NT18: NT23 NT57\n- NT5: NT23 NT57 (wait, no, let me check the list again:\n\nWait, the production NT5 is written as NT23 NT47? Wait, no, let me rewrite all productions correctly.\n\nWait, given:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there are a lot of NTs: NT18, NT5, NT22, NT41, NT42, etc. So each NT has its own productions.\n\nI'll list all the Nts and their productions.\n\nContinuing:\n\nNT42: -> NT2 NT38, and also -> NT4 NT13.\n\nLooking back, NT42's productions: NT27->NT42...

{"custom_id":"request-479","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and 'a' is a terminal symbol. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t33 t31 t43 t27 t57 t28 t53 t7 t10 t43 t28 t53 t57 t28 t12 t7 t10 t21 t9 t43 t11 t51 t12 t51 t51`.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse this string step by step, trying to find a way to break it down according to the grammar rules. The grammar has a series of non-terminals that eventually produce terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers in this case. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which expands into NT18 NT42. So the initial step is that S produces two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42. The string starts with t23, which I notice appears multiple times. I think I should trace how these non-terminals produce their terminals.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. So NT18 is a non-terminal that splits into NT23 and NT57. Both are non-terminals that will further split. Let's see what happens when we look into these.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54. NT26 and NT54 are also non-terminals. NT26 may produce t49 or another non-terminal, and NT54 is t33.\n\nWait, NT54 actually has a production rule: NT54 -> t33. So when I see t23, it must come from NT23. Then, NT23 splits into NT26 and NT54. So the first part of the string would be NT23 (which is t23?), then NT26, then NT54 (which is t33).\n\nLooking at the string: the first part is t23 t33. So perhaps the first two non-terminals in the expansion are NT23 and NT54 (since NT54 is a terminal). \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's structure this. The start is S -> NT18 NT42. So the string must be built as NT18 followed by NT42. So the string is split into two parts: the left part from NT18 and the right part from NT42.\n\nLet's consider the string as two parts: the first part should be the expansion of NT18, and the second part the expansion of NT42. \n\nLooking at the first part: t23 t33 t31. Hmm, but maybe it's more complicated than that. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is built by recursively applying the production rules.\n\nAnother approach is to work backwards. Let's look at the last symbols of the string and see if they correspond to any production rules.\n\nThe string ends with ... t51 t51 t51. Let's look at the grammar. The non-terminal NT51 has a production rule: NT51 -> t7. Wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I have NT51 -> t7, which is correct. But the string has t51 multiple times at the end. Wait, that's not possible because NT51 only produces t7. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misreading the rules.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT51 -> t7, that's correct. So the only way to get t51 is through NT51, which directly produces t7, not t51. So if the string has t51 multiple times, it should come from NT51. So the end of the string is t51 t51 t51, which must be produced by NT51 three times. So each t51 is from NT51, which in turn must be found in the expansion of some non-terminal that produces NT51.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, all the non-terminals either produce terminals or other non-terminals. So, for example, NT51 is a terminal itself? Wait no, looking more carefully: the grammar has NT51 -> t7. So NT51 is a non-terminal that produces t7, not a terminal that produces itself. So the string ending with t51 is impossible because the rules don't have NT51 producing t51. So that would mean the string can't end with t51 because that's a terminal symbol, but NT51 doesn't produce it. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. The user provided the grammar rules, and here is the part for NT51: NT51 -> t7. So, yes, the only production for NT51 is to t7. Therefore, the string cannot have t51 because there's no way to get t51 from the grammar. So the presence of 't51' in the string is impossible, so the answer must be No.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Perhaps I misread some rule. Let me check again. Yes, in the production for NT51 -> t7, so no way to get t51. Therefore, the string contains t51, which is not allowed, so the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, is there another way? For example, is there any non-terminal that produces t51? Looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal expands to t51. All the terminals are like t35, t28, etc., but t51 is only produced by NT51, which only produces t7. So yes, t51 can only come from NT51, but NT51 can only produce t7, which is different.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains 't51', which is not possible.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't51', which cannot be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means it's structured in a specific way with production rules that have two non-terminals on the left or terminals on the left, etc. Since the grammar is given, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these rules step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, which directly produces NT18 NT42 according to the first rule. So S -> NT18 NT42. That means I need to break down the string into two parts: one starting with NT18 and the other with NT42. Let me write down the string as two separate parts.\n\nThe string is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t36 t43 t27 t38 t28 t53 t7 t10 t43 t36 t28 t12 t53 t53 t51 t12 t12 t35 t35 t12.\n\nWait, actually, I should think of this as a sequence of symbols, each being a terminal or non-terminal. So I need to parse the string into a sequence of these symbols. Let me list them out:\n\nt23, t33, t31, t43, t43, t43, t36, t43, t27, t38, t28, t53, t7, t10, t43, t36, t28, t12, t53, t53, t51, t12, t12, t35, t35, t12.\n\nSo S starts as NT18 NT42, meaning the string should start with a derivation that produces NT18 followed by NT42. Let's check:\n\nThe first token is t23. Now, looking at the grammar, t23 is defined as NT26 followed by NT54. Wait, but in the production rules, NT26 is 't49', so maybe not. Let me check where t23 is a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and also NT28 -> NT43 NT5, but I don't see t23 being a terminal. Hmm, this might be confusing.\n\nWait, in the production rules, some are direct terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't28', so 't28' is a terminal. Similarly, NT8 -> 't11', so 't11' is a terminal. So in the string, when I see a two-digit number, I need to check if it's a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT9 -> 't35', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT2 -> 't28', which is a terminal. Other terminals include t7, t10, t12, t23, t33, t36, etc. Wait, in the production rules, I see NT36 -> 't48', so 't48' is a terminal, but 't36' is a non-terminal? No, wait, in the production rules, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT4 -> 't9', so 't9' is terminal.\n\nWait, I need to map each terminal string in the production rules to their respective symbols. Let me list the production rules where non-terminals are followed by terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't54' (from NT8 -> NT54 NT49, but NT54 is a terminal 't33'? Wait no, looking at the rules: NT54 is 't33'? Or is it the other way around. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the rules are written as S -> NT18 NT42, which is a production from S to NT18 and NT42. Then, for each non-terminal, their rules are defined as a combination of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT2 -> 't28' is one of the rules. So whenever NT2 appears, it can be replaced by t28.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 -> 't9', so whenever NT4 is encountered, it becomes t9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t23. So I need to see if t23 is a terminal or a non-terminal. In the production rules, is t23 a terminal? Let me go through each production rule to see if any non-terminal directly produces t23.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal immediately produces t23. So t23 must be part of a larger structure produced by a non-terminal. Let me find which non-terminal produces t23. Looking through all the production rules, is there a rule that has t23 in it? For example, NT26 -> 't49' is a terminal, but t23 is not a terminal; so maybe t23 is derived from a non-terminal. Let me look for a production rule where t23 is part of the output.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT23 -> NT26 NT54. Neither NT26 nor NT54 are 't23'. Also, NT28 -> NT43 NT5, which doesn't involve t23. Wait, NT27 -> NT42 NT43, so no. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t23 is a non-terminal that can produce a string of terminals. For example, in the rules, the production for NT26 is 't49', which is a terminal. So perhaps there's a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach is to try to build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce the string. Starting with S = NT18 NT42.\n\nNow, let's break down NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT18's rule is NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nNT42 has multiple rules. Let's check: NT42 can produce NT42 -> NT4 NT13, or NT42 -> 't27', or NT42 -> 't2' (Wait, no, in the rules: NT42 -> 't27' is one production? Let me verify. Looking through the rules, yes, I see NT42 -> 't27' and NT42 -> 't43' and other options. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT22 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT53 -> etc. Wait, actually, looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nWait, let's list all the production rules for NT42.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT53 -> etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. To clarify, maybe it's better to list all production rules and see where NT42 appears.\n\nFrom the user's list:\n\nNT42 is given as:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nWait, no, that's NT27's rule.

The start symbol is S. The string we need to check is a series of terminals, so each step of the derivation must consume the entire string without non-terminals left.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols in the string must be t18 and t42. But wait, the first symbol is t10, not t18. That seems off. Did I get something wrong?\n\nLet me check the productions. S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, to get a string, it must start with nt18 and nt42, each starting with 't' followed by the number. But the first token is t10, which I don't see directly in any production, except maybe through chain rules.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, maybe some of the NT's can produce t10 or others. For example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and then NT57 \u2192 t31. Wait, no, actually, NT38 \u2192 t35, but looking through the productions, I'm trying to see where t10 comes from.\n\nWait, looking at the NT42 production: NT42 can go to NT4 NT13, but that\u2019s producing t4 and t13. Wait, and looking further down, NT42 also goes to t27 and t41? Or is there a typo? Wait, the productions given include:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 (twice), which must be a mistake. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, let me list the productions:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\n\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\n\nNT9 -> 't35'\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT43 -> 't57'\n\nNT45 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT38 -> 't51'\n\nNT51 -> 't7'\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nNT28 -> 't50'\n\nNT13 -> 't11'\n\nNT49 -> 't45'\n\nNT27 -> 't22'\n\nNT28 -> 't55'\n\nNT57 -> 't31'\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't9'\n\nNT5 -> 't40'\n\nNT36 -> 't36'\n\nNT43 -> 't47'\n\nNT42 -> 't54'\n\nNT47 -> 't21'\n\nNT38 -> 't12'\n\nWait, so looking at this, NT18 produces NT23 and NT57, and then eventually, NT23 \u2192 NT26 and NT54, which finally goes to 't49' and NT54 \u2192 't33'. So, NT18 can eventually produce 't10' through NT18 \u2192 NT18? No, wait. Let's see the chain.\n\nWait, the production NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, then NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT54 \u2192 't33'. So, this path would produce t33. But we need t10? How do we get t10?\n\nLooking at where t10 comes from. Checking the productions, NT18 \u2192 t10 is directly from NT18 -> NT18 -> ... Oh, wait, looking at the productions under NT18: It says NT18 -> NT23 NT57, and NT23 -> NT26 NT54, but wait, there's also NT8 -> 't11' and NT51 -> 't7'. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me see. NT51 \u2192 't7', which is NT51. But how do we get 't7' into the string? Let's look at the string again. The string starts with t10, t43, etc.\n\nWait, S starts with NT18 and NT42. So, the first two elements must be the results of NT18 and NT42. Let's see what NT18 can produce. From NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, then NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT54 \u2192 't33'. So, that path would give 't33' as the second symbol. But the first symbol is t10, so perhaps there's another path for NT18.\n\nLooking for NT18's other production. Oh, in the grammar, under NT18: Is there another production? Wait, no, all I see under NT18 is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, that's a binary split. So, NT18 starts by splitting into NT23 and NT57, then NT57 is a terminal t31. Wait, no, what exactly is NT18's production? Let me read carefully.\n\nLooking back at the production list:\n\n\"NT18 -> NT23 NT57\"\n\nThen, what about NT23? It says NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nSo, NT18 would produce a t57, not a t10. So how do we get a t10 as the first symbol?\n\nWait, looking at NT42: It goes to NT4 and NT13, but NT4 is NT8 and NT10. So NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10. So, NT8 can go to t11, and NT10? Wait, does NT10 have a production?\n\nLooking back, in the productions, I don't see NT10 having any productions. So, if we have NT10, it's a non-terminal that doesn't produce anything. That would mean it's a dead end unless it's a terminal somehow. But in the grammar given, none of the NTs other than those ending with t are terminals.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions for terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 (ends with t57)\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47 (t47)\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\nNT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13 (t4 is a terminal, but NT13 leads to t11)\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4 (t49 and t4 are terminals)\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\nNT9 -> 't35'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT42 -> 't27'\nNT43 -> 't57'\nNT45 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't33'\nNT38 -> 't51'\nNT51 -> 't7'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT26 -> 't49'\nNT49 -> 't45'\nNT27 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, the grammar is provided, along with a string, and I have to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form is. It's a way to write context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side. That should make it easier to parse the string because each step in the derivation would depend on the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which fits the first condition. Some, like NT2 \u2192 't28', are terminals, so they don't produce anything else. That's good because when parsing the string, we can match these terminals and move forward.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t49 t33 t31 t43 t36 t43 t43 t22 t43 t28 t6 t50 t12 t7 t10 t43 t48 t54 t51 t53 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12 t51 t53`. \n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals, so I can parse it by matching the non-terminals in the grammar to these terminals. The idea is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, to produce the string, S must first generate NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are 't49' and 't33'. Let me check if NT18 and NT42 can produce these.\n\nFirst, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Let me see what NT23 and NT57 can produce. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 is 't49' because NT26 \u2192 't49', which matches the first token 't49'. Then, NT54 \u2192 't33', which matches the second token 't33'. So, so far, S \u2192 NT18 NT42 can produce t49 t33. Good.\n\nNow, moving to the next token. The string is ... t33 t43 t36 t43 t43 t22 t43 t28... So, after NT23 and NT54, we expect NT57 to produce t33, which it does. So, now S is successfully producing the first part: t49 t33.\n\nNext, let's look at NT42. The production for NT42 is several options. Currently, I think the first option is NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13. Let's see what NT4 and NT13 produce. NT4 \u2192 't9', and NT13 \u2192 't11'. So, combined, NT4 NT13 would produce 't9 t11'. Hmm, but in the string, after 't33', the next token is 't43'. So, 't9 t11' isn't matching that. Maybe I picked the wrong production.\n\nWait, perhaps NT42 has another production. Let's check the options for NT42. The current choice I made was NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13, but in the grammar, I see that another production for NT42 is NT42 \u2192 't27', which is a terminal. So, maybe after S \u2192 NT18 NT42, NT42 can directly produce 't27', which would mean that the sequence would end there. But in our string, after 't33', the next token is 't43', so that doesn't fit. That means I must have taken the wrong production for NT42.\n\nHmm, so perhaps NT42 has another production. Looking back, I see that NT42 can go to 't54', or 't51', or 't47', or 't53', or 't27', or 't26'. Let's see, maybe I should check other productions for NT42.\n\nWait, is there a production where NT42 is replaced by NT27 or something else? Looking again, in the grammar, NT42 appears multiple times. Let me list all the productions for NT42:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22\n- NT42 \u2192 NT28\n- NT42 \u2192 't54'\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 NT47\n- NT42 \u2192 NT54\n- NT42 \u2192 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT51\n- NT42 \u2192 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT48\n- NT47 is a separate node, so it's a different non-terminal.\n\nHmm, so there are a lot of options for NT42. That complicates things because I have to choose the right path.\n\nWait, in the string, after t33, the next tokens are 't43', so looking at the production for NT42, perhaps in this case, after t33, NT42 must expand into something that starts with t43.\n\nLet me look at the options again for NT42.\n\nLooking for a production that starts with 't43'. So, among the productions for NT42, is there any that starts with 't43'? Yes: NT42 \u2192 't43' is not a direct terminal because looking at the grammar, I see that 't43' is the production for NT43, not NT42.\n\nWait, no. Let me check: NT43 \u2192 't33' or something?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT43 \u2192 't43' perhaps? Let's look: Yes, I see NT43 \u2192 't47' or other. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT43 is different. Let me check: \n\nLooking at the productions for NT43, it's listed as NT43 \u2192 't57' or 't47' or 't38'. Hmm, not directly 't43'.\n\nWait, actually, let's look more carefully. I have:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't47'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43' (Looking back: NT10 \u2192 't43')\nAh, okay, that's an important point. So, NT10 is another non-terminal that produces 't43'.\n\nSo in the string, when we encounter 't43', it can be produced by NT10 or perhaps by another NT that can produce it, like NT9 \u2192 't40' or NT8 \u2192 't11' or something else. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't11' is an option. NT10 \u2192 't43' is another.\n\nWait, let me make this clearer. So, starting from S, after producing t49 and t33, we now need to produce the 't43' that comes next. So, after NT57 (which is 't33'), we have NT42. NT42 \u2192 something that produces 't43'. So, is there a production for NT42 that can lead to 't43'?\n\nLooking at the NT42 productions:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22\n- NT42 \u2192 NT28\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13 (which is 't9' 't11')\n- NT42 \u2192 't27' (a terminal)\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22\n- NT42 \u2192 NT28\n- NT42 \u2192 't54'\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 NT47\n- NT42 \u2192 NT54\n- NT42 \u2192 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT51\n- NT42 \u2192 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT48\n- NT42 \u2192 NT53\n- Perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscopied the grammar earlier, but let's see. Wait, in the provided grammar, is there any production that leads to 't43' from NT42?

That's a long string with 30 symbols, which seems quite complex.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Parsing in CNF can be done using a recursive descent approach or using a simple stack-based method. Since the grammar is given, I can attempt to build a parse tree for the string by checking which production rules can derive a prefix of the string.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT18 NT42. So the first step is to see if NT18 can produce the first part of the string and NT42 can produce the remaining part.\n\nLooking at NT18, the production is NT23 NT57. So NT18 can't be a terminal yet. Similarly, NT42 has multiple productions; let's see:\n\nNT42 can be:\n- NT4 NT13\n- NT28 NT27\n- NT42 NT41\n- ... others that might reduce to terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a production for NT42 as 't27'. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, there is:\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nYes, so if NT42 is allowed to be 't27', then that's one way. But is that the only way? Let's see.\n\nBut wait, in the initial step, the start symbol is NT18 NT42, so both NT18 and NT42 need to produce something. So the first symbols in the string must come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Wait, the start symbol is S = NT18 NT42, which is two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will produce a sequence of symbols starting from their respective top-down productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider that the entire string must be generated by the start symbol S. Since S is NT18 NT42, the entire string must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT18 and NT42. So the string provided must be the concatenation of the string generated by NT18 and the string generated by NT42.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is generated by NT18, and the second part by NT42.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t10. Let's see which non-terminal can generate t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't10' is produced by NT26 (look at the production: NT26 -> 't49'), no, wait, wait. Let me check:\n\nLooking for symbols that produce t10:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43' (Wait, no, NT10-> 't43' is probably wrong. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I need to check each rule to see which non-terminals produce t10.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT53\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT5 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT38 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT10 -> 't43' (Wait, looking for terminals, 't10' isn't a terminal; the terminal production must be somewhere else.)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in CNF, all productions are in A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the terminal productions, which are either A -> a or A -> B, but in CNF, it should be A-> a, where a is a terminal or a single non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, A must expand to two non-terminals, so the only way to get terminal symbols is through direct productions.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except for the terminal symbols, which would be handled as individual rules. But wait, in the grammar provided, I see lines like 't10', which are terminals, so perhaps the grammar includes some productions where non-terminals are allowed to derive terminal symbols directly. Wait, but looking at the provided grammar, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol like 't10'. Each rule is of the form A\u2192BC, so all non-terminals must expand into two non-terminals.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check a few more rules:\n\nLooking for any 't' symbols on the left side. For example, NT2 -> 't28' is a production. So, NT2 directly produces 't28'. Similarly, other non-terminals directly produce 't' strings.\n\nSo, the grammar does have some non-terminals that produce terminal symbols. So, some rules like NT2 -> 't28' are present, which means NT2 can be replaced by the terminal 't28'.\n\nSo, when trying to parse, we can consume multiple steps by using these rules.\n\nSo, going back to the string. The first symbol is t10. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t10.\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\nLooking for where a non-terminal A has a production like A -> 't10'. But I don't immediately see any.\n\nWait, let me check each rule:\n\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT26 -> 't49' (Wait, no, I don't see NT26 producing 't10')\n- NT4 -> 't9' no\n- NT5 -> 't40' no\n- NT36 -> 't36' yes, but that's the same symbol, so perhaps that's allowed.\n- Wait, 't10' is a terminal that is produced by a non-terminal. Looking through, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't10', except perhaps in some production.\n\nWait, in production rules, for example:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43' \u2014 no\n- NT42 -> 't27' yes\n- NT43 -> 't47' no\n- Looking back at the grammar, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the rules and see which non-terminals produce t10.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43\n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT22 -> NT29 NT53\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10\n- NT5 -> NT40 NT28\n- NT38 -> NT51 NT45\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT43 -> 't47'\n- NT42 -> 't54'\n- NT22 -> 't55'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT13 -> 't11'\n- NT49 -> 't45'\n- NT27 -> 't22'\n- NT28 -> 't55'\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT36 -> 't36'\n- NT43 -> 't47'\n- NT42 -> 't54'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n- NT38 -> 't12'\n\nWait, I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string to evaluate is: `t10 t43 t43 t22 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t12 t35 t53 t7 t10 t43 t48 t54 t12 t12 t53 t53 t57 t27 t7 t10 t27 t51 t12`.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the grammar into its components. Each production rule is of the form X \u2192 Y Z or X \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The non-terminals include S, NT18, NT5, NT22, NT41, NT42, NT2, NT4, NT18, NT27, NT9, NT58, NT42, NT22, NT28, NT8, NT23, NT36, NT28, NT38, NT45, NT54, NT38, NT40, NT26, NT28, NT13, NT49, NT27, NT28, NT57, NT8, NT43, NT10, NT36, NT53, NT9, NT2, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT54, NT38, NT40, NT26, NT28, NT13, NT49, NT27, NT28, NT57, NT8, NT43, NT10, NT36, NT43, NT47, NT42, NT54, NT47, NT38, NT12.\n\nWait, that's a mix-up. Actually, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (NT) is on the left, followed by \u2192, and then either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I need to process the string step by step, seeing if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe string has a series of t and numbers, which are likely terminals. The approach is to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules, trying to match symbols and non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminals in the string: t10, t43, t43, t22, t43, t43, t48, t9, t11, t12, t35, t53, t7, t10, t43, t48, t54, t12, t12, t53, t53, t57, t27, t7, t10, t27, t51, t12.\n\nI notice that t12, t10, t22, t27 are among the terminals. Looking at the grammar, I'll check if these terminals are defined as non-terminals or are terminals. From the production rules, many non-terminals are used. For example, NT42 \u2192 t27, so t27 is a terminal. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 t28, and others.\n\nWait, let me check each rule to understand the terminals:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41: Both are non-terminals.\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13: Both non-terminals.\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT53: Both non-terminals.\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45: Both non-terminals.\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38: Both non-terminals.\n- NT2 \u2192 t28: T2 is a terminal, so t28 is a terminal.\n- NT4 \u2192 t9: So t9 is a terminal.\n- NT5 \u2192 t40: t40 is a terminal.\n- NT18 \u2192 t10: t10 is a terminal.\n- NT27 \u2192 t22: t22 is a terminal.\n- NT9 \u2192 t35: t35 is a terminal.\n- NT2 \u2192 t28: same as above.\n- NT8 \u2192 t54: t54 is a terminal.\n- NT23 \u2192 t26: t26 is a terminal.\n- NT8 \u2192 t47: t47 is a terminal.\n- NT36 \u2192 t48: t48 is a terminal.\n- NT28 \u2192 t43: t43 is a terminal.\n- NT38 \u2192 t51: t51 is a terminal.\n- NT40 \u2192 t6: t6 is a terminal.\n- NT26 \u2192 t23: t23 is a terminal.\n- NT28 \u2192 t50: t50 is a terminal.\n- NT13 \u2192 t11: t11 is a terminal.\n- NT49 \u2192 t45: t45 is a terminal.\n- NT27 \u2192 t22: same as above.\n- NT28 \u2192 t50: same as above.\n- NT57 \u2192 t31: t31 is a terminal.\n- NT8 \u2192 t11: same as above.\n- NT4 \u2192 t9: same as above.\n\nFrom the above, the terminals in the grammar are t10, t28, t4, t9, t40, t10, t22, t27, t35, t48, t54, t51, t6, t23, t50, t11, t45, t31, t11, t9. So in the string, t12, t10, t43, etc., are present. Wait, t10 is a terminal (since NT18 \u2192 t10). Also, t27 is a terminal (NT27 \u2192 t22). Hmm, wait, no: NT27 \u2192 NT22, which is a non-terminal. So NT27 is a non-terminal, so when the string has 't27', it must be terminal. But I don't see any production rules for t27, so that might be an issue. Wait, no, looking back, NT27 \u2192 t22, which is a non-terminal. So in the grammar, there's no rule for t22 as a terminal. So how does the string have 't27'? That would be a terminal that isn't defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT27 \u2192 t22, so t22 is a terminal? But in the grammar, there's no production for t22 as a terminal. Hmm, this might be an issue. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT53, which are both non-terminals. So t22 is not defined as a terminal; perhaps it's a typo or I misread. Alternatively, maybe 't27' is a terminal, but in that case, the grammar doesn't have a rule for t27 \u2192 anything, so it's invalid.\n\nThis seems confusing. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that t12, t10, t43 are terminals. But looking at the grammar, t43 is defined as NT43 (e.g., NT43 \u2192 t47), so t43 is a terminal. Similarly, t10 is a terminal because NT18 \u2192 t10.\n\nLet me list all the terminals present in the string and see if they are defined as terminals in the grammar:\n\n- t10: Defined by NT18 \u2192 t10. So yes.\n- t43: Defined by NT43 \u2192 t47. Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have mixed up NT43 and t43. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t47, and NT43 \u2192 t47 as well. So t47 is a terminal. So t43 is a non-terminal (since NT43 \u2192 NT8 NT4), which would be t47 and t9?\n\nWait, no, NT43 \u2192 t47 would make t47 a terminal resulting from NT43. But in the string, there's a 't43', which would have to be a terminal if that's the case, but in the grammar, NT43 is a non-terminal producing other things. So perhaps there's confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, the string has 't43' as a terminal, but perhaps it's actually part of a production.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t43 t22 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t12 t35 t53 t7 t10 t43 t48 t54 t12 t12 t53 t53 t57 t27 t7 t10 t27 t51 t12.\n\nI need to match this to the deriv"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing, though I'm not using a parser here. Instead, I'll analyze the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, let me write down the string to make it easier to process:\n\nt49 t33 t31 t43 t36 t43 t36 t43 t36 t43 t43 t22 t54 t7 t10 t54 t12 t6 t47 t23 t33 t21 t53 t53 t53 t12 t12 t12 t51.\n\nEach symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal or terminal as per the grammar. Remember, terminals are those that directly produce the string characters, while non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals expand into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT8 can expand into NT54 NT49, which are both non-terminals, or into NT47 NT4, which is a mix, etc.\n\nMy approach will be to see if the string can be traced back through the grammar. Since the grammar is CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, which might indicate that each step of the string generation would produce exactly two symbols. However, the input string length is odd (31 symbols), which might suggest it's generated by an odd number of productions, but that might not be directly relevant here.\n\nI'll start by looking at the last symbol and see if it can be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. The last symbol is t51. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT51 -> 't7'. So 't51' is a terminal and directly corresponds to NT51.\n\nLooking before that, the second last symbol is t12. Checking which non-terminals produce t12. Let's see:\n\nNT53 -> 't53' and 't38' (from NT42 -> NT42 NT41, but wait, looking for NT that produce t12. Checking all rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT45 -> 't10', so no. NT53 -> 't48' (no), NT57-> 't31', NT38->'t53', NT43->'t38', NT42->'t27', NT22->'t9', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking for non-terminals that directly produce 't12':\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT23->'t23' (no), NT29 (not present), wait, let me see all rules. Oh, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT12 isn't defined, so maybe t12 comes from another non-terminal. For example, NT22->'t9' (no), NT28->'t50' (no). Wait, perhaps NT42 has a rule that includes t12.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41 (first one) or others. Wait, in the production rules, when looking for t12, perhaps NT27 -> NT42 NT43. Then in NT43, perhaps produces something that includes t12.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this from the top-down. Let me pick the start symbol S and see how it could derive the string. But this might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can process the string symbol by symbol, checking at each step which rule could generate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string using the grammar, symbol by symbol, trying to find which non-terminals can produce the sequence step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps I should look for patterns or repetitions. For example, the string starts with t49, which corresponds to NT49 -> 't49' according to the rules: NT49 -> 't49'. So the first symbol is directly generated by NT49.\n\nAfter t49, the next is t33. Let's see if any non-terminals produce t33. Looking through the rules:\n\nI see that NT38 -> 't53' and 't38', but not t33. Wait, NT36->'t36', which is a terminal, but no. Hmm. Wait, checking all the rules, looking for NT that produce 't33':\n\nLooking, I don't recall any. Wait, no, actually, in the rules:\n\nNT54->'t54', NT42->'t27', no. Wait, let me check all the NT rules to see if any produce 't33':\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly results in 't33'. Wait, but perhaps 't33' is part of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking at NT54 -> 't33'; yes, there's that rule. So t33 is a terminal and is directly produced by NT54.\n\nWait, so the second part is, after t49 comes t33, which is NT54 -> 't33'. So that would fit.\n\nNow, preceding t49 is 't49' (from NT49), then 't33' (NT54). So in the grammar, is there a rule that connects NT49 and NT54 to something that can produce the next part of the string?\n\nWait, looking for a production where NT49 and NT54 are part of the expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most rules are of the form A->BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So the two symbols t49 t33 would correspond to the expansion of a non-terminal into NT49 NT54, but looking for rules where A expands into NT49 and NT54. I don't recall such a rule. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules again, for example:\n\nNT42-> 't27', but that's a terminal. There's no rule that expands NT49 or NT54 into anything else except terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe t49 and t33 are part of a non-terminal's expansion, such as a non-terminal that's not directly a terminal but expands into these. Alternatively, maybe the string is longer, so each production can produce two symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically. Let me try to see what the possible derivations could look like.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check the counts of certain symbols. For example, since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces a non-terminal into two non-terminals, leading to a doubling of non-terminals. However, this might not directly help for a specific string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check for the sequence of symbols and see if each can be linked via the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the string represents a step-by-step expansion. Let me try to see if each symbol can be produced directly by a non-terminal or if it needs to be part of a production.\n\nFor example, the first symbol t49 comes from NT49. The second symbol t33 comes from NT54. So if NT49 NT54 were to produce t49 t33, but looking for a rule where a non-terminal expands into NT49 and NT54. Let's check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any A -> B C where B and C are NT49 and NT54? From the rules, I don't see such a production. The rules are mostly A-> BC where B and C are non-terminals, but specific to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT49 and NT54 are both terminals, but no\u2014looking back, I see NT49 is a non-terminal that produces only t49, and NT54 is a non-terminal that produces t54. Both are terminals, so their combination would just produce t49 t54, but in the string, it's t49 t33. So something is wrong. Because NT54 -> 't54', not 't33'. Wait, so perhaps I was mistaken earlier.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules. Looking for any rule that produces t33:\n\nFrom the rules, I see NT36 -> 't36', etc. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, looking at the rules as provided:\n\nWait, in the user's message, they provided a lot of rules.

{"custom_id":"request-539","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the grammar is provided, and the string is quite long. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol does not produce the empty string.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I can see that it's in CNF because all the rules on the left-hand side (LHS) are a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42 has two non-terminals on the RHS. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 is two non-terminals, and some of them, like NT2 \u2192 't28', are terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t43 t43 t27 t38 t43 t43 t27 t38 t54 t7 t10 t54 t12 t6 t21 t21 t9 t43 t43 t6 t53 t7 t10 t9 t11 t12 t35 t12`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I should try to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to this string. Alternatively, since the string consists of terminals, I can try to break it down into segments that match the terminals given in the productions.\n\nLet me list all the production rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal because those are the leaf nodes of the parse tree. These will help me identify possible splits in the string.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal productions are:\nNT2 \u2192 t28\nNT4 \u2192 t9\nNT5 \u2192 t40\nNT8 \u2192 t54, t47, t11\nNT9 \u2192 t35, t40, t11, t43\nNT10 \u2192 t43\nNT18 \u2192 t10\nNT22 \u2192 t23, t9\nNT23 \u2192 t26, t54\nNT26 \u2192 t49\nNT27 \u2192 t22, t43\nNT28 \u2192 t4, t50, t38\nNT36 \u2192 t48, t53\nNT38 \u2192 t51, t36, t12\nNT42 \u2192 t18, t41, t2, t27, t43, t47\nNT43 \u2192 t12, t38, t47, t55\nNT44 is not present, wait, looking back, NT42 is one, but I see NT42 appears multiple times.\n\nWait, I think I need to make a list of all the terminal productions to match against the string.\n\nLet me list all terminal productions and the symbols they produce:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT8 \u2192 t54, t47, t11\n- NT9 \u2192 t35, t40, t11, t43\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT22 \u2192 t23, t9\n- NT23 \u2192 t26, t54\n- NT26 \u2192 t49\n- NT27 \u2192 t22, t43\n- NT28 \u2192 t4, t50, t38\n- NT36 \u2192 t48, t53\n- NT38 \u2192 t51, t36, t12\n- NT42 has several: t18, t41, t2, t27, t43, t47\n- NT43 \u2192 t12, t38, t47, t55\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n- NT53 \u2192 t42, t38\n- NT58 \u2192 t42, t41\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT57 \u2192 t42, t51\n- NT38 \u2192 t51, t36, t12 (duplicate)\n- Wait, some of these might have typos. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT42 has multiple rules, so for example, NT42 can be t18, t41, t2, t27, t43, t47. But in the string I have, I see t2, t43, t47 appearing multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 can produce t12, t38, t47, t55.\n\nI need to map each part of the string to these terminals. Maybe it's helpful to look at the string and see which parts correspond to these terminal productions.\n\nThe string is:\nt10 t43 t43 t27 t38 t43 t43 t27 t38 t54 t7 t10 t54 t12 t6 t21 t21 t9 t43 t43 t6 t53 t7 t10 t9 t11 t12 t35 t12\n\nI should first check if the entire string can be broken down into the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to parse this string step by step, trying to find the longest possible matches from the end, maybe using a recursive descent approach or CYK parsing.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if there's a leftmost derivation possible.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t10. Looking at the terminal productions, NT10 produces t43. So t10 corresponds to NT10 \u2192 t43. So the first part is NT10, which is t43.\n\nSo position 0: t10 is NT10 (which is t43).\n\nWait, no, the production is NT10 \u2192 t43. So when we have t10, the rule is NT10 \u2192 t43, but since in the parse tree, NT10 would produce t43. However, in the string, the first symbol is t10, which would mean that NT10 is applied, and then t10 is replaced by NT10, which then becomes t43, but that would not make sense because the string starts with t10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIn the grammar, NT10 \u2192 t43, which means that wherever there's NT10, it can be replaced by t43. So if the string starts with t10, which is a terminal, then how does that fit into the grammar? Unless perhaps there's a non-terminal that produces t10. Wait, looking back, NT18 \u2192 t10, so perhaps it's easier if I think about NT18.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the string is t10. Looking at the terminal productions, NT10 \u2192 t43, NT18 \u2192 t10. So, t10 must come from NT18.\n\nSo the first part is NT18 \u2192 t10. So t10 is produced by NT18. So after replacement, the string starts with t10.\n\nWait, no. If the string is t10, then in the derivation, the start symbol S must expand to something that starts with t10. So the first step would be to have S \u2192 NT18 NT42, as per the first rule.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThen, NT18 \u2192 t10, and NT42 would be another part that needs to derive the rest of the string. Wait, but then the string starts with t10, but NT18 can only produce t10 as a terminal, which is fine because the string starts with t10.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let's try to model this.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThen, NT18 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo the first symbol t10 is matched. Now, the remaining string (after t10) is 't43 t43 t27 t38 t43 t43 t27 t38 t54 t7 t10 t54 t12 ...'\n\nThe next symbol is t43. Looking at the rules, which non-terminals produce t43?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t23, t9 (no)\n- NT23 \u2192 t26, t54 (no)\n- NT26 \u2192 t49 (no)\n- NT27 \u2192 t22, t43.

NT26 \u2192 t49, and that's it. So, if the string starts with t49, that comes from NT26, then after that, we need to produce t33 and t31 somehow.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the largest possible units first.\n\nWait, the string has 't31' at position 3. NT57 is the only non-terminal that produces 't31' (NT57\u2192t31).

{"custom_id":"request-558","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of production rules that define how non-terminal symbols can be expanded into other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). The string I need to evaluate is: `t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t27 t53 t6 t9 t6 t6 t57 t40 t6 t47 t49 t33 t21 t6 t21 t21 t21 t9 t43 t43 t43 t6 t53`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Since it's in CNF, each production rule on the left-hand side (LHS) side is a single non-terminal symbol on the left, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals. The exception could be the base case when a non-terminal is directly connected to a terminal, but in CNF, that's allowed as well. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

The string has a lot of 't' symbols with numbers, so I can map each 'tX' to the respective non-terminal or terminal using the rules.\n\nThe string is: `t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t27 t53 t6 t9 t6 t6 t57 t40 t6 t47 t49 t33 t21 t6 t21 t21 t21 t9 t43 t43 t43 t6 t53`\n\nI notice that every other element is a 'tX' that can be a terminal or a non-terminal. To start, the first symbol in the string is 't10', which, according to the rules, corresponds to NT10. Checking the rule for NT10: NT10 \u2192 't43'.\n\nSo, 't10' expands to 't43'. Now, the next symbol in the string is 't43'. But wait, in the original string, after 't10' comes 't43', so it's like T10 followed by T43. However, in the grammar, T10 is a terminal symbol (as per NT10 \u2192 't43'), so this would imply that the second symbol is generated by NT10, but NT10 \u2192 't43', not another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string as a series of symbols that need to be matched by the grammar. Let me try a different approach: perform a top-down parse starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the first expansion must be S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nThus, the string should start with NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't10', which we know is NT10 (from NT10 \u2192 't43'). Hmm, but S's first production is NT18 NT42, so the first part would be NT18 and the second NT42.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is 't10', which is a terminal, so that would correspond to NT10, not NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Maybe I should reevaluate how each 'tX' maps back to non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, each 'tX' is either a terminal or can correspond to a non-terminal. Let me create a mapping from each 'tX' to the rule that produces it.\n\nFor example, t10 is the result of NT10 \u2192 't10'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some rules have the RHS as a terminal, e.g., NT26 \u2192 't49', etc.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar to correctly map each 'tX' to its production.\n\nEach non-terminal can produce a terminal or non-terminals. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- And so on.\n\nBut, some rules have the production mapping to a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT43 \u2192 't57'\n- etc.\n\nSo, each terminal can be obtained by a non-terminal which has a production to that terminal. So, to parse the string, I need to match the symbols generated by the grammar.\n\nPerhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their possible productions that produce certain terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to map each terminal 'tX' to the specific production rule that yields it. For instance, t27 comes from NT42 \u2192 't27', which is the production.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, we can track which non-terminal it originates from and then work backwards.\n\nLet me consider the given string again:\n\nt10, t43, t43, t43, t43, t43, t48, t27, t53, t6, t9, t6, t6, t57, t40, t6, t47, t49, t33, t21, t6, t21, t21, t21, t9, t43, t43, t43, t6, t53.\n\nI think the parsing approach would involve recursively applying the productions of the grammar to see if the string can be generated.\n\nHowever, given that this is a time-consuming process for such a long string, perhaps I should look for patterns or possible conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each symbol in the string can be associated with a production rule.\n\nLet me take the first symbol: 't10'. Looking back at the rules, 't10' comes from NT10 \u2192 't10' (from the rule NT10 \u2192 't40'? Wait, no. Wait, in the given rules, I think NT10 \u2192 't43' is not correct because looking at NT10: \"NT10 -> 't43'\". So, NT10 is a non-terminal that produces 't43', meaning that 't10' cannot be directly generated by NT10 because 't10' would be from some other production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is provided with various production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form has production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The string to check is t23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t22 t43 t54 t47 t9 t11 t7 t10 t21 t11 t43 t43 t11 t51 t53 t7 t10 t21 t11 t43 t43 t11 t51 t6 t55 t51.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the string must begin with something derived from NT18 and NT42. Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t23 and t33. I check the production rules for NT18 and NT42. From NT18, the only production is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. And for NT42, the production can be NT42 \u2192 NT27 NT43 or NT42 \u2192 't27'. Wait, NT42 itself has multiple rules, so I need to see which one is taken first.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t23, which suggests that NT18 must produce something that starts with t23. Let's see: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, what's the path for NT23? Looking at the rules, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So, NT23 is non-terminal and needs to split further. This feels a bit deep; maybe I should backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first rule applied is NT42 \u2192 't27'. Wait, NT42 can produce 't27' as one of its rules. So, if S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and then NT42 \u2192 't27', then the first part of the string could be 't27', but the given string starts with 't23'. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check: the first token is t23. Let's look at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, the first element derived from NT18 would be NT23, which then must derive to t23. Let's see how NT23 is produced.\n\nLooking at NT23: it has a production rule NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. But both NT26 and NT54 are non-terminals, so they need to split further. NT26 \u2192 't49' and NT54 \u2192 't33'. So, if NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, then it would produce 't49 t33', but wait, the string's first token is t23, not t49 or t33. So that suggests that perhaps the initial step is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong direction. Let's approach it differently. The string starts with t23, which suggests that in the parse tree, the first leaf is t23. Looking at the grammar, which rules produce t23? From the given rules, t23 appears in NT51 \u2192 t7, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT4. Hmm, wait, looking at the rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nWait, so NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and then NT26 \u2192 t49 and NT54 \u2192 t33, so the sequence would be t49 t33. But the string starts with t23, so that can't be it. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let's check each non-terminal to see where 't23' appears. Looking through the provided rules, the non-terminal NT18 has a production where NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, maybe the start of the string is derived from NT18, which produces NT23 and NT57. Then, NT23 produces t23, and NT57 might produce t31. Let me check NT57's production.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT57 \u2192 t31. Yes, there's a production rule NT57 \u2192 't31'. So, if S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and then NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, this part would produce t23 and t31. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are t23 and t33, but according to this, NT57 \u2192 t31, not t33. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the tokens. The string is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t22 t43 t54 t47 t9 t11 t7 t10 t21 t11 t43 t43 t11 t51 t53 t7 t10 t21 t11 t43 t43 t11 t51 t6 t55 t51.\n\nSo, t23 is at position 1, t33 at 2, etc. So if NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 and NT57 \u2192 't31', then the first part of the string should start with t23 t31, but in the string it's t23 t33. So that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT57 \u2192 t33? Let me check the provided rules again. Looking through the rules, NT58 \u2192 t42 t41, but that's not relevant. Wait, let me make sure I transcribed all the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT57's productions: only NT57 \u2192 't31' is listed.\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't51'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't54' 't49'\n\nWait, looking again, let me list all rules that produce t's:\n\n- NT53 \u2192 't42' 't38'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't10' 't21' (Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT21 \u2192 't21', but that's a non-terminal? No, perhaps I got confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals in the rules. Let me go through each production and note terminal symbols:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't40' 't28'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't51'\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't7'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't54'\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't21'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't12' (I think that's the end of NT12)\n\nWait, so the terminals are t's followed by numbers. Each production either is a terminal or further splits into non-terminals.\n\nSo, when trying to match the string, some symbols in the string must be directly produced by non-terminals, and others must be results of further splits.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t23, so at some point, a non-terminal must produce t23.

Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. This structure is helpful for parsing because it limits the ways non-terminals can expand.\n\nNow, the grammar given has several non-terminals and productions. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to see if the string provided can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t12 t57 t28 t53 t7 t10 t27 t12 t6 t55 t6 t50 t6 t9 t6 t12`.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Since CNF productions result in exactly two non-terminals in each step, except for the terminals which are the base case, I might need to split the string into parts that fit these productions.\n\nLet me list out the productions again for clarity:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't57'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't51'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't38'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT40 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't50'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't45'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't55'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't54'\n\nNT47 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't12'\n\nOkay, so any production ending with a terminal is a leaf in the parsing tree. Let me try to start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is t49. Looking at the productions, t49 comes from NT8 via NT8 \u2192 t11, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, NT8 has multiple productions. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT8 \u2192 t11, but that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I should look for all terminals in the productions.\n\nWait, let's list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT4 \u2192 t9\n\nNT5 \u2192 t40\n\nNT9 \u2192 t35\n\nNT22 \u2192 t22 (but NT22 isn't a terminal, it's a non-terminal because it has productions)\n\nWait, no. NT2 is a non-terminal, but it's productions include terminals like t28. So in the grammar, NT2 can produce t28.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing non-terminals and terminals here. The left-hand side is non-terminals, but the right-hand side can have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So looking back, the productions where the right-hand side is just a single terminal are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT4 \u2192 t9\n\nNT5 \u2192 t40\n\nNT9 \u2192 t35\n\nNT22 \u2192 t22 (but that's a non-terminal, so that's not a terminal. Wait, that can't be right because as a production, it's not a terminal production if it still has non-terminals on the right side. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, for example, NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53 is a production, so the right-hand side is still non-terminals. The productions that produce terminals are those where the right-hand side is just a single terminal. So, for example, is there any production where the RHS is a single terminal symbol?\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4 \u2192 looking, no.

Hmm, the grammar is provided with various non-terminals and terminals, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like all the production rules are in the form of A \u2192 BC, which is Chomsky Normal Form. Each non-terminal (like S, NT1, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals or a terminal. My task is to see if the given string can be generated by starting from the start symbol (which seems to be S) and applying these productions.\n\nThe string is: `t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t54 t47 t54 t7 t10 t43 t22 t43 t22 t43 t36 t27 t53 t51 t7 t10 t27 t51 t51 t7 t10 t27 t53 t12 t12 t35 t53`.\n\nWait, actually, I notice that each production has exactly two parts, either non-terminals or terminals. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production results in exactly two symbols, so the length of the string generated by the grammar should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. But the string given has 37 symbols, which is an odd number. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, so 37 isn't a power of two. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me count the tokens again:\n\nt49, t33, t31, t43, t43, t54, t47, t54, t7, t10, t43, t22, t43, t22, t43, t36, t27, t53, t51, t7, t10, t27, t51, t51, t7, t10, t27, t53, t12, t12, t35, t53.\n\nYes, that's 37 tokens. But if each step doubles the length, starting from 1 (the start symbol S), then after n steps, the length is 2^n. 37 isn't a power of two, so that's a red flag. Maybe the string isn't in the language, but I need to check further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to parse the string without considering the structure, but given the grammar's rules, I should look for specific expansions. Let me check each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT42 can produce some terminals.

Let me approach this differently. I'll list all production rules for each non-terminal, focusing on the ones that produce terminals because the string consists of terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the ones that directly produce terminals are:\n\nNT42 \u2192 t27\nNT42 \u2192 t42\nNT42 \u2192 t43\nNT42 \u2192 t54\nNT42 \u2192 t57\nNT42 \u2192 t2\nNT42 \u2192 t38\nNT42 \u2192 t7\nNT42 \u2192 t10\nNT42 \u2192 t43\nWait, perhaps I should go through each line and note when a non-terminal directly expands to a terminal.\n\n1.

But each production is of the form A\u2192BC, so each rule's RHS is two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal produces a terminal? Or wait, in the rules provided, all are A\u2192BC, where B and C can be either non-terminals or terminals. So for example, NT42 can sometimes produce a terminal. \n\nWait, looking again, perhaps some rules have terminals on the right-hand side. For example:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 t27\nYes, I see in the rules, some lines have a single terminal, but that's not possible in CNF, which is a binary tree, so each rule is A\u2192BC, meaning two symbols.

Each rule is followed by a string that might represent the final terminals. For example, I notice that some NTs directly expand into terminal symbols, which are the 't' words.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems that the start symbol is S, which expands to NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the concatenation of whatever NT18 expands to and NT42. Let me check what NT18 and NT42 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT42 can expand in multiple ways. One is NT42 -> NT4 NT13, another is NT42 -> 't27'.\n\nWait, so NT42 can generate either a sequence of NTs or directly a terminal.

Let's expand NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT26 -> t49\nNT54 -> t33\nSo NT23 becomes t49 t33.\n\nNow, NT57 -> t31.\n\nSo NT18 expands to t49 t33 t31.\n\nNext, NT42 can be either a terminal or more NTs. Looking at the expansion, one possibility is NT42 -> 't27'. So if NT42 is expanded to 't27', the string after NT18 would be 't27'.\n\nPutting it together: NT18 NT42 would expand to t49 t33 t31 t27.\n\nBut the given string starts with t10, while this gives t49 t33 t31 t27, which doesn't match t10. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong path. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way NT42 can be expanded.\n\nWait, NT42 can also expand into other non-terminals. Let's check if NT42 can lead to t10. Looking back, I notice that some NTs directly expand to t10. For example, NT10 -> 't43' (I think I might have missed this earlier). Wait, checking the rules:\n\nI don't see NT42 -> 't27' and other terminals. Let me verify each rule carefully.\n\nAh, here's a rule: NT42 -> 't27'. But also, NT42 -> NT4 NT13. Hmm, but I don't see a rule for NT42 that gives t10 directly. Let me scan all the NT rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, here's a rule: NT2 -> 't28'. Another: NT4 -> 't9'. NT5 -> 't40'. NT27 -> 't22'. Wait, also NT9 -> 't35', and NT27 -> 't42 NT43' which expands to t42, t43, etc. It's getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, the string starts with t10. Let me see if any non-terminal directly expands to t10. Looking through the rules, looking for a rule where something expands to t10. Hmm, here's a rule: NT53 -> NT42 NT38. But that might not help. Or NT10 -> NT43. Or wait, wait: looking through, do any NTs directly produce t10?\n\nLooking again: NT2 -> t28. NT4 -> t9. NT5 -> t40. NT10 has a rule NT10 -> 't43'. NT26 -> 't49'. Wait, wait: looking for 't10', perhaps in the expansion of some NT rule. Let me check the entire list again.\n\nWait, here's a rule: NT40 -> 't6'. NT13 -> 't11'. So that's not t10. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the NT18 expansion is correct as t49 t33 t31, and then NT42 can expand to t27, which would give t49 t33 t31 t27. But the string starts with t10, so that path doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way for NT18 and NT42 to expand.\n\nLooking back: S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57. Let's expand NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT26 -> 't49'\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nSo NT23 becomes t49 t33.\n\nNT57 -> 't31'\n\nSo NT18 becomes t49 t33 t31.\n\nNow, NT42 can expand to t27 or to other NTs. Let's see if there's a way to get 't10' somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe NT5 expands into t43, or look for t10 later on.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find a way to have NT42 expand to t27, and then maybe NT18 contributes to something else. But that would give t49 t33 t31 t27 at the start, which doesn't match t10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t10, so perhaps S contributes something else. Wait, maybe S is split into different parts.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is a series of t's and numbers. Perhaps the first part is 't10', so let's look for a production that starts with t10.\n\nLooking through all the rules, does any production start with 't10'? Looking at the rules, I see NT26 -> 't49', NT4 -> 't9', etc. Wait, maybe a higher-level NT expands into t10.\n\nWait, looking through, I don't see any direct expansion of an NT into t10. Maybe t10 isn't directly an NT terminal, but derived through another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and I can break it into smaller chunks to see how they fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with 't10 t43 t43 ...', so maybe it's generated by a substitution starting from S somehow reaching that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parsing problem, trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated by the grammar based on the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated because the initial steps are possible, but then later steps get stuck. For example, maybe the first part of the string is 't10', but in the grammar, how can we get t10?\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT27 -> 't22', and NT28 -> 't50', etc. Wait, perhaps another approach: the string is a long sequence, maybe it's built by using certain NTs that can produce sequences of t's.\n\nWait, another idea: let me try to parse the string using the given grammar.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t43 t43 t48 t43 t43 t43 t9 t11 t57 t27 t7 t10 t43 t48 t9 t11 t12 t53 t53 t6 t50 t35 t53 t53 t6 t50 t6 t38 t40 t51.\n\nLet me see if I can break it down.\n\nLooking for the start symbol S, which is NT18 NT42. Let's see what NT18 and NT42 can generate.\n\nFirst, split the string into parts where each part could be produced by NT18 and NT42.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is built by expanding NT42 as 't27' and seeing if the rest can be derived.\n\nWait, let's try to see what the first few tokens might come from.\n\nIf NT42 expands to 't27', then after the initial part from NT18, which we thought was t49 t33 t31, followed by t27, that gives t49 t33 t31 t27, but the string starts with t10.

{"custom_id":"request-616","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Additionally, there are no epsilon productions, and the start symbol does not appear on the right side of any production. I should check if the given grammar adheres to these rules, but the user is presenting it as CNF, so I'll assume they're correct in that aspect.\n\nNow, the given string to evaluate is:\n\n`t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t51 t35 t6 t9 t6 t51 t38 t43 t54 t57 t9 t11 t7 t10 t54 t12 t53 t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t53`\n\nI notice that this string consists entirely of terminal symbols. The non-terminal symbols from the grammar include things like NT18, NT5, NT22, etc., but the string itself only has terminal symbols like 't49', 't33', etc. The grammar's left-hand sides are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals until they reach a terminal.\n\nSince the string provided is only terminals, the grammar should generate it by expanding non-terminals into sequences of terminals. The question is whether such a derivation exists.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the starting symbol, which might have more. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. So, the starting symbol would produce two non-terminals, each of those would produce two, and so on. The length of the string generated must be 2^n where n is the number of steps from the start symbol. Here, the string has 33 symbols. Let me count the positions: yeah, 33 symbols in total.\n\nWait, 33 is not a power of 2. The number of terminals generated in an expansion starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, in CNF would result in 2^n terminals where n is the number of productions applied. So for a string of length 33, which is 2^5 + 1? 32 is 2^5, 33 is 32+1. Wait, but that's not a power of two. So does that mean that the string cannot be generated by a grammar in CNF because the length isn't a power of two?\n\nWait, no, that's for the case where each production is applied exactly once. Maybe the tree can have different depths. Hmm. For example, one branch could have more terminals than another. But in CNF, each expansion step produces two non-terminals, which then must be expanded further until they become terminals.\n\nBut each step doubles the number of non-terminals. Therefore, the total number of terminals would be 2^n, where n is the number of expansion steps from the start symbol. But in this case, the string has 33 terminals, which is not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 33 is in between. Therefore, it's impossible for a grammar in CNF to generate a string of length 33 because that would require a derivation with a non-integer number of steps, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the start symbol S directly produces NT18 and NT42 (from the first production: S \u2192 NT18 NT42). Each of these NT's, when expanded, will produce two more non-terminals each, and so on. The total number of terminal symbols would be 2^k where k is the depth of the derivation tree. So, for example, if each NT is expanded to a terminal, then the total length would be 2^depth. But 33 is not a power of two, so it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some non-terminals expand into multiple terminals, not just one. But in CNF, each production rule replaces one non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. So each expansion step increases the number of symbols by a factor of two. Thus, the length of the entire string must be 2^n, where n is the number of times the non-terminals were expanded beyond the initial S.\n\nWait, initial S \u2192 NT18 NT42 (length 2). Suppose both are expanded completely, then each would go through their own expansions. But each NT production in the grammar seems to lead to other NTs, which eventually become terminals. So maybe each NT can expand into a certain number of terminals, but in CNF, each production is a split between two NTs until you reach a point where an NT becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, every production is two NTs on the right. So, to reach a terminal, we must have a leftmost derivation where each NT eventually becomes a terminal. But each NT can have its own production chain, so the number of terminals in the end could vary depending on the specific production rules.\n\nWait, but each NT production in the grammar is either a terminal or a production into two NTs. For example, NT2 is 't9' (a terminal) or NT10 NT22. NT42 is 't27' or NT2 NT38, etc.\n\nSo, some NTs directly produce terminals, others produce two NTs. So the total number of terminals generated depends on which NTs are chosen to produce terminals and which to expand further.\n\nIn this case, the string's length is 33 symbols, which is not a power of two. So even if some NTs produce terminals and others continue to split, the overall count might not fit 2^n.\n\nWait, but actually, in this specific case, let's see. The string has 33 symbols. Each time an NT is expanded into two NTs, the total count of non-terminals increases by one each step. Wait, maybe it's better to model the derivation.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces two NTs: NT18 and NT42. So after one step, we have two non-terminals. Each of those could either produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider that each NT that doesn't produce a terminal increases the count of non-terminals by one. For example, if NT18 produces a terminal, then it contributes 1. If NT18 produces two NTs, then we have two more NTs. Similarly for NT42.\n\nThe initial count of NTs is 2. Each expansion step can potentially increase the count. Let's model it:\n\nAt step 0: 2 NTs (S \u2192 NT18 NT42)\n\nAt step 1:\n\n- NT18 can become 't10' (a terminal) or NT2 and NT22.\n\n- NT42 can become 't27' or NT2 and NT38.\n\nSo if both NT18 and NT42 produce terminals (if possible), then we end up with 2 terminals, and the process stops. So the length would be 2, which is 2^1.\n\nIf NT18 produces a terminal and NT42 produces two NTs, then the count is 1 (from NT18) + 2 (from NT42) = 3.\n\nIf both produce two NTs: 2 + 2 = 4, which is 2^2.\n\nWait, but according to this, the number of NTs can take various paths, and the total number of terminals can be between 2 and 2^depth, depending on how many NTs produce terminals and how many continue to split.\n\nBut in this case, the string has 33 terminals, which is not a power of two. However, maybe there is a way to split the NTs such that the total number of terminals sums up to 33.\n\nWait, but each step of splitting an NT into two NTs increases the total count of non-terminals by one. So starting with 2 NTs, each split increases count by 1, while some NTs becoming terminals reduce the count by 1.\n\nWait no, when an NT splits into two, we replace one with two, so net increase of 1 NT. If an NT becomes a terminal, we remove it, so net decrease of 1.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe another approach: Let's think of each NT in the grammar as eventually being expanded into some sequence of terminals.\n\nFor example, some NTs have direct terminal productions, like NT9 \u2192 t40 or t35, etc. Others need to be expanded through their productions.\n\nSo to generate the string, each symbol in the string must be generated by some NT's production.\n\nI can try to see if the overall structure of the string is consistent with the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t49, t33, t31, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the initial step is to have t18 followed by t42. Wait, no, S is split into NT18 and NT42. But looking at the rules, these non-terminals NT18 and NT42 might further expand.\n\nLooking at NT18, it has a production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, NT23 \u2192... Hmm, NT23 also has a production: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 t45. Wait, but NT54 is another non-terminal. NT54 \u2192 t33. So, putting that together, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 \u2192 t49 t33. So NT23 would expand to t49 t33.\n\nWait, let me step back. The string starts with t23. But according to the grammar, none of the non-terminals produce 't23' as a terminal, except maybe NT23 \u2192... Let me check NT23's productions.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT23 has productions: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 and NT23 \u2192 NT57. Wait, no, NT23 has NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 and NT43 \u2192 NT21. Wait, let me recheck because I might be confusing the non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT43 \u2192 NT21\n\nHmm, but the string starts with t23. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the non-terminals and terminals work. Wait, no. The non-terminals are like NT18, NT23, etc., but in the string, we have t23, t33, etc. So when a non-terminal is resolved, it either produces another non-terminal pair or a terminal.\n\nSo in S -> NT18 NT42, we have two non-terminals, NT18 and NT42, each of which will expand into something, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t23. So let's see which non-terminal can produce t23 as its terminal. Checking all the non-terminals, I see NT23 has a production NT23 \u2192 NT43 NT54, but that's if you choose that production. Alternatively, if it has a production that directly gives t23, but from the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t23 as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me list out all the non-terminals and their productions to find if any of them have a production that gives a terminal 't23' directly. From the given rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT43 \u2192 NT21\n\nHmm, so neither NT23 nor NT43 directly produce t23. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT10\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 NT49\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n\nSo NT23 could eventually produce t49 t33? Wait, no, NT49 is t45, and NT45 is t10. So NT23 would be NT26 NT54, which is NT49 NT54. NT49 is t45, NT54 is t33. So NT23 \u2192 t45 t33. But t45 is a terminal, and t33 is a terminal. So the expansion would be t45 t33, which is t45 t33.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t23, but according to the grammar, NT23 doesn't produce t23. Therefore, there's no way the string can start with t23 because there's no production of NT23 that directly or indirectly leads to t23.

NT38 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo all the non-terminals (like S, NT18, etc.) eventually produce terminal strings (like t23, t33, t21, etc.). My task is to see if the given string can be derived from S starting at the top.\n\nThe string given is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t36 t43 t48 t43 t28 t12 t47 t33 t45 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t51 t12 t12 t51 t53 t6 t38 t23 t33 t21 t35 t6 t50 t53.\n\nFirst, let me note that the grammar is in CNF, meaning each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since all non-terminals seem to directly map to a single terminal, this essentially means each step in the grammar produces exactly one terminal symbol. So, the entire derivation will consist of a sequence of rules that directly lead to the terminals in the string, without any intermediate non-terminals except for the ones in between.\n\nSince each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, the string's length should be equal to the number of productions applied plus one. But since this grammar is directly showing each production, let me think differently.\n\nGiven that, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, and each terminal corresponds to a single production. So, perhaps we can check if the string is a concatenation of the productions' terminals.\n\nLooking at the first production S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string must start with NT18 and NT42 derived into terminals. Let me check the given string:\n\nIt starts with t23 t33 t31... So, does NT18 and NT42 produce these? Looking at the productions:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 (from rule 8), so that's NT23 and NT57.\n\nWait, but the first two terminals in the string are t23 and t33. Let me check the productions for NT23 and NT57.\n\nFrom rule 23: NT43 \u2192 't38'\nWait, NT23 is production 16: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nThen NT26 \u2192 t49 (rule 36) and NT54 \u2192 t33 (rule 26). So, NT23 would produce t49 when derived, right? Wait, no, because the grammar is in CNF, so each non-terminal directly reduces to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each non-terminal directly reduces to one terminal, so each production just represents that terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, in the rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't9' (rule 44)\nNT5 \u2192 't40' (rule 45)\nNT18 \u2192 't10' (rule 11)\nWait, no. Looking back:\n\nWait, rule 8: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nRule 11: NT9 \u2192 't35'\n\nRule 16: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nRule 47: NT47 \u2192 't21'\n\nRule 23: NT43 \u2192 't38'\n\nRule 26: NT54 \u2192 't33'\n\nRule 31: NT38 \u2192 't53'\n\nWait, but rule 42: NT42 \u2192 't27'\n\nRule 4: NT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nRule 7: NT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo, perhaps the top symbol S is NT18 and NT42, each producing a series of terminals. Let's check the string:\n\nt23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t36 t43 t48 t43 t28 t12 t47 t33 t45 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t51 t12 t12 t51 t53 t6 t38 t23 t33 t21 t35 t6 t50 t53.\n\nWait, the string is quite long, 38 terms. Since each step reduces two non-terminals to terminals, the length of the string should be 2n, but the given string has 38, which is even, so maybe n=19, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string corresponds to the application of productions in a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the derivation is S \u2192 NT18 NT42 \u2192 ... and each of these non-terminals is directly reduced to their terminal symbols.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation is simply a sequence where each non-terminal is replaced by their corresponding terminal.\n\nGiven that, let's try to map the given string to the productions.\n\nThe first two symbols are t23 and t33. So, according to the production S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which corresponds to t18 and t42. So, if NT18 \u2192 t23 and NT42 \u2192 t33, that would fit.\n\nWait, let's check the rules for NT18. Rule 8: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, in order for NT18 to be t23, NT23 must produce t23. Looking at rule 16: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So for NT23 to produce t23, NT26 must produce t26, which is rule 36: NT26 \u2192 t49, which is not t23. So that doesn't fit. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT18 can be directly mapped to t23 via rule 8? But wait, rule 8 is NT18"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-655","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of several production rules where each non-terminal on the left side produces two non-terminals on the right side, or a terminal. In CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier, probably using something like theCYK algorithm, but since the question is about generating the string, maybe I can find a way to trace the string through the grammar.\n\nThe given string is: `t49 t33 t31 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t21 t9 t43 t11 t47 t27 t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t6 t38 t23 t33 t21 t6 t38 t23 t33 t21 t12 t12 t53`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided, I see that many non-terminals have productions that eventually break down into terminals. My approach should be to start from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the entire string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT18 and NT42. Let's consider the string. The first symbol is t49, which needs to come from one of the productions starting with t49. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT9 produces t40 and t28, but that's for NT9 \u2192 t40 t28, which isn't directly relevant here. Wait, looking closer, some NT rules lead to terminals directly.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t49. Looking at the rules, I see that NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, and NT43 can produce t38 or other NTs. But the string starts with t49. Let me find which NT rule leads to t49. Scanning through, I see NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49, but that's a cycle. Also, NT49 \u2192 t45. So, let's see. Maybe I should try to see which production eventually leads to a sequence of t49.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is better approached by parsing the string from left to right, using the grammar to expand non-terminals step by step. Since the string starts with t49, I need to find a production that eventually produces t49 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which rules produce t49. I know NT54 \u2192 t33, but that's a terminal. Wait, looking through all the rules again, I see NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49. So, to produce t49, we need to have a production that can lead to t49 as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t45. Wait, actually no, looking through all the rules, I only see NT49 as a non-terminal, perhaps. Let me list the rules to make sure.\n\nWait, looking at the list of rules, I notice:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49\n\nSo, NT26 can produce NT23 and NT49. If NT49 is a non-terminal, then this might not immediately give a terminal, but if NT49 has a production that eventually becomes a terminal, then that's the way.\n\nWait, looking further down the list, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49\n\nHmm, so NT26 can be expanded into NT23 and NT49. Then, I need to see if NT23 and NT49 can produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nSo, NT23 produces NT26 and NT54. NT54 \u2192 t33, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, so let's trace:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 can be \u2192 NT23 NT49\n- So, that seems like a cycle, but perhaps in the context of the entire string, this might be resolved differently.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different approach. Since the string starts with t49, maybe I should look for a production that can produce t49 as part of a larger chain.\n\nWait, checking the rules, I see:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n\nWait no, looking again at the rules, I see that NT54 \u2192 t33, but that's a different rule.\n\nWait, wait, let me check the entire list carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT49 is defined as t45: \"NT49 -> t45\"\n\nWait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the list, after NT44 comes:\n\n- NT45 -> t10\n- NT54 -> t33\n- NT38 -> t53\n- NT49 -> t45\n\nWait, so yes, NT49 \u2192 t45.\n\nSo, if I have t49 in the string, that would need to come from a production where a non-terminal expands into t49. But looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t49, except perhaps for NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49, which would only produce a sequence that includes t49 as part of the right-hand side. That is, expanding NT26 would require NT23 to expand further.\n\nSo, the string starts with t49. Let me see if any non-terminal can derive t49 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nSo, let's see. Suppose I have a production NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49. If I expand NT23, it becomes NT26 NT54, which can then be expanded into NT23 NT49 and NT54. NT54 becomes t33, but that's a terminal, so that would be the end of that part.\n\nWait, so let's try to build the first few steps:\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThen, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Let's expand that.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT54 \u2192 t33. So that gives us NT26 and t33. But NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49, which would need to be expanded again.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to try to find whether the string can be fully derived from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string backwards, seeing if the last symbol can be matched with a production of the start symbol.\n\nBut since the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, and the string's length is odd (let's count: the string has 36 symbols, assuming each 't' is one symbol, so 36 terms. Since S produces two, the first level would have N=1, then N=2, then N=3, etc. For a string of length L, the number of symbols in parsed trees would be L+1. Hmm, but 36 might be problematic. Maybe I should check the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find if the string can be built by replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to see what the first token is: t49. Where does t49 come from? Looking through the rules, I see that NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49, but that would require that after expanding, the next symbols would include t49 and then the rest.\n\nWait, but NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49. Suppose we have a production where NT26 is the leftmost symbol, then NT26 can be expanded into NT23 and NT49. NT23 would then expand into NT26 and NT54, and NT54 is a terminal t33.\n\nWait, that would give us the first part as t33, but the string starts with t49. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, is there any non-terminal that produces t49 as a terminal? Let me check all the rules to see if any non-terminal's production includes a terminal t49.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT36 \u2192 etc.\n\nI don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t49, except through other non-terminals. So to get t49, it has to be a result of expanding NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.

So perhaps I need to check if any of the NTs in the productions of NT8 produce terms.\n\nWait, no. That suggests that NT8 can only be expanded into two NTs, so NT8 must come from a two-step expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-671","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of productions, and the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form for CFGs where every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms more manageable.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the productions indeed fit into the CNF structure. Each production on the left side is a single non-terminal, and each right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So that's good; the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t10 t43 t27 t57 t43 t36 t27 t51 t53 t7 t10 t43 t22 t43 t43 t43 t28 t35 t6 t9 t6 t6 t55 t53 t7 t10 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t51 t51 t51 t53`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since it's a context-free grammar, the derivation must follow a sequence of productions without any context issues.\n\nThe approach I think I should take is to model the parsing process. Specifically, since it's in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing in CNF. However, implementing CYK would require mapping the string to indices and checking the rules, which might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree step by step, ensuring that each rule application leads closer to the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the start symbol S and see how it can expand to the given string. S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string starts with NT18 NT42. Let's look at the string: it starts with t10 t43. So wait, NT18 is in the grammar. Looking up NT18, the production is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT23 is a non-terminal, as well as NT57. Then, each of these can be broken down further.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to traverse the string step by step, trying to match possible productions. Let me structure this.\n\nFirst, note that the string is made up of terminals, so each production used in the derivation must expand precisely to those terminals. For example, any production like A \u2192 a would directly match a terminal a.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their productions for clarity. Each non-terminal can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n- NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 t27\n- NT43 \u2192 t57\n- NT45 \u2192 t10\n- NT54 \u2192 t33\n- NT38 \u2192 t51\n- NT51 \u2192 t7\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t49\n- NT43 \u2192 t38\n- NT10 \u2192 t43\n- NT36 \u2192 t48\n- NT38 \u2192 t53\n- NT40 \u2192 t6\n- NT26 \u2192 t23\n- NT28 \u2192 t50\n- NT13 \u2192 t11\n- NT49 \u2192 t45\n- NT27 \u2192 t22\n- NT28 \u2192 t55\n- NT57 \u2192 t31\n- NT8 \u2192 t11\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT5 \u2192 t40\n- NT36 \u2192 t36\n- NT43 \u2192 t47\n- NT42 \u2192 t54\n- NT47 \u2192 t21\n- NT38 \u2192 t12\n\nWait, looking at this, some of the productions for non-terminals result directly in terminals. For example, NT5 expands to 't40', NT2 to 't43', NT42 to 't27', etc.\n\nBut in the string, some of the elements are multi-part, like t27 t42, which might correspond to NT27 \u2192 t42 NT43, which then would need to expand further. Hmm.\n\nLet me check if all the symbols in the string are covered in the productions. For instance, t10 is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but when NT18 \u2192 t10, perhaps. Also, NT2 \u2192 t43, etc. So the string consists of these terminals, each corresponding to some non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of t followed by numbers. Each t followed by a number is a terminal symbol in this grammar.\n\nSo to generate the string, each tX must be generated by a production that ends with a terminal. So, each tX must be matched by a production A \u2192 a, where a is 'tX'. Looking at the grammar, there are several non-terminals that produce 'tX' directly, such as NT2 \u2192 t43, NT4 \u2192 t9, NT5 \u2192 t40, etc.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, every 'tX' in the string must correspond to a production that directly produces that terminal.\n\nWait a minute, let's check each 't' in the string:\n\nt10, t43, t27, t57, t43, t36, t27, t51, t53, t7, t10, t43, t22, t43, t43, t43, t28, t35, t6, t9, t6, t6, t55, t53, t7, t10, t21, t33, t45, t43, t43, t11, t51, t51, t51, t53.\n\nEach of these must correspond to a production where the non-terminal on the left is expanded into that terminal.\n\nNow, let's look at the grammar for each:\n\n- t10: Looking for a non-terminal that expands to t10. From the list, NT51 \u2192 t7, which doesn't help. Wait, NT40 \u2192 t6, but we have t10 in the string. Wait, but looking back, I thought NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. However, NT18 \u2192 t10 is another production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but elsewhere in the list, NT26 \u2192 t49, etc. Wait, actually, looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see that NT18 \u2192 t10. Specifically, looking at the list, yes: line says NT18 \u2192 t10. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 t43, NH56: wait, no, the grammar shows:\n\nLooking through, NT18 \u2192 t10. Yes, line: NT18 -> t10. So NT18 can directly produce t10.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 t49, but not t10. Wait, the line for NT18 is: NT18 -> t10. So NT18 \u2192 t10 is a production.\n\nWait, this contradicts my earlier thought. So the production for NT18 is NT18 \u2192 t10. So that means any NT18 can produce the single terminal t10.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals can directly expand to various terminals.\n\nSo, if the string has a t10, that must come from NT18 \u2192 t10.\n\nWait, but looking back,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, looking at the rules, NT26 is NT28.\n\nWait, let me check: The rules for NT26 is NT28. Because in the grammar, under NT, NT26 is listed as:\n\nLooking back, I see under NT, the rule is:\n\nNT26 -> NT49 NT.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT26: From the list, the rule is \"NT26 -> NT49 NT27\". Wait, no\u2014wait, here's the given grammar:\n\nUnder NT, the rule is NT26 -> NT49 NT27.\n\nAnd NT27 is listed as: NT27 -> NT42 NT43.\n\nSo, NT27 is NT42 NT43.\n\nSo tracing back:\n\nS is NT18 NT42 = NT23 NT57 (for NT18) and NT42.\n\nNT42's production is several options: Looking back, I think NT42 can be either 't27' or other combinations.\n\nWait, in the rules, for NT42, we have:\n\nNT42 -> NT22 NT53,\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13,\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41,\nNT42 -> NT42 NT43,\nNT42 -> NT42 NT54,\nNT42 -> 't27',\nNT42 -> 't43',\nWait, actually, in the given rules, for NT42, looking back:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT42 -> NT22 NT53,\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13,\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41,\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT43,\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT54,\n\nNT42 -> 't27',\n\nNT42 -> 't43',\n\nSo, NT42 can either produce a terminal or split into non-terminals.

So, t10 is a terminal, perhaps from a production that directly writes to t10.

{"custom_id":"request-693","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has several non-terminals, and each production rule seems to break down these non-terminals into terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Each production in CNF is a non-terminal (NT followed by a number) breaking down into exactly two other symbols, which could be terminals or other non-terminals. My job is to parse the given string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT18 NT42. So the string must be built starting with the symbols produced by NT18 and NT42. Let me look at the grammar rules for NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18: S -> NT18 NT42. The production for NT18 is NT23 NT57. Then NT23 breaks down into NT26 NT54. NT26 is 't49' as a terminal. NT54 is 't33' according to the rules. So NT23 produces 't49' and 't33'. So NT18 -> 't49' 't33'.\n\nThen NT42: looking at NT42's productions, it's a bit tricky because there are multiple rules for NT42. The given string starts with t49, which matches NT18's first production. Then t33, which matches the second part of NT18 (since NT57 -> NT38 and NT38 -> 't53', but wait, in the given string it's 't33'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar for NT18 is NT23 NT57. NT23 is NT26 NT54. NT26 is 't49', and NT54 is 't33'. So NT18 produces 't49' 't33' correctly. Then NT42 needs to produce something that starts with the next part.\n\nWait, the given string is: t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t27 t53 t53 t57 t11 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t35 t35 t35 t51 t38 t28 t12 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nStart with NT18: produces 't49' and 't33'. Next symbols after that are 't31', which is the third symbol. So after 't49' and 't33', we have 't31', which would be the third token. But according to NT18, it's supposed to be 't49' 't33', nothing else. So perhaps the NT42 part is contributing the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire string as parts generated by NT18 and NT42. So NT18 starts with 't49' and 't33', leaving the rest of the string to be generated by NT42.\n\nLet me look at the remaining string after 't49' and 't33': t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t27 t53 t53 t57 t11 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t35 t35 t35 t51 t38 t28 t12 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12.\n\nSo NT42 must generate this entire remaining string. Let's see what NT42 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT42 has several production rules. One of them is NT2 -> NT10 NT22, but that's for NT2, not NT42. Wait, let's list all NT42 rules:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> NT27 NT42\nNT42 -> NT28 NT43\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT42 -> NT54 NT41\nNT42 -> NT8 NT49\nNT42 -> NT27 NT53\nNT42 -> NT43 NT38\nNT42 -> NT10 NT54\nNT42 -> NT42 NT43\nNT42 -> NT47 NT40\nNT42 -> NT43 NT57\n\nWait, no, looking again: The grammar for NT42 has multiple productions, like NT42 -> NT2 NT38, but perhaps I should find the chain that can produce the remaining string.\n\nGiven the string starts with 't31', which would be from NT42's production. Looking at the grammar, NT27 produces 't22', but that's not matching. Let me see NT28: NT28's rule is NT28 -> NT4 NT40, and looking at NT4: NT4 -> NT9 NT4? Wait, the terminals for NT4 are 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to traverse from the start symbol and see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nThe entire string needs to be produced by S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNT18 produces 't49' and 't33', as per above.\n\nThen we need NT42 to produce all the remaining symbols: t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t27 t53 t53 t57 t11 t43 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t35 t35 t35 t51 t38 t28 t12 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t47 t40 t12.\n\nSo starting with NT42, let's see if the first symbol t31 can be produced by any of NT42's rules.\n\nNT42's possible first symbols are:\n\n- From NT2: 't28'\n- From NT27: 't22'\n- From NT28: depends on NT4 and NT40, which is 't9' and 't6'\n- From NT42 itself: 't54'\n- From NT53: 't38' (since NT53 is 't38')\nWait, actually, looking at the given grammar, some non-terminals are terminals. So for NT2, it directly produces 't28'. Similarly, NT53 is 't38', etc.\n\nSo let me see:\n\nLooking at the first part after 't49' 't33', the next symbol is 't31'. So we need to see which non-terminals produce 't31'. Looking through the grammar, perhaps any NT that produces 't31' is the start of the rule.\n\nLooking at the given terminals, it's possible that NT31 is a rule, but I don't see such a rule. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see that NT57 is 't51', NT38 is 't53', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals and their corresponding terminal outputs.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see what they produce:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 (which is NT26 NT54, then 't49' 't33')\nSo NT18 produces 't49' 't33'\n\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22 (which is 't43' 't4')\nWait, no: looking at NT10: NT10 -> 't43'\nNT22: NT22 -> 't4' (or is it 't9'; wait, let's see NT4: NT4 -> 't9')\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct myself.\n\nLet me list each non-terminal and their production rules, and then determine their corresponding terminal outputs.\n\nNT18: NT23 NT57 \u2192 't49' 't33'\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22 \u2192 't43' (from NT10) and NT22. What does NT22 produce? NT22 -> NT2 NT9. So NT22 breaks down into 't28' (from NT2: 't28') and NT9. NT9 is 't11' because NT9 -> 't11' in the rules.\n\nWait, no, NT22 is a production: NT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9.

The string is `t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t48 t43 t36 t43 t43 t43 t22 t54 t7 t10 t54 t51 t6 t9 t6 t35 t53 t53 t12 t53 t6 t50 t35 t35 t6 t21 t9 t43 t6 t51`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar is given with non-terminals on the left side of the rules, and each production on the right side has exactly two non-terminals since it's CNF. Some of these non-terminals eventually resolve to 't' followed by a number, which are terminals.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to see if it can be derived according to the grammar. Since the string starts with 't49', I'll check which non-terminal directly produces 't49'. Looking at the rules, I see that NT49 -> 't45'. But wait, that's a different rule. Let me see all the rules starting with 't'.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar rules are from S down, and some non-terminals resolve to terminals. For example, NT4 -> 't9', NT5 -> 't40', etc. So, I need to check if any of the initial steps can produce the starting token.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't49'. I check which non-terminal produces 't49'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT49 doesn't have a production because the rules provided don't include NT49 -> anything except maybe in the NT26 rule: NT26 -> 't49'. So NT26 can produce 't49'.\n\nSo, the first token 't49' must come from NT26. Now, looking back at the grammar, NT26's production is NT26 -> 't49', so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving to the next token, 't33'. The grammar has NT33 -> 't33', so NT33 can produce 't33' directly.\n\nNext is 't31', which comes from NT31. Checking the grammar, I see that NT51 -> 't7'. Wait, but NT31 is not directly present. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT51 -> 't7'. NT35 has a production: NT35 -> 't7'. Wait, no, let me check each rule.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me list out all the rules again more clearly. The rules are as follows (abbreviated for clarity):\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\nNT42 (twice) -> multiple options, including 't27', 't28', etc.\nNT22 -> NT29 (but I don't see that, maybe it's a typo)\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, some non-terminals might have multiple productions. But it's easier if I list each non-terminal's possible productions.\n\nLet me make a list for each non-terminal:\n\n1. S -> NT18 NT42\n2. NT5 -> NT23 NT47\n3. NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n4. NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n5. NT42 -> NT2 NT38 | NT4 | 't27' | 't28'\n6. NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n7. NT4 -> NT8 NT10 | 't9'\n8. NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n9. NT27 -> NT42 NT43 | other options?\n10.

NT2 -> 't43' (multiple rules)\nWait, looking back, for example, NT28 -> NT4 NT40 | 't50' or 't35'. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the bottom-up approach by trying to match the string against the grammar by starting from the initial symbol and expanding, but since the string is long, that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the entire string can be broken down into the starting non-terminals.\n\nFirst token: t49. So, we need to have a non-terminal that can produce 't49', which is NT26 -> 't49'.\n\nSo, the first production is S -> NT18 NT42. NT42 can produce 't28' (as per the rules, NT42 -> 't28' once). So S can start with NT18 followed by NT42, which is 't28'. Wait, but the string starts with 't49', which comes from NT26, so that's a problem because S leads to NT18 NT42, which doesn't start with NT26.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the structure. Let me clarify: The starting symbol is S. So the entire string must be derived from S. So, if S produces NT18 NT42, then the entire string must be the concatenation of NT18's derivation and NT42's derivation.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't49', which is from NT26, not NT18. That seems contradictory. So perhaps S cannot directly produce the string because S's first production leads to NT18 followed by NT42, which starts with 't43' perhaps. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order.\n\nWait, S expands to NT18 NT42, and both of these must be on the left side, meaning the string should be the concatenation of NT18's expansion and NT42's expansion. So, the first part of the string should be generated by NT18, and the second part by NT42.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't49', which would have to come from NT26, which is part of S's expansion as NT42, I think. Wait, no: S is NT18 followed by NT42. So NT18 is first, then NT42. So the expansion would produce the string as (NT18's expansion) followed by (NT42's expansion).\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't49' which comes from NT26, so that should come from NT42, right? Because S's production is NT18 NT42. If NT42 is the latter part, then the 't49' should be in the latter part of the string. Wait, but the string starts with 't49', which suggests NT26 is first, but according to S's production, NT18 is first.\n\nThis seems conflicting.

{"custom_id":"request-713","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. \n\nLet me look at the grammar again. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are as follows:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nThen, looking deeper, each non-terminal (like NT18, NT42) has other productions. Some of them eventually produce a single terminal symbol, like NT5 producing NT40 and NT28, which then become 't40' and 't28'. Others produce other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is:\n\nt10 t43 t48 t43 t43 t27 t38 t21 t21 t9 t43 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t28 t6 t57 t23 t33 t21 t12 t51 t12 t57 t28 t53 t7 t10 t43 t28 t35 t12 t53 t51 t51 t53.\n\nFirst, the top-level production is S -> NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the expansion of NT18 followed by NT42. \n\nLet me break down the string into chunks based on the initial productions. Starting with NT18 and NT42.\n\nFor NT18, looking at the productions:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT26 -> NT28 NT50\nNT28 -> NT43 NT55\nNT43 -> NT38 NT53\nNT38 -> NT51 NT12\nNT51 -> NT7 NT10\nNT7 -> ... Wait, actually, wait. Let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at NT18:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nNT26 -> NT28 NT50\nNT28 -> NT43 NT55\nWait, but in the string, the first part after S is t10, but looking at NT18's production, none of the immediate expansions of NT18 produce a terminal. So perhaps I need to trace the entire expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42. So the entire string must be formed by expanding NT18 and NT42, then combining their expansions.\n\nLooking at NT18:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nSo NT18 has to expand into NT23 and NT57. The next terms are t10, which is a terminal. But NT23 is another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT23:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\nThen NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT50\nWait, but in the string, after NT18, it goes to t10. So the expansion of NT18 is NT23 NT57. Let's see what NT23 becomes.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54. Then NT26 -> NT28 NT50. But in the string, the next term is t43. Hmm, this seems a bit complex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the string backward, using a top-down approach or look for reductions. Alternatively, maybe using memoization or dynamic programming for CYK parsing, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll need another approach.\n\nAnother way is to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals correctly. Let me try to see the structure of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t10. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t10? Looking through the end productions:\n\nLooking at NT18: does it produce t10? No, NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nLooking at other NTs: NT10 is produced by NT2, NT4, NT5, etc., but let me check:\n\nLooking at all NTs, which ones have productions that produce t10.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> t28? Wait, no. NT26 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT26, its production is NT28 NT50. NT28 is another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the terminal productions. Each terminal production is when a non-terminal directly produces a single 't' letter.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't35'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nNT5 -> 't40'\nNT8 -> 't54' and 't47'\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT26 -> 't49'\nNT27 -> 't22'\nNT28 -> 't50', 't55', 't53', 't57', 't6'\nNT36 -> 't36'\nNT42 -> several terminals\nNT43 -> 't38', 't33', 't57', etc.\nNT45 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nWait, now I can list which NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT8 -> 't54' and 't47'\nNT28 -> 't50', 't55', 't53', 't57', 't6'\nNT42 -> 't27', 't2', 't4', etc. Wait, looking at specific rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT42 has several rules:\n\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT40\n- NT42 -> NT5 NT45\n- NT42 -> NT27 NT58\n- NT42 -> NT36 NT58\nWait, wait, actually in the grammar:\n\nLooking back, let me list all NT42 productions correctly. The original grammar has:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\nNT42 -> NT27 NT58\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41\nND42 -> NT22 NT43\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nIn the initial grammar, NT42 has these productions:\n\nWait, let me correct this. The user wrote:\n\nIn the context-free grammar, the rules are:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nThen several lines, each line is a production for some NT.

Let's make sure each line is correctly parsed.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in the grammar input, but given the context, I think it's best to proceed with the understanding that some NTs have multiple productions. However, given the confusion in the original post, I'm going to focus on identifying which NTs directly produce t10, t43, etc.\n\nFrom the terminal productions:\n\n- NT8 -> t47\n- NT18 -> t10\n- NT4 -> t9\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT28 -> t50\n- NT26 -> t23?

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by that grammar. My task is to determine\u2014yes or no\u2014if the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice that some productions have more than two non-terminals on the right side. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47, which is fine because in CNF, the right side can be two non-terminals only. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the grammar might have multiple non-terminals on the same production.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, most productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right. For instance, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which is two non-terminals. But then NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\u2014also two. So perhaps it's in CNF. Well, sometimes CNF allows for the productions to have two symbols, non-terminals or terminals, but in some definitions, it strictly requires non-terminals only. Wait, but in Chomsky's original CNF, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so terminals on the right side are allowed as well. So maybe each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking through, I see some productions with two non-terminals, others with two non-terminals separated by a space? No, wait, maybe the productions are written with a space as a separator, so each production is on the left, and the right side is two non-terminals. For example, NT5 -> NT23 NT47 is a production where NT5 is on the left, and on the right, it's NT23 and NT47. Similarly, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, I see NT42 -> 't27' which is a terminal. So this grammar has both non-terminals and terminals, and each production's right-hand side has two symbols at most, which fits CNF. Okay, so it's in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of terminals: t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 ... ending with t6 and t50 t12. I need to check if this string can be derived by the grammar, starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string step by step, checking if each production matches.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the sequence derived from NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nLet me break down NT18 and NT42 in the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 and NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT49. Wait, but NT18's production is NT23 NT57, and NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and so on. This seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, each production can be recursively broken down.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to build the string by trying to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to apply the productions step by step, ensuring that each step reduces the string towards the terminals.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me try to see the steps.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the start is S, and the first move is to replace S with NT18 NT42, resulting in the string NT18 NT42.\n\nNow, I can choose to expand NT18 or NT42. In leftmost derivation, I'll expand the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nSo first, let's take NT18.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNow, the string becomes NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nNext, expand NT23.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nWait, wait: NT23's production is NT26 NT54? Let me check: The grammar above, looking up for NT23: yes, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Okay.\n\nSo now, NT23 becomes NT26 NT54, so the string is NT26 NT54 NT57 NT42.\n\nNow, expand NT26.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT27 NT58.\n\nWait, no: Looking at the grammar, NT26 is transformed as NT26 \u2192 NT27 NT58. But wait, in the given grammar, the productions for NT26 are: NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, etc.\n\nWait, let me get this straight: NT26 \u2192 NT27 NT58? Wait, looking back at the grammar provided by the user, I see:\n\nLooking through:\n\nThe grammar has lines such as:\n\nNT26 -> NT27 NT54\n\nWait, no: Let me check the list of productions given:\n\nThe user listed NT26 as NT26 -> NT27 NT54. So NT26 expands into NT27 and NT54.\n\nSo in the current string, after NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, the string becomes NT27 NT54 NT57 NT42.\n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up the steps. Let me correct.\n\nWait, from S \u2192 NT18 NT42, then NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNow, the string is NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nThen, expand NT23, which is NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNow the string is NT26 NT54 NT57 NT42.\n\nNext, expand NT26 \u2192 NT27 NT54.\n\nWait, no: Checking the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT27 NT54, as per the given productions.\n\nSo the string becomes NT27 NT54 NT54 NT57 NT42.\n\nWait, but this seems to be getting more complex. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards from the string to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nLet me see the string: t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 ... Let's see the last part: ...t50 t12.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t50 is a terminal that appears in NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40 and NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5. Also, in NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41, and so on. Hmm. Also, t50 appears in NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5. Wait, let me see the productions:\n\nLooking for t50: in NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5. So t50 is NT28 \u2192 ..., and in NT28's production, it's NT43 NT5.\n\nWait, let me go down the chain. The string ends with t50 t12. So t50 must come from NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5 and NT28 \u2192 NT45 NT4.\n\nWait, NT28's productions are:\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5, and NT28 -> NT45 NT4.\n\nSo t50 is a terminal in NT28: but in the grammar, I don't see NT28 producing t50. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT28's productions are:\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\n\nNT28 -> NT45 NT4\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nThe provided grammar includes:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nAnd so on. Wait, in the grammar, NT28 is:\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40 ?\n\nWait, let me confirm by scanning the lines:\n\nLooking at lines:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT4 NT40\"\n\nYes, so NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40. But then, earlier, we had NT28 -> NT43 NT5 and NT28 -> NT45 NT4. Wait, that can't be. Each line is a separate production.\n\nLooking more carefully, the lines under NT28 are:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT43 NT5\"\n\n\"NT28 -> NT45 NT4\"\n\nSo NT28 can produce two non-terminals: either NT43 and NT5, or NT45 and NT4, or itself as NT4 NT40? Wait, no, that's a different production for NT28: \"NT28 -> NT4 NT40\".\n\nSo, NT28 has three productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT45 NT4\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40.\n\nBut wait, earlier I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, in Chomsky CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A-> a, where A and B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, some rules have two terminals on the right, like NT2 -> 't28', which is a single terminal. But others have two non-terminals, like S-> NT18 NT42. Wait, but that would be a production with two non-terminals on the right, which is allowed. But I think that some rules have a mix, but in this case, no\u2014each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal or a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: NT42 -> 't27', which is a terminal\u2014single terminal. But others like NT42 -> NT4 NT13, which is two non-terminals. So each production is A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C can be either non-terminals or a mix. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form requires that each production is A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So I think in this case, the grammar is a little mixed, perhaps having mixed terminals and non-terminals on the right side.\n\nWait, perhaps some rules have a single non-terminal, and others have a mix. Let me check a few. For example, S -> NT18 NT42: that's two non-terminals. NT2 -> 't28' is a single terminal. Another rule, NT8 -> 't11' is a single terminal. Wait, but some rules have a mix, like NT28 -> NT43 NT5, so two non-terminals. Wait, no, looks like some have two non-terminals, others have a mix? Wait, no\u2014wait, NT8->'t11' is a terminal. But NT22-> NT29 NT5: no, looking at the user message, it's NT22-> NT29? Wait, user wrote:\n\nNT22 -> NT29 NT5: is that correct? Wait, looking at the user's list:\n\n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, the grammar has some rules with mixed terminals and non-terminals. Or perhaps all are non-terminals except for some terminals represented by 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string first. The string is:\n\nt23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t43 t43 t36 t43 t43 t43 t54 t38 t9 t11 t7 t10 t33 t45 t43 t11 t12 t6 t55 t6 t55 t51 t53 t6 t47 t23 t33 t21 t12 t7 t10 t27 t51 t12\n\nI think I should try to parse this string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a parsing problem, checking if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the standard way to check is through a recursive descent parser or via dynamic programming, but maybe I can do this manually.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. S can only produce NT18 NT42, which are two non-terminals. So the first step is to see if the string starts with the concatenation of NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t23 t33... So I need to see if NT18 can produce t23 or some non-terminal that eventually can produce t23.\n\nWait, looking at NT18's productions: NT18 -> NT23 NT57 | NT23 NT57 perhaps? Wait, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nSo NT18 can only become two non-terminals, NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT23 is a non-terminal; looking at its productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54 | NT8 NT11\n\nWait, wait, no, in the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nBut looking at the user's grammar list, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54 | NT8 NT4\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all productions for each non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to outline each non-terminal and their productions:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The string I have is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Each token can be either a non-terminal or a terminal. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions in the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\nt10 t43 t43 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t27 t12 t6 t55 t53 t57 t28 t51 t7 t10 t27 t12 t6 t57 t49 t33 t21 t51 t12 t35 t6 t9 t6 t12.\n\nI think the approach should be to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to match the productions until I get to the start symbol S. Alternatively, I can model this as a parsing problem, where I try to see if the string can be rewritten using the productions until I reduce it to S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either combining two non-terminals or replacing a non-terminal with a terminal or two non-terminals. Since all productions are CNF, it's suitable for a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the possible ways the string can be split into the non-terminals that lead back to S. But since that might be complex, maybe building a parsing table or using a top-down approach would help.\n\nFirst, let me list all the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT7\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT10\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT23\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT50\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT11\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT45\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT22\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT55\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT31\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT11\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT9\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT40\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT36\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT47\n\nNT42 \u2192 T27\n\nNT47 \u2192 T21\n\nNT38 \u2192 T12\n\nWait, some non-terminals end up being terminals, as in the productions ending with 't' followed by a number. So, any occurrence of these terminals in the string must match exactly.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the next tokens in the string should first be NT18 and then NT42 when fully expanded. But I'm not sure if that's the direction to go. Maybe I should find a way to derive the string starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a parsing table or use a recursive strategy.\n\nAnother plan: for each symbol in the string, determine if it can be replaced by a production. Since the grammar doesn't have \u03b5 productions, each production must be used exactly once in the leftmost or rightmost positions.\n\nWait, using recursive descent parsing, it's better to start with the top-level production, which is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the first two symbols in the string should correspond to NT18 and NT42, or something that can be reduced to NT18 and NT42.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t10. Wait, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which are also non-terminals. So perhaps I'm wrong; perhaps NT18 is a non-terminal that doesn't directly correspond to any terminal. Or maybe I should see which non-terminals can produce t10.\n\nLooking through the productions, some non-terminals have terminals in their productions.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23\nNT54 \u2192 NT42 NT41\nNT42 \u2192 various options, including NT27 which is t42 \u2192 NT42 NT43.\n\nWait, NT42 can produce t42, which is 't42' is a terminal.

So NT51 is a non-terminal that produces t7.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 \u2192 NTt45, as NT45 \u2192 t10.\n\nWait, let me list which non-terminals can produce terminals:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4 (but NT4 \u2192 t9, so NT8 could produce NT47 and NT9)\nNT47 \u2192 t21 (terminal)\nWait, the production for NT47 is NT42 \u2192 t21. So NT47 is a non-terminal that can produce t21.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT27, etc.\nNT42 can also be directly 't27' as per some productions? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking back: one production is NT42 \u2192 't27', which is a terminal.\n\nSo NT42 can be 't27' in some cases.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41: perhaps NT58 can be 't27' and NT41 can produce 't45' because NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45, and NT51 \u2192 't7', NT45 \u2192 't10'. So NT58 can be t27 followed by t45 and t10.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t58, but looking at the grammar, I don't think any non-terminals have t58 as a terminal directly. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list all non-terminals that can produce a specific terminal:\n\nFor each terminal 'tX', find which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n' t21' is produced by NT42 \u2192 t21.\n\nSo NT42 can be 't21' when that's a production.\n\nWait, no: looking at the productions, NT42 \u2192 t27, as one of the productions is NT42 \u2192 't27'.

The grammar and the string are both provided, and I have to decide whether the string belongs to the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me lay out the grammar to understand how the productions work. The start symbol is S, and it can produce NT18 NT42. Each non-terminal on the left also has productions to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's a series of tokens ending with 't's and numbers, like 't10 t43 t43 t22...'. Each token in the string is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is binary, which simplifies things.\n\nMy approach will be to try to parse the string from the start symbol S. I'll break down the string into parts that match the start symbol. The string is \"t10 t43 t43 t22 t43 t36 t27 t53 t53 t7 t10 t43 t48 t43 t43 t36 t43 t43 t48 t54 t51 t6 t38 t40 t51 t51 t6 t55 t12 t53 t51 t53 t53 t38 t54 t7 t10 t54 t12 t51\".\n\nStarting with S -> NT18 NT42. So S produces two non-terminals: NT18 and NT42. Each must be expanded into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT18, in the grammar, I see that NT18 -> NT23 NT57. Both NT23 and NT57 are non-terminals. Then, NT23 -> NT26 NT54, and NT26 can be broken down into 't49' (a terminal). NT54 is a terminal ('t33') or can be further broken down.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. NT23 -> NT26 NT54. NT26 can be 't49' (terminal) or via another production. Wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT26 -> t49, as well as another production NT26 -> t23. Let me check that. Yes, under NT26: NT26 -> t23 or t49. Hmm, maybe I should check if my earlier analysis was correct.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, and I need to parse it step by step. Let me list all the productions to make this clearer.\n\nThe productions are as follows:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT57 ->? Wait, looking back, the productions start from NT5. Wait, the given productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, starting from NT5, but S is NT18 NT42, which comes from the first line.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if I can track the expansion.\n\nList of non-terminals:\n\nNT5, NT22, NT41, NT42, NT2, NT4, NT18, NT27, NT9, NT58, NT8, NT23, NT36, NT28, NT8, NT38, NT53, NT9, NT2, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT54, NT38, NT51, NT18, NT26, NT43, NT8, NT4, NT5, NT36, NT43, NT43, NT48, NT43, NT47, NT38, NT54, NT7, NT10, NT49, NT27, NT28, NT53, NT51, NT6, NT38, NT54, NT51, NT12.\n\nEach of these has specific productions. Some have two productions.\n\nFor example, NT22 -> NT36 NT53, NT41-> NT51 NT45, NT42-> NT2 NT38, NT8-> NT54 NT49, etc., until many have a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of tokens, which are either terminals or non-terminals. The first step is to see if the string can be built by expanding S into these tokens.\n\nSo S is NT18 NT42, so when we expand S, we need to replace NT18 and NT42. Let's look at NT18 and NT42.\n\nNT18 expands to NT23 NT57. So that part is S -> NT23 NT57 NT42.\n\nNow, NT23 expands to NT26 NT54. So replacing NT23, we have NT26 NT54 NT57 NT42.\n\nNT57: Let's see, looking through the productions, under NT57: The grammar shows NT57 is not a non-terminal; looking through all the productions, NT53 is there. Wait, the productions provided include up to NT54. Wait, perhaps in the user's grammar, NT57 is written as a terminal, but looking through the list, perhaps NT57 isn't a non-terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nThe productions provided are:\n\nNT9 -> 't35'\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT43 -> 't57'\n\nNT45 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT38 -> 't51'\n\nNT51 -> 't7'\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nNT43 -> 't38'\n\nNT10 -> 't43'\n\nNT36 -> 't48'\n\nNT38 -> 't53'\n\nNT40 -> 't6'\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nNT28 -> 't50'\n\nNT13 -> 't11'\n\nNT49 -> 't45'\n\nNT27 -> 't22'\n\nNT28 -> 't55'\n\nNT57 -> 't51'\n\nWait a minute, so some of these productions have terminals, but in the productions list, NT57 is written as a production, but perhaps it's a non-terminal that can produce a terminal 't51'. Wait, perhaps I'm confused because in the given grammar, there are productions where a non-terminal is written on the left, and on the right, it's a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo for instance, NT22 -> NT36 NT53: both NT36 and NT53 are non-terminals, but if one of them can produce a terminal, then the expansion continues.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to treat each production as possible steps. For example, looking at the string, I need to see if it can be constructed by expanding the grammar step by step, ensuring that every step produces terminals.\n\nSo let's go step by step.\n\nThe string is a series of tokens, but we need to track the non-terminals as we parse from S to\u53f6\u5b50.\n\nSo starting with S: NT18 NT42.\n\nBut in the string, looking for the starting NT18 and NT42. Let's see the string:\n\nt10 t43 t43 t22 t43 t36 t27 t53 t53 t7 t10 t43 t48 t43 t43 t36 t43 t43 t48 t54 t51 t6 t38 t40 t51 t51 t6 t55 t12 t53 t51 t53 t53 t38 t54 t7 t10 t54 t12 t51\n\nBut when I look at the grammar, the starting point is S = NT18 NT42, which in the string would need to correspond to two sequences that, when expanded, produce these non-terminals in order. So the first part must be NT18 and the second part NT42.\n\nBut in the string, the tokens are all terminals. Wait, that can't be. Because NT18 is a non-terminal, which would need to expand into a sequence of terminals, not directly matching the string's tokens. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the grammar's start symbol S produces a sequence of non-terminals, each of which needs to be expanded into a string of terminals.\n\nWait, let me think: the string given is a list of tokens, each either a 't' followed by a number or a non-terminal like NT18.\n\nWait, wait, the string provided is actually not given in terms of the grammar's terminals and non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-777","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except for the start symbol, which can derive terminals directly. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that all the productions start with something like S -> NT18 NT42 or NT5 -> NT23 NT47, etc. So each non-terminal on the left is rewritten into two other non-terminals on the right. Some of these non-terminals seem to eventually produce a terminal 't' followed by a number or sometimes a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, for example, t23 t33 t31 and so on, ending with t12. Given that the grammar is in CNF, I know that the derivation of the string will involve a sequence of splits, but I need to figure out if the string is valid.\n\nOne approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses strings based on a CFG. However, since I'm doing this manually, I might look for patterns in how the non-terminals produce the terminals.\n\nLet me list all the production rules and see how they generate the terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT9 -> 't35'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT42 -> 't27'\n- NT43 -> 't57'\n- NT45 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't33'\n- NT38 -> 't51'\n- NT51 -> 't7'\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT43 -> 't38'\n- NT10 -> 't43'\n- NT36 -> 't48'\n- NT38 -> 't53'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT28 -> 't50'\n- NT13 -> 't11'\n- NT49 -> 't45'\n- NT27 -> 't22'\n- NT28 -> 't55'\n- NT57 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't11'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT5 -> 't40'\n- NT36 -> 't36'\n- NT43 -> 't47'\n- NT42 -> 't54'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n- NT38 -> 't12'\n\nI notice that some non-terminals produce a single terminal (like NT9 -> t35). Others can produce other non-terminals, which might themselves expand into more terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t23 t33 t31... So the first symbols are t23, t33, t31, followed by t43 four times, then t43 once again, then t22, t27, t7, t10, etc.\n\nI need to reconstruct a parse tree that starts with S and expands to include all these terminals. Since the starting symbol is S, the root of the parse tree is S. S has two children: NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the production S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to expand into terms that can produce the given string. Let's see:\n\nNT18 -> nt18. Looking at the rules, NT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the initial grammar, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the rules.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with production rules like S -> NT18 NT42, and then listing all the NTs.\n\nLooking back, each rule is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz. But then, some NTs have terminal productions. For example, NT9 -> 't35', meaning it can produce the terminal string 't35'.\n\nSo, to parse the given string, I need to see if the non-terminals can be expanded into the given sequence of 't's.\n\nThe string is long, so perhaps it's easier to look for patterns or see if each 't' can be generated by some NT.\n\nFor example, the first token is t23. What NTs produce t23? Let's look through the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT27 -> 't22', NT28 -> 't50', but the options for generating t23: NT26 -> 't23', which is part of the rules.\n\nWait, looking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT26 -> 't23' (Wait, looking at the list, I think I miscounted. Let me recheck the user's grammar.)\n\nLooking back, under NT28: NT28 -> 't55', but earlier ones:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't49'\n- NT26 -> 't23' (Yes, because in the user's input, I see 'NT26 -> 't49' under NT28, but wait, no. Let me re-examine the provided rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT27 -> 't22' (line 8)\n- NT43 -> 't38' (line 40)\n- NT10 -> 't43' (line 81)\n- NT36 -> 't48' (line 79)\n- NT38 -> 't53' (line 87)\n- NT40 -> 't6' (line 80)\n- NT26 -> 't9' (line 82)\n- NT28 -> 't50' (line 83)\n- NT13 -> 't11' (line 84)\n- NT49 -> 't45' (line 85)\n- NT27 -> 't22' (line 8)\n- NT28 -> 't55' (line 83)\n- NT57 -> 't31' (line 73)\n- NT8 -> 't11' (line 67)\n- NT4 -> 't9' (line 64)\n- NT5 -> 't40' (line 65)\n- NT36 -> 't36' (line 77)\n- NT43 -> 't47' (line 74)\n- NT42 -> 't54' (line 68)\n- NT47 -> 't21' (line 72)\n- NT38 -> 't12' (line 86)\n- NT51 -> 't7' (line 88)\n- NT18 -> 't10' (line 57)\n\nWait, so to summarize, NT26 has two productions: NT26 -> 't49' and NT26 -> 't23'. Similarly, NT28 has NT28 -> 't50' and NT28 -> 't55', etc.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first symbol is t23. That must come from NT26, which can derive 't23' directly. So, the t23 is generated by NT26.\n\nNext, the second token is t33. Looking through the rules, which NTs produce t33? Scanning the terminal productions:\n\n- NT38 -> 't53' (line 87)\n- NT33: Wait, looking back, do any NTs produce 't33'? I see NT33 isn't listed as a terminal, but perhaps NT58 -> 't42' (line 54), but wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the user didn't list all the NTs with terminal productions. Let me look again.\n\nIn the user's grammar, the lines are each an NT followed by -> and then either another NT or a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT9 -> 't35' (line ?)\n- NT2 -> 't28' (line 19)\n- NT42 -> 't27' (line 56)\n- NT43 -> 't57' (line 60)\n- NT45 -> 't10' (line 70)\n- NT54 -> 't33' (line 71)\n- NT38 -> 't51' (line 78)\n- NT51 -> 't7' (line 88)\n- NT18 -> 't10' (line 57)\n- NT26 -> 't49' (line 82) and 't23' (line 90)\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long, so I should probably break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems all non-terminals have two non-terminals on the right side except for some that directly produce terminals like 't23', 't28', etc.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t22 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t27 t12 t12 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t50 t6 t50 t6 t55 t12 t57 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t33 t45 t43 t11 t51 t51`.\n\nI think the approach here is to start from the start symbol S and try to rewrite it, substituting rules until we reach the string. Alternatively, using a bottom-up approach, I could parse the string step by step by checking if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the string is long, a bottom-up approach might be manageable. Let me list the rules first to keep track:\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38 or NT4 NT13 or NT22 NT9 or NT28 NT43 or NT4 NT54 or NT8 NT49 or NT42 \u2192 't27' (among others)\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22 or NT8 NT10 or NT26 NT54 or NT23 NT54\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10 or NT47 NT4 (but NT47 is terminal)\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28 or 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n- NT42 \u2192 NT42 't27' (from above, but also can have other options)\n- And more non-terminals with various rules.\n\nThis is a bit complicated, but maybe I can parse the string from left to right, looking for substrings that match the terminals at the top level of the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't23'. In the grammar, NT23 has rules like NT26 NT54, NT47 NT4, and so on. But 't23' also appears in some rules. Wait, checking the rules: NT23 is actually a non-terminal. The only way to get 't23' is through NT23 \u2192 't10'? No, looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 't11', NT27 \u2192 't12' perhaps. Wait, no, in the NT rules, I see 't23' is not a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT26 \u2192 't49', NT27 \u2192 't12', NT28 \u2192 't50', NT23 \u2192 't54'? No, wait: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 or NT49 NT4 (which is 't11'). Hmm, I might need to look for terminals in the string that correspond to leaves in the grammar.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for the rightmost non-terminal and see if it can produce the last part of the string. Alternatively, since the start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42, perhaps I can split the string into two parts that correspond to NT18 and NT42, respectively.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't23', but S \u2192 NT18 \u2192 which means the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT18, and the second part the expansion of NT42.\n\nSo, the string is: NT18 expansion part followed by NT42 expansion part.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: 't23'. If NT18 \u2192 some terminals, maybe 't23' is part of that substring.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, NT18 can expand into two non-terminals, each of which can expand further.\n\nWait, this might not be the easiest way. Let me think of the string as a series of terminals, and I need to see if the grammar can generate it.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to split it into parts that can be generated by the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider that S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT18 and the expansion of NT42.\n\nLooking at the string, the second part (after some 't22's) has a 't11' which could be the end of NT42. Let's see if the last part of the string can end with NT42.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start by checking the possible expansions for each part.\n\nLet me consider the string as two parts: left and right, separated by S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSuppose the left part is the expansion of NT18, and the right part is the expansion of NT42.\n\nSo, the left part should end with 't23' because the very first symbol is 't23', but wait, that's not necessarily the case unless the NT18 directly starts with 't23'. But NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, so the NT18 expansion starts with NT23's terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me instead look for sub-strings that match the grammar's right-hand sides.\n\nEach production rule in the grammar is of the form X \u2192 a b, where X is a non-terminal and a, b are terminals or other non-terminals. Since in binary CNF, each rule produces two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals. So, when we parse it, each rule can consume two symbols if both are terminals, or one symbol if one is a terminal and the other is a non-terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in bottom-up parsing, each production can be used as a reduction rule. For example, if we have abc, we can check if 'bc' is a production of some non-terminal (i.e., if there's a rule Y \u2192 bc, then abc can be reduced to aY, where Y is the left-hand side of that production).\n\nSo, going step by step, I can use this approach.\n\nStarting with the string:\n\nt23 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t22 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t27 t12 t12 t7 t10 t54 t53 t6 t50 t6 t50 t6 t55 t12 t57 t21 t9 t43 t11 t7 t10 t33 t45 t43 t11 t51 t51\n\nLooking for right-hand sides of productions that match two consecutive symbols.\n\nLooking at the start, t23 t33: check if there's a production where X \u2192 t23 t33. Scanning all the rules, I don't see any production that directly gives t23 t33. So, moving to t33 t31.\n\nt33 t31: Similarly, no production matches this pair.\n\nNext pair: t31 t43.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43, but the terminals are part of the reductions. Alternatively, NT43 might produce a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. But the terminal part is not t27 and t43. Similarly, NT31 is not present in the rules as a non-terminal. Wait, T31 must be a production in the grammar.

Hmm, CNF is a specific form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make things a bit easier because of the structure of the productions.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of rules, each starting with something like S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and so on, until I see some terminal symbols like 't35', 't28', etc. Each production either breaks down into more non-terminals or directly ends with a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals:\n\nt49 t33 t31 t43 t22 t43 t43 t43 t11 t43 t11 t57 t43 t28 t6 t47 t40 t12 t7 t10 t54 t12 t6 t9 t6 t12 t57 t43 t28 t35 t53 t7 t10 t27 t53 t12 t7 t10 t9 t11 t53 t51.\n\nFirst, I think I need to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it might be helpful to look for a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string. Alternatively, maybe a bottom-up approach, like using the CYK algorithm, but since the string is long, that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can try to see if each symbol in the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions that end with a single terminal. For example, NT2 \u2192 't28', NT4 \u2192 't9', etc. So, these can be seen as terminal symbols. Let me list out all the terminal symbols here:\n\nt28, t33, t31, t43, t22, t11, t57, t6, t47, t40, t12, t7, t10, t54, t35, t53, t9, t27, t13, t49, t45, t8, t36, t58, etc. But the important ones are the ones present in the string.\n\nWait, actually, the string is just a list of terminals: t49, t33, t31, etc. So, the string is t49 t33 t31 t43... up to t51.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the grammar. The top level is S, which can produce NT18 NT42. So, the start symbol S is two non-terminals. So, the derived string should start with the leftmost symbol of NT18's expansion followed by NT42's expansion.\n\nSo, maybe I can break down the string into parts that correspond to these non-terminals. Let me see: S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the string produced by NT18 and the string produced by NT42.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with t49. Looking at the NT18 production rules: Let's see, the rules for NT18 are:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57  \nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54  \nNT26 \u2192 NT49  \n\nSo, NT26 is t49. Therefore, starting from NT18, we can go NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 \u2192 NT26 NT54 NT57 \u2192 NT49 NT54 NT57. So, the first three steps would give t49, t54, t57. Wait, but the string starts with t49, not t54. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the NT18 might have another production.\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the grammar, the rule for NT18 is only one? Let me check. The user input shows:\n\nThe grammar rules start with S -> NT18 NT42, and then it lists other non-terminals. Then, looking through the rules, NT18 is defined as:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and that's it. So, NT18 can only break down into NT23 and NT57. Then, NT23 breaks into NT26 and NT54, and NT26 is 't49'. So, NT18 must derive 't49 t54 t35'... Wait, wait, looking at NT57, what does that expand into? Let me check: NT57 \u2192 NT31 NT38. NT31 is 't31', and NT38 is 't53'.\n\nWait, but NT57 is a production, but I don't see a rule for NT57 as a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me see the initial part of the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT57: The user input shows NT57 \u2192 ... Wait, actually, let me recount.\n\nI think the initial user message had all the rules, but perhaps I should list them again.\n\nLet me transcribe all NT productions:\n\n- S -> NT18 NT42  \n- NT5 -> NT23 NT47  \n- NT22 -> NT36 NT53  \n- NT41 -> NT51 NT45  \n- NT42 -> NT2 NT38  \n- NT2 -> NT10 NT22  \n- NT4 -> NT8 NT10  \n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57  \n- NT27 -> NT42 NT43  \n- NT9 -> NT40 NT28  \n- NT58 -> NT42 NT41  \n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13  \n- NT22 -> NT29 NT2  \n- NT28 -> NT4 NT40  \n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49  \n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54  \n- NT8 -> NT47 NT4  \n- NT36 -> NT27 NT58  \n- NT28 -> NT43 NT5  \n- NT53 -> NT42 NT38  \n- NT9 -> NT42 NT28  \n- NT2 -> 't28'  \n- NT4 -> 't9'  \n- NT5 -> 't40'  \n- NT42 -> 't27'  \n- NT43 -> 't57'  \n- NT45 -> 't10'  \n- NT54 -> 't33'  \n- NT38 -> 't51'  \n- NT51 -> 't7'  \n- NT18 -> 't10'  \n- NT26 -> 't49'  \n- NT43 -> 't38'  \n- NT10 -> 't43'  \n- NT36 -> 't48'  \n- NT38 -> 't53'  \n- NT40 -> 't6'  \n- NT26 -> 't23'  \n- NT28 -> 't50'  \n- NT13 -> 't11'  \n- NT49 -> 't45'  \n- NT27 -> 't22'  \n- NT28 -> 't55'  \n- NT57 -> 't31'  \n- NT8 -> 't11'  \n- NT4 -> 't9'  \n- NT5 -> 't40'  \n- NT36 -> 't36'  \n- NT43 -> 't47'  \n- NT42 -> 't54'  \n\nWait, the transcription might have some errors. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I'm not missing any rules. Let me count:\n\nThe original user message includes a long list of rules. So, after S, it's a list of NT rules until the end. Each line is a rule for a non-terminal. For example, the first is NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47.\n\nSo, I need to structure the rules correctly.\n\nNow, from what I can see, the terminals are when a rule is written as NTx \u2192 'tX' for some X.\n\nSo, for instance, NT2 \u2192 't28' is one of the rules. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 't9', and so on.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can try starting from S and see if I can generate the string.\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nSo, the string starts with the expansion of NT18, followed by the expansion of NT42.\n\nSo, the string is: t49 t33 t31 t43 t22 t43 t43 t43 t11 t43 t11 t57 t43 t28 t6 t47 t40 t12 t7 t10 t54 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I remember that this should help in constructing a derivation tree, and maybe I can use that to check the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S directly produces NT18 NT42 (S \u2192 NT18 NT42). So the first thing to check is whether the string starts with these two symbols combined. Let's look at the string: it starts with \"t23 t33 t31...\" So wait, NT18 and NT42 are both non-terminals, but in the string, the first symbols are terminals. That seems odd. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe NT18 and NT42 correspond to specific terminal sequences. Let me check the productions for NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So that means NT18 can't be a terminal; it must be broken down further. Similarly, NT42 has multiple productions, including one that becomes 't27'. Hmm, maybe I should start by expanding S and see how the string can break down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol and see if the string can be matched. Since the first part of the string starts with t23, which might correspond to a production that starts with NT23.\n\nWait, let me list out the productions and see which non-terminals produce terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 (Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT26: it's actually NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5, but that's a different NT. Maybe I need to look for NT X productions that produce terminals.\n\nLooking more carefully: NT9 \u2192 't35', NT2 \u2192 't28', NT4 \u2192 't9', NT8 \u2192 't54', NT27 \u2192 't42', NT42 \u2192 't4' and others like that. So, some NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps each production chain will lead to a sequence of terminals. The idea is that the string should be a sequence of these terminals, starting from S and expanding in a way that matches.\n\nBut since the string starts with t23, which is a terminal, let's see if any NT directly produces t23 or if any production can lead to t23 through some chain.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, which are non-terminals, so to get t23, perhaps it's part of a longer sequence. Wait, but t23 isn't a terminal on the right-hand side of any production. So maybe NT23 itself can't produce a terminal, but perhaps through other productions.\n\nWait, let me check each NT production:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54 (Wait, that's not right; maybe I should look again. From the given grammar: NT26 is actually defined as NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5, but perhaps I confused NT26 with another. Alternatively, maybe NT26 isn't a terminal and only a few of the NTs produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't35'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT8 \u2192 't54' and 't47'\n- NT27 \u2192 't42'\n- NT42 \u2192 't4', 't27', etc.\n- NT43 \u2192 't38', 't57', etc.\n\nSo, the terminals are 't23', 't33', 't31', etc., but looking at the terminal symbols in the productions, I don't see NT23 producing any terminal. So maybe t23 is a terminal that is allowed as a part of a production but not as the result of a production.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me confirm: in the productions, all NTs either produce two NTs or a terminal. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, so t23 isn't a terminal but a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals. So how does t23 appear in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me look back. Oh, I see a production for NT8 \u2192 't54' and 't47', but I don't see NT23 directly producing anything. So maybe the given string has t23 which is not possible unless it's a terminal, but in the grammar, only certain NTs produce terminals. Therefore, maybe the string starts with something that isn't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a production that I'm missing. Wait, no, looking again, none of the NTs directly produce t23. So if the string starts with t23, that's a problem because t23 should be derived from NT23, which produces two non-terminals. So how would t23 appear as a terminal in the string? It seems impossible because NT23 can't produce a terminal, and thus any string including t23 would not be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how strings are derived. In CNF, the left-hand side of a production is always a non-terminal, so in the derivation, every step should consist of replacing a non-terminal with its RHS (two non-terminals or a terminal). The string is the result of all non-terminals being replaced, so it's a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo if the first symbol is t23, which would mean that the first non-terminal expanded is a production that directly gives t23, but in the given grammar, no NT directly produces t23. Therefore, the string cannot start with t23, meaning it's not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t23. So according to the grammar, since there's no production for any NT that gives t23 as a single terminal, the first token can't be t23. Therefore, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nI think that's the key point. Since the grammar doesn't have NT23 producing t23, and t23 is in the string, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the given grammar.

So from NT23, we get NT26 (t49) and NT54 (t33). That matches the beginning of the string: t49 t33. That's promising.\n\nSo the initial split is:\n\nFirst part: t49 (NT26 \u2192 t49)\nSecond part: t33 (NT54 \u2192 t33)\n\nWait, but NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So the two symbols should be in sequence, so t49 t33 t31... Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t43 t43 t54 t47 t28 t53 t7 t10 t28 t53 t53 t6 t9 t6 t35 t12 t38 t43 t28 t53 t57 t27 t7 t10 t43 t43 t36 t54 t51 t35 t53 t12 t53 t7 t10 t27 t51 t51\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the initial split: the first symbol is t49. Looking at the production rules, what NT produces t49. Looking through the rules, I see NT26 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo, for the first part of the split, the symbol t49 comes from NT26. So the first non-terminal is NT26.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is t33. Looking at production rules, I see NT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo the second non-terminal is NT54.\n\nThus, the first part is NT26 and the second part is NT54. But the initial split from S's production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which are two non-terminals. So the string must be split into two parts: the first part derives from NT18, the second from NT42.\n\nBut my current split is starting with t49 (NT26) followed by t33 (NT54). That would be part of the NT18's derivation or NT42's?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track back further. Let's think recursively.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the string must be split into two substrings, each derived from NT18 and NT42, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t49 t33 t31... Maybe the first split is the first half and the second half. But given the length of the string, that's 39 tokens. So if I split after 19 tokens, but that might be too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split can be determined by looking for known productions.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t49 and t33.\n\nFrom the rules, t49 comes from NT26 \u2192 t49, and t33 comes from NT54 \u2192 t33. So perhaps the initial split is NT26 (t49) and NT54 (t33).\n\nBut wait, NT23 \u2192 NT26 t49 and NT54 \u2192 t33 as per NT23.\n\nSo maybe NT23 is the first part, which splits into NT26 (t49) and NT54 (t33).\n\nWait, but then how does that fit into the original S \u2192 NT18 NT42? Because S is NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which means the first part would be NT23 (leading to t49 t33) and NT57 (leading to the rest of the string).\n\nBut then the second part after t49 t33 would be NT57, which needs to be derived from NT57\u2019s production.\n\nLooking at NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT38 NT53. So NT57 would split into two parts.\n\nSo, the overall structure is:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 t49\nNT54 \u2192 t33\nWait, no. Wait, NT23 is a non-terminal that can produce NT26 and NT54. Then, each of those can produce terminals.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the production rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, so it can only produce two symbols, both non-terminals. But in the string, after NT23, we have NT26 which is t49 and NT54 which is t33. But t49 is a terminal, so how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Since in the sentence, we can only have a terminal at the end of a production.\n\nWait, no. Each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So when you're generating the string, each step of the derivation appends terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nSo for example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nThen, to get a string, each of those non-terminals must be expanded further until we get a string of terminals.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must produce exactly that sequence.\n\nSo, given that, we can try to split the string into two parts, one derived from NT18 and one from NT42.\n\nSo the first part should be derived from NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and the second part from NT42 \u2192 NT2 etc.\n\nWait, but given the string is quite long, I need a systematic way to split it.\n\nAn alternative approach is to work backward. Starting from the string, try to find the last production that would have generated the string, then split it into the two components, and then recursively do the same for each component.\n\nThis is because context-free grammars can be parsed by recursively applying productions in reverse.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe last symbol in the string is t51.\n\nLooking for which non-terminal can produce t51 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT51 \u2192 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-808","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens: \"t10 t43 t54 t38 t27 t7 t10 t43 t22 t33 t45 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t48 t43 t43 t43 t54 t47 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t43 t54 t47 t21 t33 t45 t43 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t53 t35 t6 t9 t6 t12 t53 t53 t12 t12 t53 t12\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. My plan is to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules, checking if each token can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet's list the production rules for each non-terminal involved in the string. The string contains the following terminals: t10, t43, t54, t38, t27, t7, t22, t33, t45, t48, t47, t21, t35, t6, t9, t12, etc. \n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string should start with t10 (from NT18) and t43 (since NT42 \u2192 't43'). Wait, in the provided grammar, NT42 can produce 't43', which is T43. So first, I need to check if t10 is produced by NT18 and t43 by NT02.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 could be derived from t23 (from NT23) and NT57. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t10. That's a problem because NT18 \u2192 t23 and t57, which doesn't directly lead to t10.\n\nHold on, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me check the grammar again. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So, to get t10, I might need NT23 to produce t10. Looking at the rules: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 t49 and NT26 also has another production: NT26 \u2192 NT26 NT54, which seems recursive. Hmm, but in the string, the very first token is t10, which would require NT18 to produce t10. But looking at the rules for NT18, it's NT23 and NT57. Both of these don't directly give t10. \n\nWait, wait. Let me check the rules again more carefully. NT57 is another rule. It says NT57 \u2192 't31' in one production, but is there another production for NT57? Let me check. Looking through the rules, I see NT57: only NT57 \u2192 't31' and nothing else. No, so NT57 can only produce t31. Therefore, NT18 \u2192 NT23 and NT57 would be t23 and t31, which would make the first part of the string t23 t31. But in the input string, the first token is t10, which doesn't match either. \n\nSo, this immediately suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar because the first token t10 isn't produced by NT18. Wait, but NT18 can't produce t10, because from NT18, we get NT23 and NT57, which don't lead directly to t10. So, this makes me think that the string starts with t10, which is the terminal t10, but NT18 can't derive that. \n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I notice that NT2 \u2192 't28', right? And in the string, there are multiple instances of t28. But the first token is t10. So, perhaps the start symbol S is derived by NT18 and NT42, but the problem arises when S tries to derive t10, but NT18 can't produce t10. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the entire string needs to be the concatenation of the symbols derived from NT18 and NT42. So the first part should be whatever NT18 produces, and the second part whatever NT42 produces.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the first part would be T23 followed by T57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNT26 \u2192 either NT26 NT54 or t49.\n\nSo, let's say NT26 is t49, since that's the only direct terminal it can produce. Then NT26 \u2192 t49.\n\nThen NT23 \u2192 t49 and NT54.\n\nNT54 \u2192 t33.\n\nSo, NT23 would produce t49 t33.\n\nNT57 \u2192 t31.\n\nSo, overall, NT18 \u2192 t49 t33 t31. So the first part of the string should start with t49 t33 t31.\n\nBut the input string starts with t10. So, this doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe there's another production path for NT23. Let's see:\n\nWait, does NT23 have any other rules besides NT26 NT54?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, yes: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54 | t49. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I think I might have a rule where NT26 can derive t49. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the provided rules: NT26 \u2192 't49' is one production. So, yes, NT26 can derive t49. Hence, NT23 can be t49 and something else. But the other part is NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So, perhaps combining this, the structure is:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\n\u2192 (t49) (t31)\n\nSo, combining, the first part would be t49 t31, followed by whatever NT42 produces. But the input starts with t10.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the production of NT23. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT23:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nBut also, looking at NT26, it says NT26 \u2192 't49' or another rule? Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through all the rules: Yes, there is NT26 \u2192 't49' and also NT26 \u2192 NT22 NT9. Hmm. Oh, so NT26 can be t49 or another combination. So, perhaps in the case where we need to derive t10, maybe NT26 is chosen differently?\n\nWait, no. Because if T26 can be t49 or NT22 and NT9. But the first token in the string is t10, which isn't either option. Therefore, T26 can't produce t10, because t10 is only produced by NT2 or NT26, but in this context, NT18 can't produce t10. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong again. Let me take it step by step.\n\nStart symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo the string must start with NT18's derivation followed by NT42's.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nNow, let's see what NT26 can derive. The rules for NT26 are:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49' OR NT22 NT9.\n\nBut t10 doesn't appear here. So how can we get t10?\n\nWait, another non-terminal that produces t10: NT2 \u2192 't28' is one place, but that's not t10. Wait, no. Looking through all the rules, I see that NT10 \u2192 t10, but no, wait: looking at the productions:\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't54' etc. Let me look through the rules again:\n\nLooking for 't10':\n\nIndeed, one of the rules is NT10 \u2192 't10', so if we have a NT10 non-terminal node that can directly produce t10.\n\nSo, going back to NT23:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\n\nSuppose in the parse, NT26 produces t10 via one of its rules?

{"custom_id":"request-829","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Let me look at the grammar to see how it's structured.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT18 NT42. So any valid string derived from this grammar must start with t10 (since NT18 -> t10) and then NT42, which can produce various things, including terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t49 t33 t31 t43 t43 t33 t45 t43 t11 t47 t27 t7 t10 t43 t27 t57 t43 t11 t43 t11 t47 t27 t7 t10 t33 t45 t43 t11 t51 t12 t7 t10 t9 t11 t12 t51 t12 t6 t21 t11 t43 t43 t6 t12.\n\nSince the start symbol S produces NT18 and NT42, the first symbol should be t10. Looking at the string, it starts with t49, which doesn't match t10 or t18 (because NT18 is t10 as per NT18 -> t10), but wait, the first production is S -> NT18 NT42. So the first two symbols should come from NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the string: the first two terms are t49 and t33. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT18 has productions like -> t10, but also NT18 can produce various combinations of non-terminals. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the NT18 production, I see that it has several rules, including NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So t49 could come from NT23 or NT57, but looking at the NT23 and NT57 rules, I see that NT23 produces t26 and t54, and NT57 produces t31. Wait, maybe I should trace backward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of this as a parsing problem where each step consumes certain symbols and reduces the non-terminals. But this might take time. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces NT18 NT42. So the first two non-terminals are NT18 and NT42, and the first symbols consumed should be the results of expanding these.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a flat sequence of terminals. So I need to expand the non-terminals step by step and see if the entire string can be consumed.\n\nLet's attempt to parse the string.\n\n1. The first symbol is t49. Let's see if t49 comes from any non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see rules for each NT which can produce t49. For example, NT23 -> t26 NT54, but t49 is terminal, so maybe NT54 can produce t49? Let me check: NT54 is defined as NT33 NT45 (from NT26), and NT45 is NT10 (t10). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, is there a production that directly produces t49? Looking through the rules, I see that NT49 is not directly defined, but NT43 can produce t43 and so on. Wait, let me check. Wait, the user provided a list of rules, so I can refer to them.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n- So, NT54 has a production NT33 NT45, and NT45 is NT10 (t10). So, if a non-terminal produces NT54, it can eventually produce t33 and t10.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should instead create a table of all the terminals and see if any non-terminal directly produces them.\n\nLooking at all the rules, the terminals are: t10, t11, t12, t21, t27, t28, t31, t33, t36, t38, t40, t41, t42, t43, t45, t47, t49, t51, t53, t54, t57, t58.\n\nNow, let's check which rules produce these terminals directly.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT10 -> 't43' (Wait, does NT10 directly produce t43? Let me check. Looking at the rules provided, I see NT10 -> 't43' (from NT10 rule: NT18 -> NT23 NT57; NT23 -> NT26 NT54; etc. Wait no, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let's look at each rule where a non-terminal immediately produces a terminal.\n\nNT18 -> t10. No, wait, the productions are like S -> NT18 NT42, and NT18 can be expanded into various non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the provided list of rules:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT23 -> NT26 NT54\n- NT8 -> NT54 NT49\n- and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping of which non-terminals can directly produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT42 has several rules, including NT42 -> 't27', 't42', etc. For instance:\n\n- NT42 -> 't27' (I see that as NT42 -> 't27' in one of the rules)\n- NT42 -> 't42' is not a terminal but a non-terminal?\n\nWait, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 NT41\nWait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Let me look again.\n\nLooking for rules where a non-terminal directly expands to a terminal:\n\n- NT23: looking for anything without further non-terminals. From the list, NT23 -> NT26 NT54 (so still a combination), so it doesn't directly produce a terminal. Similarly, NT26 -> 't49', because looking at the rules: NT26 -> 't49'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the rules: NT26 -> 't49' and also another rule NT26 -> NT23 NT54.\n\nWait, so NT26 has two rules: one where it's a terminal 't49' and another where it's NT23 NT54.

{"custom_id":"request-824","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a format where each non-terminal (like S, NT18, NT5, etc.) has productions that either produce two other non-terminals or a terminal (like 't28'). Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That makes it easier because each production step will replace a non-terminal with two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe goal is to check if the given string can be generated by this grammar. The string is: \n\n`t23 t33 t31 t43 t28 t53 t38 t43 t11 t43 t11 t38 t43 t22 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t28 t12 t51 t53 t7 t10 t43 t48 t27 t12 t53 t53 t7 t10 t11 t43 t11 t53 t53 t7 t10 t27 t51 t51`.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar's productions. Each step should replace a part of the current string with the corresponding production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree or see if each part of the string can be matched by the productions. But given the string's complexity, I might need to look for a way to split it appropriately.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few symbols: t23, t33, t31, t43, etc. I need to find if these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT18 NT42 (S \u2192 NT18 NT42). So S is the root, and I should start with deriving from the two parts: NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT18 and NT42:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 (from the given grammar: NT18 -> NT23 NT57)\n- NT42 \u2192 could be several productions. Looking at grammar, NT42 has several options: NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, and also NT42 \u2192 't27', and others. Wait, in the grammar, NT42 has multiple productions, but some are terminals. For example, NT42 \u2192 't27' is one of them. So for NT42, we can either split into non-terminals or just have a terminal.\n\nSo for the first part, NT18, let's apply the production NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Now, the first token is t23, so NT23 must produce t23.\n\nChecking NT23's productions: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Hmm, but wait, in the grammar, NT23 can produce t51 (looking at grammar: NT23 -> t51). So if I take NT23 \u2192 t51, then t51 is produced. But the first token is t23, which is different. So maybe I took the wrong production.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT23: in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. Also, there's NT23 \u2192 t51. So to produce t23, which is the first token, we need a production of NT23 that ends in t23. But from the given productions, NT23 only produces t51, not t23. So that's a problem because the first symbol is t23, and NT23 cannot directly produce t23. That suggests that maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. Maybe NT18 doesn't produce NT23 NT57, but another option. Wait, let me check the grammar again. Looking at NT18, the productions are:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57 and NT18 -> 't10'. Are there any other productions for NT18? The user provided the grammar as multiline, so maybe I missed some. Wait, looking again:\n\nThe user's grammar includes:\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\n... and so on. \n\nSo for NT18, only two productions: NT23 NT57 and 't10'. Similarly, for NT42, multiple productions, including NT2 NT38 and 't27', 't42' perhaps? Wait, in the list:\n\nLooking at NT42:\n\nNT42: \n...\n\u2192 NT2 NT38\n\u2192 NT42 NT41\n\u2192 NT27 NT51\n\u2192 NT42 NT4\n\u2192 NT27 NT53\n\u2192 NT42 NT47\n\u2192 NT22 NT6\n\u2192 ...\n\u2192 't27'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NT42's productions.\n\nFrom the given grammar lines:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38  \nNT42 -> NT4 NT13  \nNT42 -> NT22 NT6  \nNT42 -> NT27 NT51  \nNT42 -> NT28 NT53  \nNT42 -> NT42 NT47  \nNT42 -> NT42 NT4  \nNT42 -> NT42 NT53  \nNT42 -> NT42 NT38  \n... etc.?\n\nWait, actually, the user presented the grammar as lines, but perhaps it's better to look for 'NT42 ->' any of these.

{"custom_id":"request-843","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of several non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals or terminals, denoted as terminals being represented by 't' followed by a number and other non-terminals as NT followed by a number. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals and non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of this grammar. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All productions only have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or one terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. That's good because it aligns with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t23 t33 t31 t43 t36 t43 t22 t43 t43 t27 t47 t43 t48 t54 t12 t53 t7 t10 t43 t28 t6 t11 t43 t6 t12 t51 t6 t57 t23 t33 t21 t12 t7 t10 t43 t48 t11 t43 t11 t53 t12 t12 t12 t53 t12.\n\nI need to check if this string is part of the language defined by the grammar. To do that, I think of using a parsing method, maybe using a top-down approach since the grammar is in CNF. Alternatively, I can track the derivation steps to see if the string can be formed.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree that starts from the start symbol S and expands until all symbols in the string are covered. Since S starts with NT18 and NT42 according to the first production S \u2192 NT18 NT42, I'll need to see if the string can be broken down into that structure.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t23, which comes from NT23 or NT18 maybe. Wait, looking at the productions, NT18 is connected to other non-terminals. Let's see.\n\nI think it's better to represent the productions as a tree. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst production: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string should start with the expansion of NT18 and then NT42.\n\nLooking at NT18, I see the productions:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the lines starting with NT18 are:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nWait, I'm looking at NT18: it branches into various combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t23. So that could be the result of one of the non-terminals deriving to t23. Wait, but in the grammar, which non-terminals derive to t23? Let's check all productions for 't23' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, I see that:\n\n- NT26 has a production \u2192 t49, which is represented by NT26 \u2192 't49' under the grammar.\n- NT23 has a production \u2192 t33, because NT23 \u2192 t33 is present.\n\nAh, so NT23 \u2192 t33, which would make t33 a terminal. Wait, no, I think I need to clarify: in the given grammar, NT23's productions are lines that start with NT23. Looking back:\n\nYes, in the grammar, the productions for NT23 are:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nWait no, no\u2014let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nThen line 71: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n\nSimilarly, line 78: NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT4\n\nLine 92: NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\n\nLine 94: NT28 \u2192 NT43 NT5\n\nWait, no, I need to go line by line.\n\nWait, I need to look for any production that ends with 't23'.

Let me list all ends in 't' followed by a number:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t49 \u2192 t49\n- NT23 \u2192 t33 \u2192 t33\n- NT28 \u2192 t53 \u2192 t53\n- NT42 \u2192 t27 \u2192 t27\n- NT43 \u2192 t38 \u2192 t38\n- NT18 \u2192 t10 \u2192 t10\n- NT23 \u2192 t12 \u2192 t12\n- NT26 \u2192 t49 \u2192 t49 (duplicate)\n- NT43 \u2192 t38 \u2192 t38 (duplicate)\n- NT10 \u2192 t43 \u2192 t43 (but NT10 is a non-terminal; wait, does that mean NT10 \u2192 t43? So if NT10 is a non-terminal, then it's possible to derive into a terminal.\n\nWait no, wait: the grammar as presented has lines like NT26 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal production. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 t43\u2014so NT10 can produce the terminal t43.\n\nSo, for any non-terminal X, if X has a production X \u2192 a where 'a' is a terminal, then in the string, 'a' must be present.

{"custom_id":"request-841","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar has several non-terminals and terminals. Strings in the language will be composed of these terminals. The string provided is a long sequence of terminals like 't49', 't33', etc. I remember that in a CFG, each production either produces a terminal or another non-terminal, and the process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and has two non-terminals on the right, except where they directly produce a terminal. For example, S -> NT18 NT42 initially, which are non-terminals, so to start the derivation, S must be expanded.\n\nBut the given string is a sequence of 't's, which are terminals. So for the string to be generated, each segment of the string must be formed by replacing the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me try to parse the string. It's a list of terminals in order: t49, t33, t31, t43, t22, t43, t43, t28, t51, t38, t43, t43, t48, t43, t27, t47, t54, t7, t10, t9, t11, t12, t12, t53, t6, t38, t23, t33, t21, t12, t7, t10, t43, t28, t35, t53, t12, t6, t55, t51.\n\nI think each 't' corresponds to a production in the grammar. So maybe I can work backwards from the string and try to build a derivation tree that ends at S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing. But the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is suitable for CYK. Let me recall the CYK steps:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each position corresponds to a substring of the input.\n2. For each position (i,j) where j-i is the length-1 substring, check possible productions that directly match that terminal.\n3. For each length from 2 to n (length of input string), for each substring of that length, check all possible ways to split it into two parts and see if any non-terminal at left i can produce the left part, and non-terminal at right k can produce the right part, and check if S can be reached.\n\nWait, but doing CYK step-by-step might be time-consuming for such a long string. Maybe there's a pattern or a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, check if each terminal in the string can be reached directly from some non-terminal, and see if the sequence can be broken down into the allowed productions.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string and see where it can come from:\n\n- t49: From NT26's production, but wait, in the grammar, NT26 -> t49. So the first 't49' must come from NT26.\n- So the first symbol is t49, which comes from NT26. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 ... which must eventually produce NT26 ... and so on.\n\nBut how? Let's try to see the dependencies:\n\nStarting with the string, the first symbol is t49. So, it must be produced by a non-terminal that directly goes to t49, which is NT26 because NT26 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo, S must derive a string that starts with NT26. Looking at the productions for S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S can only produce strings that start with NT18, unless somehow NT18 or NT42 can produce NT26.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because S is the top symbol and it can only be replaced by NT18 NT42. So, the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the first symbol in the generated string should be the first symbol of NT18's expansion.\n\nLet me look at what NT18 can produce. Checking the grammar, NT18 has productions:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 (repeated)\n- NT18 \u2192 t10\n\nWait, I think the initial lines are misaligned. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT18: lines say NT18 -> NT23 NT57 on one line, then on another, \"NT18 -> t10\" (looking at the list), assuming each line under NT is a separate production? Wait, the grammar is written in a list format, each line under NT is a production.\n\nSo for NT18, we have:\n\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT57 (same as above? Or perhaps it's a typo)\n- NT18 -> t10\n\nWait, actually, looking at the initial grammar:\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting with S, the first line is S -> NT18 NT42.\n\nThen NT5 -> NT23 NT47.\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53.\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45.\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38.\n\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22.\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43.\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28.\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41.\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13.\n\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9.\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40.\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49.\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4.\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58.\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5.\n\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38.\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28.\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT43 -> 't57'\n\nNT45 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT38 -> 't51'\n\nNT51 -> 't7'\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nNT26 -> 't49'\n\nNT43 -> 't38'\n\nNT10 -> 't43'\n\nBTW, each line is a different production.

{"custom_id":"request-860","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Let me break this down step by step to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form is a specific kind of context-free grammar where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier to analyze and sometimes perform parsing algorithms on, like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm not going to perform parsing here, maybe I can approach this by trying to construct the string from the start symbol using the given production rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with NT18 followed by NT42. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are 't10' and 't43'. Wait a minute, but according to the rules, NT18 is supposed to produce 't10', right? Let me check the productions for NT18.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Then, I need to see what NT23 and NT57 produce. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54. Hmm, that's a recursive situation. Let me trace this out.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\nWait, this seems like an infinite loop. Because NT26's production leads back to NT23. So without a direct terminal, it's hard to know when it stops. Let me check the productions for NT54. Oh, NT54 \u2192 't33'? Wait, no, looking back, NT54 is only in one production: NT54 \u2192 't33'? No, actually, no, wait: looking at the list, I see NT54 has a production NT54 \u2192 NT39 NT52? No, wait, maybe I misread. Let me go through each line carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT26 \u2192 NT23 NT54\nNT54 \u2192 't33' (wait, no, looking at the list, I don't see NT54 \u2192 't33'. Let me look again.)\n\nWait, searching through the productions, I see:\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\nNT51 \u2192 't7'\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT43 \u2192 't38'\nNT9 \u2192 't40'\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\nNT36 \u2192 't36'\nNT43 \u2192 't47'\nNT42 \u2192 't54'\nNT47 \u2192 't21'\nNT38 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me make sure I'm looking at all the productions. Maybe NT54 \u2192 't33'? No, I don't see that. Let me look for any production that ends with 't33'. I see NT38 \u2192 't51', which is for NT38. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier, maybe NT38 is 't51', but I don't see NT54 pointing to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, after NT53, I see NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38. Then, NT51 \u2192 't7', NT18 \u2192 't10'. Let me check all NTs for their terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't35'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT43 \u2192 't57'\n- NT45 \u2192 't10'\n- NT54 \u2192 't33'\n- NT38 \u2192 't51'\n- NT51 \u2192 't7'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't49'\n- NT43 \u2192 't38'\n- NT10 \u2192 't43'\n- NT36 \u2192 't48'\n- NT38 \u2192 't53'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT28 \u2192 't50'\n- NT13 \u2192 't11'\n- NT49 \u2192 't45'\n- NT27 \u2192 't22'\n- NT28 \u2192 't55'\n- NT57 \u2192 't31'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 't40'\n- NT36 \u2192 't36'\n- NT43 \u2192 't47'\n- NT42 \u2192 't54'\n- NT47 \u2192 't21'\n- NT38 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, I think I see some confusion here. Each production either ends with a terminal or another non-terminal. So, for example, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but if both NT23 and NT57 produce more, how does this chain end?\n\nLet me try to figure out the entire derivation for the given string. Perhaps tracing the string back from the start symbol S, which is NT18 NT42. So the string starts with 't10 t43', as per NT18 \u2192 't10' and NT42 \u2192 't27'. Wait, no: in the grammar, NT42 appears in several productions, like NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38, and also directly as NT42 \u2192 't27' and NT42 \u2192 't43'. Let me check those.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT42 \u2192 't43'\n\nWait, so NT42 has multiple productions. It can become the terminal 't27' or 't43', or two non-terminals. So when the start symbol S is NT18 followed by NT42, in the string, the first part is 't10 t43'. So S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which becomes 't10' followed by whatever NT42 produces. If NT42 produces 't43', then the next token after 't10' would be 't43', which matches the string given.\n\nWait, the string starts with t10 t43, so that would correspond to NT18 \u2192 't10' and NT42 \u2192 't43'. So that's correct so far.\n\nNow, after 't10 t43', the next tokens are 't43 t43', so that would require that the second NT42 (from S) produces these 't43's. But I'm not sure, let me see.\n\nWait, the entire string is: t10 t43 t43 t22 t54 t7 t10 t43 t43 t11 t43 t11 t47 t28 t12 t7 t10 t43 t22 t43 t54 t38 t11 t43 t11 t7 t10 t27 t12 t51 t7 t10 t21 t11 t43 t43 t11 t12 t53 t53 t6 t50 t12 t51 t35 t12.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let's see if I can parse this step by step.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which becomes 't10' and NT42, which in this case is 't43'. So far: 't10 t43'.\n\nNext, the next token is another 't43', meaning NT42 must produce more. But S has only the two non-terminals NT18 and NT42, each producing a single part. Wait, no, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, which are two separate non-terminals, so each will be expanded into their respective sequences. So the first NT18 is 't10', and the second NT42 is the rest of the string after 't10'.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Each NT in the production can generate a sequence of tokens, so perhaps the first NT18 is 't10', and then the second NT42 must generate the rest of the string starting from 't43 t43...'.\n\nSo the entire string can be split into two parts: the first 't10', then the second part starting with 't43 t43 t22 t54...'.\n\nSo starting with NT42 producing the second part. Now, let's see:\n\nNT42 has several productions.

{"custom_id":"request-857","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string to check is: `t23 t33 t31 t43 t21 t21 t21 t21 t21 t21 t21 t11 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t11 t47 t28 t51 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t48 t43 t28 t6 t57 t49 t33 t21 t53 t53 t6 t57 t40 t35 t12 t12 t12`.\n\nFirst, let me recall how string reduction works in context-free grammars. Each step reduces a non-terminal using the productions, substituting the terminals and non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals and the string is generated. \n\nThe initial non-terminal is S, and S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the terminals generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the production for NT18, it's NT23 NT57. So the first two terminals should be from NT23 and NT57. Checking the string: the first token is t23 and the second is t33. Wait, that's a problem because NT23's production is NT26 NT54, and NT54 \u2192 t33. So the first two tokens should be t23 and t33, which matches the string's first two tokens (t23 t33). \n\nWait, no. NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, and NT57 \u2192 t31. So the initial step after S is NT18 NT42 \u2192 (NT23 NT57) (NT42). So the first two tokens should be from NT23 and NT42. Wait, no: S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and each of these can produce a string of terminals. So the first part is NT18's string and then NT42's string.\n\nNT18's production starts with NT23 and NT57. Let's check NT23: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 t49, and NT54 \u2192 t33. So the first token after S is t49, then the next from NT54. But the string starts with t23... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nEach NT rule has two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT18 NT42, where NT18 and NT42 are non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will generate a string of terminals based on their productions. So the entire string is the concatenation of NT18's string and NT42's string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t23, so the first part must be the beginning of NT18's string.\n\nLet's see: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 t49, NT54 \u2192 t33. So NT18's initial tokens are t49 t33.\n\nBut the string starts with t23 t33 t31... So that doesn't match. That suggests that the string starts with t23, which would come from NT23, which is part of NT18, but that's not the case. Because NT18 starts with NT23, which starts with t49. \n\nWait, maybe I have to parse the string as a series of productions. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nThe string can be thought of as the concatenation of S's left-hand side productions: NT18 followed by NT42. Each NT has its own production rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\nt23 t33 t31 t43 t21 t21 t21 t21 t21 t21 t21 t11 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t11 t47 t28 t51 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t48 t43 t28 t6 t57 t49 t33 t21 t53 t53 t6 t57 t40 t35 t12 t12 t12.\n\nFirst, we look at the start symbol S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the string must start with the concatenation of NT18's generated string followed by NT42's generated string.\n\nNow, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the initial part of the string should be the concatenation of NT23's string and NT57's string. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 t49, NT54 \u2192 t33. So NT18's initial part is t49 t33.\n\nBut the string starts with t23 t33... which suggests that the first token is t23. Wait, that can't be because NT18's first production after S is t49 t33. So the first token in the string should be t49, not t23. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the S's expansion is happening step by step. Let me consider that the entire string is a direct derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, that's not how context-free grammars work. They are top-down, so S \u2192 NT18 NT42, then each NT is expanded recursively. So the string is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT18 and NT42.\n\nSo the first part is NT18's string, which starts with t49, as we've seen. But the string starts with t23, which doesn't match. That seems like an immediate problem.\n\nWait, let me check: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 t49, NT54 \u2192 t33. So the beginning of NT18's string is t49 t33. But the string starts with t23. So there's a mismatch here.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT23 again. The production for NT23 is NT26 NT54, and NT26 \u2192 t49, NT54 \u2192 t33. So the first two tokens from NT23 are t49 and t33.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a different production for NT23 that I'm not considering? Looking at the grammar, it seems that NT23 only has one production: NT26 NT54.\n\nSo if the string starts with t23, which isn't part of NT23's or S's initial productions, this would mean that the string does not match. But wait, perhaps there's another way to parse it. Maybe the initial S production isn't the starting point. But in Chomsky Normal Form, every expansion is from S, so it's the top-down approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which part of the string corresponds to which non-terminal. Let me try to think recursively.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT18 followed by NT42.\n\nLet me trace the string as a possible derivation:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nSo, the string must start with NT18's string followed by NT42's string.\n\nNow, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\n\nSo, NT18's string is (NT23) followed by (NT57).\n\nNow, NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. So the string so far is t49 t33 ... (from NT23 and NT57, which is NT57\u2192t31. Wait, wait, let me clarify.\n\nNT57's production is: NT57 \u2192 t31. So the entire NT18 string would be t49 t33 t31. \n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54. NT26 \u2192 t49, NT54 \u2192 t33. So the first three tokens from NT18 are t49, t33, t31. But the string starts with t23, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, the string does not conform to the grammar because the first tokens expected from S are t49, t33, t31... which don't match the given string starting with t23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the NT23 or NT18 productions. Let me check all the relevant rules again.\n\nLooking at NT18's production: NT18"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So each of these represents a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, checking each token in the string against the grammar's terminals:\n\nThe string includes t23, t33, t31, t43, t9, t11, etc. Let's see:\n\nt9: Looking at the grammar, NT5->'t40', NT9->'t35', NT4->'t9', so 't9' is present as a terminal.\n\nt11: NT8->'t11', so 't11' is present.\n\nt33: looking for 't33' in the terminals: Yes, NT54 -> 't33', so 't33' is a terminal.\n\nt43: NT18 -> 't10'; NT4->'t9'; other rules have 't43'? Wait, looking back, NT42 -> 't27'; NT43 is defined in several rules, but does the terminal have a 't43'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that says NT... -> 't43'.

{"custom_id":"request-888","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t23 t33 t31 t43 t22 t43 t43 t28 t53 t57 t27 t7 t10 t27 t51 t6 t47 t40 t12 t7 t10 t43 t43 t22 t43 t48 t27 t53 t12 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t48 t9 t11 t12 t35 t35 t53 t12 t6 t9 t6 t12 t12 t53`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar properly. It's given in CNF, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Every production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or maybe a terminal. But wait, CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that because each production on the left side has exactly two non-terminals on the right.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the string according to this grammar. Let me see what the start symbol is. The start symbol is S, which in the grammar is expanded as S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So the entire string must start with NT18 and NT42. \n\nNow, looking at the string, the first tokens are t23, t33, t31, etc. Wait, but S starts with NT18 and NT42. So in the string, the first thing after S should be NT18 and NT42. But let me check the string: the first token is t23, which comes from NT18. But wait, looking at the production for NT18, it's NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So NT18 expands into NT23 and NT57.\n\nSo, the first step would be that after S, we have NT18 and NT42. Then each non-terminal needs to derive a sequence of terminals and non-terminals leading down to terminals that form the string.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t23, which comes from NT18, because NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the first part is okay: S \u2192 NT18 NT42, and NT18 \u2192 t23 and NT57.\n\nBut wait, looking at the productions, I see that NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. So the first part t23 is derived from NT23. So the next token after t23 should come from NT57.\n\nLooking at the string: t23, then t33. So t33 must be the result of NT57. Let me check what NT57 produces. Looking at the grammar: NT57 \u2192 NT53 NT41. Wait, but NT57 isn't a variable; I think I'm getting confused because the non-terminals have similar numbers. Wait, no, looking back, NT57 is not a non-terminal in the given grammar. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the production for NT9 is NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28. Wait, that's a non-terminal. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me list all the non-terminals to avoid confusion.\n\nNon-terminals: NT18, NT5, NT22, NT41, NT42, NT2, NT4, NT18, NT27, NT9, NT58, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT54, NT38, NT51, NT18, NT26, NT43, NT10, NT36, NT38, NT40, NT26, NT28, NT53, NT51, NT18, NT2, NT42, NT43, NT45, NT54, NT38, NT51, NT18, NT26, NT28, NT55, NT57, NT8, NT27, NT36, NT38, NT40, NT26, NT28, NT53, NT12, NT49, etc. Wait, that's a lot. Some are repeated, like NT18 appears multiple times, but that's probably a typo, so I'll consider each as a separate non-terminal.\n\nSo, for NT57, looking at the productions, maybe I got that wrong. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT47\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\nNT43 \u2192 NT38\nNT10 \u2192 't43'\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT58\nNT38 \u2192 NT53\nNT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38\nNT40 \u2192 't6'\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\nNT28 \u2192 't53'\n\nSo, looking at NT57, actually, I don't see a production for NT57 in the given grammar. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting or there's a typo. Let's check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT57 as follows: NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54; so that's not NT57. Then, perhaps NT57 is a terminal? Wait no, the terminal symbols are indicated by being written as t followed by a number. So, for example, t23 is a terminal. The non-terminals are the NT followed by numbers.\n\nWait, the production for NT29, for example, isn't present, but maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me look again at the productions for NT57: in the list provided, I see NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT38, and looking further, I don't see a production starting with NT57. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me re-examine the initial grammar list:\n\nThe grammar strings are lines starting with '->', so each line is a production.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n- NT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54\n- NT57 \u2192 NT53 NT41 (Wait, is there a production for NT57? Looking again, I think I see:\n\nWait, in the list:\n\n- NT57 isn't a production. Oh wait, actually, looking through all the productions, I see that NT9 has a production starting with NT9, NT2 has a production, etc. Wait, perhaps NT57 is a terminal?\n\nWait, in the string, we have t57. Let me check what NT57's production is. Hmm, in the productions, I don't see a production for NT57 starting with NT57 \u2192 something. Therefore, it's possible that NT57 is a terminal, but in the grammar, as per the given list, it's not a non-terminal. Wait, but if it's a terminal, then the production for NT18 is NT23 and NT57, which are non-terminals, except if 57 is a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, all non-terminals must be on the left side of a production as the single symbol. So if NT57 is a non-terminal, it must have a production starting with NT57 \u2192 something. But in the given grammar, looking through all the lines, I don't see any production that starts with NT57. Therefore, I think NT57 is actually a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string has t57, so that would come from NT57 if it's a terminal, but since it's a terminal, then in the grammar, NT57 must be a terminal symbol. But in Chomsky Normal Form, terminals are not part of the production rules; they are the atomic symbols. Therefore, perhaps the production for NT18 is actually S \u2192 NT18 NT42, but NT18 is not a terminal, so it must have a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me make a list of all non-terminals in the grammar, ensuring they each have a production.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, and the grammar consists of several non-terminals and some terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the initial derivation starts from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S is immediately transformed into NT18 NT42. So the derivation starts with these two non-terminals. From there, each non-terminal can be broken down further until we reach terminals. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to build the parse tree from the bottom up, trying to reach the start symbol S. However, since the string is quite long, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list out the productions and terminals first to see which parts might correspond to parts of the string.\n\nThe terminals are 't10', 't28', 't29', etc., and some like 't35', 't43', 't47', 't51', 't57', 't6', 't7', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of 't's followed by numbers. I notice that several 't's appear multiple times, like 't10' and 't43' being common.\n\nI need to check if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. One approach is to see if the string can be split into steps that match the productions.\n\nLet's start by checking the first few symbols. The first symbol is 't10', but the start symbol S is NT18 NT42, which must be the first production. So perhaps the first part of the string corresponds to NT18 and NT42.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 has a production: NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. That would produce t23 and t57. Wait, but in the string, the first 't10' comes before 't43', so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if there's a way to have NT18 produce a terminal first.

{"custom_id":"request-900","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the given string is generated by it. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is a set of production rules where each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right. Chomsky normal form typically requires productions to have two non-terminals on the right, which is the case here. Each production is like A \u2192 BC, except maybe for the terminals, which are on the right side as well.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t36 t54 t12 t35 t35 t12 t57 t43 t28 t53 t47 t9 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t51 t7 t10 t43 t9 t11 t57 t11 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t11 t43 t11 t53 t53 t53 t51 t12 t53`.\n\nI notice that 't' is followed by numbers, which are terminals. So, the first thing is to see if these terminals appear in the correct order and according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some NT rules produce other NTs or terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't28', so T2 can directly produce 't28'. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't40', but that's an NT, so it's probably broken down further.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, the string must start with NT18 \u2192 something, and NT42 \u2192 something else. Let me parse the string.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't10'. Looking at the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't10' via NT18: 't10' (since NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but wait, no: looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at NT18: it has a production NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, but also NT18 \u2192 't10' via NT9 \u2192 't35', which is not directly, but wait, let me reconstruct.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are a bit tricky. Let me list all the production rules to see the possible paths.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. But wait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 -> NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 -> NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 -> NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 -> NT2 NT38\n\nNT2 -> NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 -> NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 -> NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 -> NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 -> NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 -> NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 -> NT54 NT49\n\nNT23 -> NT26 NT54\n\nNT8 -> NT47 NT4\n\nNT36 -> NT27 NT58\n\nNT28 -> NT43 NT5\n\nNT53 -> NT42 NT38\n\nNT9 -> 't35'\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT42 -> 't27'\n\nNT43 -> 't57'\n\nNT45 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't33'\n\nNT38 -> 't51'\n\nNT51 -> 't7'\n\nNT18 -> 't10'\n\nAh, okay, there's some terminals here. Let's see:\n\nNT18 has a production to 't10' via NT18 \u2192 't10'? No, actually, in the production, NT18 is rewritten as NT23 NT57, which then must derive to 't10'. Looking again, I see that NT18 has another production: NT18 \u2192 't10', but wait, the grammar for NT18 is listed as NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Is that correct? Or is there a direct production?\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I misread. Let me check the list again:\n\nThe production under NT18 is: NT18 \u2192 't10' and also NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57. Wait, no: looking at the provided grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT42\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT51 NT45\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT42 NT41\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT4 NT40\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT49\n\nWait, that's the initial part. Wait, looking again, perhaps I missed the direct 't's. Let me list all NTs with their productions:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57 | 't10'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT22 | 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT10 | 't9'\n- NT5 \u2192 NT23 NT47 | 't40'\n- NT9 \u2192 NT40 NT28 | 't35'\n- NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53 | NT2 NT9 | 't28'?\nWait, no: NT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53 | NT2 NT9.\n\nLooking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43 | 't27'\n\nWait, no: looking at NT27, it's in the grammar as NT27 \u2192 NT42 NT43. Also, check if any direct production for NT27 to a terminal.\n\nNo, so NT27's productions are only to non-terminals until it reaches terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT43 \u2192 NT42 NT38 | 't57'\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to write all the NT productions clearly:\n\nNT18: NT23 NT57, 't10'\n\nNT5: NT23 NT47, 't40'\n\nNT22: NT36 NT53, NT2 NT9, 't28' (Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT2 \u2192 't28', so perhaps NT2's production includes 't28'. Hmm, maybe I need to pay attention. Let me list all NTs with all their rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go step by step.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT18 NT42.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT18 and NT42. The string starts with 't10', so the first symbol is 't10'. Now, looking at NT18's productions:\n\n1. NT18 \u2192 't10' : So, if NT18 directly produces 't10', then the first two symbols must form 't10' and the next should be whatever NT42 produces. But let me see: the first symbol is 't10', so NT18 must produce that. So, the next symbols are 't43' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the entire string is the leftmost derivation of the grammar. Let's try to construct the parse tree.\n\nGiven the string is a series of 't's with numbers. Let's note that:\n\n- NT18's possible productions are either two NTs or 't10'\n\n- NT42's productions are NT2 NT38, etc.\n\nBut maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, looking at each terminal and seeing if it can be generated by some NT.\n\nWait, another approach is to build a parse tree. Let's try to see if the string can be broken down using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t36 t54 t12 t35 t35 t12 t57 t43 t28 t53 t47 t9 t11 t7 t10 t54 t53 t51 t7 t10 t43 t9 t11 t57 t11 t43 t11 t7 t10 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t11 t43 t11 t53 t53 t53 t51 t12"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-912","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding what the grammar and string are.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules. I notice that each rule on the left side (like S, NT5, etc.) production only has two non-terminals on the right, which fits the CNF requirement. Some of the non-terminals (NTs) have terminals attached, like NT5 -> 't40' and NT2 -> 't28', which means they directly produce terminal tokens.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers and more 't's, ending with some numbers and 't's again, and ending with t12. The string is: \n\n`t49 t33 t31 t43 t48 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t27 t51 t35 t6 t9 t6 t6 t47 t40 t53 t57 t54 t7 t10 t43 t36 t33 t45 t43 t11 t12 t51 t53 t35 t51 t12 t51 t53 t53`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT18 NT42. So, the first step is to produce two parts: NT18 and NT42. Let's see what each of them can produce.\n\nStarting with NT18:  \nLooking at the productions, NT18 -> NT23 NT57. So, NT18 can only produce NT23 and NT57.\n\nNT57:  \nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT57 being on the left side of any production, except in NT8 and NT57... Wait, wait. Let me check the productions carefully. Oh, NT57 is only a terminal in the string, right? Or is there a production for NT57?\n\nWait, in the production list, I don't see NT57 on the left side. So, the only place NT57 appears is as a terminal, perhaps. Or maybe somewhere else? Let me look again: Oh, there's NT8 -> NT47 NT4, and NT42 -> 't47' or something. Wait no, looking back, I don't see NT57 being defined anywhere except in the string. Wait, in the string, the sequence starts with t49, then t33, t31, etc. I don't see NT57 in the grammar, except that in NT42, it produces t47 or maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the production list, NT42 has multiple productions:  \n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13  \n- NT42 -> 't27'  \n- NT42 -> 't47' (wait, in the grammar, NT42 -> NT42 -> 't47'? No, looking at the given grammar, the productions for NT42 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nNT42 -> NT42 -> 't47'? No, wait. Let me list all NT42 productions:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT42 -> NT4 NT13  \n- NT42 -> 't27'  \n- NT42 -> 't47'? I think the user might have made a typo. Wait, looking again: The user wrote:\n\n\"NT42 -> NT42 -> 't47'\"\n\nWait, that can't be right because it's duplicated. Maybe they meant to write NT42 -> 't47' as another production. Let me count the productions for NT42:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nNT42 -> NT4 NT13  \nNT42 -> 't27'  \nNT42 -> 't47'  -- So, NT42 can produce either of these.\n\nAh, so NT57 doesn't appear in the production list. Instead, in the string, the first tokens are t49, t33, t31, etc. So, I might need to check where these 't's come from.\n\nLet me try to trace the derivation.\n\nThe string starts with t49. That 't' must come from some production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT26 -> 't49' and NT43 -> 't38', and others. So, 't49' is produced by NT26.\n\nWait, so to get 't49' as the first symbol, NT18 must produce NT23 and NT57. But 't49' comes from NT26, which is another node. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, S -> NT18 NT42. So, S first splits into NT18 and NT42. Let me first handle NT18.\n\nNT18 -> NT23 NT57.\n\nSo NT18 needs to produce NT23 and NT57. Now, 't49' is the first token in the string, which should come from either NT23 or NT57.\n\nBut looking at NT23: NT23 -> NT26 NT54.\n\nAnd NT57: Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT57 as a production, except as a terminal perhaps. Wait, in the grammar, NT57 appears on the right side of some productions?\n\nWait, looking at the productions again, NT8 -> NT47 NT4, and other similar rules. I don't see NT57 on the left side, so it's unclear. Wait, but the string starts with t49, which comes from NT26, as per the production NT26 -> 't49'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the top-down approach could help, but since the string is quite long, it might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to see if the string can be split into the left and right parts as per each production step.\n\nLet me see.\n\nThe string starts with t49 t33 t31 t43 t48 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t43 t22 t27 t7 t10 t27 t51 t35 t6 t9 t6 t6 t47 t40 t53 t57 t54 t7 t10 t43 t36 t33 t45 t43 t11 t12 t51 t53 t35 t51 t12 t51 t53 t53.\n\nThat's 37 tokens. Let's see if the length makes sense.\n\nEach production in the grammar adds two tokens (the two symbols on the right side of each production). So, for a string of length n, to be generated, the parse tree should have n-1 binary productions. Let me check the count.\n\nThe start symbol S expands into two symbols (because S-> NT18 NT42). Each of these can produce two more tokens, and so on.\n\nWait, an alternative approach is to calculate the number of symbols in the string. Let me count them:\n\nCounting the string:\n\n- t49, t33, t31, t43, t48, t43, t22, t9, t11, t7, t10, t43, t43, t43, t43, t43, t43, t22, t27, t7, t10, t27, t51, t35, t6, t9, t6, t6, t47, t40, t53, t57, t54, t7, t10, t43, t36, t33, t45, t43, t11, t12, t51, t53, t35, t51, t12, t51, t53, t53.\n\nTotal tokens: Let's count.\n\n1. t49\n2. t33\n3. t31\n4. t43\n5. t48\n6. t43\n7. t22\n8. t9\n9. t11\n10. t7\n11. t10\n12. t43\n13. t43\n14. t43\n15. t43\n16. t43\n17. t43\n18. t22\n19. t27\n20. t7\n21. t10\n22."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-911","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. But wait, looking at the rules, some of them have two terminals, like NT2 -> 't28' or NT4 -> 't9'. That seems a bit odd\u2014shouldn't each rule have either two non-terminals or a terminal? Or maybe it's allowed because the right-hand side can have multiple symbols as long as they are all terminals or non-terminals.\n\nActually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So each production rule should have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. But the given grammar has some rules with two terminals, like NT2 -> 't28'. That's allowed in a slightly different form but might complicate things because it could contribute to making the derivation more complex.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt10 t43 t43 t22 t9 t11 t7 t10 t43 t36 t43 t54 t47 t43 t43 t43 t27 t47 t43 t43 t28 t35 t6 t47 t23 t33 t21 t12 t7 t10 t28 t53 t53 t6 t38 t49 t33 t21 t35 t51 t7 t10 t54 t12 t12 t53 t51 t51 t35 t53.\n\nThat's a pretty long string. My initial thought is to work backwards, starting from the top of the grammar, S, and see if I can derive this string through a series of substitutions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT18 NT42. So, S starts with NT18 and NT42. Both of these are non-terminals that must be expanded.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57.\nThen, NT23 and NT57 are non-terminals. Let's expand them as needed.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT26 NT54.\nSo, NT23 becomes NT26 and NT54. Then, NT26 \u2192 t49, which is a terminal. NT54 \u2192 t33. So, the expansion of NT23 is t49 t33.\n\nBack to NT18, which is NT23 NT57. So after expanding, that becomes t49 t33 followed by whatever NT57 expands to.\n\nNow, NT57 \u2192 t53? Wait, looking at the rules, NT57 is a terminal 't53'. So, NT18 expands to NT23 (t49 t33) followed by NT57 (t53). So overall, NT18 becomes t49 t33 t53.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check NT57's rule. The rule is NT57 \u2192 't53'. Yes, so NT18 is t49 t33 t53.\n\nNow, moving on to NT42. S \u2192 NT18 NT42, so the first part is t49 t33 t53, and then we need to expand NT42.\n\nLooking at NT42's rules, there are several:\n- NT42 \u2192 NT2 NT38\n- NT42 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT42 \u2192 NT22 NT43\n- NT42 \u2192 't27'\n- NT42 \u2192 't43'\n\nSo, in the target string, after t43 t43 t22, there's a t9, etc. Wait, maybe I should see how the string starts.\n\nThe string starts with t10 t43 t43 t22 ... \n\nLet me check what the first non-terminals expand to. S is NT18 and NT42. Let's see if we can get a t10 in the string.\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which expands to t49 t33 t53. That doesn't have a t10, so perhaps another path? Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me re-examine NT18.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT57, which is t49 t33 t53. That can't produce a t10. So perhaps S doesn't expand through NT18 but through another path?\n\nWait, no. The start symbol S only has two options: NT18 and NT42. So, I think my initial expansion is correct.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t10. So how does t10 come into play?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me backtrack.\n\nWait, maybe the S's expansion isn't just NT18 and NT42 but each can generate the necessary t tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the first part of the string is t10 t43 t43 t22. Let's look for where t43 appears.\n\nLooking at the rules, several non-terminals produce t43:\n- NT4 \u2192 't9' \u2192 no, that's t9.\n- NT5 \u2192 't40' \u2192 no.\n- NT27 \u2192 't42' \u2192 no.\n- NT43 has several rules:\n  - NT43 \u2192 't21'\n  - NT43 \u2192 't38'\n  - NT45 \u2192 't10'\nWait, no, NT45 is 't10'\u2014but wait, NT45 \u2192 't10'. So, where else?\n\nWait, let me list all rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\nNT5 \u2192 't40'\nNT9 \u2192 't35'\nNT18 \u2192 't10'\nNT22 \u2192 't22' (since the rule is NT22 \u2192 't22'?

Let me go through all the NT22 rules.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT54 (No, actually, checking again, perhaps it's different. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking back, in the provided grammar:\n\nNT22 is present here:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT36 NT53 \n\nWait, no, that's a production of two non-terminals. So NT22's production is two non-terminals, making it a bit more complex.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me list all the NT22 rules:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT22:\n- \u2192 NT36 NT53\n\nIs that all? Or did I miss any? Let me check again.\n\nIn the provided rules, I don't see any direct terminal productions for NT22. So NT22 must produce two non-terminals. So, how can the string include t22? That suggests that perhaps in the expansion, a non-terminal produces t22 directly.\n\nLooking back, looking for NTs that produce t22:\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any of the rules produce 't22'? For example, NT27 \u2192 't42'\u2014no.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for NTs that can produce 't22'. Let's scan all the rules for those.\n\nLooking at NT42's rules:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't27' \u2192 no\n- NT42 \u2192 't43' \u2192 but 't43' is a terminal? Wait, the rules are written as A \u2192 ... So if NT42 \u2192 NT43, that's another non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I only see NTs that produce terminals as 't10', 't28', 't9', etc.\n\nWait, I think perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal produces 't22' directly. From the given grammar:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nLooking for 'NTx' \u2192 't22':\n\nI don't see any. So how does 't22' appear in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps it's part of a non-terminal expansion. For example, NT22 is defined as \u2192 NT29 NT54, which I don't see,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
