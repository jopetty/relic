{"custom_id":"request-4","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t90\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string carefully.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules. I notice that the non-terminals on the left side of the rules can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals include 't' followed by numbers, which might correspond to parts of the string we're testing.\n\nThe string we're testing is simply \"t90\". In this case, \"t\" is a terminal, but the main part we're concerned with is \"90\", which looks like a combination of two terminals. Now, looking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals include numbers like T90, T83, T74, etc. Wait, no, actually the grammar has rules where non-terminals produce other non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, the only terminals listed are those that start with 't' followed by a number. For example, 't90', 't8', 't30', etc. So the string \"t90\" consists of the terminal symbols 't' and '90'. Wait, no, wait\u2014the string is \"t90\", which could be one token if '90' is considered a single symbol, but in the grammar, the terminals are individual 't' followed by numbers. So I think each terminal is 't' followed by a single digit. Wait, but in the grammar, for example, NT74 can produce 't75'. Wait, the production rule for NT74 is NT74 -> NT3 NT67, NT77 -> NT68 NT44, and so on.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the grammar, there are production rules where non-terminals on the left-hand side can produce other non-terminals or terminate with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT93 -> 't54', which means NT93 can produce the terminal 't54'. Similarly, NT74 -> 't75', meaning it can produce 't75'. Wait, but in the given string, we have \"t90\", which is 't' followed by 9 and 0. So I'm not sure if 90 is a single terminal or if it's made up of two separate terminals.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the only terminals are those where a non-terminal directly produces a string starting with 't' followed by a single digit. For example, NT74 -> 't75', which is a terminal (output) of 't75'. So the terminals are each of the form 'tX', where X is a single digit.\n\nSo the string \"t90\" would need to be composed of two consecutive terminals: 't9' followed by 't0'. But wait, no, because 't90' is a single token. However, the grammar only generates strings where each production contributes to a single terminal step. So each non-terminal only produces one terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The string is \"t90\", which is two symbols: 't9' and 't0'. But in the grammar, each production produces a single terminal symbol, which would be like 'tX' where X is a single digit. Therefore, to get \"t90\", we'd need to have a production that directly gives 't90', but looking through the grammar, I don't see any such rule. The closest is NT90, but wait, hold on: looking at the grammar, it starts with S and other non-terminals, but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't90'. The only production rules are to other non-terminals, except for some like NT18 -> 't8', which are single terminals.\n\nTherefore, to produce \"t90\", the parser would need to have NT90 -> 't90', but in the given grammar, I don't see such a production. Therefore, the string \"t90\" cannot be generated by this grammar because there's no rule that allows a non-terminal to produce 't90' directly. Instead, each production only allows a non-terminal to produce a single terminal of the form 'tX', where X is a single digit.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Is there any rule where a non-terminal produces 't9' followed by 't0'? No, because every rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for example, NT90 isn't present as a non-terminal in the grammar, because the left-hand side of the rules have non-terminals like NT44, NT18, etc., leading down, but no NT90 rule. Therefore, \"t90\" cannot be generated because there's no way to produce that exact string of two terminals in one step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"t90\" could be produced by expanding a non-terminal that eventually produces 't9' followed by 't0', but in this grammar, each expansion can only produce one terminal at a time, so it's impossible to get 't90' as a single string without a rule that directly outputs it.\n\nSo, after considering all the production rules and the structure of the grammar, I conclude that the string \"t90\" is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-13","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string `t7 t42`. My task is to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions on the left side are non-terminals, and the right sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, I'll look at the string `t7 t42`. In the grammar, terminals are represented as 't' followed by a number or other symbols like 'NT' or 'S'. Wait, looking at the grammar, some terminals have specific expansions. For example, NT3 is 't17', NT20 is 't65', and so on. Also, I notice that some non-terminals directly map to terminals, especially 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo, the string `t7 t42` consists of two terminals: 't7' and 't42'. I need to check if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for terminals:\n- NT77 \u2192 't32'\n- NT67 \u2192 't56'\n- NT44 \u2192 't60'\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n- NT54 \u2192 't9'\n- NT36 \u2192 't50'\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT82 \u2192 't93' and other 't' substitutions.\n\nWait, but the string has 't7' which isn't directly listed in the grammar. Let me check. The grammar doesn't have a production that directly maps a non-terminal to 't7'. So, that could be an issue. Maybe 't7' is derived from a non-terminal that doesn't have a production ending with 't7'. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string was generated through a series of steps where 't7' is involved as a terminal, but it's unclear. Let me think\u2014since the grammar produces various 't's but not 't7', maybe 't7' isn't directly possible. \n\nWait, let's see: looking at the non-terminals, I see S and others. The start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. NT3 is 't17' and NT77 maps to 't32' as per the grammar rules. So, S produces 't17 t32' as a string. But the input string is 't7 t42', which is different. \n\nTo get 't7 t42', perhaps it's necessary to find a production that ends with 't7' and 't42'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly or indirectly produces these. Each terminal expansion seems to correspond to a specific number, but 't7' isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string was generated by combining terminals, but since there's no production that leads to 't7' or 't42', the string can't be derived. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait a moment, perhaps I missed something. Let me cross-verify. Since all terminal symbols in the grammar have specific 't' expansions, but 't7' and 't42' aren't among them, it's impossible for the grammar to produce these exact terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-19","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t87 t71\" is generated by this given grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a form where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The string I'm given is a sequence of terminals, so each token is a terminal.\n\nThe first step is to parse the string \"t87 t71\" and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or two terminals, which aligns with the way strings are built in CNF.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens: t87 and t71. Each of these looks like a specific terminal derived from certain productions. I need to see if each token can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with t87: Looking through the rules, I see that some terminals correspond to non-terminals which produce a single terminal. For example, NT15 -> 't73'. Wait, but where is t87 coming from? Let me scan the rules. Hmm, in NT83 -> 't44', because I remember seeing that somewhere. So, maybe t87 is part of a production rule that ends with it. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see that NT77 -> NT68 NT44, which then eventually may lead to t30 and other tokens. But I'm specifically looking for t87.\n\nWait, I'm probably making a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules. The rule NT22 -> 't78' is there, but that's 't78', not 't87'. Another rule is NT71 -> 't70', which is not t87. I see a rule: NT79 -> 't69' from NT93, but I'm not getting t87 from that. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait! There's a production where NT77 -> NT68 NT44, which then maybe leads to t30 (from NT36 -> 't30'), but that's not t87.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check NT74: Oh, there's NT74 -> 't75'. Not helpful. What about NT79 -> 't69'. Not 't87'. Hmm, maybe there's a production for NT79 leading to 't79' elsewhere? Wait, no. Let me scan all the rules again.\n\nWait a second, I think I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me look for any NT production that leads to 't87'. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't87'. That makes me think that t87 might not be part of the language. But wait, perhaps it's derived through multiple steps. For example, if there's a production that has NT37 -> 't83' or something like that. Wait, NT44 -> 't60', but that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The string \"t87 t71\" has two tokens. Each token must be directly derived from a single production rule where a non-terminal produces that terminal. So, for 't87', I need a production rule where a non-terminal directly results in 't87'. Scanning the rules, I don't see such a rule. All the terminals listed are specific two-digit numbers like 't17', 't22', 't23', 't25', etc. But nowhere is there an NT that produces 't87' directly. That suggests that 't87' cannot be a terminal produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't87' is generated through a longer chain. For example, maybe there's a rule that produces 'NT86' or something, which then leads to 't87', but that doesn't seem to be there. Alternatively, maybe 't87' is a part of a multi-step production, but in that case, it would have to be written as part of the terminal symbols in the string. Since 't87' isn't a terminal in the given rules, I think it's impossible for the grammar to produce that token.\n\nSimilarly, looking at 't71', let's check if there's a production that results in 't71'. Scanning the rules, I see that NT71 -> 't70', which is not 't71'. Are there any other NT productions that lead to 't71'? Let me check. The rule NT22 -> 't78' is 't78', which is not the one. NT79 -> 't69' is also not it. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, is there a rule for NT54 -> 't9'? No, that's 't9'. NT22 -> 't71' is a possibility because I see a rule NT22 -> 't71'. Oh! Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Looking again, the specific rules: \n\nWait, oh, no. Wait, let me check the rules again. Oh, here's a rule: NT22 -> 't71' is not present. Looking through all the rules, the closest is NT22 -> 't78' and NT71 -> 't70'. I don't see a production that results in 't71' directly. So, 't71' also might not be part of the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe 't71' is a terminal from another NT production that eventually leads to it. For example, maybe an NT like NT71 -> something that has 't71'. But from the rules, I see NT71 -> 't70' directly. So that's a problem because 't70' is from another NT that might not be allowed.\n\nWait, to clarify, the grammar's rules are all in CNF. So each step is a split into two symbols. If any rule produces a terminal, that is a leaf. So, in order for 't71' to be present in the string, there must be a production rule where that non-terminal directly produces 't71'. But looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't71'. The closest is NT22 -> 't78' and NT71 -> 't70'. So, both 't71' and 't87' don't have direct productions.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't87' and 't71' are part of a longer derivation. For example, maybe a more complex production includes them in the intermediate steps. But considering the structure, each production splits into two, so if a token isn't directly produced, it can't appear in the string at all. So if both 't87' and 't71' are not directly produced by any single rule, the string can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, since neither 't87' nor 't71' appear as terminals in the grammar's production rules, the given string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the string has three tokens: `t50`, `t7`, and `t83`. This suggests that the generated string should consist of these three terminals in sequence. So, the goal is to see if S can derive exactly these three tokens in order.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll start from the start symbol S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, S expands into NT3 and NT77. Now, I'll need to see how each of these non-terminals can expand further to form the string.\n\nStarting with NT3: According to the productions, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, NT3 becomes NT17 and NT6. Then, I check what NT17 does. From the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. Next, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. So, NT8 becomes NT30 and NT50. NT30 \u2192 NT54, and NT54 can either produce t9 or NT83. Wait, actually, let's check NT30. Hmm, looking back, NT30 \u2192 t34? No, wait, the grammars have multiple 't's.\n\nWait, let me recheck the productions for NT30. Looking through the list: NT30 \u2192 t54. So, NT30 directly produces t54. But t54 is a terminal. So, that would be part of the string.\n\nNow, looking at NT54: There's a production NT54 \u2192 NT33 NT34, and more. Wait, no, the given string's third token is `t83`, so I need to see how to get there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let's build the parse tree from the start.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nNow, expand NT3 and NT77.\n\nFirst, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nNT30 \u2192 t54\n\nSo, that's one path, leading to t54.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t50. Hmm, but in this expansion, the first part is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Then NT8 \u2192 t30 t50. So the first part is t50? Wait, t30 is NT30, which is a terminal, t30 would be 't30' but in the string it's 't50'. So that might not match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check each step more carefully.\n\nLet me start again.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nSo, NT3 expands to NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nNT30 \u2192 t54\n\nNT50 is in the string. So the path so far is t54 from NT30, but in the string, the first part is t50. Wait, no: the string is t50 t7 t83, so t50 is the first symbol. So perhaps I need to look for a way to get t50 through some non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should explore both branches.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Let's see what NT17 does.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nSo, NT8 can produce either NT30 or directly NT50 (since NT50 is a terminal). Wait no, looking at the grammar: NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, meaning it's a binary production to NT30 and NT50. So NT8 cannot produce t50 alone; it can only produce both, so in this case, after splitting, it's two parts: NT30 and NT50, each must be expanded further or produce terminals.\n\nSo, the NT3 expansion would go to t54 and t50. But in the string, the first token is t50, so that matches.\n\nWait, maybe that's the case. So, under NT3, we get NT17 and NT6, which then become NT8 and NT58 (from NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58). Then NT8 splits into NT30 NT50. So, what's NT30? From the grammar, NT30 \u2192 t54. So that's a terminal, but in the string, the first part is t50. That doesn't match. So perhaps the initial path doesn't lead to the correct string.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider another way. Maybe instead of NT3, I should look at NT20. Wait, no, S only splits into NT3 and NT77. So I'm stuck on that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at NT77 first.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\n\nNT49 \u2192 t74\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT14\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54\n\nSo, let's see: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n\nNT68 \u2192 nt49 and NT25 \u2192 which is t74 from NT49, and NT25 \u2192 NT31 and NT5.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT14, which is NT37 and NT22.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT83 and NT54.\n\nSo, let's see this as a path: NT77 \u2192 NT68 (which becomes t74) and NT44.\n\nThen, NT44 can expand further. Let's look at NT44 \u2192 NT74 and NT44 (which is itself, but that's problematic unless it can go to a terminal). Wait, no: in the grammar, we see NT44 has several productions. Wait, looking at the productions for NT44:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nNT44 also has other rules? Or was that all? Let me check the grammar list.\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT44 is only listed as:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nWait, but earlier, in some of the other entries, I see NT44 appearing in other productions, but for NT44, it's only NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18 and NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25.\n\nWait, yes, actually:\n\nIn the grammar, I see multiple entries for NT44. Let me check:\n\nLine 14: NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nLine 21: NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25\n\nSo, NT44 can be broken down into NT22 and NT18, or NT37 and NT25.\n\nSo, going back, the NT44 after NT77 splits into NT22 and NT18.\n\nNow, NT22 \u2192 NT71 and NT39.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT70 NT39.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT30 NT65.\n\nNT70 \u2192 t78?\n\nWait, let me check NT70.

Let me start by understanding what the grammar consists of and then figure out a way to break down the string to see if it fits.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar structure, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I need to see if I can derive the string starting from S.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t50 t13 t65 t72`. Each of these is either a terminal symbol or a multi-symbol token, but in this grammar, it seems each production ends with a terminal (e.g., S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and so on until NT3 \u2192 't17'). So each part of the string should correspond to a non-terminal that can be expanded into that terminal.\n\nLet me list out each part of the string and see what terminals they represent:\n\n- `t50`: Looking at the grammar, I see that NT74 \u2192 't75' and NT44 \u2192 't60'.

The terminal t50 appears in NT26 \u2192 't69', but where does 't50' come from? Oh wait, in the list, I see that NT26 \u2192 't69', but that's not t50. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me look through all the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- 't10' in NT36 \u2192 't10'\n- 't13' in NT83 \u2192 't13'\n- 't14' in NT31, NT22, etc.\n- 't17' in NT3, NT15, etc.\n- 't24' in NT54 \u2192 't24'\n- 't27' in NT93 \u2192 't27'\n- 't29' in NT54 \u2192 't29' via NT26.

't50':\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT26 \u2192 't69' (so that's not 50). NT73 might be relevant because t50 could be in a rule that leads to that. Wait, let's see: the rule NT54 \u2192 't9'... No. Let's search for any non-terminal that can produce 't50'. Hmm. Wait, the production NT26 is listed as:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't69' (from NT26 \u2192 't69'), but I'm not seeing any rule that produces 't50'. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all the 't' rules.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't69' (so not 50)\n- NT74 \u2192 't75' (75)\n- NT44 \u2192 't60' (60)\n- NT93 \u2192 't90' (90)\n- NT54 \u2192 't24' (24)\n- NT44 \u2192 't68' (68)\n- NT74 \u2192 't60' (60)\n- NT93 \u2192 't54' (54)\n- NT22 \u2192 't71' (71)\n- NT23 \u2192 't29' (29)\n- NT54 \u2192 't82' (82)\n- NT71 \u2192 't10' (10)\n- NT23 \u2192 't18' (18)\n- NT93 \u2192 't27' (27)\n\nWait a minute, where is 't50'? Let me re-read the entire grammar rules to ensure I haven't missed 't50'.\n\nLooking back, I see NT26 \u2192 't69' and also NT74 \u2192 't75', NT44 \u2192 't60', etc. Is there a rule that produces 't50'? Hmm, perhaps not directly. Wait, maybe it's produced through some combination. For example, perhaps there's a production that combines NT26 and another to get t50, but I don't see that. Wait, another angle: let's think about the string as four terminals, so that means the derivation needs to produce four tokens through the grammar.\n\nEach token is the result of a non-terminal expanding into that token. So, starting from S, which expands into NT3 NT77. Then those two non-terminals need to expand into the string parts.\n\nWait, let's take the string as four tokens: t50, t13, t65, t72. So the derivation would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nThen NT3 \u2192 ... and NT77 \u2192 ...\n\nBut NT3 and NT77 produce two tokens each, so the entire string would be NT3 NT77 \u2192 (t50) (t13) (t65) (t72)? Wait, no, because NT3 and NT77 would each need to produce two tokens each, leading to a total of four tokens. But wait, how?\n\nWait, not necessarily. Let's think: each non-terminal expansion could produce one terminal, so perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and NT3 \u2192 A and NT77 \u2192 B, such that A and B are the first two tokens. Or perhaps NT3 and NT77 each produce two terms, but maybe in this case, each produces a single token.\n\nWait, more accurately, each non-terminal (like NT3) can expand into two non-terminals or one terminal. So, to generate a single token, the non-terminal must have a rule that directly gives that token. So, first, looking up each token in the grammar.\n\nLet's map each token to a rule that can produce it.\n\n- 't50': Does any NT have a rule that directly produces 't50'?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see an NT that does. Each token is 'a' in some production.

Hmm, CFT in CNF means that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, and the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, and the production rules start from S. Each production seems to be two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for the terminal symbols, which are directly mapped to 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe string we're evaluating is `t56 t90 t16 t44 t87`. Each of these corresponds to a production rule. Let me list them:\n\n- t56: This matches the production NT67 \u2192 t56.\n- t90: Wait, in the grammar, I don't immediately see a production where anything goes to t90. Let me check the rules. Hmm, looking through the NT productions, I don't see t90. But wait, maybe it's part of a longer chain. Or perhaps it's through a different production.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by building the parse tree for the string. Let's see:\n\nThe string is five tokens: t56, t90, t16, t44, t87. Since it's a sequence of terminals, each must come from a production rule. \n\nLet me look at t87. In the grammar, looking for t87, I find NT17 \u2192 t70. Oh, no, that's t70. Then maybe NT77 \u2192 t32? No, that's t32. Looking further, I see NT54 \u2192 t83 and NT83 \u2192 t16 and t44. Hmm, t67 \u2192 t56. Wait, but t90 isn't directly there. Maybe it's a multi-step production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting symbol S is producing a sequence that can be split into parts that match the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production breaks down into two non-terminals except when it outputs a terminal. \n\nLet me break down each token:\n\n1. t56: This comes from NT67 \u2192 t56. So the first part is NT67.\n\n2. t90: I don't see any NT that directly produces t90. Looking through the rules, I don't see any terminal t90, so maybe this is part of a longer chain. Did I miss it? Let me go through all NT productions to see if any have t90 on the right. Scanning, I don't see any. But maybe it's produced indirectly through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if t90 can be generated by any NT. Since none of the NT productions directly produce t90, maybe the string isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and overlooked a production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at all NT production rules, I don't see any that have a t90 on the right-hand side. So NT16, NT20, NT22, NT25, etc., all lead to other non-terminals, not terminals. So how can the string have t90?\n\nLooking at the last production rules, I see NT17 \u2192 t70, NT77 \u2192 t32, NT54 \u2192 t83, etc. So t90 seems impossible unless there's a production that I missed. Maybe I should check all NT productions systematically.\n\nWait, maybe I overlooked something. Let me list all NTs and see if their productions include any of the t numbers in the string:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t56. Good for the first token.\n- NT93 \u2192 t54, which I don't see in the string, but the string has t44 and t67, etc.\n- NT77 \u2192 t32, which isn't in the string.\n- NT44 \u2192 t68, which isn't in the string.\n- NT25 \u2192 t30, which is not present in the string but appears in another token?\n\nWait, the string has t87 as the last token. Looking for t87: In the NT rules, I see NT23 \u2192 t29, NT79 \u2192 t72, etc., but no t87. Hmm, but wait, looking at NT83: NT83 \u2192 t44. But the string has t44 as the fourth token. So maybe t83 leads to t44, but where does t87 come from?\n\nWait, what about NT65 \u2192 t80? Oh, no, that's gone. Wait, let me check all NTs for t87. Hmm, I don't see any NT directly producing t87. So perhaps the string contains a token that's not produced by any NT, making it impossible.\n\nLet me think: The string has t56, t90, t16, t44, t87.\n\nt56 is from NT67, which is okay.\n\nt90: Looking at all NTs, none have t90 as a terminal. So that token can't be generated.\n\nWait, but wait: NT83 \u2192 t44 and t16. So perhaps t83 is somewhere else. But I can't get t90. So if the string includes t90, and there's no NT that produces t90, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Did I miss any NT that leads to t90?\n\nLooking again through the entire list of NT productions:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't73' (terminal t73)\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT65 \u2192 't46'\n- NT26 \u2192 't29'\n- NT40 \u2192 't90' \u2014 Oh wait! NT40 \u2192 t90. That's it! So t90 comes from NT40. That makes more sense. Earlier, I thought t90 was not there, but actually, NT40 produces t90.\n\nSo t90 is NT40 \u2192 t90. So the string's second token is t90, which comes from NT40.\n\nOkay, so that's possible. Now, let's see if the entire string can be broken down.\n\nThe string is: t56 t90 t16 t44 t87\n\nSo each token must come from NT productions:\n\n1. t56: NT67 \u2192 t56\n2. t90: NT40 \u2192 t90\n3. t16: Let's find NT that leads to t16. Looking through NTs, I see NT16 \u2192 t95, which isn't helpful. Wait, looking again: NT16 \u2192 NT95 NT18. Wait, that's not helpful.

Scanning, I see NT16 \u2192 t95 t18, but that doesn't help. Wait, maybe a different approach: is t16 a terminal? Or does it come from an NT that produces t16.\n\nLooking: in the grammar, NT16 \u2192 NT95 NT18, but that's not producing a terminal. So perhaps t16 comes from higher-level NT productions.

Looking:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT16 \u2192 NT95 NT18. So NT16 cannot produce t16 directly. Hmm, that's a problem. Because then the third token is t16, which would require an NT that leads to t16 as a terminal, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's through another NT that leads to t16. Let me look for any NT that leads to t16:\n\nLooking at NT79: NT79 \u2192 NT58 NT22. Not helpful.\n\nNT67 \u2192 t56, but then that's broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way.

{"custom_id":"request-58","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t88 t44 t42 t35 t79` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar first. It's presented in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, B -> C, etc., where A and B are non-terminals and C is a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the non-terminals are rewritten into terminals. For example, NT3 eventually is rewritten as 't17', NT65 as 't88', and so on. The initial symbol is S, which expands into NT3 NT77. So the first step is to see if I can derive the string from S.\n\nThe string provided is `t88 t44 t42 t35 t79`. Let's break it down into tokens: t88, t44, t42, t35, t79. So that's five tokens, which would correspond to the productions of S, which is NT3 NT77.\n\nWait, no. S is NT3 NT77, so S -> NT3 NT77. The length of the string is five, which must come from the productions of these NT3 and NT77. Let's see:\n\n- NT3 is rewritten as 't17', which is t followed by 17, but our string starts with t88. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if NT3 is t17, then t88 would have to come from a different production.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT88: NT65 -> 't46' and from other rules, I see NT88 eventually is 't75'? Wait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the given grammar has several productions where non-terminals are transformed into terminals. For example, NT44 -> 't60', which is t60, so 't60'. Hmm.\n\nWait, the string given is t88, t44, t42, t35, t79. So let's see:\n\nStart with S: S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nNow, NT3 -> 't17' as per the rules, but the string starts with t88. So unless there's another path, maybe NT3 isn't the right start. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. I think I made a mistake earlier. I see that NT8 is 't35' as per the grammar, so t35 is a terminal output from NT8. Similarly, NT39 is t30, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each non-terminal to their terminal outputs.\n\nLet's make a list:\n\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT5 -> 't14'\n- NT6 -> 't63'\n- NT7 -> 't67' (Wait, is there an NT7? Let me check the rules: No, but there's NT67 -> 't56'. Hmm, so NT67 is t56.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to build a mapping from NT to terminal.\n\nHere's a list of NTs and their corresponding terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT83 -> 't13'\n- NT65 -> 't88' (from NT65 -> NT74 NT26; then NT74 is 't75' and NT26 is 't44'? Wait, no, not directly. Let me check each production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the entire grammar and list each NT and its primary output.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- NT65: From NT65 -> NT74 NT26. NT74 -> 't75' (from NT74 -> 't75'). NT26 -> 't44' (from NT26 -> NT5 NT48; NT5 -> 't14'; NT48 -> 't18'; so NT26 is t18? Wait, no, wait, NT26 -> NT5 NT48, and NT5 is 't14', and NT48 is 't18', so NT26 would be t14 t18? No, wait, in the rules, NT26 -> 't44' because of NT26 -> 't44'?\n\nWait, let me look up each NT's production and see which is its terminal value.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\n...\nWait, this might take too long, but perhaps the easiest way is to go through the provided mappings.\n\nLooking at the end of the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\nNT6 -> 't63'\nNT12 -> 't35' (wait, is there an NT12?)\nNo, actually the provided grammar ends with entries like NT51 -> 't27', NT37 -> 't70' etc. So perhaps I should list all the NTs and their corresponding terminals.\n\nLet me go through each production in the grammar and note the terminal results:\n\n1. NT8 -> 't35' (from NT8 -> 't35')\n2. NT20 -> 't65' (from NT20 -> 't65')\n3. NT70 -> 't78' (from NT70 -> 't78')\n4. NT50 -> 't24' (from NT50 -> 't24')\n5. NT74 -> 't75' (from NT74 -> 't75')\n6.

NT59 -> 't17' (from NT59 -> 't17')\n17. NT85 -> 't3' (from NT85 -> 't3')\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me find each NT's primary terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see for each NT, which production gives the terminal symbol directly.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT54 -> 't9' comes from NT54 -> 't9'? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, when NT54 is rewritten, sometimes it's transformed into other NTs. Wait, from the grammar, I see:\n\nNT74 -> 't75' (from NT74 -> 't75').\n\nAlso, NT54 -> 't9' directly (from NT54 -> 't9').\n\nWait, but sometimes NT54 is part of longer productions.\n\nSo for each NT, we take the one production that directly assigns a terminal.\n\nLet me list each NT that directly produces a terminal. Others are rewritten into other NTs until they reach a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT30 -> NT65 NT22, but looking at NT65 and NT22. NT65 -> 't46' (from NT65 -> 't46') and NT22 -> 't87' (from NT22 -> 't87').\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's make a list.\n\nLooking through all the rules, any rule where the left-hand side is a single terminal would be a direct production.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or terminals can appear directly (though in CNF, often variables produce two variables). However, looking at the productions, some have a single terminal, so maybe it's a mix, but assuming it's in CNF with possibly terminals on the right.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, each likely a result of a production chain. My goal is to see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S can derive into two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. Each of these NTs has their own productions.\n\nLet me list the NT productions to see where they can lead. For example, NT3 is defined as NT17 NT6, and so on. Each NT eventually produces terminals or other NTs. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation will proceed through these substitutions.\n\nThe string has six tokens: t61, t73, t7, t13, t14, t15. I'll analyze each token to see how it can be generated.\n\nt61 is found under NT93: NT93 \u2192 t54, or look at production NT93 \u2192 NT44 NT14, which then would lead to t54 and t14. But t61 is a terminal; checking the productions, I see NT93 \u2192 t93 directly? Wait, no. Wait, let me look at the productions. Checking the given NT productions, I see NT93 \u2192 NT44 NT14. Or wait, is there an NT93 production that leads to a terminal? Scanning the list:\n\nLooking for NT93: It's in the given productions as NT93 -> NT44 NT14, and also NT93 -> NT49 NT27. But no, I don't see any direct production for t61 from NT93. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the list more carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT21 -> NT39 NT65, which leads to t29 and other things. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps t61 comes from NT93, which has two options, neither of which directly produce t61. So maybe I'm wrong about that. Alternatively, I might have to backtrack.\n\nWait, let's look again. The token t61 is found under NT58: NT58 -> NT5 NT85. NT5 leads to t14, and NT85 is in another production. Wait, but I'm not seeing t61 as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that can directly produce t61. Scanning through all the NT productions, I don't see any production where an NT directly becomes t61. So maybe t61 comes from a longer chain.\n\nLooking deeper, NT93 \u2192 NT44 NT14. NT44 has productions, like NT44 \u2192 NT49 NT25, and so on. So let's see. For example, NT44 can go to NT25 NT25, and NT25 can go to NT31 NT5, and so on. But I'm not seeing t61 in the terminal string.\n\nWait, perhaps t61 comes from NT26, which leads to t44 or t29. Or maybe not. Let me map this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong branch. Let me approach this differently. The string starts with t61. To get t61, there must be a non-terminal that leads to it. But from the given productions, none of the NTs directly produce t61. This makes me think that perhaps the string is invalid because t61 cannot be derived from any NT in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT productions for t61. Going through the list:\n\nLooking for where a terminal t61 is a result. Hmm, I don't see an NT production that directly leads to t61. The closest is NT26 \u2192 t29, but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string was supposed to have t61 somehow, but looking through the productions, perhaps t61 can come from NT93 through a chain, but it's not present in the string's tokens.\n\nWait, looking at the string again: t61, t73, t7, t13, t14, t15. Let me see the possible terminals for each.\n\nt61: Not directly produced by any NT. Maybe this token is invalid, so the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I overlooked something. Let me check each NT again to see if any path leads to a t61.\n\nWait, NT93 \u2192 NT44 NT14. NT44 can go to NT49 NT25 or NT37 NT25, etc. NT49 can go to t12, which is a terminal? Wait, looking at the productions: NT49 \u2192 t74. Wait, no, production NT49 \u2192 t74? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT49 \u2192 t74. So NT49 \u2192 t74. NT74 has productions like \u2192 t30, etc. Wait, no, NT74 in the productions includes: NT74 \u2192 t75, which is the same as S \u2192 NT74.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me try to track back from t61.\n\nSince NT61 isn't part of any NT production except perhaps if I look for a path. Wait, maybe I should consider that t61 is derived from some NT, but I don't see any NTs that generate t61. Therefore, the token t61 can't be part of the language defined by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-80","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the string \"t70 t75 t54 t50 t63\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar seems to fit this form because each production either results in two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t70, t75, t54, t50, t63. Each of these must be derived from the grammar.\n\nI notice that each production in the grammar that ends with a terminal leads to a specific 't' string. So, for example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. But NT3 and NT77 are non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. I'll need to track how each of these non-terminals can generate the required 't' strings.\n\nLet me look at the productions for each 't' symbol mentioned:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t7 (from production rule NT70 -> t7)\n- NT75 \u2192 t75 (from NT75 -> t75)\n- NT54 \u2192 t54 (from NT54 -> t54)\n- NT50 \u2192 t50 (from NT50 -> t50)\n- NT63 \u2192 t63 (from NT63 -> t63)\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT63 is not present. Hmm, looking back, I see that NT26\u2192t44 and NT26 appears in some productions. Wait, maybe I missed that. Let me check again.\n\nNo, actually, the terminal symbols are all listed at the end, like NT3 -> t17, NT67->t56, etc. So each production for a non-terminal either ends in a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo, to generate 't70 t75 t54 t50 t63', each of these must come from the top-level productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the string starts with t70, which would come from NT3 or NT77.\n\nLooking at the productions under NT3:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nSo, NT3 can't directly produce t70. Hmm, maybe I need another way. Let me see what produces t70.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT70 \u2192 t7. So, to get 't70', we look for a non-terminal that produces t70. Checking the list, I see NT70 \u2192 t70. Wait, no, the production is NT70\u2192 t70? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT70 is written as NT70 -> t70. So NT70 directly produces t70. Similarly, NT75 directly produces t75, NT54\u2192t54, etc.\n\nSo, to get t70, we can use NT70.\n\nSo the string can be generated by using NT70, NT75, NT54, NT50, NT63.\n\nNow, let me see where these non-terminals come from.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is split into two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. So the string starts with whatever NT3 produces and then NT77.\n\nBut the string starts with t70, which would require NT3 to produce t70. But looking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT58 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t8, or NT6\u2192t63, or via other steps.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string: t70 t75 t54 t50 t63.\n\nEach of these terminals is produced by a specific NT. So, the string can be thought of as:\n\nt70 (NT70) \u2192 t70\n\nt75 (NT75) \u2192 t75\n\nt54 (NT54) \u2192 t54\n\nt50 (NT50) \u2192 t50\n\nt63 (NT63) \u2192 t63\n\nWait, but wait, in the grammar, NT63 is not present. Looking back, I see NT63 is not listed. Let me check all the productions:\n\nWait, none of the productions end with t63 except maybe somewhere I missed.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t63. So this might be a problem. Because our string ends with t63, which is supposed to come from NT63, but if NT63 isn't a terminal and doesn't directly produce t63, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Looking through all the productions, I don't see NT63 as a terminal. So, maybe NT63 is a non-terminal, which would need to be derived from other non-terminals. But if all the productions of NT63 are to other non-terminals, then it can't produce a terminal symbol. So unless there's a direct production for NT63 \u2192 t63, which there isn't, t63 can't appear in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. Oh, I see production NT54 \u2192 t54, but NT63 is missing. So, if the string has t63, but there's no production that produces t63, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I just noticed that in the given grammar, NT54 is listed as having a production NT54 \u2192 t54, which is correct. But nowhere do I see a production for NT63 \u2192 t63.\n\nTherefore, t63 cannot be generated by this grammar because there's no non-terminal NT63 that directly produces t63, and no NT63 exists in the grammar to produce t63. So, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the production rules again to see if NT63 exists. Going through the list:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT54\n\nNT54 \u2192 t54\n\nWait, that's what I see. So NT54 produces t54, but what about t63? It doesn't seem to appear in any production besides as a terminal for NT54. Wait, NT54\u2192t54, which is correct. But nowhere is t63 defined as a terminal, except maybe in the list above.\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT26\u2192t44, and some others. But for t63, there's NT54\u2192t54, NT63\u2192t63, but does NT63 exist?\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see NT63 being a non-terminal. All other non-terminals are like NT3, NT67, etc. So, unless I made a mistake, t63 can't be produced because there's no NT63 in the grammar that directly produces t63.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t70 t75 t54 t50 t63\" can't be generated because t63 isn't in the grammar. But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait another thing: Maybe t63 is derived from a longer chain. But in the given grammar, all non-terminals eventually lead to terminals except for those that directly produce terminals. So, if there's no NT63 production that leads to t63, then t63 can't appear.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I don't see NT63 as a terminal or as a non-terminal. So, unless I'm mistaken, the string has t63, which isn't present.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-examine the grammar. The grammar is structured so that each non-terminal either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see NT63. Only NT54 produces t54, and others like NT70 produce t70. So, NT63 isn't in the grammar, so t63 can't appear.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, I see NT54\u2192t54, which is correct. So, for the string to include t63, there must be a production that produces t63, but I don't see it. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the string has t63, which isn't possible, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S because it's the one that the derivation starts with. So S is the root, and we can expand it step by step.\n\nThe string provided consists of several 't's followed by numbers. These seem to be terminal symbols. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals into terminals.\n\nLet me map out each terminal in the string:\n\nt50, t54, t42, t75, t70, t75, t16.\n\nSo, I need to create a leftmost derivation from S, expanding non-terminals to terminals and seeing if I can arrive at this exact sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts with S -> NT3 NT77.

Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar is in Chomsky normal form if all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because each production has two non-terminals on the right side except for the terminals. So that's good, but I still have to see how the string is formed.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't's followed by numbers, like `t30`, `t68`, etc. I notice that some of these correspond to non-terminals that have a direct terminal production. For example, NT3 is 't17' because looking at the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6 and also NT3 -> 't17' so wait, no, that's actually a production from NT3 to 't17'. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nAh, in the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6, and also in the same part, NT3 is shown as -> 't17'. Hmm, that must be a mistake because in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, maybe it's redundant here, but for our purposes, we can proceed.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to try to derive the string step by step. The string is `t30 t68 t9 t71 t7 t15 t9`. Let's parse it token by token and see if each token can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLet's list the tokens in order: t30, t68, t9, t71, t7, t15, t9.\n\nI'll need to see if each 't' token can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce 't...' terminals.\n\nFor example, NT36 -> 't10' (from the grammar: NT36 -> NT70 NT33 and also NT36 -> 't50')? Wait, no, in the grammar I see:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I spot several non-terminals that are directly producing certain 't' terms:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17' (from the rule NT3 -> NT17 NT6) and also NT3 -> 't17'. Wait, no, let me find all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT17 NT6 and also, in the same section, perhaps directly 't17'? No, maybe it's a production rule like NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, but I also see NT3 \u2192 't17'? Or is that a separate rule? Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I should scan all production rules for any that produce a terminal directly without non-terminals.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT20 -> 't65' (from NT20 -> NT44 NT36 and also NT20 \u2192 't65'? No, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan each rule line by line.\n\nFor example, the rule NT3 -> 't17' is not present. Instead, looking at each step:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT58 -> 't54' (from the line NT58 -> NT5 NT85)\n- NT83 -> 't44' and 't14' (from NT83 -> NT44 NT14)\n- NT98 -> 't93' and 't16' (from NT98 -> NT93 NT16)\n- NT54 -> 't8' and 'nt...'\n\nWait, it's a bit messy. Maybe a better approach is to compile a list of all non-terminals that produce any terminal, including the specific 't' terms in the string.\n\nLet's go through the production rules line by line and see which have terminals as their right-hand sides.\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-118","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar provided, it's definitely in CNF because each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminal symbols and the empty string. But wait, I see that there are some terminals in the productions, like 't37' or 't54'. So, the grammar can generate terminal strings, but in CNF, all productions must be to two non-terminals except for the base case. Hmm, but this grammar has a mix because some productions produce terminals, which is a bit confusing. Maybe the grammar isn't strictly in CNF? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Well, the question states it's in CNF, so I'll go with that, maybe the terminals are allowed as part of the grammar.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t54 t88 t8 t46 t18 t83 t88 t17`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nLet me see what the grammar looks like. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT3 NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nI can probably build a parse tree for this string, starting from the root S. Each non-terminal in the string might need to split into parts. Let me try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string has eight tokens: t54, t88, t8, t46, t18, t83, t88, t17. I'll need to see if these can be grouped into a sequence of productions from S.\n\nFirst, the top-level production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the entire string needs to be generated by expanding NT3 and NT77. Let's look at NT3 and NT77 separately.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, NT3 expands into NT17 and NT6. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, let's look at NT17 and NT6.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. NT30 is a terminal, as per the rules where NT30 \u2192 t54. Let me see, wait, no, looking back, the initial productions are for NT20, NT68, etc., but now I'm seeing more detailed ones. Wait, perhaps I need to map all the way down.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking at the string and seeing if it can be split into segments that match each production. Let's try to split the string into possible components.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must start with NT3 generating some parts, followed by NT77 generating others.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So the first part of the string should be generated by NT17 and NT6.\n\nLooking at NT17, it's NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. NT30 \u2192 t54, and NT50 \u2192 t63. Wait, in the production rules, NT8 is defined as NT30 NT50, and NT30 is t54, and NT50 is t63. So, NT8 would produce t54 t63.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT24. Wait, looking at NT58's production: NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT24. Then, NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT39, and so on. Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to see if any of the segments in the string match directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\n2. So, the string starts with NT3 and followed by NT77.\n\nNow, let's parse NT3 first: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo, the string's first part would be NT17 and then NT6.\n\nLooking at NT6: according to the rules, NT6 \u2192 t63. So NT6 produces 't63'.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. NT30 \u2192 t54, NT50 \u2192 t63.\n\nSo, NT8 \u2192 't54' 't63'.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT22 NT24. NT24 is t24? Wait, looking at the production rules, I see NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT24. Now, NT24 doesn't expand further; wait, looking through the grammar, is NT24 a terminal? Or does it produce another non-terminal?\n\nWait, going through the list, I see NT24 isn't directly present as a production rule except as part of other productions. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't find NT24, so maybe it's another non-terminal. Wait, looking at NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT39, and so on. So, NT22 doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the production rules. Let me check if any of the NT productions directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t63\n- NT74 \u2192 t75\n- NT98 \u2192 t93\n- NT55? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, the rules have NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, etc. Nowhere does NT24 or NT22 directly produce a terminal, except NT30 and NT50 which do. So, NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT24, but both are non-terminals, so NT58 would expand into further non-terminals until we hit terminals.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then parsing the string would require that. So, the string after NT3 (which is 't54 t63' plus whatever NT17 produces) would have to be matched against the rest.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is t54 t88 t8 t46 t18 t83 t88 t17. So, the first part is t54, which matches NT6.\n\nThen, after that, perhaps it's NT8, which is 't54 t63', but the next is 't88', not 't8' (which is NT8). Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the second token is 't88'. So after 't54', we have 't88', which doesn't seem to align with NT8 being 't54 t63'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, then we have NT17 and NT6 to expand.\n\nNT6 is 't63', as per the rule NT6 \u2192 t63.\n\nBut the string starts with 't54', so 't54' is matched against NT6, so that would mean we have NT6 expanded as 't54', and then maybe the string needs to continue.\n\nWait, maybe the parsing is done in a way where NT3 can lead to other possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at each step more carefully.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't54', which could come from NT3's NT6, as per NT6 \u2192 t63. But wait, that's 't63', but here it's 't54', so that wouldn't work. Alternatively, is there another production for NT6? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking back, indeed NT6's production is only NT6 \u2192 t63. So NT6 produces only 't63'. So, the first token must be 't63'. But the string starts with 't54', so that's a problem. Wait, but maybe my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the S is NT3 and NT77, each of which can produce parts. So, the entire string needs to be built from the expansion of NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54', so that must come from either NT3 or NT77. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT77: it's NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25.\n\nNT49 \u2192 t74, and NT25 \u2192 t24?\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I don't see any terminal symbols for NT25 or NT49 except where explicitly defined. Wait, the production for NT49 is NT49 \u2192 t74, yes, because looking at the rules, I see line 13: `NT49 -> t74`.

I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), and I need to determine if the string \"t14 t13 t44 t35 t60 t65 t70 t8\" is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side. All non-terminals are on the left-hand side. Also, in CNF, all productions start with a capital letter and have exactly two symbols ( terminals or non-terminals ) on the right.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's mostly structured in that way.

For example, NT14 produces t14. But there's no NT13 in the grammar. That's a problem because if 't13' isn't the terminal of any non-terminal, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.

Each non-terminal (like S, NT20, etc.) has a production rule that breaks it down into two other non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, except for 'NTX' which are non-terminals.\n\nMy approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if it can be broken down into the non-terminals present in the grammar. I'll try to split the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is `t18 t75 t50 t14 t75 t56 t79 t32 t88`.

So in the string, t18 must correspond to NT18's production. But according to the given rules, NT18 \u2192 t8. So that doesn't make sense unless I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, I think I got it mixed up. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT18 \u2192 t8.

The string provided is \"t54 t63 t46 t60 t30 t12 t88 t50 t17 t32\". I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to see the possible derivations. The string is a sequence of t-commands, so each token like 't54' corresponds to a specific symbol in the grammar. I think each 'tX' in the string represents a terminal symbol, so I need to trace back through the grammar to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT3 NT77. So the first step is to see if the string starts with 't54' which is the terminal, so I need to trace back what NT3 and NT77 can produce.\n\nWait, no, the string is a sequence of t symbols, which are results of the grammar's derivations. So each 'tX' must result from replacing a sequence of non-terminals down to a terminal.\n\nI'll break down the string into individual tokens: t54, t63, t46, t60, t30, t12, t88, t50, t17, t32.\n\nI should check each token to see what non-terminals they can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT54 -> t9 (from the grammar: NT54 -> t9)\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT54 is a production that goes to t9. So if 't54' is the result, that could be from NT54 -> t9.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's 't54', which is the terminal, so perhaps that comes from NT54's production. So let me check what NT54 produces. In the grammar, NT54 -> t9. So that's not helpful because t9 is not the same as t54. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait no, perhaps each 'tX' in the string is the result of a derivation where a non-terminal expanded to a tX. So for each 'tX' in the string, I need to see if that tX is a terminal that can be produced by some NT. So let's list all the 'tX's and see their possible NTs.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\nNT54 -> t9 (no match with t54)\nNT58 -> t54 (Ah, yes! NT58 can produce t54)\nNT44 -> t60\nNT37 -> t71\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, NT58: NT58 -> t54. So if there's a t54, it comes from NT58.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t54, so that must come from NT58.\n\nNow the first token is t54, which is from NT58.\n\nNow, to get to NT58, let's see what NT58 expands into. Looking at the grammar, NT58 is a terminal, right? Wait, no: looking at the grammar, I think NT58 is a non-terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT58 is defined as t54, so it's a terminal. But in the string, t54 is a terminal, so that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT58: Yes, NT58 -> t54. So NT58 is a non-terminal that produces t54.\n\nSo in the derivation, we'd have S -> NT3 NT77. Then NT3 and NT77 would need to generate the tokens following t54. But wait, the order of tokens in the string is t54 t63 t46 t60 t30 t12 t88 t50 t17 t32. So the first token is t54, which is from NT58. Then, is there a production that has NT58 followed by something that produces the next token, t63?\n\nLooking at the NTs, what do they produce:\n\n- NT63: from looking through the grammar, I don't see NT63 being a terminal, but perhaps it's an NT that produces a t symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nEach 'tX' in the string must be the result of replacing a non-terminal in the derivation. So for each 'tX', I need to find which non-terminal can produce that terminal.\n\nSo let's list all the 'tX's:\n\n1. t54: Looking for NT that produces t54. From the grammar, NT58 -> t54. So t54 comes from NT58.\n\n2. t63: Looking for NT that produces t63. Checking the grammar, NT49 -> t63. So t63 comes from NT49.\n\n3. t46: Looking for NT that produces t46. I don't see any NT that directly produces t46. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's check all NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> t44 and t29\n- NT40 -> t90\n- NT67 -> t56\n- NT65 -> t46\n- NT37: Not a terminal, as it has NTs.\n- NT51: No, that produces t98 and t26.\n\nWait, let me check each NT:\n\n- NT54 -> t9 \u2192 No, t54 is from NT58.\n- NT55: Not present.\n- NT18:NT18->t8\n- NT65->t46: Yes, NT65 -> t46.\n\nSo t46 comes from NT65.\n\n4. t60: Looking for NT that produces t60. NT44 -> t60.\n\n5. t30: Looking for NT. NT77 can produce t30 through NT77 -> NT68 NT44, and then NT68 can produce t77 and NT44 can produce t60, but perhaps directly, NT30 can produce t30? Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT directly producing t30 except NT30 itself. Wait, does any NT directly produce t30?\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT25: Doesn't produce t30.\n- NT30: I think NT30 is a terminal? Wait, let me check the grammar. NT30's productions:\n\nNT30: Check the grammar, I don't see NT30 as a non-terminal; instead, NT30 is used in some rules, like NT68->NT49 NT25, etc. Wait, maybe NT30 is a terminal. Let's see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, when you have NT30, is it a terminal or a non-terminal? For example, NT25->NT31 NT5. So NT25 is non-terminal. Looking for NT that directly produce t30: Maybe NT30 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT30 is used as a non-terminal, but in the grammar, it's in productions like NT68->NT49 NT25, etc. So perhaps NT30 is a terminal because none of the productions for NT30 have a non-terminal except in the case of NT30 itself. Wait, but looking, for example:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NTs expand into other NTs, others produce t symbols.\n\nNT25-> NT31 NT5\nBut looking for NTs that directly produce t30:\n\nFrom the grammar, does any NT directly expand into t30? Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for the production NT30:\n\nI don't see an explicit rule like NT30 -> t30 in the grammar. The production for NT30 is likely within some other rule. For example, looking:\n\nDo any NT rules include NT30 as a terminal? Let's see:\n\nLooking through each rule, it seems that NT30 appears as a part of other productions but doesn't directly produce t30. So perhaps t30 is from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's see:\n\nWe have t30 in the string. We need to see if any NT directly produces t30. If not, maybe t30 is the result of a longer derivation, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back: the string is t54 t63 t46 t60 t30 t12 t88 t50 t17 t32.\n\nEach 'tX' is a terminal, so each must be produced by a non-terminal.

The string is `t32 t88 t69 t61 t56 t42 t56 t51 t9 t27 t10`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined by a set of productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is a sequence of terminals or non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the productions are already in CNF. Each production on the left side (like S, NT20, etc.) is either transforming into two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Some non-terminals like NT3, NT6, etc., directly correspond to terminal symbols like 't17', 't63', and so on.\n\nMy task is to check if the string `t32 t88 t69 t61 t56 t42 t56 t51 t9 t27 t10` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll check each symbol in the string to see if any of them are non-terminals that need to be expanded beyond a single terminal. From the grammar, the non-terminals are all NT... symbols and S. The terminals are 't' followed by two numbers.\n\nLooking at each symbol:\n\n- t32: Check if present in the grammar as a direct production. Looking through the productions, I see NT77 \u2192 t32. So t32 can be generated directly.\n- t88: Looking for a production NT with a rule that ends with t88. Checking, NT49 \u2192 t88.\n- t69: Looking for non-terminal productions ending with t69. NT65 \u2192 t69.\n- t61: Check if any NT \u2192 t61. NT85 \u2192 t61.\n- t56: Check NT58 (since NT58 \u2192 t5. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, NT56 isn't a variable; the terminals are like t56. Wait, looking at the productions for NT56, I don't see it in the list. Perhaps I misread. Wait, the productions are listed as NT58 \u2192 t54, but I don't see NT56 in the RHS except as a terminal. Wait, looking back, I see NT15 \u2192 t73, etc. I think in the grammar, the terminals are the t symbols, so for non-terminals like NT56, there's no production with NT56 on LHS. So does that mean NT56 can only produce t56?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, some NT symbols go into t symbols. For example, NT98 \u2192 t93, NT93 \u2192 t54, etc. So for non-terminals that are t followed by two numbers like t56, I need to check if any NT non-terminal has a production where it's directly replaced by that t... symbol.\n\nWait, the problem is that some of the string's elements are like t32, t88, etc., so they need to be directly derived from a single NT production. Let me go through each symbol:\n\n- t32: Yes, NT77 \u2192 t32\n- t88: Yes, NT49 \u2192 t88\n- t69: Yes, NT65 \u2192 t69\n- t61: Yes, NT85 \u2192 t61\n- t56: Check if there's an NT that produces t56. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT56 on the LHS, except as a terminal. Wait, the productions only have NTs on the LHS, so to produce t56, we must have an NT production that results in t56. Looking at all the productions, I don't see any NT with RHS t56 except in the list as ND56 (but that's a terminal), so does that mean that t56 is a terminal and cannot be expanded further? Or perhaps NT54 \u2192 t83 and t98, but not t56.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for RHS t56. The productions for NT15 produce t73, NT22 produces t71 and others. Hmm, I don't see any production that ends with t56, except perhaps NT67 \u2192 t82 t44. No, that's two symbols. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me go through each symbol in the string and see if any cannot be derived directly or if there's an issue with the expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree for the given string, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if it can derive the string by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first step is to split S into these two non-terminals, making the string split as (NT3)(NT77). \n\nSo the string starts as t32 t88 t69 t61 t56 t42 t56 t51 t9 t27 t10.\n\nNow, the first part is t32, which is the production of NT77 (since NT77 \u2192 t32). So for the first part, that's one leaf.\n\nThe second part in the parse tree is NT77. Looking at the productions for NT77, it's NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So to produce t88, which is the next terminal in the string after t32, the NT44 must produce t88. Checking the production for NT44: NT44 \u2192 t88, so that works.\n\nSo after two steps, we have t32 (from NT77) and t88 (from NT44), so the next symbol in the string after these is t69.\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string after t32 and t88 is t69. The next non-terminal in the string after that would be NT65, as the second part of S: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, so the second part is NT44, which then becomes t88, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Perhaps a better approach is to list the string as a sequence of symbols and try to match them step by step.\n\nWait, the string is t32 t88 t69 t61 t56 t42 t56 t51 t9 t27 t10. \n\nSince S \u2192 NT3 NT77, both NT3 and NT77 must produce the two parts of the string, in order. So the first symbol t32 comes from NT3, and the second symbol t88 comes from NT77.\n\nWait, that's not exactly right because NT77 produces some non-terminals, which may derive into other symbols. Let me correct this: S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the parse tree starts with NT3 followed by NT77. Therefore, the first symbol of the string is generated by NT3, and the next symbol is generated by NT77.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 will split into NT17 and NT6.\n\nThen, the first symbol t32 is generated by NT77's first symbol, which is NT68, and that's part of NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So NT68 must produce t32, and NT44 must produce t88. Let's verify:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. So NT68 \u2192 NT49 and NT25. NT49 must produce t88? Wait, NT49 \u2192 t88? Looking at the productions, yes, NT49 \u2192 t88.\n\nThen, for the second symbol t88, that's correct.\n\nNow, the third symbol in the string is t69, which must come from NT6's expansion. Wait, no, because NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, so the next symbols are t32 (from NT77), then t88, and then the third symbol t69 would come from NT6's expansion.\n\nWait, let me outline this:\n\nThe entire string is t32 t88 t69 t61 t56 t42 t56 t51 t9 t27 t10.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string starts with NT3's expansion and then NT77's.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo the string is t32 t88 t69 ...\n\nWait, let me try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-180","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t61 t18 t87 t22 t61 t61 t87 t46 t70 t17 t46`. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all given. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and some other symbols like NT followed by numbers or the t's.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. So I need to see if these 't's and numbers can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, the grammar's productions start with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S is initially split into NT3 and NT77. Each of these will be rewritten into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet's look at the productions for NT3 and NT77. NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT6 is a terminal, so that's straightforward. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. Wait, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. So NT8 can become t30 and t50? Or do I have to look further? Wait, from the grammar, NT8 is a non-terminal, so I need to see what it produces. Looking back, NT8 has multiple productions: NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, but also NT8 \u2192 NT20 NT15, but at the bottom of the list, I see NT83 -> 't13', NT85 -> 't16', etc., but NT8 is earlier: NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, but other NTs like NT83 and NT85 are also present.\n\nWait, let me try to see if I can work through the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt61 t18 t87 t22 t61 t61 t87 t46 t70 t17 t46.\n\nI'll write it down as a list of tokens: ['t61', 't18', 't87', 't22', 't61', 't61', 't87', 't46', 't70', 't17', 't46'].\n\nStarting from S, which is NT3 NT77, so the initial split is NT3 and NT77. Each of these needs to be expanded until I get all terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nLet's look at NT3 first. From the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT6 is 't63', so that's a terminal. So NT3 can be rewritten as NT17 t63.\n\nNow, looking at NT17, it's defined as NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So that's another split.\n\nNT8: Looking at the grammar, NT8 has several productions, but wait, in the given list, I see NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. Wait, but in the provided grammar, NT8's productions are:\n\nLooking at the list:\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50 (first occurrence)\nAlso, I see later:\nNT83 \u2192 't13', but that's a different NT. So for NT8, it's initially defined as NT30 NT50.\n\nSo NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nNow, NT30: Checking the grammar, NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT25.\n\nWait, no, looking through the grammar, I see NT30 \u2192 NT65. Wait, let me check. Oh, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT30 -> t54 (since in the list, 't54' is defined as NT30). Or wait, no, looking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT30, I see:\n\n\"NT30 -> t54\" \u2013 wait, in the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT30 -> t54 is one line, meaning NT30 is a terminal. Is that correct? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\nI see NT30 -> t54 (Yes, it's one of the productions). So NT30 is a terminal 't54'.\n\nSo NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50 = 't54' NT50.\n\nBut wait, NT50 is another non-terminal, so I need to expand NT50.\n\nLooking at NT50 in the grammar, I don't see an explicit production. Wait, do I? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT50 -> t24? No, I don't see a production for NT50 except maybe I missed it. Wait, let's scan through the provided grammar lines for NT50.\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\n\"NT50 -> t24\" \u2013 Yes, there's a production: line 64: NT50 -> t24. So NT50 is a terminal 't24'.\n\nSo, putting it together, NT8 \u2192 't54' 't24' \u2192 t54 t24.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't18', 't87', etc., so 't54' and 't24' would not appear in the string. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing NTs with terminals. Wait, in the grammar, some lines like NT85 -> 't16' mean that NT85 is a terminal 't16'. Similarly, NT77 -> 't32' means NT77 is a terminal 't32'.\n\nSo let me try again.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 NT17 NT6 NT77 (since NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6).\n\nThen, NT77 is another non-terminal, so we need to expand that as well. NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo now, the string is building up as NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider building a parse tree, but with this many steps, maybe it's easier to see if the string is a concatenation of possible terminal sequences derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string again: t61 t18 t87 t22 t61 t61 t87 t46 t70 t17 t46.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar. Each 't' must come from a production that eventually results in a terminal symbol, possibly through multiple steps. Also, sequences of terminals must match in the correct order as per the grammar.\n\nFor example, the first token is t61. So I need to see if t61 is a rule for any NT. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't32' but not 't61'.\n\nWait, let's find which NTs are terminals.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't32' (line 42: NT77 -> NT68 NT44; wait, that's a production, but also other lines.\n\nWait, let's scan each line and mark if the NT is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT18 \u2192 't8'\n- NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36\n- NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\n- NT36 \u2192 ... and other lines, but it's a long list.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait, I have to go through each rule one by one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal to its production.\n\nLet's go through each terminal in the string and find their productions.\n\n1. t83 \u2192 NT74 NT16\n\n2. t60 \u2192 NT44\n\n3. t70 \u2192 NT17 NT58\n\n4. t74 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n\n5. t83 \u2192 NT74 NT16 (same as first)\n\n6. t90 \u2192 NT25 NT33\n\n7. t18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n\n8. t68 \u2192 NT44 NT36\n\n9. t65 \u2192 NT77 NT2\n\n10. t63 \u2192 NT49 NT98\n\n11. t88 \u2192 NT49\n\n12. t46 \u2192 NT26\n\nSo now, starting from S, which is NT3 NT3 NT3 (S->NT3 NT3 NT3). Wait, no, wait:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and looking at the productions, S \u2192 NT3 NT3 NT3, wait: S -> NT3 NT3 NT3? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S -> NT3 NT3 NT3. So S starts as three NT3s.\n\nSo S expands into three NT3 non-terminals. Each NT3 can expand into other non-terminals or eventually produce a terminal.\n\nFor each NT3, the production is:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nSo each NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo expanding S gives NT17 NT6 NT17 NT6 NT17 NT6 (since S is NT3 NT3 NT3).\n\nWait, no, S is NT3 NT3 NT3, each expanding into NT3, which is NT17 NT6, so S would become NT17 NT6 NT17 NT6 NT17 NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string we have is:\n\nt83 t60 t70 t74 t83 t90 t18 t68 t65 t63 t88 t46\n\nEach t is a terminal and must be generated by some NT. So I'll need to find a sequence of rule applications that start from S and derive this string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of terminals, each step must produce a terminal, so perhaps it's easier to work backwards, checking if the string can be split into symbols that match the productions.\n\nGiven the string is 12 symbols long, and each production is either two symbols (like AB) or one (A \u2192 a), so when we derive, each step could split the symbols into parts. Let's try to see if we can break down the string into possible productions.\n\nStarting with the entire string: [t83 t60 t70 t74 t83 t90 t18 t68 t65 t63 t88 t46]\n\nLet me label them as positions 1 to 12.\n\n1: t83\n2: t60\n3: t70\n4: t74\n5: t83\n6: t90\n7: t18\n8: t68\n9: t65\n10: t63\n11: t88\n12: t46\n\nNow, let's see what each position can be derived from.\n\nLooking at t83: must come from NT74 NT16.\n\nt60: comes from NT44.\n\nt70: comes from NT17 NT58.\n\nt74: comes from NT23 NT16.\n\nt83 again: NT74 NT16.\n\nt90: NT25 NT33.\n\nt18: NT68 NT82.\n\nt68: NT44 NT36.\n\nt65: NT77 NT2.\n\nt63: NT49 NT98.\n\nt88: NT49.\n\nt46: NT26.\n\nSo let's see if we can find a way from S to this sequence.\n\nFirst, let's consider the start symbol S, which is NT3 NT3 NT3.\n\nEach NT3 can go to NT17 NT6.\n\nSo S would expand into NT17 NT6 NT17 NT6 NT17 NT6.\n\nNow, each NT17 can go to NT8 NT58, and NT6 may go to t63 (if NT6 \u2192 t63? Wait, looking back, what's NT6's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT6 having a production to t63. Hmm, let's check NT6.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT6 is used in some rules:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48 or others.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, perhaps NT6 doesn't have a production to a terminal directly. So maybe NT6 is further expanded into non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check which non-terminals have terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5 and others; it doesn't produce a terminal yet.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to make a list of each non-terminal and their possible productions to terminals.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see which ones produce terminals:\n\n- NT65 \u2192 t77 (from NT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2; when NT77 \u2192 something else"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t15 t9 t14 t70 t27 t68 t60 t9 t74 t65 t7 t61`, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This means every production either combines two non-terminals or is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the production rules are in CNF because each rule either produces two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT3 NT37) or a single terminal (like NT3 \u2192 't17'). So, the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is generated by this grammar, I can approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since the string has a sequence of terminals, I'll need to find a derivation path that matches each token in order.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which expands to NT3 NT37. So, the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT37\n\nBut the string starts with `t15`, so after expanding S, we need to see if NT3 can derive `t15` and NT37 can derive the remaining tokens. Let's check NT3:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, to get `t15` from NT3, let's check the productions for NT17. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65. NT49 \u2192 't12', and NT65 \u2192 't46'. So, the derivation for NT3 is:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65\nNT49 \u2192 't12'\nNT65 \u2192 't46'\n\nSo NT3 can derive `t12 t46`. But the first token is `t15`, not `t12`, so this path doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I took the wrong approach. Instead of trying to directly match the first token, perhaps I should consider the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can think of it as a series of productions where each terminal is a result of a production. Let me list the tokens in the string in order:\n\n1. t15\n2. t9\n3. t14\n4. t70\n5. t27\n6. t68\n7. t60\n8. t9\n9. t74\n10. t65\n11. t7\n12. t61\n\nSo, starting from S, which is NT3 NT37, I need to see if I can derive these terminals in order.\n\nBut the problem is that the string has 12 tokens, but the grammar likely constructs the string step by step, combining non-terminals into terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to reconstruct the parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t15. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t15? Wait, not directly, because most non-terminals produce two non-terminals except where they are terminals. Wait no, in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So looking at the grammar, the rules where a non-terminal is a terminal are where NT3 \u2192 't17', NT8 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nSo, t15 is a terminal, so it must come from a production where the right-hand side is just 't15'. Looking at the grammar, does any NT rule produce 't15'? Let's search the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only NT rules that are terminals are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n- NT14 \u2192 't70' (Wait, NT14's production is NT59? Wait no, looking back, let me check all the NT rules.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me list all the NT rules where they produce a single terminal:\n\nFrom the grammar provided:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n- NT14 \u2192 't70'\n- NT22 \u2192 't78'\n- NT31 \u2192 't14' (Wait, NT31 produces NT37 NT5, but NT37 produces NT83 NT40, and so on, eventually producing 't14').\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build a table of which NT rules produce each terminal.\n\nBut that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be derived from S by a series of expansions.\n\nWait, the string has 12 tokens, so it's possible that the derivation is quite long.\n\nLet me try to see if I can find which NT rules can produce each terminal in the string.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with t15. Looking for an NT rule that can produce t15 directly, which I don't see in the grammar because all NT rules either produce two NTs or a single terminal, and 't15' doesn't seem to be directly a single terminal of any NT.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't78' and NT54 \u2192 't83', etc. Let me check the grammar for any NT rule that directly produces t15. Scanning through:\n\nLooking for any NT rule with RHS as 't15':\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't22' and other options.\n- NT77 \u2192 't32' (Wait, no, NT77 \u2192 't32' is one option)\nWait, perhaps I should check all the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only explicit terminal productions are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't61' (Wait, looking at NT21's production, it's 't29')\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the grammar has a lot of rules where NT produce a terminal plus another NT.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, for example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT0 \u2192 't8'\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT21 \u2192 't39'\n- NT22 \u2192 't71' and 't78' (since NT22 has multiple productions)\n- NT23 \u2192 't29'\n- NT25 \u2192 't50' and others\n- NT26 \u2192 't44' and 't22' and others\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT44 \u2192 't60' and others\n- NT45 \u2192 No, wait, the highest I saw was NT70 producing t78.\n\nWait, looking at the NT rules, none of them directly produce 't15' as a terminal. That's a problem because our string starts with 't15', but if none of the NT rules directly produce 't15', then the string can't be generated. So if the first symbol in the string is 't15', but there's no NT rule that directly produces 't15', then the answer is No.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because I might have made a mistake in the interpretation. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar again:\n\nLooking for any occurrence where RHS is 't15'.\n\nIn the grammar, all the NT production rules are either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17' \u2192 No 't15'\n- NT5 \u2192 't14' \u2192 No\n- NT7 \u2192 Wait, looking at the grammar, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule systematically.\n\nLooking for any rule where the RHS is just 't15':\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't8' \u2192 No\n- NT2 \u2192 't69' \u2192 No\n- NT3 \u2192 't17' \u2192 No\n- NT5 \u2192 't14' \u2192 No\n- NT7 \u2192 't61' \u2192 No\n- NT8 \u2192 't8' \u2192 No\n- NT9 \u2192 Not in the grammar? Wait, the grammar rules are for specific NTs, like NT20, NT22, etc. So perhaps NT rules don't directly produce 't15'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT54 \u2192 't83' and others don't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that 't15' isn't directly produced by any NT rule, so the string cannot be generated.

The string to check is `t7 t63 t8 t90 t60 t83 t35 t60 t54 t18 t68 t74 t24`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a lot of rules where non-terminals produce two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. This is straightforward in CNF. Similarly, NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, which is also in CNF. \n\nSome non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For instance, NT3 \u2192 't17'. Wait, no, in the last part, after NT3, there's a rule like NT3 -> 't17'. So that's a terminal production.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is followed by a number, like t7, t63, etc. My task is to see if the entire string can be derived using the given grammar.\n\nTo do this, I might need to see how the string can be built up step by step using the production rules. But given that the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to check if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string as a series of terminals, and each terminal must correspond to a production rule in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol 't7'. I look at the productions: is there a rule that directly produces 't7'? Looking through the list, I don't see a direct production for 't7'. For example, NT93 is 't54', NT73 is 't73', etc. Hmm, maybe 't7' is produced by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's check if any non-terminal directly produces 't7'. Looking through the rules, the terminal symbols are things like 't7', 't8', 't90', etc. So 't7' must be produced by a non-terminal that has a rule ending with 't7'. \n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions, I see NT15 \u2192 't73', NT25 \u2192 't50', etc. Wait, I don't see a non-terminal producing 't7'.

Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the 'a' productions: \n\n- NT75 \u2192 't79'\n- NT44 \u2192 't60'\n- NT77 \u2192 't32'\n- NT74 \u2192 't16'\n- NT59 \u2192 't17'\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT83 \u2192 't27'\n- NT22 \u2192 't78'\n- NT31 \u2192 't14'\n- NT36 \u2192 't50'\n- NT26 \u2192 't44'\n- NT51 \u2192 't27'\n- NT83 \u2192 't51'\n- NT77 \u2192 't30'\n- NT65 \u2192 't98'\n- NT82 \u2192 't65'\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n- NT82 \u2192 't65'\n- NT67 \u2192 't82'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT44 \u2192 't68'\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't10'\n- NT23 \u2192 't29'\n- NT54 \u2192 't83'\n- NT82 \u2192 't98'\n- NT67 \u2192 't82'\n- NT26 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't18'\n- NT26 \u2192 't37'\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT23 \u2192 't18'\n  \nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me look for 't7' specifically. Scanning all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't7' (Ah, here it is)\n- NT98 \u2192 't93'\n- NT58 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo NT70 \u2192 't7'. So 't7' is produced by NT70. Therefore, the first symbol 't7' must have come from NT70.\n\nSo, in the derivation, the start symbol S must derive a string that includes NT70 somewhere. Let's see how S can produce NT70.\n\nLooking at the S rules: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S can produce NT3 and NT77.\n\nNow, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. NT5 \u2192 't14'. NT85 can produce various things. Let's track this:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\nNT85 \u2192 NT74 NT51 or other rules.\n\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, to see if 't7' is a part of the derivation, let's look at which non-terminals can produce it. NT70 \u2192 't7'. So somewhere in the derivation, we must have NT70.\n\nBut S initially is NT3 NT77. Let's see if any of these can produce NT70.\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 (from earlier rules). So S can go to NT3 NT77 \u2192 NT3 NT68 NT44.\n\nThen NT44 can be split into NT22 NT18. So S could be NT3 NT68 NT22 NT18.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this path leads to NT70. Maybe I should try to see if any of these non-terminals can eventually produce NT70.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a parsing strategy or check if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me try to build the string from the start symbol.\n\nThe string is t7 t63 t8 t90 t60 t83 t35 t60 t54 t18 t68 t74 t24.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So we can write as [NT3] [NT77].\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So now we have [NT17] [NT6] [NT77].\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So [NT8] [NT58] [NT6] [NT77].\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. So [NT8] [NT5] [NT85] [NT6] [NT77].\n\nNT5 is a terminal \u2192 't14'. So now we have 't14' [NT85] [NT6] [NT77].\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT3 NT67 (from earlier rule). So [NT3] [NT67] [NT6] [NT77].\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that each 't' must correspond to a terminal production, and perhaps the order is such that the non-terminals can chain together to produce the necessary terminals.\n\nLet me try to see which 'ts' correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't7' which is from NT70. So the initial part of the string must involve NT70.\n\nBut starting with S, I'm not sure how NT70 comes into play because S starts with NT3 NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps S can derive to NT3 NT77 \u2192 NT17 NT6 NT77 \u2192 NT8 NT58 NT6 NT77 \u2192 NT8 NT5 NT85 NT6 NT77.\n\nThen NT5 is 't14', so we have 't14' then NT85.\n\nNT85 can go to NT3 NT67.\n\nNT3 is 't17' from NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 't8' and NT58 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 't14'.\n\nWait, am I getting confused here? Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother method is to build the parse tree and see if the string can be constructed by the grammar. Each step should produce new terminals or split into non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the string as a list of symbols and try to see if each symbol can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the string:\n\n['t7', 't63', 't8', 't90', 't60', 't83', 't35', 't60', 't54', 't18',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string in question is `t22 t50 t74 t63 t65 t50 t69 t44 t54 t78 t75 t60 t42`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. CNF is a specific form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn\u2019t have any trailing symbols on the right-hand side of a production. From the grammar given, I can see that it's indeed in CNF because all the productions either result in two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, each token being something like 't22', 't50', etc. Each of these must be generated by the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol in the string must be a direct production of a single non-terminal, meaning the parse tree should be a binary tree where each internal node is a production step of CNF.\n\nSo, I think the approach here is to try to parse the string from left to right using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a simple reduction method can be used.\n\nLooking at the string: `t22 t50 t74 t63 t65 t50 t69 t44 t54 t78 t75 t60 t42`. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst token is 't22'. Looking at the grammar, where does 't22' appear? Scanning through the productions, I notice that in the last production, NT22 \u2192 t71. Wait, but in the grammar provided, there's \"NT22 -> t71\" under NT23, right? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT22, I see that it's present in multiple places, like NT22 \u2192 t71, but also NT22 \u2192 NT78. Wait, in the grammar, each production is only listed once, I think. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar: \n\n- NT22 is mentioned in two places: once as NT22 -> t71 (under NT23?), no, looking again: \n\nLooking at the productions, I find that NT22 appears in \"NT22 -> t71\" (I think this is under the last part of the grammar, but let me look: yes, in the grammar, the last part is showing NT22 -> t78 and NT23 -> t29, etc.\n\nWait, no, let me scan: under NT82 -> NT22? Not exactly. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> t33 (in NT25 -> NT50 NT33)\n- NT23 -> t29\n- NT22 -> t71\nWait, no, I think that under NT22 -> t71 is actually under NT23, perhaps I got confused. Wait, in the last part, I see:\n\nNT22 -> t71 (from NT23: yes, because looking at the grammar, under NT23, one of the productions is NT23 -> t29. Wait no, let me look again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that under the entries:\n\n- \"NT22 -> t71\"\n- \"NT23 -> t29\"\n- \"NT82 -> nt65 ...\"\n\nWait, let me check the grammar lines:\n\n- \"NT17 -> NT8 NT58\"\n- \"NT74 -> NT74 NT77\"\n- \"NT83 -> NT44 NT14\"\n- \"NT8 -> NT30 NT50\"\n- \"NT65 -> NT98 NT26\"\n- \"NT82 -> NT20 NT15\"\n- \"NT79 -> NT22 NT22\"\n- \"NT71 -> NT70 NT39\"\n- \"NT37 -> NT71 NT40\"\n- \"NT37 -> NT59 NT0\"\n- \"NT82 -> NT79 NT16\"\n- \"NT22 -> t71\"\n- \"NT23 -> t29\"\n- etc.\n\nWait, no. Under the 'NT22 ->' lines, I see:\n\n- \"NT22 -> t71\"\n- \"NT22 -> t78\" (from NT22 -> NT78)\n- \"NT22 -> NT71\"\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's list all instances where a non-terminal produces 't22' or something that leads to 't22'. Wait, 't22' is one of the terminal symbols in the string, so we need to find a production that outputs t22.\n\nLooking through all the productions for terminals:\n\n- The string starts with t22, so I need to find a production where a non-terminal A \u2192 t22. Looking through the grammar, the only production that outputs t22 is in the line \"NT22 -> t71\" and \"NT71 -> NT70 NT39\", etc. Wait, but t22 is a terminal, so to have t22 appear in the string, the CFG must have a production that directly generates t22, i.e., A \u2192 t22.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where the right-hand side is just t22. All the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or a pair of terminals. Hmm. That suggests that 't22' might not be directly generated by any non-terminal. So that would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't22' would have no production.\n\nWait, is that right? Because 't22' is part of the string, so the grammar must have a production that can produce 't22'. If none of the non-terminals produce 't22', then the string cannot be generated.\n\nLet me scan the CFG again to see if any production directly produces 't22':\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- The lines under NT22: seems that NT22 -> t71 and NT22 -> NT74 etc., but not directly t22.\n\nSimilarly, looking elsewhere, I see:\n\n- NT37 -> NT59 NT0 \u2192 but not 't37' or 't22'.\n- NT22 is mentioned in multiple productions, but none of them directly produce 't22'.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the CFG to generate 't22' because there's no production that directly outputs 't22'.

{"custom_id":"request-242","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S. The string to check is \"t46 t14 t68 t54 t75 t24 t17 t68 t50 t27 t60 t65 t17 t8\".\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many symbols (like NT20, NT68, etc.) eventually resolve to terminal symbols (like t14, t68, etc.). My approach should be to see if the string can be derived by expanding the grammar step by step.\n\nStarting with the string, the first symbol is t46. In the grammar, t46 is produced by NT26 \u2192 t46. So, the first symbol comes from NT26.\n\nLooking for NT26 in the grammar, indeed, NT26 \u2192 NT54 and NT54. Wait, let me check: NT26 -> NT54? Wait, in the grammar, I see NT26's productions. Let me scan through:\n\nNT26:\n- NT26 -> NT54\n- Also, other entries? Checking the list, yes, NT26 -> NT44, NT26 -> NT37, etc. Wait, no, looking again: \n\nLooking through the NT26 productions:\n- NT26 -> NT54\n- Also, in one case, NT26 -> t44 (but t44 is a terminal symbol). So, NT26 has two productions: NT54 and t44.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t46, which comes from NT26 \u2192 t46. So, we take the right-hand side as t46. So, to get t46, we need NT26 \u2192 t46. That's good.\n\nNow, after t46, the next symbol is t14. Looking at the grammar, t14 is produced by NT22 \u2192 t71 and then NT71 \u2192 t14. So, we need to see if we can derive t14 after t46.\n\nSo, first part: Start with NT26 \u2192 t46.\n\nNext, t14: The symbol after t46 is t14, which comes from NT22 \u2192 t71, and then NT71 \u2192 t14. So, we need to produce t71 first, then t14.\n\nBut wait, t71 is generated by NT71 \u2192 t14. So, the production for NT71 is NT71 -> t14. But before that, we need to get NT22 to produce t71. So, the sequence would be:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t71, and then t71 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo, from t14's position, we're inserting t71, which then becomes t14. But in terms of the string, it's better to see how the sequence unfolds.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals, and we need to parse them using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t46, t14, t68, t54, t75, t24, t17, t68, t50, t27, t60, t65, t17, t8.\n\nLooking at each symbol and trying to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\n1. t46: This comes from NT26 \u2192 t46. So, we start with NT26.\n\nAfter t46, the current string part is \"t14 t68... etc.\" So, the next production should be from NT26's other part, but wait, NT26 can produce t46 or NT54. So, after producing t46, the next step is to produce t14.\n\nSo, after NT26 \u2192 t46, we need to produce t14, which is part of NT22 \u2192 t71, and NT71 \u2192 t14. Alternatively, looking for another production that can produce t14. Wait, does any NT rule produce t14 directly? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t71.\n- NT71 \u2192 t14.\n- Any others? NT54 \u2192 t83, NT26 \u2192 t44, etc. So, t14 is only produced through NT22 \u2192 t71 and then t71 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo, after t46, the next symbols should be t71, then t14.\n\nSo, let's consider: NT26 produces t46, and then we need to produce t71 before t14.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the first production is NT26 \u2192 t46, and then from the same NT26, we have to produce another part, which is NT54. But wait, NT26 can produce t46 or NT54, but in this string, we have t46 followed by t14. So, after t46, we need to have another production that starts. So, the tree would be S \u2192 NT26 \u2192 t46, then the NT26 can split into another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's try step by step.\n\nLooking at the string as a sequence, the first symbol is t46. Since t46 comes from NT26, we start with NT26 \u2192 t46.\n\nSo, now, the remaining string is t14 t68 t54 t75 t24 t17 t68 t50 t27 t60 t65 t17 t8.\n\nAfter t46, the next symbol is t14, so we need to see if the next production is t14. To get t14, we look at NT22 \u2192 t71 and then NT71 \u2192 t14. So, t14 is two steps, needing to generate t71 first.\n\nBut NT22 is not part of the current NT26 production. So, perhaps after producing t46, the NT26 can split into another production. Since NT26 has two productions: t46 and NT54. So, perhaps after t46, the next step is to use the other production of NT26, which is NT54.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t46 comes t14, so maybe the production for NT26 is t46 followed by another production. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is t46 followed by t14 followed by t68... Let's try to parse the string as a leftmost derivation.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT26 \u2192 t46 (consumes the first symbol). Now, the next symbol is t14. So, from the same NT26, we need to generate t14. But NT26's productions are t46 and NT54. So, we can't produce t14 from NT26, unless we split NT26 into t46 and then have another production. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar starting from S. Let's try to represent this as a parse tree.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to check each symbol step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t46, which comes from NT26 \u2192 t46.\n2. After t46, the next symbol is t14. So, we need to see how to get t14.\n\nNow, looking for t14 in the grammar, it comes from NT22 \u2192 t71, and then NT71 \u2192 t14. So, we need to split NT26 into t46 and then have another NT22 or NT54. Wait, but NT26 has only two productions: t46 and NT54. So, after t46, the next production would be NT54.\n\nWait, NT26 \u2192 t46 OR NT54. So, after t46, the next symbol comes from NT54. Let's check what NT54 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT54 has several productions:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT82\n- NT54 \u2192 NT83\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50\n- NT54 \u2192 NT9\n- NT54 \u2192 NT59\n- NT54 \u2192 NT0\n- etc.\n\nLooking for NT54 \u2192 t something. Checking the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT82\n- NT54 \u2192 NT83\n- NT54 \u2192 NT50\n- NT54 \u2192 t83\n- NT54 \u2192 t27\n- etc.\n\nLooking at nt54, one of the productions is nt54 \u2192 t83.

The string is `t10 t22 t78 t71 t75 t54 t79 t56 t72 t32 t78 t71 t42 t72`. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. This should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a way to derive the string.\n\nThe string is a series of 't's followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, there are several rules where non-terminals are replaced with 't' and numbers. For example, `NT3 -> NT17 NT6` and then `NT6` can produce `t63`. So some non-terminals when expanded result in 't' strings.\n\nI notice that many of the numbers in the string (like t10, t22, t78, etc.) appear as results of certain non-terminals. I'll go through each part of the string and see if each 't' can be mapped to a production.\n\nStarting with the first token, t10. Looking at the grammar, NT49 -> t12, NT75 -> t79, NT65 -> t46, NT26 -> t29, etc. But none of these directly give t10. Wait, wait, in the given grammar, there's NT36 -> t50, NT33 -> t10, and NT93 -> t54. Hmm, does any non-terminal produce t10?\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT33 -> t10. So that's possible. Then, does NT33 appear in any expansion? Looking at the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Then NT17 -> NT8 NT58, which might lead to something. But I'm not sure if that's the path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any 't' terms and see if their non-terminals are connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to reconstruct the string backward, seeing which non-terminals could produce these 't' strings.\n\nLet me try to identify the sequence.\n\nt10: possible from NT33.\n\nt22: Looking for which non-terminal can produce t22. Wait, in the grammar, maybe NT22 is a non-terminal. Let's see. For example, NT22 could directly produce t71 or t54. Wait, looking at the rules, NT22 -> t71, but that's only if expanded correctly. Or NT22 might have rules that lead to t22? Wait, no, I see NT22 -> t78 and t42, but not t22.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. The grammar has NT22 -> t78, which is different. Hmm. Or maybe another rule for NT22 that can produce t22? Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see a rule where NT22 -> t22. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe t22 comes from NT31 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT31: NT31 -> NT37 NT5. Then NT37 can produce t70 or t44. Hmm. Not sure. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree for the string, but since this is a long string, it might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can see if each 't' can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 't's in the string and see if I can find any production rules that could generate them.\n\nThe string has t10, t22, t78, t71, t75, t54, t79, t56, t72, t32, t78, t71, t42, t72.\n\nWait, let's note down all the 't's:\n\n- t10: So some NT must produce t10. Looking through the grammar, the only way to get 't' is from specific non-terminals that end up producing a 't' when fully expanded. For example, NT33 -> t10. So that's one possibility.\n\n- t22: Maybe this comes from NT58 (if NT58 can produce 't22'). Looking at NT58: NT58 -> t9 via NT33? Wait, let me see. NT58 -> t9: Looking at the grammar, NT58 -> t9. So NT58 can produce t9, not t22. Hmm. Wait, perhaps another rule: Wait, NT58 -> NT59 NT2. Then NT2 could be... Wait, looking back, NT2 -> t69. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the string is a series of expansions that eventually result in these 't's. For example, starting from S, expand it to NT3 NT37. Then each of those non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be broken down into a series of productions. Given the string length, it's 14 tokens, which would mean that the derivation could involve several steps. Maybe a bottom-up approach.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be generated by tracing the rules. For example, the last part of the string is t72. Looking back, the grammar has NT74 -> t75, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe NT72 can be produced? Wait, looking at the grammar, I notice that some rules end with 't', but others don't. For example, NT26 -> t54, NT30 -> t54, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the string ends with multiple t72's. Let's look at the grammar. I see NT74 -> NT14 NT23, and then maybe NT14 can produce t71, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each 't' in the string can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with t10: As per grammar, NT33 -> t10. So the earlier non-terminals leading to NT33 must be present.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with NT33, which eventually leads to t10.\n\nThen, the next token is t22. To get t22, there must be a non-terminal that can derive t22. Looking through the grammar, the only option I see is NT22, but I don't see NT22 -> t22. Wait, NT22 can produce t78 and t42. So perhaps the second token comes from NT22 being derived into t22 via another step. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t22 is from NT58, but NT58 -> t9 or another non-terminal. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the structure of the string. It seems that there are multiple t78 and t71, which might be from the same root. For example, NT44 -> t60, which may come from NT37 NT6, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to trace each 't' token in the string and see if it can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nLet's take the first token, t10. It comes from NT33. So earlier, somewhere in the derivation, we have NT33.\n\nLooking at how NT33 can be derived: NT33 -> t10. So the earlier step must derive to NT33.\n\nNow, how is NT33 derived? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces NT33. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice:\n\nNT19 -> t8\nNT58 -> t9\nNT31 -> NT37 NT5\nNT37 -> NT83 NT44\nNT83 -> NT44 NT14\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18\nNT22 -> t78 and t42\nNt18 -> t68\n...\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps t10 comes from NT3, which is a known rule:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nSo to get t10, perhaps NT33 is part of that expansion, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t10 comes from NT33, which is connected to other non-terminals. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rules that produce NT33, except perhaps from NT18 or others.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT37 -> t70 or t44, which might not lead to t10.\n\nThis is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-258","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string provided is: `t65 t42 t51 t65 t29 t24 t24 t15 t73 t61 t22 t54 t71 t87 t61`. \n\nFirst off, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The first thing I notice is that each production here either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly to a terminal.\n\nMy initial thought is that for any given string, each non-terminal in the string should expand into another non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal. So, starting from the string and breaking it down, I can try to construct a parse tree to see if it follows the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t65`. I need to see if there's a production where a non-terminal A expands to `65`, but according to the grammar, `t65` actually refers to the terminal symbol '65', right? So, I think there might be a confusion there. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, no, I think I misread. The NT rules are all the ones starting with letters, like S, NT20, etc. The terminals are the symbols that end with 't' followed by a number, like t65, t42, etc. So, in the string, each symbol is a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals. I need to trace back from the top of the grammar to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nLet me list out the productions again to see how they can be applied. Starting from S, which is directly `NT3 NT77`. So, S expands into two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. Since both of these are non-terminals, I can then check how they expand.\n\nBreaking down NT3, according to the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So, S \u2192 NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to expand further. Let's take NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. NT5 is directly 't14', NT85 \u2192 NT23 NT16.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's not get confused. Let's start with each part step by step.\n\nStarting with NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbols are t65, t42, etc., which don't match these. Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the string's symbols in terms of the productions. Let me see if each symbol in the string can be matched by a production of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t65 t42 t51 t65 t29 t24 t24 t15 t73 t61 t22 t54 t71 t87 t61.\n\nEach of these is a terminal. So, each must correspond to some rule that ends with a terminal. I think the only productions that lead to terminals are those where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal or through two steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals end directly to a terminal with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT74 \u2192 't74', which is 't74'. Similarly, NT98 \u2192 't93', etc.\n\nWait, but this seems confusing because the string's symbols don't match the exact patterns in the rules.\n\nWait, no, the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal that directly maps to 't65' as a terminal. Instead, NT74 \u2192 't74'. So, if the string has a 't65', is there a non-terminal that maps to it?\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, I see NT77 \u2192 't77', but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the grammar: Each NT rule is a production where a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, and then those can expand into terminals or other non-terminals. So, the only way a terminal appears in the string is through a production where a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal.\n\nSo, the string symbols like t65 must be the results of non-terminals expanding directly into a terminal. So, for example, if there's a non-terminal A \u2192 t65, then A can produce t65.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see if any rule ends with a 't' followed by a number.

It's a set of rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given seems to fit this because all the rules either combine two non-terminals or are terminals.\n\nThe string we're evaluating consists of a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. The 't's seem to correspond to some terminals in the grammar. For example, looking at the rules, NT42 \u2192 't42', so any 't42' in the string would presumably come from that production.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into its components: t42, t75, t75, t7, t72, t74, t7, t51, t74, t44, t30, t78, t17, t29, t14. So 15 tokens in total.\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is defined as NT3 NT77. So the entire string should start with NT3 and NT77, which produce something. \n\nLooking at the NT77 rule: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then both NT68 and NT44 have their own rules. \n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 NT3 NT68 NT44.\n   - Now, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So that would be NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n   - NT6 \u2192 't63', so we get 't63' from NT6.\n   - So now, the string would have 't63' at the end, but our input starts with 't42', so perhaps this path isn't the right one. Alternatively, wait, maybe I should look for where 't42' comes from. \n\nLet me see which NT's produce 't42'. From the rules, NT42 \u2192 't42', and also NT93 \u2192 't93', but not 't42'. So the only way to get 't42' is if we have NT42 somewhere in the derivation.\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar, I don't see a NT42. Hmm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the rules again. Wait, the rules are listed with NT followed by something, like NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, etc. None of the NT rules directly produce 't42'; instead, some other NT may do so. But looking through the list, I see:\n- NT42 \u2192 't42'\n- NT55 \u2192 't55' (but not present here)\nWait, in the rules, I see some 't's with numbers, but I don't see a rule for NT42 directly. Let me scan the provided rules again.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT42 doesn't seem to be a non-terminal because none of the rules end with 't42'. Wait, actually, in the rules provided, I see NT49 \u2192 't74', but not NT42. So perhaps I'm mistaken\u2014maybe NT42 is a non-terminal that somehow produces 't42', but in the rules given, I don't see it. Oh, no, that's not correct. The rules are all about non-terminals producing other non-terminals or terminals. So if 't42' is a terminal, then there's a rule NT42 \u2192 't42'. But in the provided rules, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't42'. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n- NT44 appears multiple times as a non-terminal, and one of its rules is NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18.\n- NT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79, etc.\n- I don't see any rule where the non-terminal's production includes 't42'. So how can we have 't42' in the string if there's no rule that produces it directly? Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the rules for each NT:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT85 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n- NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n- NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n- NT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79\n- NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n- So none of these directly produce 't42'. So perhaps the only way to get 't42' is if the grammar includes a rule like NT42 \u2192 't42', but looking at the provided rules, I don't see that.\n\nWait, perhaps I copied the rules wrong. Let me check again. Oh no, looking back, I realize that in the rules, I see NT42 is present? Let me check:\n\nWait, the initial part of the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then the other rules follow. Looking through all the lines, I don't see an NT42 rule that produces 't42'. So maybe the string includes 't42' but there's no way to produce it. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. \n\nWait, but that can't be, because the problem says the user will present a string that may or may not be in the language. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe some NTs produce 't42', but in the provided rules, that's not the case. So if the string contains 't42', but no NT produces 't42', then the answer is 'No'. But wait, let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't42' is a typo, and it's meant to be another production, but according to the provided rules, that's not the case. So, given that, the string contains a 't42' that the grammar can't produce, so the string can't be generated. \n\nWait, but in the rules, I do see:\n\nLooking at the rules again, for example:\n- NT49 \u2192 't74'\n- NT95 \u2192 't61'\n- NT93 \u2192 't54'\n- So somewhere, the production rules for non-terminals result in certain terminals. But 't42' isn't in any of these, meaning there's no way to produce 't42' from any NT in the given grammar. Therefore, any string that includes 't42' cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nTherefore, since the given string starts with 't42', it cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar provided. It's a bit extensive with many productions. The start symbol seems to be S, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals: `t71 t68 t78 t10 t72 t24 t73 t72 t60 t75 t72 t71 t54 t51 t87 t90`.

Each cell (i,j) is a set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from j-i to j.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nInitialize the table with each (i, i+i) being either a terminal or non-terminal if it appears on the diagonal.\n\nThen, for each cell, check if the substring s_i to s_j can be derived from any non-terminal.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to look for possible derivations.\n\nLet's look at the terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFor example, s3 is t10.\n\nLooking up t10: in the productions, NT36 -> NT70 NT33, and NT33 -> t10. So, NT36 can derive 't10' if NT70 and NT33 can derive other symbols.\n\nBut looking at the other symbols, I'll try to see if the entire string can be built step by step.\n\nAnother approach: the start symbol is S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the first expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nNow, I can look at NT3 and NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. From the production NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 (from NT17 -> NT8 NT58) and NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. So NT17 can be NT8 NT58, which are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, and NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the way. Let me track each step.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative is to look at each symbol and see if they can be generated by some production.\n\nLooking at t71: s11 is t71. Looking up t71: NT71 -> NT70 NT39.\n\nSo NT71 is made of NT70 and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-286","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t29 t83 t83 t87 t51 t68 t44 t29 t72 t50 t7 t74 t22 t8 t60 t56`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This means every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all production rules on the left side of the arrows (the non-terminals) follow this structure. Each non-terminal (like S, NT20, NT68, etc.) produces either two non-terminals or a terminal like 't29' or 't8'. This matches CNF exactly.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. However, the CYK algorithm involves building a parsing table and checking whether the string can be derived from the start symbol. Since I'm more familiar with the Chomsky parsing approach, I might look for a derivation sequence, but with 16 tokens, that's quite long.\n\nAlternatively, since each production only produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string can be broken down step by step to see if it corresponds to any possible derivation. Each token in the string must correspond to a production rule. So, let's map out the string as a sequence of tokens:\n\n1. t29\n2. t83\n3. t83\n4. t87\n5. t51\n6. t68\n7. t44\n8. t29\n9. t72\n10. t50\n11. t7\n11. t74\n12. t22\n13. t8\n14. t60\n15. t56\n\nSince the string is a series of t's followed by numbers and possibly a t, I need to check if there's a way to derive it starting from S.\n\nFirst, S starts as S -> NT3 NT77. So, S must expand into two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. Then, each of these can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t29, which likely comes directly from a production rule. Let's check the grammar to see which non-terminals produce t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT37 -> NT65 NT54\n- NT5 -> 't14'\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n- NT93 -> 't54'\n- NT30 -> 't54'\n- NT74 -> 't15'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT22 -> 't23'\n- NT93 -> 't27'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n- NT51 -> 't27'\n- NT93 -> 't27'\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n- NT31 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT79 -> 't69'\n- NT15 -> 't44'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n- NT8 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT83 -> 't51'\n- NT77 -> 't30'\n- NT6 -> 't63'\n- NT79 -> 't72'\n- NT58 -> 't54'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT44 -> 't44'\n- NT5 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n- NT23 -> 't18'\n\nLooking at these, I can list the non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT74 -> t75, t78, t79, t60, t15, t17, t70, t74, t68, t56, t61, t54, t93, t16, t82, t51, t36, t26, t71, t63, t90, t73, t40, t18, t70, t8, t44, t78, t69, t79, t65, t93, t90, t30, t10, t33, t14, t27...

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. \n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the structure of the grammar. It seems that the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT3 NT77 (S -> NT3 NT77). From there, each NT non-terminal eventually resolves to some terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is part of a terminal symbol in the grammar, like 't32', 't24', etc. So, I'll need to track the sequence of these terminals to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into its components: t32, t24, t46, t65, t44, t35, t54, t78, t32, t16, t44, t65, t16, t73, t79, t63, t50.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, most of the non-terminals eventually reduce to these terminal symbols. For example, NT3 becomes t17, NT44 becomes t60, etc.\n\nI'll try to see if the given string can be generated by S. Starting with S, it produces NT3 and NT77. \n\nFirst part after S is NT3 NT77. So, S -> ... -> NT3 NT77.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 can be expanded to NT17 NT6, and NT17 can be expanded further. Let me backtrack a bit.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this from the output string and try to trace back through the grammar to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nThe string ends with t50. Looking at the grammar, t50 is from NT50 (NT50 -> t24 or NT18). Wait, no, looking at the productions, some terminals directly correspond to NT rules. For example, NT74 -> t75, NT85 -> t3, etc.\n\nLet me list the terminal productions:\n\nNT3 -> t17\nNT17 -> t70\nNT70 -> t7\nAnd then NT7 also is another production, but maybe that's not the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since each production is binary, the string can be thought of as a sequence of steps where each step combines two symbols into one. So, the length of the string would be the number of leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to check each production step by step.\n\nLet me start by examining the string:\n\nt32, t24, t46, t65, t44, t35, t54, t78, t32, t16, t44, t65, t16, t73, t79, t63, t50.\n\nI need to see if this can derive from S.\n\nWait, S first splits into NT3 and NT77. Then each of those can split further.\n\nSo, starting with S => NT3 NT77.\n\nThen, NT3 can split into NT17 NT6. NT17 splits into NT8 NT58. Then NT8 splits into NT30 NT50. Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the sequence in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t32. The only production that leads to t32 is NT77 -> t32. Because in the grammar, looking at the rules, NT77 is defined as NT68 NT44, which then breaks down further, but somewhere along the line, it leads to t32. Specifically, NT77 -> t32.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t32, that must come from NT77. So, the first part is NT77.\n\nSo, the initial production is S -> NT3 NT77. The first token is NT77, which must derive t32. Let me see the path for NT77.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44.\nNT68 -> NT49 NT25.\nNT49 -> NT74 NT51 (maybe not the right path).\nWait, NT68 can also be NT77 -> NT68 NT44, which then goes to NT49 NT25, which is NT74 NT51. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps let's see where t32 comes from. Looking through the rules, I see that NT77 -> t32. So, NT77 must derive t32. So, the production chain must go through NT77 -> ... -> t32.\n\nLooking back, NT77's only production is NT68 NT44, so I must follow that path.\n\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nNext, look at NT68: NT68 -> NT49 NT25.\n\nThen NT49: NT49 is in the rules as NT49 -> NT12 NT... Wait, the grammar shows NT49 -> NT74 NT51 (from line 9: NT49 -> NT74 NT51). Wait, no, looking at the initial grammar, line 4 says NT20 -> NT44 NT36, line 9 says NT49 -> NT74 NT51.\n\nSo, NT49 -> NT74 NT51.\n\nThus, NT49 becomes NT74 and NT51.\n\nThen NT74 can be NT75 NT21 (looking at line 19: NT74 -> NT75 NT21) or NT74 -> NT70 NT39 (line 36: NT74 -> NT70 NT39). But Wait, NT74 has multiple productions. Let's find the one that leads to t32.\n\nWait, let's think: NT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nNT68 -> NT49 NT25.\n\nNT49 -> NT74 NT51.\n\nNow, NT74 could have several options. Let's see each option:\n\n1. NT74 -> NT75 NT21 (line 19)\n2. NT74 -> NT70 NT39 (line 36)\n3. NT74 -> NT77 NT2 (line 77: NT77 -> NT68 NT44\u2014no, that's the rule for S)\nWait, line 77 is NT77 -> NT68 NT44, which is already our starting point.\n\nSo, focusing on NT74, two main options.\n\nOption 1: NT74 -> NT75 NT21.\n\nNT75: NT75 can have which production? Looking through the rules, NT75 is in the line 74: NT74 -> NT75 NT21, and line 74: NT75 -> NT74 NT77 (not sure; check the lines provided initially.\n\nLooking back, line 74 is NT74 -> NT74 NT77? That seems circular, but I might have made a mistake. Wait, the initial list goes up to line 109, so maybe line 74 is different. Looking back, line 19: NT74 -> NT75 NT21, line 27: NT75 -> NT74 NT77, line 27 is 'NT75 -> NT74 NT77'. So, NT75 can go to NT74 and NT77.\n\nSo, if NT74 -> NT75 NT21, then NT75 becomes NT74 NT77.\n\nBut this seems like it's going into an infinite loop.

{"custom_id":"request-303","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure might help because parsing algorithms like CYK can efficiently handle such grammars, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll focus on the productions and the structure of the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t22 t69 t90 t90 t83 t14 t44 t29 t50 t22 t7 t60 t63 t71 t15`.\n\nI notice that each token is a terminal, and each is a 't' followed by a number. Looking at the grammar, each non-terminal seems to produce pairs of non-terminals until they eventually terminate with a terminal tX.\n\nLet's start with the entire string and see if it can be built by the grammar.\n\nThe string has 16 tokens. Let's see if they can be connected by non-terminals.\n\nThe approach will be to find the top-level production, which in this grammar seems to be S \u2192 NT3 NT77 or similar, but looking at the first production, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which produces two non-terminals. So the string should have two parts connected by either S's production or another production.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a single sequence of terminals. So maybe S \u2192 NT3 NT77 isn't directly applicable, but perhaps higher levels or other rules can break it down further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial S production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so to derive the string, we'd have to start with S. Let's see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So let's track that. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then NT68 is NT49 NT25, and so on.\n\nThis could get complex, but perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by individual non-terminals which are connected through the grammar.\n\nAnother way is to look for each 't' and see if they match any productions. For example, 't8' might be produced by NT8, but looking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't35'. Hmm, that's a terminal, so 't35' equals 't8'? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, each production can only have terminals on the right. Each NT (non-terminal) can produce combinations of other NTs until they reach a terminal. So we need to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back to a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but all the non-terminals in the grammar ultimately produce some terminal, like 'tX' where X varies. So each position in the string must correspond to a non-terminal that can produce a terminal, and the sequence must match.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should list all the productions for each NT.\n\nLet me note that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't17', NT5 \u2192 't14', etc. So each production chain for a non-terminal will terminate in a sequence of 't's. So the string we're given has 16 't's, meaning that each step in the production must generate sequences correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of multiple steps. Maybe the string is a single derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, but S produces two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. Each of those will need to produce sequences that together form the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the string should be the concatenation of whatever NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nLooking at the string, it's t8 t22 t69 t90 t90 t83 t14 t44 t29 t50 t22 t7 t60 t63 t71 t15.\n\nLet me check if the beginning can be produced by NT3 or NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So the beginning would be t17 t6. But the string starts with t8, so that doesn't match. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string should be the concatenation of NT3's production and NT77's production.\n\nSo let's see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 is... looking at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't93' NT16. Wait, no, NT58 \u2192 't54'. So NT58 is a terminal 't54'? Wait, no, looking at the productions, I see NT15 \u2192 't73', NT74 \u2192 't75', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing. Each production that ends with 'tX' is a terminal, so each non-terminal production that ends in 'tX' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT3 \u2192 't17', which is a terminal, so 't17' is produced by NT3. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't14', etc.\n\nWait, but in our string, we have 't8 t22 t69...' etc. So perhaps I should check which non-terminals can produce a 't8'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 't73', NT74 \u2192 't75', etc., but none directly produce 't8' except possibly NT8, which is a terminal. Wait, looking for 't8' in the productions: yes, NT8 \u2192 't35'\u2014so if 't8' is in the string, maybe 't35' is another part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a non-terminal that eventually produces that 't'.\n\nBut the string length is 16, and each step may split into two, but perhaps the string is the concatenation of two parts, each corresponding to NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, given the initial string is t8 t22 t69 t90 t90 t83 t14 t44 t29 t50 t22 t7 t60 t63 t71 t15.\n\nLooking at the first parts: 't8 t22 t69'. Does NT3 produce a 't8'? Let's trace:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 (NT8 NT58) (something) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should see what NT6 produces. NT6 \u2192 't63' (from NT6 \u2192 't63'). So if NT6 is 't63', then seeing a 't63' in the string would fit. Looking at the string, towards the end, the last part is t15, which is produced by NT15 \u2192 't73'... Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly. Maybe I should check if each 't' corresponds to a non-terminal's production. Each 'tX' is a terminal, generated by the non-terminals that directly produce 'tX'.\n\nSo for example, NT3 \u2192 't17', so wherever NT3 is used, it would produce 't17'.\n\nSimilarly, NT74 \u2192 't75' and 't60' and others.\n\nBut the string starts with 't8', which isn't one of the immediate terminals. So perhaps t8 is produced by some non-terminal that eventually leads to 't8'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't35' (from NT8 \u2192 't35'), so if we need t8, that's not directly available unless another path leads to it.\n\nThis might be getting too complicated. Another approach: since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, we can try to see the depth of the parse. For example, each step of production increases the depth by 1.\n\nThe string has 16 tokens, so the parse depth is 16. The max depth possible in the grammar would depend on the productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to see if each 't' can be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nBut if I can't find each 't' being produced by a non-terminal, then the string might not be in the language.\n\nHowever, another point: the grammar's initial symbols might need to be used in some way. Maybe the entire string must be broken down into the productions. Let's see:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nSo, the string must be NT3's production concatenated with NT77's production.\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 (NT8 NT58) (something)\n\nNT58 \u2192 't93' NT16.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal.

So, each step in the derivation should produce two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string provided is: `t18 t16 t87 t7 t70 t32 t70 t75 t79 t69 t79 t42 t9 t50 t18 t72 t29 t56`.\n\nI should check if each terminal is either directly produced by a non-terminal or appears in the productions of another non-terminal.

Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT54 -> t83, but looking at the string, I see 't56'. Looking through the productions, I see NT50 -> t24, NT51 -> t27, etc. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake.\n\nLet me go step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t18. Looking at the productions, NT83 has a production that includes t74, so maybe not.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be equal to the number of steps plus one. Since each step produces two symbols, the number of symbols should be one more than the number of steps. The given string has 19 symbols. So, the derivation should have 18 steps, starting from S, which produces two symbols each time.\n\nLet me count: 19 symbols mean 18 steps, which is possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe I should try to parse the string from the top-down, using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the possible ways the string can be broken down.\n\nStarting with 't18', which appears in NT77 -> t32 and also in NT44 -> t60, etc. Hmm, wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT44 has the production NT22 -> t78, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's cross-reference the string tokens with the grammar. Each token must be either a terminal from the grammar or produced by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. t18: Appears in NT77 -> t32, but t18 isn't directly a product of NT44. Wait, let me check the productions. I see NT77 -> t32, but also NT44 -> t60, and NT65 -> t46, etc. Hmm, I don't see t18 directly except as a production of NT22 (t78?), maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT93 -> t54\n- NT65 -> t46\n- NT79 -> t72\n- NT82 -> t29\n- NT58 -> t54\n- NT26 -> t44\n- NT51 -> t27\n- NT0 -> t8\n- NT93 -> t27\n- NT82 -> t16\n- NT74 -> t60\n- NT22 -> t71\n- NT31 -> t14\n- NT36 -> t50\n- NT2 -> t69\n- NT74 -> t15\n- NT79 -> t69\n- NT82 -> t65\n- NT54 -> t83\n- NT18 -> t8\n- NT20 -> t65\n- NT70 -> t7\n- NT65 -> t46\n- NT26 -> t44\n- NT51 -> t27\n- NT22 -> t87\n- NT44 -> t68\n- NT5 -> t14\n- NT37 -> t71\n- NT67 -> t56\n- Other productions as well.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last token is t56. Is there a non-terminal that produces t56? Let me check the productions. I see NT67 -> t56. So, the last symbol in the string must come from NT67 -> t56. So, the last step in the derivation should involve NT67.\n\nLet me see the position before t56. The token before is t72. NT79 -> t72, so that would be NT79.\n\nSo, the last two symbols are t72 and t56, which would come from NT79 and NT67. So, at some point, the derivation must have NT79 and NT67, which produce t72 and t56.\n\nBut to produce t72, the non-terminal must be NT79. Now, what non-terminal produces NT79? Looking at the grammar, NT79 is produced by NT22, which is a production of NT78 and NT31.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the grammar again. For NT79, I don't see any production rule that directly produces NT79; instead, NT79 is a left-hand side of a production. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the grammar, all non-terminals expand to two non-terminals except those that directly produce terminals. So, perhaps each non-terminal corresponds to a rule that either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because NT79 is a non-terminal, so it must expand into two non-terminals. But in the string, we have t79 followed by t69, which is also a terminal. Wait, no, looking back, the string has t79 t69.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT79 -> NT22 NT22. So, NT79 must split into two NT22s. So, each of those NT22s must further split.\n\nBut the string has t79 and t69. So, wait, I'm getting confused because in the string, each symbol is a terminal. So, perhaps I should approach this by decomposing the string into non-terminals and terminals, checking if each terminal is present in the grammar and each non-terminal can be expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct the parse tree from the string, trying to match each symbol at each step.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into symbols and see if I can match them step by step.\n\nThe string is: t18 t16 t87 t7 t70 t32 t70 t75 t79 t69 t79 t42 t9 t50 t18 t72 t29 t56.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. t18\n2. t16\n3. t87\n4. t7\n5. t70\n6. t32\n7. t70\n8. t75\n9. t79\n10. t69\n11. t79\n12. t42\n13. t9\n14. t50\n15. t18\n16. t72\n17. t29\n18. t56\n\nI'll start by trying to find a production rule that starts with t18.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. I don't see the start symbol 'S' here, but I notice that each production starts with S. So the start symbol must be S, but looking at the grammar, I see that S -> NT3 NT77. So S generates two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77.\n\nThe string provided consists of a series of t-letters, which I think are terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules until all symbols are terminals (i.e., match the t-values).\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt69 t17 t73 t12 t22 t24 t68 t71 t27 t27 t65 t65 t14 t63 t46 t27 t24 t68.\n\nThat's 18 tokens. Since each production in CNF typically generates two symbols (nt1 and nt2), I expect each step to double the number of symbols until we reach the length. However, since terminals can't produce further, I need to see if the parse tree can lead to the given string.\n\nBut starting from S, we have S -> NT3 NT77. So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT3 and NT77. Let me check what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nSo NT3 generates two non-terminals: NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 -> NT30 NT50.\n\nNT30 -> t54.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for each:\n\nLooking up NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, so that's good.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nWhat's NT8? It's not directly defined, but looking at the list, I see that NT83 \u2192 't16' but that's not applicable here. Wait, no, actually, the productions for NT terms:\n\nWait, let me look up NT8: it says NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nAnd NT30: NT30 \u2192 't54' (from NT30 -> 't54').\n\nSimilarly, NT50 \u2192 't24'.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check each step.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the given grammar:\n\nI see that each rule is either a production like S -> NT3 NT77 or an NT rule leading to other NTs. So I need to see how each production's right-hand side generates the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree from the string, working backward from the root, which would be S, and see if it can split into two parts that correspond to NT3 and NT77.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can apply the productions in reverse, replacing each term with its possible parent.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be split into parts corresponding to the productions of the grammar. Since S produces NT3 and NT77, and each of those must generate a certain sequence.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t69. Let me see which NT can generate t69.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some NTs have fixed values:\n\nFor example, NT74 \u2192 't75', NT44 \u2192 't60', etc.\n\nLooking for t69, I see that NT22 \u2192 't71', NT44 \u2192 't60', etc. Hmm, looking through all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't44'\n- NT40 \u2192 't90'\n- NT24 appears in NT54 \u2192 't69'? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, looking through the fixed terminal productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT2 -> 't69'\n\nSo any NT that produces 2 generates 't69'. Also, NT5 -> 't14', etc. But 't69' is directly generated by NT2.\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nWait, no, the productions for 't' are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, fixed terminals are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n\n- NT83 -> 't51'\n\n- NT85 -> 't23'\n\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n\n- NT48 -> 't18'\n\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n\n- NT65 -> 't46'\n\n- NT44 -> 't60'\n\n- NT69 -> no, wait, no, in the fixed terminal productions, I see:\n\nnt26 -> t44\n\nnt54 -> t83\n\nnt27 -> t27?

{"custom_id":"request-340","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t44 t69 t65 t29 t24 t63 t90 t90 t72 t44 t51 t60 t30 t73 t87 t61 t42 t30 t73\" and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice that many of the productions do indeed fit this structure. For example, S -> NT3 NT77 is in CNF because it's a non-terminal producing two non-terminals. However, some rules seem to have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, each production is either a non-terminal generating two non-terminals or a non-terminal generating a terminal. So it's in CNF.\n\nWait, actually, no. Looking more closely, I notice that some rules have multiple non-terminals on the right-hand side, which isn't allowed in CNF. For example, S -> NT3 NT77 is fine, but something like NT20 -> NT44 NT36 is also fine. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals, except for the base cases which produce terminals. So in this grammar, all productions are of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> t (a terminal), so it's indeed in CNF.\n\nGiven that, I can proceed. The approach to determine if the string is generated by the grammar is to perform a parsing process, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but since the string is small, maybe a recursive descent or top-down approach would work.\n\nThe string starts with \"t44\", which must be produced by some rule. Looking at the grammar, the only place where \"t44\" appears is in the production NT74 -> 't74'. So that's the terminal symbol. Therefore, to get \"t44\" in the string, the corresponding rule must be part of the derivation. \n\nLooking at the string, after \"t44\", we have \"t69\". So in the production that immediately leads to \"t44\", what follows? Since \"t44\" is only produced by NT74, I need to find a production of NT74 that results in \"t74\". Looking at the grammar, the productions for NT74 are:\n\nNT74 -> NT37 NT4\nWait, no, let me check the grammar provided. Wait, looking back, the user-provided grammar has:\n\nNT74 -> NT74 NT77\nand\nNT74 -> 't75'\n\nAh, yes, so NT74 can produce 't75' or the same NT74 producing another NT74 and NT77, which would lead into recursion. But since the string has \"t44 t69...\", which isn't part of that, perhaps I need to consider other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a production that can generate \"t44\" as part of a derivation that also includes \"t69\". Wait, looking again, maybe I should identify the starting symbol S and see how it can derive the string.\n\nS is the start symbol, producing NT3 NT77. So the derivation starts with NT3 and NT77. Let's split this into two parts: NT3 and NT77.\n\nFor NT3, according to the grammar, it produces NT17 NT6. So the string so far would be the two branches nt3 -> nt17 nt6 and nt77 -> ... but the string is a linear sequence, so perhaps a parsing approach where both branches are considered together.\n\nThis might be getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the parse table method or a dynamic programming approach like CYK would be more efficient, but since the string is 20 symbols, it's manageable.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of symbols: t44, t69, t65, t29, t24, t63, t90, t90, t72, t44, t51, t60, t30, t73, t87, t61, t42, t30, t73.\n\nI need to parse this string into the grammar. Let's see where each \"t\" comes from. Each \"tX\" must come from a production NTX -> 'tx'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, not all \"t\"s are present. For example, \"t44\" comes from NT74. How? The rule for NT74 is:\n\nNT74 -> NT37 NT4 (wait, no, checking the grammar again, it shows:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT74 -> NT74 NT77\n\nand\n\nNT74 -> 't75'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Here's the full list of grammar rules (abbreviated):\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nNT6 -> 't63' \n\nWait, looking through:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6 (from the user's grammar, line 13: NT3 -> NT17 NT6)\n\nNT6 -> 't63' (line 36: NT6 -> 't63').\n\nWait no, line 36 is NT65 -> NT77 NT2. So, the productions for NT6:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the relevant productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT63 is part of NT18 -> NT68 NT82 (line 54: NT65 -> NT98 NT26), but that's not NT6.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nThe user's grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT77, then each line defines a non-terminal in terms of others. Let me try to systematically list each non-terminal and their productions to make it clearer.\n\nThe grammar has the following non-terminals and productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nNT6 -> 't63'\n\nWait, no: Let me check each line for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n1.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 Nyt Nz, and some are terminals (like NT3 \u2192 't17'). So each NT is a non-terminal that can produce two other non-terminals until we reach the terminals, which are the 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t61 t60 t56 t68 t27 t44 t17 t72 t73 t46 t61 t65 t70 t42 t17 t68 t17 t74 t29`. That's a sequence of terminals. I need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, parsing can be done using a method like the CYK algorithm, but I might need a different approach since I'm more familiar with looking for possible derivation paths step by step.\n\nLet me list all the productions that result in terminals (the ones that end with 't' followed by a number):\n\nNT -> 't42' (NT2)\nNT -> 't56' (NT67)\nNT -> 't74' (NT49)\nNT -> 't74' (NT26->?)

Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out whether the string can be derived from the starting symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It seems like each production is a rule where a non-terminal (like S, NT20, etc.) is broken down into two other non-terminals or terminals. The terminal symbols are various strings like 't63', 't14', etc., down to 't98' or something. So the end of the productions is when a non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nThe string to verify is: `t63 t14 t12 t78 t9 t42 t78 t88 t79 t17 t90 t68 t51 t24 t51 t14 t9 t14 t68 t90`.\n\nI think I should start from the start symbol S and try to derive this string by applying the productions step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can work backwards from the string, starting from the end and trying to match the productions in reverse. That might be more efficient since the string is a sequence of terminals, and I can check each part against the possible rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t63`. I need to check if `t63` is a terminal, which it is. Then, see if it can be generated from any production. Looking at the grammar, I see production rules where a non-terminal becomes a terminal. For example, NT54 -> 't9', NT93 -> 't54', etc.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminal productions to see what's available.

For example, NT77 -> NT68 NT44, which further down translates to 't32' and 't60', right?

{"custom_id":"request-367","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided with a series of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It seems each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT20, NT3, etc.) produces two other non-terminal symbols until it reaches a terminal symbol, which ends with 't' and a number. So, each production is of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except when it's a terminal.\n\nThe string given is: `t79 t60 t44 t61 t30 t70 t56 t29 t46 t63 t60 t74 t78 t35 t72 t46 t16 t69 t44 t60`.\n\nI think I should work backwards, starting from the string and trying to see if I can derive it by matching the rules. Each 't' symbol is a terminal, and each number corresponds to a specific non-terminal. \n\nLet me start by splitting the string into individual tokens: t79, t60, t44, t61, t30, t70, t56, t29, t46, t63, t60, t74, t78, t35, t72, t46, t16, t69, t44, t60.\n\nI'll consider the grammar's production rules to see what each non-terminal expands into. For example, NT79 -> t22, but in the given string, one of the tokens is t79. So I need to know which non-terminal corresponds to t79. Looking back, in the grammar rules, NT79 is defined as -> NT22 NT22. Wait, no: in the rules, NT79 is written as `NT79 -> NT22 NT22`. Hmm, looking back: \n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT79 is defined as `NT79 -> NT22 NT22`? Wait no, looking at the list provided, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT22? Wait, I'm not finding that. Let me check:\n\nLooking for where NT79 is defined. Scanning the list:\n\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT22: I don't see that in the given rules. Wait, checking the provided grammar, looking through each line:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT79 -> NT22 NT22.\n\nWait, no: looking again, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT79: \n\nOh, I see that in one rule: \"NT79 -> NT22 NT22\". Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, under NT79, it says:\n\n\"NT79 -> NT93 NT16\"\n\nWait no, wait: scrolling through:\n\nLooking for NT79 in the given rules, I see:\n\n- \"NT79 -> NT22 NT22\": No, actually, no. Wait, let me look again. \n\nIn the list of grammar rules provided:\n\n\"NT79 -> NT22 NT22\": Wait, I'm not finding that. Wait, perhaps I have misread the grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, after NT44: \n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT83 -> 't13'\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT67 -> 't56'\n- NT49 -> 't74'\n- NT65 -> 't88'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT18 -> 't8'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT70 -> 't78'\n- NT50 -> 't24'\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT65 -> 't46'\n- NT26 -> 't29'\n- NT40 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't54'\n- NT49 -> 't12'\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n- NT44 -> 't60'\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT74 -> 't16'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT15 -> 't73'\n- NT49 -> 't63'\n- NT33 -> 't10'\n- NT74 -> 't30'\n- NT95 -> 't61'\n- NT93 -> 't54'\n- NT0 -> 't8'\n- NT54 -> 't83'\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n- NT51 -> 't27'\n- NT93 -> 't27'\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n- NT31 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT2 -> 't22'\n- NT83 -> 't51'\n- NT77 -> 't30'\n- NT6 -> 't63'\n- NT79 -> 't72'\n- NT58 -> 't54'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT5 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n- NT23 -> 't18'\n\nSo looking for which non-terminal ends in 't79'. It's NT79, defined as `NT79 -> NT93 NT16`. Okay, so t79 comes from NT79.\n\nLooking at the string, the second token is t60. So to produce this, we need to see which non-terminal produces t60. Let me see: where does NT60 come from? Wait, the non-terminals only go up to NT95, but none seem to be NT60. Wait, no, in the rules, looking for 't60'.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n\"NT44 -> t60\"\n\nSo NT44 produces t60. So in the string, the last two symbols are t44 and t60. So that would come from a production like NT44 -> t44 t60, but in the grammar, looking for NT44's production, I see:\n\n\"NT44 -> NT22 NT18\"\n\nAnd then, looking at NT22: \"NT22 -> 't71'\", and NT18: \"NT18 -> 't8'\". So that would mean NT44 can be expanded into 't71' 't8', but in the string, at the end, there's t44 and t60, which are 't44' and 't60'. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. The string is a sequence of tokens where each token is either a 't' followed by a number. So, for example, 't44' is just the symbol for the terminal T44.\n\nSo, in the string, 't60' is just T60, 't44' is T44, etc.\n\nSo, to generate the string, each 't' is the terminal itself, and the numbers are the specific non-terminals.\n\nSo, working backwards, the last symbol in the string is 't60' which is the terminal T60. So that's produced by whatever non-terminal can produce T60. Looking at the rules, NT44 can produce T60. Additionally, we see that NT44 is defined as `-> NT22 NT18`, and NT22 is 't71', NT18 is 't8', so NT44 as a non-terminal would produce 't71' 't8', but in the string, at the end, we have T44 followed by T60, so that would require a production where T44 is followed by T60, but in the grammar, T44 is not an intermediate step connected to T60.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the string, the last two symbols are T44 and T60. So, in the derivation, the last step would have to split into T44 and T60. But looking at the grammar, T44 is generated by NT44, and T44 can produce T60 as one of its terminals. Wait, but NT44's production is `-> NT22 NT18`. So it can't produce T44 and T60 directly. It produces two non-terminals, which in turn are terminals.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string `t22 t30 t54 t18 t56 t73 t10 t61 t50 t29 t27 t14 t27 t71 t60 t68 t71 t16 t68 t30 t71` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the terminals in the string are combinations of 't' followed by numbers, like 't22', 't30', etc. Also, some non-terminals seem to directly map to these terminals, so I'll note those mappings to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nThe string is a series of t-terms: t22, t30, t54, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t22, t30, t54, t18, t56, t73, t10, t61, t50, t29, t27, t14, t27, t71, t60, t68, t71, t16, t68, t30, t71.\n\nWait, some of these t-terms are on the right-hand side of the productions. For example, t27 comes from NT27, but in the grammar, I don't see NT27 defined directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, looking back, I see that NT54 \u2192 t9, t18, and t83, but not t27. So perhaps t27 corresponds to NT27, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT27 as a production.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each part. Looking through the rules, I see productions like NT22 \u2192 t71, which is in the string as t71. But for t27, looking through the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 t35, but not t27. Hmm. Also, NT37 \u2192 NT71 NT40 and so on, but that doesn't lead to t27. Maybe t27 is part of a more complex derivation. Or perhaps I made a mistake in mapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has some repetitions or multiple paths that could be taken. Let me try to see if I can start from S and derive parts of the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is NT3 NT3. So S \u2192 NT3 NT3. Each NT3 is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the production for NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So each NT3 can split into NT17 and NT6.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So NT17 becomes NT8 and NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. So NT8 splits into NT30 and NT50.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. So NT58 becomes NT5 and NT85.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this by parsing the string from the beginning, trying to find corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the first part: t22. In the grammar, NT22 has a production to t71. So to get t22, is there a way to have NT22 in the string? But in the given productions, NT22 is part of NT22 \u2192 t71, so that could be used if t22 is needed. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t78 is another production. Wait, let me check: looking through the rules, I see NT22 \u2192 t71 (from NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT16, and then NT71 \u2192 t71) and NT22 \u2192 t78 (from NT74 \u2192 t78). So in the string, t22 might correspond to either t71 or t78. But in the string, we have t73, which is 't27', but maybe that's part of another chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the t22 can be derived from NT22, but looking at the first token in the string, it's t22. So let me try to see if I can start with S \u2192 NT3 NT3, then each NT3 becomes NT17 NT6, then NT17 becomes NT8 NT58, NT8 becomes NT30 NT50, and NT58 becomes NT5 NT85.\n\nWait, this might not be the right approach. Maybe I should build a parse tree for the string and see if it can be constructed from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the grammar. But given the length of the string (20 tokens), that might be time-consuming, so maybe I can look for patterns or repetitions.\n\nLooking at the string: t22, t30, t54, t18, t56, t73, t10, t61, t50, t29, t27, t14, t27, t71, t60, t68, t71, t16, t68, t30, t71.\n\nLet me start by mapping each token to possible non-terminals.\n\n- t22: Looking for which non-terminals produce t22. From the rules, NT58 \u2192 t58 (but wait, no, in the rules, NT58 isn't defined, but looking through the rules, I see NT22 \u2192 t71 and t78. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the rules include NT22 \u2192 t71 and NT22 \u2192 t78. So NT22 can produce t71 or t78. But in the string, we have t22. So perhaps t22 in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce t22. But looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t22. All the non-terminals either produce combinations of others or terminals starting with 't'. So if the string has 't22', and 't22' is not produced by any non-terminal, then maybe the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, but some of the rules produce 't' followed by a number, like NT27 \u2192 t27, but looking back, I don't see NT27. So perhaps the first 't22' is problematic because there's no non-terminal that produces t22. That would mean the string can't be derived, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each 't' token in the string against the rules.\n\nFor example, the first token is t22. Looking at all rules, none have a right-hand side that is simply 't22'. The closest is NT22 \u2192 t71 or t78. But the string has t22, so that can't be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a 't22' which has no corresponding production.\n\nSimilarly, checking the second token, t30. Looking for NT30. In the rules, NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65 and NT30 \u2192 t54. So 't30' can be produced by NT30, which is possible.\n\nWait, but if the first token is t22 and it's not possible, then regardless of the rest, the answer is 'No'.

{"custom_id":"request-385","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and also that the start symbol S has two productions. Wait, no, in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for possibly the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. Wait, looking back, the grammar seems to have productions like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so S directly produces two non-terminals. The rest of the productions are all non-terminals producing two other non-terminals. So it's definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t78, t65, t13, t68, t7, t30, t61, t12, t74, t75, t70, t60, t50, t15, t71, t75, t70, t30, t61, t56, t8, t12. \n\nFirst, I need to see how the grammar can derive this string. Since each step in the grammar replacement reduces a non-terminal into two others, the process is somewhat hierarchical. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the top level of the parse would involve the start symbol S generating two non-terminals. \n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string is a concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT77. So first, I need to check if the string can be split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT3 and the second by NT77.\n\nLooking at the string: t78, t65, t13, t68, t7, t30, t61, t12, t74, t75, t70, t60, t50, t15, t71, t75, t70, t30, t61, t56, t8, t12.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nStarting with NT77: looking at the productions for NT77, I see that NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So to derive a string starting with t78, which from the given grammar symbols might not immediately correspond to any NT77 productions. Wait, but looking at the productions, I see that NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and looking further, NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT2, and NT44 \u2192 NT60 NT44, etc. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Maybe the entire string can be generated by repeatedly applying the productions in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the end of the string, we have t56 and t8. Let me check the productions for t56 and t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nFrom NT67 \u2192 t56, so if I have NT67, it can generate t56. Similarly, NT8 can generate t30 via NT70 \u2192 t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work backward from the string.\n\nThe string ends with t56 and t8. Let's see, t56 is from NT67, so maybe the last part of the string is generated by NT67 and something else.\n\nWait, no. Let me parse it as a tree. Each step combines two symbols into one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string starts with the output of NT3. Let's see what NT3 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 can produce something like NT17 and NT6. Then, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. Hmm, this seems like a long path. Let me trace how each non-terminal ends up in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, and most of these numbers correspond to non-terminals in the grammar that have specific terminal outputs. So perhaps I can look for how each 't' is generated.\n\nWait, let's see: the string is a series of t's and numbers. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, according to the grammar. For example, 't78' is a terminal generated by NT78? But wait, in the grammar, most non-terminals don't have 't' as terminal; instead, some specific non-terminals generate certain 't's. So looking into the grammar, for example, NT3 \u2192 't17', meaning that NT3 can produce 't17' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the entire string, let's see if the symbols can be linked through the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list out the string:\n\n1. t78\n2. t65\n3. t13\n4. t68\n5. t7\n6. t30\n7. t61\n8. t12\n9. t74\n10. t75\n11. t70\n12. t60\n13. t50\n14. t15\n15. t71\n16. t75\n17. t70\n18. t30\n19. t61\n20. t56\n21. t8\n22. t12\n\nSo, 22 symbols. Since S is the start symbol and produces two non-terminals, each production splits into two. So for a string of length 21 (since S\u2192A B, each step increases length by 1, so starting with 2, and each split increases by 1. So 22 symbols would mean that the derivation is four levels deep (since each step adds one to the length). But perhaps more accurately, for a string of n symbols, the derivation depth is n-1.\n\nBut let's not get bogged down. Let me try to see if each 't' is reachable from some starting point.\n\nFor example, the last few symbols are t56, which is from NT67 \u2192 t56. So perhaps the last production is NT67.\n\nBefore that, t8. NT8 can generate t30 via NT70 \u2192 t7. Wait, let's look:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t7. So if we have a production where a non-terminal leads to t7, it's through NT70. But in the string, we have t7 somewhere in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each terminal to its possible non-terminal parent.\n\nFor example:\n\nt78 \u2192 can come from NT78, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that produce t78. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT77 \u2192 t9. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the first entries:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' (so NT3 can produce t17)\nWait, no, looking at the given productions, NT3 is followed by 't17', which is part of the mapping. Wait, perhaps the 't's are the terminals, and the rest are non-terminals. So, the grammar has certain non-terminals that can derive specific terminals. For example, NT3 can produce 't17' as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify the grammar. Each line is a production, like S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then, each NT is a non-terminal that can derive into other NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, no: actually, from the given grammar, it seems that each production is either NTa \u2192 NTb NTc, or some NTa \u2192 'tn', where 'tn' is a terminal. So, for example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Then, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. And so on, until we reach a point where NTa \u2192 't...' a terminal. So, for example, NT67 \u2192 t56. So NT67 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't56'.\n\nSo, each non-terminal in the grammar either produces two non-terminals (and thus a non-terminal symbol) or a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the approach is to see if the entire string can be built by starting from S and applying the productions step by step until we get the string.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a yes\/no question, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree in reverse, starting from the terminals and seeing if we can reach the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down parsing approach, applying the productions and building the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, considering that it's in CNF, each step doubles the number of symbols, leading to an exponentially increasing parse. But since the string is relatively small, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to see if the string is a correct derivation by using a recursive approach, checking whether each segment of the string can be derived from a NT.\n\nLet me try to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first thing in the string, it's t90, which I notice is an actual token in the grammar, not a production. Let me check the rules for NT90. Wait, no, the grammar shows symbols like NTx, NTy, etc., but the terminals are 't' followed by numbers. So t90 is a terminal, and in the grammar, there's a rule where NT49 \u2192 't74', but that's not relevant here.

Let's see what each part can lead to.\n\nLooking at NT3: it can expand into NT17 and NT6. NT17 can lead to 't70' or other things. Wait, but t90 is a terminal, so perhaps it's part of a production. Looking through the rules, I see NT49 \u2192 't74' and NT75 \u2192 't79', but where does t90 come in? Hmm.\n\nWait, the string starts with t90, so I need to find a path from S that can produce t90. Maybe looking at the start symbol S, which splits into NT3 and NT77. Let's explore NT3 first.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Now, NT17 can produce 't70' or other things. Wait, but 't70' is a terminal, but t90 isn't directly there. Alternatively, looking at the string, t90 is the first token, so maybe that comes from NT75 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step. Let me try to see if I can expand S step by step.\n\nS: NT3 NT77\nLet me expand each part:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nSo S becomes NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44\n\nNow, let's replace these further if possible. Starting with NT17:\nNT17 \u2192 't70' or other options. Wait, in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 or NT8 NT58? Wait, checking the rules, NT17 can produce 't70' or other things. Let's see:\n\nLooking back, NT17 \u2192 't70' (I think this is the production, but looking through the rules, I don't see 't70' listed directly. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me search the productions for NT17.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't70'\n\nAh, yes. So NT17 \u2192 't70'.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 could be a terminal or more. Checking NT6: NT6 \u2192 't63'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't63' somewhere. Yes.\n\nSo expanding S: t70, NT6, NT68, NT44.\n\nThen, NT6 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo now, the string so far is t70, t63. But the given string starts with t90, so this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. Maybe the first part of the string doesn't come from NT3 but from NT77.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So after expanding both, we have NT3 and NT77.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first t90 comes from NT77. So NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So now, t68 and t44 could be in the string. But t90 isn't among them.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go deeper into the expansions.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't's. The given string has several t's: t90, t63, t75, t69, etc. Each t is associated with a specific non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each terminal is preceded by a 't' and a number. So we can map 'tX' to the corresponding non-terminal that produces 'tX'.\n\nFor example, 't90' corresponds to NT90, but in the grammar, I don't see a 't90' production. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nNo, looking through, I don't see any 't90' terminal except in NT49 \u2192 't74' and NT75 \u2192 't79', etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. The grammar is written with NTx and S, but when I replace them, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers. So each non-terminal can produce multiple things, some of which are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps 't90' comes from NT90, but looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule that produces 't90'. So maybe t90 is not in the grammar, which would mean the string is invalid. But that seems unlikely because the problem provides this string and expects a yes or no.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't54'\nNT75 \u2192 't79'\nNT33 \u2192 't10'\nNT54 \u2192 't83'\nNT22 \u2192 't71'\nNT31 \u2192 't14'\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\nNT77 \u2192 't30'\nNT95 \u2192 't61'\nNT93 \u2192 't54'\nWait, but in the rules, I see that NT49 \u2192 't74', and NT75 \u2192 't79'. But I don't see anything that ends in 't90' except perhaps NT27? Wait, looking for 't90', perhaps another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminals:\n\n'NT49 \u2192 't74''\n\n'NT75 \u2192 't79''\n\n'NT79 \u2192 't72''\n\nWait, perhaps 't90' is produced by NT27? Let me look:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see 'NT27' has productions \u2192 't29', 't27', 't90'. Yes! So NT27 \u2192 't29' or 't27' or 't90'.\n\nSo, if any subtree in the parse tree leads to NT27 and eventually produces 't90', that would make sense.\n\nSimilarly, other 't's can be mapped to their non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, I'll recall that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That simplifies things because we can parse the string using a top-down approach, perhaps with a recursive descent parser.\n\nThe grammar has non-terminals like S, NT3, NT20, and so on, with some of them eventually producing terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number). Some non-terminals are more complex and break down into others.\n\nThe string to analyze is: `t12 t65 t70 t61 t69 t68 t8 t83 t15 t17 t63 t60 t90 t74 t69 t70 t70 t51 t78 t78 t42 t42`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the non-terminals correspond directly to terminal symbols. For example, NT3 maps to 't17', NT58 to 't54', NT77 to 't32', etc. \n\nMy initial approach will be to work backward from the string and see if we can derive it from the start symbol S. Since S starts with NT3 (from the production S -> NT3 NT77), we'll begin from there.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT3 and NT77. Let's look at NT3: its production is NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So, we need to split the string into substrings that match NT17 and NT6.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is t12, so maybe that's part of NT17 or another non-terminal. Wait, NT17 is another non-terminal; let's check its production. NT17 -> NT8 NT58, which further breaks down into NT8 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. NT17 would require two parts. Maybe the start of the string is part of NT17. Let me see where t12 occurs. From the grammar, I see NT6 is 't63', which might not directly help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial non-terminals are more straightforward. Let me list out the first few non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\n\nSo, S starts with NT3 and NT77. Let's take NT3 first: it requires NT17 and NT6.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t12. Maybe t12 is part of NT17? Wait, looking at NT17's production, it's NT8 and NT58. What do those produce? NT8 is a terminal 't35', but in the string, the first token is t12. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe t12 is part of NT6?\n\nWait, NT67 is in the grammar and has a production to 't56', but that's not t12. Let me check NT6 in the grammar. Oh, I don't see NT6 in the given grammar except its production is 't63'. So perhaps NT6 is directly 't63'. If that's the case, maybe the t63 is part of the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t12, so I'm a bit confused. Let me take a step back. Maybe I should parse the string in order and see if it can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to split it into pairs since S's production produces two non-terminals. The string has 22 tokens. Since S is split into two, we can check if the string can be split into two parts that each start with a non-terminal.\n\nThe string length is 22, which is even, so maybe each split is 11 tokens. Let's try splitting at 11 tokens:\n\nFirst part: t12 t65 t70 t61 t69\nSecond part: t68 t8 t83 t15 t17\n\nWait, but the non-terminals in the grammar have varying production rules. Let me look at what each part could correspond to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is split into two non-terminals, each with their own structure. So perhaps the string is covered by two trees, each starting with a non-terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to work upwards from the string. Let's try to find sequences in the string that match the productions.\n\nLooking for a place where a non-terminal might be split. For example, starting from the beginning:\n\nt12 t65 t70 t61 t69 t68 t8 t83 t15 t17 t63 t60 t90 t74 t69 t70 t70 t51 t78 t78 t42 t42\n\nThe length is 22, so each split from S is 22 tokens. Let me check if the entire string can be split into two parts that each match the productions of the initial non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the first non-terminal, NT3, which splits into NT17 and NT6. So the first part of the string should match NT17's production and the next part NT6's.\n\nBut the string starts with t12, which doesn't seem to fit NT17 or NT6 directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list all the non-terminal productions and see if any of them directly match parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 -> NT68 NT44. So NT77 would be followed by NT68 and then NT44. Does the string have any part that starts with NT68 and then NT44?\n\nLooking at the string, after t12, we have t65 which is 't65', perhaps part of NT77's production. Let's see: t65 is matched by NT70 because NT70 is in the grammar as -> 't78' but also has productions to NT74 and others. Wait, perhaps I need to better map each non-terminal to its productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals correspond directly to terminals. For example, NT44 can produce t68. Wait, no, NT44's productions include NT22 and NT18, and some also produce NT37 and others. Looking back at the grammar, for example, NT44 has NT22 and NT18 as one production, and other longer productions.\n\nWait, let me check each production to see if any non-terminal directly produces a 't' number that appears in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT44 has a production to t68 (look at NT77's production? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT77 -> NT68 NT44. But NT68's production is -> NT17 NT79, and NT44's production is, for example, -> NT25 NT5, which are non-terminals. So that doesn't directly produce t68.\n\nWait, maybe NT20: looking from the grammar, NT20 is -> NT44 NT36. Then NT44 has a production to NT22 NT18, and NT36 has a production to NT17 NT65, and so on. This could get too complicated.\n\nMaybe it's better to look for non-terminals that directly map to a terminal 't' value in the string. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals:\n\n- NT44: one production is -> t68\nWait, no, in the grammar, looking at each production, some have a direct 't' value.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT49: 't74'\n- NT65: 't88'\n- NT65: 't46'\n- NT26: 't54'\n- NT82: 't51' and 't16'\n- NT36: 't50'\n- NT22: 't71' and 't87'\n- NT20: 't65'\n- NT70: 't78'\n- NT65: 't7' and 't46'\n- NT26: 't29' and 't54'\n- NT77: 't32'\n- NT44: 't60'\n- NT74: 't15' and 't70'\n- NT68: 't82' and 't93'\n- NT37: 't71' and 't40' and 't90'\n- NT82: 't16'\n- NT22: 't71'\n- NT26: 't22'\n- NT54: 't83' and 't9'\n- NT75: 't79'\n- NT59: 't17'\n- NT33: 't10'\n- NT74: 't15'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-420","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That simplifies parsing because each production can produce up to two symbols at a time.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit lengthy, but I can see that there are many productions. Each right-hand side (RHS) has either two non-terminals, one non-terminal, or sometimes a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, RHSs can't have more than two symbols, and if they do, they should both be non-terminals. So if there's a production like NT58 \u2192 t54, that's okay because it's a single terminal. But a production like NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82 would be allowed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t46, t24, t22, t30, t13, t75, t78, t24, t90, t90, t74, t78, t22, t44, t69, t7, t60, t56, t71, t35, t68, t87, t75.\n\nHmm, let me note these terminals:\n\n- t46\n- t24\n- t22\n- t30\n- t13\n- t75\n- t78\n- t24\n- t90\n- t90\n- t74\n- t78\n- t22\n- t44\n- t69\n- t7\n- t60\n- t56\n- t71\n- t35\n- t68\n- t87\n- t75\n\nWait, but some of these aren't in the terminals defined by the grammar. For example, NT3 is 't17', NT67 is 't56', NT26 is 't44', etc. So the entire string is a sequence of terminal symbols. Now, the key point is that the entire string must be generated correctly based on the grammar's productions.\n\nSince it's CNF, we can construct a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal and each internal node has exactly two children, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. The string should match this structure.\n\nLet me consider the structure starting from S. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S is a non-terminal, and generating it would require two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo, NT3 \u2192 NT17 and NT6. Now, NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT8. Wait, no, looking at the productions again:\n\nLooking back, I think I need to list all the productions again, perhaps organize them by non-terminals for easier reference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see how the string can be built up.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation process would expand two symbols at each step, each time doubling the number of symbols until reaching the string. However, the actual method to evaluate is to see whether the string can be obtained by starting at S and then applying productions step by step until the string is obtained.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Let's see what the last symbol is. The string ends with t75. Looking at the grammar, 't75' is produced by NT75. Checking the productions for NT75:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT79 NT26, or perhaps other productions. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions, \"NT75 -> NT79 NT26\" is one of them? Wait, let me check the given productions:\n\nAh, yes, under NT26: \"NT26 -> ... NT? let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nNT75's rules are:\n\nLooking for NT75, do I see it in the productions? Let me see the list:\n\nYes, here's a production:\n\n\"NT75 -> NT74 NT77\" \u2192 that's NT75 \u2192 NT74 NT77.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\n\"NT74 -> t75\" or \"NT75 -> NT74 NT77\". Wait, let me clarify.\n\nLooking through the production list, I find:\n\n\"NT74 -> t75\".\n\nWait, no, looking more closely, I see:\n\n\"NT74 -> t75\" is one of the productions. So NT74 \u2192 t75.\n\nAnd earlier, I see \"NT75 -> NT74 NT77\".\n\nSo to produce t75, we start with NT74, but to reach the string's end, we might need to see if NT75 can produce a t75.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the string ends with t75, so perhaps the last step of the derivation is NT75 \u2192 NT74 t75 or similar, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the last step would have to be a production that can produce t75.\n\nWait, so for NT74 \u2192 t75, then if in the previous step, before generating t75, we must have had NT74.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nTo end with t75, the previous symbol would have to be t75, so the production must end in NT74 \u2192 t75.\n\nBut let me try to build the string step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a list and try to reduce it by looking for possible pairs.\n\nWait, another approach is to list all the terminal symbols in the string and see if they can be linked according to the grammar. Starting from the entire string, we can try to find possible pairs that match any production in reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps using an approach where I process the string and try to decompose it into possible non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, the number of symbols is 23, which is odd. Since each step in the leftmost derivation would split a non-terminal into two, the number of symbols would increase by 1 each step. Starting with S (1 symbol), then 2, then 3, etc., up to the string length of 23. Wait, 23 is odd, so possible, but each step in CNF would increase the count by 1.\n\nWait, but let's check: the initial derivation of S is one symbol, then two, then three, etc. So the total number of symbols must be 1 + n, where n is the number of derivation steps. Since the target string has 23 symbols, that would require n = 22 steps. That's possible, as 23 is odd.\n\nBut let's approach this step by step.\n\nGiven the string: t46 t24 t22 t30 t13 t75 t78 t24 t90 t90 t74 t78 t22 t44 t69 t7 t60 t56 t71 t35 t68 t87 t75.\n\nPerhaps the last symbol is t75, which can only come from NT75 \u2192 t75, but looking at the productions, \"NT74 \u2192 t75\", not NT75. So, the last step must be NT74 \u2192 t75, which would come from the previous symbol being NT74, so the last two symbols before t75 must be NT74 and t75?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list the string as a list and try to see if I can split it into parts that match any of the production rules, either as a terminal or as a pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to map each terminal in the string to their corresponding non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-423","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I have a bunch of production rules for the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the problem. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing, for example, using the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need that here.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a series of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT3, NT44, etc.) produces either two other non-terminals or a terminal symbol. For instance, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and so on. Some of these rules produce terminals like 't12', 't8', etc.\n\nThe string in question is: `t12 t9 t87 t54 t35 t63 t27 t24 t8 t71 t46 t69 t44 t35 t14 t14 t65 t9 t90 t8 t56 t14 t24`.\n\nEach token is a string of the form 't<number>', where the number is a two to four digit number. The terminals listed in the grammar are things like 't12', 't8', 't14', up to 't93', 't90', 't74', etc. So, the string starts with 't12' and ends with 't24'. \n\nI notice that the grammar uses a lot of NT variables: NT12, NT24, etc. For example, the production NT12 -> 't12' is given, which is how 't12' is derived from NT12. Similarly, NT8 -> 't35' is another terminal.\n\nThe problem is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. I think I'll approach this by trying to find a derivation path that leads to the given string or determine if it's impossible.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. Looking at the production rules, S can only go to NT3 NT77. So any valid derivation must start with a sequence that begins with NT3 and NT77. \n\nSo the string must start with the concatenation of derivations of NT3 and NT77. Let's check the first token of the string: 't12'. Looking at the grammar, 't12' is a terminal for NT12, and one of the production rules is NT12 \u2192 't12'. So 't12' can come from NT12.\n\nBut looking back at the grammar, does NT12 produce anything? Yes, NT12 is a terminal, so it's one of the symbols that can appear in the string. So that's good.\n\nNow, looking at the beginning of the string, it's 't12' followed by 't9'. So after NT3 and NT77, their derived strings must start with t12 and t9 in that order.\n\nWait, actually, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the two non-terminals must directly produce t12 and t9. So I need to see if NT3 can produce t12 and NT77 can produce t9, or their respective derivations.\n\nLooking up NT3, its production rules are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6  \nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58  \nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50  \nAnd so on, until NT3 \u2192 't17'.\n\nSo NT3 can produce t17, but the first token is t12. So how can NT3 derive t12? Let's see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6  \nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58  \nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50  \nBut NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65  \nNT49 \u2192 't49'? No, wait. Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT49, one of the rules is NT49 \u2192 NT74 NT51. Then NT74 and NT51 can further produce other things. Wait, do any of these produce terminals? Let me check all the productions for NT49:\n\nLooking through the list, NT49's rules include NT49 -> NT74 NT51 and NT49 -> 't12'. Oh, wait, there's another production: NT49 \u2192 't12'. So that's important. NT49 can directly produce 't12'.\n\nSo can NT3 derive 't12'? Let's see the steps:\n\nNT3 can be expanded as NT17 NT6. NT17 breaks down into NT8 NT58, then NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. NT30 can go to NT49 NT65, then NT49 can go to 't12' because of NT49 \u2192 't12'.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6  \nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58  \nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50  \nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65  \nNT49 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo that would lead to t12 from NT3. Good.\n\nNow, the next token is 't9'. So after NT3's derivation (t12), we need to see what NT77 produces. NT77's production is S, but wait, let me check the grammar. Actually, NT77 can produce two things:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then, both NT68 and NT44 have their own productions.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44  \nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25  \nNT49 \u2192 't12' as above, and NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5. NT31 \u2192 NT14, and NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22. NT37 can produce 't70', 't30', 't40', 't71', etc., but let's see:\n\nWait, the first step after 't12' from NT3 is 't9', so we need NT77 to produce 't9' as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT77, the only way to get a terminal out of it is via the productions of NT68 and NT44. So let's see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44  \nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25  \nNT49 \u2192 't12'  \nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5  \nNT31 \u2192 NT14  \nNT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22  \nNT37 has several options: NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54, NT37 \u2192 NT59 NT0, NT37 \u2192 NT71 NT40, NT37 \u2192 NT59 NT0, etc. None of these immediately give 't9'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT44: NT44 has multiple productions, including:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18  \nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT39  \nNT39 \u2192 NT30 NT65  \nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65  \nNT49 \u2192 't12'  \nNT65 can produce t74, t88, t56, etc. Hmm. Alternatively, looking elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should look for 't9' in the grammars. Let's see which NTs directly produce 't9's.\n\nLooking through the grammar, 't9' is a terminal symbol. So, which NT rule produces 't9'? Let me check all the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT12 \u2192 't12', NT8 \u2192 't35', NT18 \u2192 't8', NT20 \u2192 't65', NT70 \u2192 't78', NT74 \u2192 't75', etc. But where is 't9'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't59' is not present. Wait, looking more carefully, I think I might have missed it. Let me re-examine the list:\n\nLooking through each NT's production rules, they sometimes have a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT74 NT51\n- NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n- NT18 \u2192 't8'\n- NT85 \u2192 't23' etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT directly producing 't9' in the given rules. Let me double-check the grammar to make sure I didn't miss it. Scanning through all the production rules...\n\nHmm, it looks like none of the non-terminals directly produce"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm given is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like `t42 t50 t60 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The given grammar has these rules, so it fits the criteria. Also, the base case is when a non-terminal symbol is replaced by a terminal symbol, specifically one of the 't' followed by a number, or maybe even just a 't' if I look closer.\n\nI need to parse the string to see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two symbols, so the parse tree should have a structure where each node has exactly two children. The string length is 22 tokens, which suggests the parse tree height could be around log2(22) \u2248 5 levels deep.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t42. Checking the grammar, I see a rule where NT3 is replaced by t17. But there's also a rule NT15\u2192't73', but in the string, it's t42, so I need to see if there's a path where any NT symbol generates t42. Looking through the production rules, I notice NT49\u2192t74, but that's t74, not t42. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules quickly.\n\nWait, I see NT70\u2192t7, NT95\u2192t61, but not t42. Hmm. Let me check. Oh, looking at the rules, there's a production NT98\u2192t93. No, that's t93. There's one NT58\u2192t5. NT26\u2192t44, and so on. Wait, is there an NT that produces t42 directly? Looking at the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t42. So perhaps it's a combination.\n\nWait, maybe it's built from two non-terminals, each of which reduces to 't' followed by a number, but overall the first token is t42. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination of two non-terminals that together produce t42. But in the given grammar, each production is exactly two non-terminals. So for 't42' to appear in the string, maybe a non-terminal produces t42, which isn't directly there, but perhaps via intermediate steps. Alternatively, maybe a production that combines two steps to generate the first 't42' token.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is a sequence of symbols where each symbol is either a terminal (starting with 't') or a non-terminal symbol (NT with a number). The string starts with 't42', which must be generated by some NT production step. But looking at the grammar, none of the NT symbols directly produce 't42'. The closest I see is NT58\u2192t5, but that's in the list, but not t42.\n\nWait, maybe 't42' is derived indirectly. For example, an NT with multiple symbols that eventually reduces to 't42'. But given that each production in CNF is two steps, and the input is a flat sequence, perhaps the 't42' is part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the parse tree. Each 't' symbol that appears at the top level must be a terminal. So, the first token is t42, which must be a terminal. But according to the given grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t42. So unless 't42' is derived via two steps from some non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The grammar's production rules have NTx -> NTy NTz, meaning each production is two non-terminals. When expanded, each of those non-terminals will be either a terminal or another production. So for the string to start with t42, that could mean that the start symbol S produces NT3 NT77, each of which might further produce more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nBut the first symbol is t42, which is a terminal. So the first production step would have to be a non-terminal that eventually produces t42, possibly through two non-terminal productions. But looking through the grammar, except for the list of NTx\u2192tbundle, there's no NT that directly maps to t42.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t42 is part of a larger structure where two non-terminals combine, but no, in the input string, it's just t42, then another token, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all the NT productions and see if any of them can derive the given sequence.\n\nLet me look through the NTx productions:\n\n- NT49\u2192t74\n- NT85\u2192t30\n- NT36\u2192t50\n- NT77\u2192t32\n- NT37\u2192t70\n- NT44\u2192t68\n- NT25\u2192t14\n- NT91\u2192? Hmm, looking at the list, I see NT49\u2192t74, but not NT42. So the first token t42 isn't directly produced by any of the NTx rules. That suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar, hence the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and there's a way to get t42. Let me double-check the rules: NT18\u2192t8, which is used in several rules. NT36\u2192t50, which is t50. NT44\u2192t68, and so on. Wait, but none of these produce t42. So unless there's a longer path. For example, take NT15\u2192t73, which is not helpful. NT75\u2192t79, that's not t42.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe in the grammar, 't42' isn't directly covered, but maybe it's generated through a series of productions. For example, perhaps a non-terminal with a number that includes a 't42' as its token, but looking at the grammar, the NT rules all either combine other NTs or produce t's followed by numbers.

Each production either replaces a symbol with two symbols or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals (like S, NT3, NT44, etc.) eventually produce strings of terminals (letters like t, and numbers). Each of these terminals seems to be a part of the language, and the grammar defines how they are combined.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string from left to right to see if each component can be matched by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must start with NT3 and NT77. So the first two parts should be NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first parts are t72, t35, t78, t74, etc. Wait, actually, the string is all separated by spaces, so the first two symbols are t72 and t35. But according to the grammar, S produces NT3 NT77, which are two non-terminals, each of which should produce a string of terminals.\n\nSo the first part should be a production of NT3 followed by a production of NT77. Let's see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n- NT6 \u2192 t63\n- NT30 \u2192 t54\n- NT50 \u2192 t24 (Wait, NT50 is in the grammar as NT50 \u2192 t24, but that's inconsistent because in other rules, NT50 appears elsewhere, like NT50 \u2192 t24. Wait, actually, looking deeper, in the grammar, I see that NT50 is present, but I need to check all its productions.)\n\nWait, let's look at NT3 and NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 produces two non-terminals, NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nNT30 is a terminal, t54.\n\nNT50 appears in multiple places. Looking at the grammar, I see NT50 \u2192 t24, but also other productions for NT50. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT50 having production to t24. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see entries like NT50 \u2192 t24? Wait, checking the list:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list, and I need to scan for NT50.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t83\n- NT51 \u2192 t27\n- NT98 \u2192 t93\n- NT90 \u2192 t90\n- NT75 \u2192 t79\n- NT0 \u2192 t8\n- NT54 \u2192 t83\n- NT26 \u2192 t44\n- NT51 \u2192 t27\n- NT93 \u2192 t27\n- NT22 \u2192 t71\n- NT31 \u2192 t14\n- NT36 \u2192 t50\n- NT2 \u2192 t69\n- NT74 \u2192 t15\n- NT5 \u2192 t14\n- NT71 \u2192 t10\n- NT23 \u2192 t29\n- NT54 \u2192 t69\n- NT8 \u2192 t69\n- NT74 \u2192 t60\n- NT22 \u2192 t78\n- NT2 \u2192 t22\n- NT83 \u2192 t51\n- NT77 \u2192 t30\n- NT6 \u2192 t63\n- NT79 \u2192 t72\n- NT58 \u2192 t54\n- NT22 \u2192 t87\n- NT44 \u2192 t68\n- NT5 \u2192 t14\n- NT71 \u2192 t10\n- NT23 \u2192 t18\n\nWait, I don't see NT50 being a terminal, so NT50 must be a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, looking at NT36: 36 is a non-terminal, and one of its productions is NT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79, and another is NT36 \u2192 t50. So NT36 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal t50.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 is a non-terminal that, according to the grammar, seems to have a production to t63? Wait, looking at NT6:\n\nIn the grammar, I see that NT6 \u2192 t63? Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through, under NT6, I find: NT65 \u2192 NT98 NT26, etc. Wait, I don't see NT6 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made an error. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the grammar as provided includes entries like NT65 \u2192 NT98 NT26, NT82 \u2192 NT65 NT17, etc. Looking for a production where NT6 goes to a terminal.\n\nHmm, I think I may have missed that. Wait, in the provided grammar, there's a line \"NT6 -> t63\". Wait, yes: searching the list, I see NT6 \u2192 t63. So NT6 produces 't63'.\n\nSo, putting NT3 together:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nBut NT30: Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT30 as a terminal. Wait, checking the list again, I see that NT30 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT30 does.\n\nLooking for NT30 in the grammar: \"NT30 \u2192 t54\" and \"NT15 \u2192 't73'\". Wait, no, wait, I see \"NT30 \u2192 t54\" as a production. So NT30 produces 't54'.\n\nSo tracing back:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nNT30 \u2192 t54.\n\nSo that part would produce 't54'.\n\nBut wait, NT50 is not resolved yet. NT50 is a non-terminal. Let me check NT50's productions. From the grammar, I don't see any direct terminal production for NT50. Wait, is there a production that resolves NT50?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT50 is a non-terminal, and it seems that in many cases, it's part of a larger production. So for example, NT74 \u2192 t74.\n\nWait, actually, looking for NT50, I don't see a direct production. So perhaps NT50 is part of another production that ultimately leads to a terminal.\n\nBut looking deeper, in the provided grammar, under NT50, I don't see it producing any terminals. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Wait, looking through the list, I see that NT50 is part of many productions, like NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT18, etc. So perhaps NT50 cannot produce any terminals, meaning the only way is if there's a production that resolves it to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar again to see if NT50 appears anywhere as a terminal. Looking through the list, under NT50, I don't see a '\u2192 t24' or similar. So maybe NT50 is unresolved, which would be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check. Let me scan the grammar list again for NT50:\n\nLooking for '\u2192 t...' or any terminal immediately.\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22\n- NT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79 | t50\n- So, NT36 can produce t50.\n- Other non-terminals seem to have their own productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to figure out the tree.\n\nSo starting with the string, the first part is t72. That means the first non-terminal in the initial production must be something that produces t72.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So each of NT3 and NT77 must produce a string that matches parts of the input.\n\nThe input starts with t72 t35 t78 t74"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-462","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, but it's a bit intimidating because the grammar is quite large, with 65 non-terminal symbols and a bunch of productions. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: \"t73 t74 t27 t87 t75 t79 t65 t56 t72 t12 t54 t15 t90 t75 t29 t12 t65 t79 t60 t46 t88 t30 t68 t27 t18\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar's structure is. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single symbol or two symbols on the right-hand side. That means each production is quite simple, which might make it easier to parse once I have an automaton or a way to generate the language.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, the initial production seems to be S -> NT3 NT77. So, S expands into NT3 and NT77. Each of these NTs is a non-terminal that further produces other combinations. The NTs eventually lead to terminals, which seem to be the 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT3 -> 't17', NT77 -> 't32', etc.\n\nThe string provided is a series of these 't' tokens. My goal is to see if this token sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of applicable productions.\n\nHmm, let me start by breaking down the string:\n\nt73, t74, t27, t87, t75, t79, t65, t56, t72, t12, t54, t15, t90, t75, t29, t12, t65, t79, t60, t46, t88, t30, t68, t27, t18.\n\nSo, the string is 25 tokens long. I need to see if the grammar can generate this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the first symbol is t73. Looking at the grammar, the only production that results in 't73' is NT15 -> 't73'. So, that would mean that one of the NTs in the expansion must be NT15.\n\nSimilarly, the last symbol is t18. Checking the grammar, I see that NT18 -> 't8' directly. Wait, but the last symbol is t18, which isn't present in the grammar. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't8' (Wait, that's 't8', not 't18'.)\n- NT27 -> 't44'? Wait, let me check the provided grammar carefully.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some terminal symbols are assigned to certain NTs:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT18 -> 't8'\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT65 -> 't46'\n- NT26 -> 't29'\n- NT40 -> 't90'\n- NT30 -> 't54'\n- NT49 -> 't12'\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n- NT54 -> 't83'\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT31 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't15'\n- NT79 -> 't69'\n- NT8 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT83 -> 't51'\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT6 -> 't63'\n- NT79 -> 't72'\n- NT58 -> 't54'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT5 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n- NT8 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT5 -> 't14'\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n\nWait, I'm looking at this, the 't18' isn't present in any production. The closest is NT22 -> 't78' and NT27 -> 't44'? Wait, no, looking again, I don't see a production that ends with 't18'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-express this. In the given grammar, there's no rule for NT18 that produces a terminal 't18'. The closest is NT18 -> 't8' (from NT18. So perhaps the string is invalid? Or maybe it's a typo, but I have to go by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but the string provided ends with ...t27 t18. So, looking at the grammar, do any of the NTs produce 't18'? Let me search through all the NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules again, I don't see any NT that directly produces a 't18'. So that's a problem because if the last token is 't18', the grammar can't produce it. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and each symbol is either a terminal or non-terminal from the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) looks like. CNF is a context-free grammar where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, I see that most productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, except for those that end with a terminal like 't' or symbols like 't74', etc.\n\nThe given string is: t74 t44 t12 t61 t69 t63 t10 t70 t14 t13 t30 t51 t14 t69 t79 t72 t32 t54 t68 t30 t14 t10 t78 t10 t68.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77. So the first step in the derivation would be S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then each NT would expand into their productions, eventually leading to the terminal symbols.\n\nBut dealing with this directly seems complicated. Maybe I can approach this by trying to parse the string backwards, or see if each symbol in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, the string has 24 symbols, which correspond to 24 productions. Since each NT in the grammar produces exactly two other NTs or a terminal, the parse tree for this string should have a structure where each internal node has two children. The number of symbols, if the string is correctly generated, should be a number that allows this. Each production adds one non-terminal, so the total number of symbols in the string should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is equal to twice the number of internal nodes plus one. Wait, no, more accurately, in a binary tree, the number of leaves is equal to the number of internal nodes plus one. But in this case, each internal node produces two non-terminals initially, and then each of those may eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nThen each of those can be NT3 and NT77, and so on. So any correctly generated string should have the number of symbols that is 2^n, but considering that each NT may produce a mix of NTs and terminals. Hmm, maybe that's not right.\n\nWait, in a normal derivation for a string of length n, the number of nodes in the parse tree would be n, but each NT can produce either two NTs and then later those can be terminals. So the string length is the number of leaves, which would require that the number of leaves n satisfies that n = 2^k - 1 for some k, since each split is binary.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 24 symbols. Let's see if 24 fits that.\n\nIs 24 = 2^k -1?\n\n2^5 =32, 2^4=16. 24 is 16+8, which is not 2^k -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed from a series of steps where each step appends new symbols, and the total number of symbols could be any number, but the structure may vary.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to process the string from top to bottom, trying to reduce it to S.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, which is NT3 NT77. So if the string starts with NT3 and is immediately followed by NT77, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t74, which is a terminal, not NT3. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, wait, no. Actually, the initial production S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the leftmost derivation would have to be S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and then each of those NTs would have to expand into their respective symbols, leading to the entire string.\n\nBut the given string starts with t74, which is a terminal that I believe corresponds to NT74 \u2192 t74, since in the grammar rules, NT74 appears as NT74 \u2192 t75, but also other rules, but wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example, NT74 has a rule: NT74 \u2192 t75. And another rule: NT74 \u2192 t75 if any? Wait, no: Wait, the grammar is a list of production rules, each of the form A \u2192 \u03b1, where A is a non-terminal, and alpha is a sequence of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t75\n- NT26 \u2192 t29\n- NT48 \u2192 t18\n- NT79 \u2192 t72\n- NT15 \u2192 t73\n- NT93 \u2192 t54\n- NT54 \u2192 t83\n- NT50 \u2192 t24\n- NT26 \u2192 t5\n- NT44 \u2192 t68\n- NT65 \u2192 t46\n- NT22 \u2192 t78\n- NT26 \u2192 t44\n- NT54 \u2192 t69\n- NT75 \u2192 t79\n- NT65 \u2192 t98\n- NT44 \u2192 t30\n- NT22 \u2192 t87\n- NT44 \u2192 t68\n- Wait, but looking through these rules, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, NT74 in one rule is t75. Wait, but in the given grammar, I see lines like:\n\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT74 -> t75\nWait, no, checking again.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT74 -> t75\n\nNT75 -> t79\n\nNT54 -> t83\n\nNT54 -> t83\n\nNT75 -> t79\n\nNT15 -> t73\n\nNT93 -> t54\n\nNT44 -> t68\n\nNT26 -> t29\n\nNT79 -> t72\n\nNT22 -> t78\n\nNT26 -> t44\n\nNT54 -> t69\n\nNT50 -> t24\n\nNT26 -> t5\n\nWait, some non-terminals directly produce terminals like t8, t18, etc. So for example, NT74 can produce t75, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t74, which is a terminal, can that be derived from the grammar? Because in the grammar, t74 itself is a terminal, but looking at the non-terminals, t74 is not directly produced by any NT rule. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT74 has a rule NT74 \u2192 t75. So no NT directly maps to t74, but NT74 can go to t75.\n\nWait, so in the string, the first symbol is t74, but in the grammar, there is no NT that produces t74 as a terminal. Hence, that string starts with t74, but t74 isn't produced by any NT. Wait, did I miss it?\n\nLooking at all the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t74. Therefore, t74 is not a terminal in this grammar, which means any occurrence of t74 must be the result of an NT expanding into another NT or a terminal, but since t74 is not a terminal, it must be part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, but in the production rules, I can see lines like NT26 -> t29, which is a terminal. But not t74. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, all the terminals seem to be like t74, t44, etc. Wait, so for example:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 t74.\n\nYes, looking at the end of the list, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT85 -> t23\n- NT36 -> t50\n\nSo, NT74 \u2192 t75 is one rule, and there's a separate production for NT75 \u2192 t79.\n\nWait, so NT74 never goes to t74, only to t75. So how can the string have a t74 if the grammar doesn't produce it?\n\nThat seems like a problem. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the string given starts with \"t74 t44 t12 t61...\", but in the grammar, there's no NT that can produce t74 as a terminal, so that would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-478","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll quickly glance at the grammar to see the possible non-terminals and terminals. From the productions, I can see that 't' followed by numbers are the terminals. So any token in the string starting with 't' could be a result of a production ending with a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is: `t8 t15 t18 t10 t16 t7 t29 t8 t75 t78 t7 t12 t74 t7 t35`. Wait, actually, I just realized, the string seems to be a sequence without spaces, so it's actually a single string like `t8t15t18t10t16t7t29t8t75t78t7t12t74t7t35`. But the initial problem presented it as separate tokens, but maybe it's a continuous string. Hmm, wait, the user wrote it as `t8 t15 t18 t10...` which seems like each 't' followed by a number, so 't8' is a single token, so the string is actually each 't' followed by a number, and each of those is a separate terminal. So the entire string is a concatenation of these terms.\n\nLet me list out the entire string in terms of each terminal symbol: t8, t15, t18, t10, t16, t7, t29, t8, t75, t78, t7, t12, t74, t7, t35.\n\nNow, each of these terminals must correspond to a production that leads down to them. So each 'tXY' is a terminal symbol, which in Chomsky Normal Form would be a production that ends directly with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, I see:\n- NT15 \u2192 't44'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT22 \u2192 't78'\n- NT83 \u2192 't51'\n- NT74 \u2192 't16'\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- And so on.\n\nWait, each non-terminal has multiple productions, some leading to terminals and others to other non-terminals.\n\nBut the problem is that the string is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must start with S and, through a series of productions, end up generating this exact sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S is \"NT3 NT77\". So S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nLet's look at NT77. From the grammar, NT77 has a production: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So NT77 splits into NT68 and NT44.\n\nThen, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. NT68 needs to split into NT49 and NT25.\n\nLooking at each of these non-terminals, do they have terminals or more non-terminals?\n\nFor example, NT49 \u2192 't12' and NT44 \u2192 't60'. Wait, so NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, but wait, NT25 is another non-terminal. So 25 splits into something else.\n\nWait, hold on. NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5. Let's check NT31. NT31 \u2192 NT14. NT14 has a production \u2192 NT37 NT22. So now it's getting more complex.\n\nThis seems like a tree that can branch a lot. But let's try to see if the given string can be built step by step.\n\nBut before diving into that, maybe it's better to try the bottom-up approach. Each terminal in the string should be generated by a production that directly produces a single terminal (since the grammar is CNF, which typically allows only two non-terminals per production, but in this case, the productions vary. Wait, actually, each production in CNF is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so they all have a maximum of two non-terminals. So for a production to produce a single terminal, it must have only that terminal as the RHS.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals do not have any direct production to a terminal; for example, NT3 is \"t17\", so it directly produces 't17'. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't63', etc.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, we need to check if there's a production that directly generates it.\n\nLooking at the string, each 'tXY' must correspond to a non-terminal that has a production with that terminal. So let's list each 'tXY' and see if it's in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that many 'tXY's are present as direct productions:\n\n- t8: Looking through the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 t60, but I don't see t8 as a direct production. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking for t with two digits as direct productions.\n\nt8 appears in NT74 \u2192 t74? Or maybe not. Let me check each production.\n\nFrom the productions, NT18 \u2192 t8. Yes, NT18 \u2192 't8'.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'.\n\nNT16 \u2192 't61'.\n\nWait, no, NT16 splits into NT95 NT18. So NT16 has a production to NT95 and NT18, which then splits further.\n\nLooking for 't8' in the productions, I see NT18 \u2192 't8'.\n\nSo t8 is generated directly by NT18.\n\nSimilarly, t15 is generated by NT83 \u2192 't51'? Wait, no, NT75 \u2192 't79', etc.\n\nWait, let's make a list:\n\nt8: Directly produced by NT18.\n\nt15: Looking for NT with production 't15'. Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't see any direct terminal for t15. So t15 must be generated by some non-terminal that eventually leads to it through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but Chomsky Normal Form allows each production to be two non-terminals, but to get a terminal, it must be an explicit terminal. So if a non-terminal doesn't have a direct production to any terminal, then it can't produce any terminal in one step. Thus, perhaps that's a problem.\n\nLooking back, the string includes t15, which must be generated by some non-terminal, say NT15. So looking at NT15's productions:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't44' (from production NT15 \u2192 't44'), right? Wait, I see in the grammar, yes:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't44'\n\nWait, no. Checking again: The productions for NT15 is NT15 \u2192 't44'. So NT15 can directly produce 't44', but in the string, there's a t15. So t15 would have to be generated by some non-terminal that eventually produces 't15'.\n\nBut in the grammar, do any non-terms produce 't15'? For example, looking for NT with a direct production to 't15':\n\nI don't see any. The given productions for each non-terminal seem to either produce terminals or other non-terminals. So maybe 't15' can't be generated at all. But wait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, re-examizing the grammar:\n\nLooking for t15:\n\nI see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't70'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't83'\n\nNo, so probably 't15' is not directly produced by any non-terminal. Instead, perhaps the string contains 't15' which can't be generated, so the string isn't in the language. But wait, the grammar doesn't have a production for 't15'. So that would mean that the string is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar:\n\nYes, looking through all the productions, I don't see any production that directly produces 't15'. So 't15' can't be generated by this grammar, meaning the string includes a symbol that is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, the string provided is:\n\nt8 t15 t18 t10 t16 t7 t29 t8 t75 t78 t7 t12 t74 t7 t35\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each 'tXY' in the string:\n\nt8: Yes, NT18 \u2192 't8'\n\nt15: Not directly generated, but does it have a production chain?\n\nWait, looking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 't44'. So NT15 can't generate t15 because it's directly 't44'. So the production for NT15 only gives 't44', so t15 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-484","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it can be generated. The string is a series of terms connected by spaces, which I assume are terminals from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar and understand how the string can be derived from it. The grammar consists of non-terminals on the left (like S, NT20, etc.) and rules that expand these non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number, like t24, t44, and so on.\n\nLooking at the initial production of the grammar: S -> NT3 NT77. So any string generated by this grammar must start with whatever NT3 and NT77 produce. Since both are non-terminals, they have their own rules.\n\nLet me write down the string to analyze:\n\nt24 t44 t29 t24 t60 t69 t83 t69 t50 t24 t56 t70 t16 t46 t90 t46 t75 t44 t68 t50 t71 t24 t14 t71 t13 t75.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Since each rule in CNF produces exactly two non-terminals, every production step will add exactly one symbol, either another non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. In Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production step for a non-terminal adds a single symbol in the derivation, but each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the entire process starts from S and replaces non-terminals until all are terminals, creating a parse tree with height log\u2082(n) where n is the length of the derived string, minus one perhaps.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use a bottoms-up parsing technique, like the CYK algorithm. Alternatively, I can try to build a parse tree manually, considering the possible rules that can lead to each terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few symbols and see if I can find the rules that could split them.\n\nThe first symbol is t24. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT24 is defined as \u2192 t24. So the first non-terminal must derive to t24 directly.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Let's see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17 (from the grammar: NT3 -> 't17'). So NT3 must be 't17', but the string starts with t24. Wait, that's a contradiction because S's first rule is NT3, which is supposed to produce something else, but in the string, it's t24. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure.\n\nWait, the grammar uses 'NT' followed by numbers as the non-terminals. So NT3, NT24, etc., are the non-terminals. Each of these has their own production rules. The terminals are strings starting with 't' like t24, t44, etc.\n\nLooking again at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17' (so it's a terminal production)\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' (terminal production)\n- So if the string starts with t24, that could be from either NT24 directly.\n\nWait, but according to the initial production S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S would produce the concatenation of what NT3 and NT77 produce. If NT3 produces 't17', and NT77 produces something else, then the string would start with t17 followed by that something else. But in our case, the string starts with t24, which is the beginning of the first symbol.\n\nThat's conflicting because according to the initial production, the string starts with the first symbol from NT3, which is 't17'. So the string should start with t17, not t24. Therefore, either I made a mistake or perhaps the initial production's non-terminals are replaced in a way that doesn't produce t17.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me check:\n\nThe initial rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So to produce a string starting with NT3, which according to the grammar is 't17', but in the string, the first symbol is 't24'. That suggests that either the initial symbol is being replaced by a different path, or perhaps the string starts after some derivation steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each non-terminal can be expanded in multiple ways. So perhaps the initial S can produce a sequence where the first symbol comes from a different production of NT3 or NT77.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, NT3 can only produce 't17' because in the provided rules, NT3's production is fixed as 't17', not any other way. Wait no, looking again: NT3's rule is given as NT3 \u2192 NT31 NT6. So perhaps NT3 has multiple productions?\n\nWait, no, the grammar provided is a list of rules, each on a separate line with arrows. Let me look for NT3. Yes, the line is:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check each rule more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n- NT22 \u2192 NT39 NT22\nWait, perhaps not. Let me find NT3's rules.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT3 produced 't17', but looking at the rules provided, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT17 and NT6. Then NT17 is another non-terminal, which has another production:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nAnd looking through the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't69'\n- NT58 \u2192 't93'\n\nSo NT17 \u2192 't69' 't93', making it 't69t93'. Similarly, NT6 is another rule:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo putting this together, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 (t69 t93) (t63). So the concatenation would be t69 t93 t63.\n\nBut wait, that's a problem because in the initial rule, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the first two symbols would have to come from NT3 (which would be t69 t93 t63) and NT77, which is another non-terminal.\n\nBut the string starts with t24, which is a single terminal. So according to the grammar as provided, the first symbol of any derived string must start with t17, because NT3 is the first symbol in S's production, and it's replaced by something that starts with t69, t93, t63. Wait, no, NT3 in production is NT17 NT6, which is replaced by 't69 t93 t63'. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. If NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which then would be replaced by their respective productions. So NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 \u2192 't69' 't93'. And NT6 \u2192 't63'. So NT3 \u2192 't69 t93' 't63'. So the first three terminals would be t69 t93 t63, followed by whatever NT77 produces.\n\nBut our string begins with t24, which is a single symbol. So I'm confused because according to this, the first symbol should be t69, not t24. But the given string starts with t24, which seems to contradict the grammar. Therefore, perhaps the string isn't in the language.\n\nBut wait, looking again, I think I might have made a mistake in how the productions are structured. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT8 \u2192 't69'\n- NT58 \u2192 't93'\n- NT6 \u2192 't63'\n\nSo combining, NT3 \u2192 't69' 't93' 't63' (since each production rule is applied, and concatenation is done step by step). So the first part would be 69, then 93, then 63. But the string starts with 24, which is different. So the initial part of the string doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-501","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens like `t78`, `t87`, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol can produce a sequence of non-terminals. In this grammar, the start symbol is S, and all the production rules seem to be in CNF because each rule has two elements on the right-hand side, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that some of the NT (Non-Terminal) symbols are directly mapped to terminal symbols, like NT3 \u2192 't17' and NT83 \u2192 't16'. So when we see these in the string, that's a match for those rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t78 t87 t9 t65 t90 t10 t10 t17 t63 t14 t9 t88 t69 t27 t70 t75 t74 t7 t35 t83 t44 t72 t50 t30 t90 t27 t90`.\n\nI think the approach here is to check each terminal in the string against the grammar. That is, each part of the string should correspond to a production that matches exactly. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in our case, perhaps mostly terminals and non-terminals).\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals, or a non-terminal producing a terminal and another non-terminal, but when we have a terminal, that's terminal production. So, when the string is a sequence of terminals, each must be produced by a terminal production.\n\nSo, for example, when the string has `t78`, we need to check if there's a production where NT78 produces terminal 't78'. Looking at the grammar provided, I don't see NT78, so perhaps it's a combination. Wait, actually, in the grammar, for example, NT74 has some productions, but I don't see NT74 in the initial grammar provided. Wait, no, the user seems to list all the productions; let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT78. So that's a problem because `t78` in the string isn't directly a terminal production. That might mean the string can't be generated, but wait, perhaps it's a derived symbol through multiple productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is constructed from the start symbol by expanding each non-terminal into its productions. So, perhaps each part of the string is either a non-terminal that can be expanded further or a terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, each token is a terminal symbol (like `t78`, `t87`, etc.) so each of these must be directly produced by a terminal production. Therefore, each of these terminal symbols must correspond to a production in the grammar where the non-terminal directly expands into that single terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar provided, I don't see any NT with a production that results in `t78`. For example, let's look for NT3. NT3 \u2192 `t17` is a terminal production, but `t78` isn't listed. So unless there's a non-terminal that directly produces `t78`, which isn't present, the string cannot have `t78` as a terminal. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps some non-terminals can produce multiple symbols. But in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal? No, actually, in CNF, all productions are two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in the usual form, they are two non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, the only way to get a terminal is through a single terminal production, not combined with anything. Wait, no, actually, not exactly. If a grammar is in CNF, it can also have rules where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal symbol. So for example, A \u2192 a is allowed in CNF if a is a terminal.\n\nBut in our case, looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces `t78`. So the string can't be generated because `t78` isn't present in the grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a token `t78`, but there is no production rule in the grammar that directly produces `t78` from a non-terminal.

I have a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. The string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols, which are 't's followed by numbers. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t7 t78 t74 t69 t10 t90 t68 t50 t9 t9 t50 t75 t87 t27 t7 t78 t9 t70 t50 t17 t27 t70 t16 t56 t27 t14 t32 t16.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't7', 't78', etc. Looking at the grammar, certain non-terminals map directly to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT58 \u2192 't54', NT74 \u2192 't75', and so on. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production expands non-terminals into two non-terminals or directly to a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be generated by a production that directly outputs a terminal, meaning each symbol must correspond to a rule like A \u2192 a.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I can check if each symbol in the string can be matched to a direct production in the grammar. Let's go through each symbol one by one:\n\n1. t7: Is there a production NT7 \u2192 't7'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT7 directly producing 't7'. So 't7' might not be a valid terminal symbol from any rule.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the grammar rules again to see if any non-terminal produces 't7'. Scanning through, I see several NT rules mapping to various 't' symbols. For example, NT37 \u2192 'NT77 NT54' doesn't produce 't7'. Hmm, let me go through each symbol:\n\n- 't7' is not listed as any direct production, except perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT productions.\nLooking again, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't7'. So maybe 't7' is not part of the language, which would mean the answer is 'No'. But wait, let's check all symbols:\n\nt7: Not found\nt78: NT77 \u2192 't32' doesn't produce 't78'. Wait, looking at the grammar again: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18, etc. So 't78' might come from some combination of non-terminals. But for the string, we need each symbol to be a direct production. So 't78' would require a rule that directly produces it, which I don't see. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So the terminal symbols are the ones directly from the rules where a single non-terminal is mapped to a terminal. Let me see: \n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see rules like NT3 \u2192 't17', NT59 \u2192 't17', etc. But I don't see any non-terminal that directly maps to 't7'. So 't7' is not a terminal output of any rule, meaning the string cannot be generated because it contains symbols not present in the grammar. \n\nEven if the grammar can derive longer sentences, the string must consist of terminals that are directly produced by rules. So if any symbol in the string is not a direct terminal in the grammar, the string isn't in the language.\n\nTherefore, since 't7' is not a terminal symbol in the grammar's productions, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. The answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal symbol 't7' which does not appear as a direct production in the grammar.

Let me look at the string again: it's a sequence of tokens like t54, t74, t7, etc. Each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers are likely parts of non-terminals. So the string is a series of terminals, and I need to see if this can be produced by the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT3 NT77, the start symbol produces two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. So the string must start with two non-terminals expanded into the given terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t54. Let's check what leads to t54.\n\nIn the grammar, t54 is terminal and appears in several production rules. Let's find which production rules have t54 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, t54 is part of:\n- NT48 \u2192 t54\n- NT26 \u2192 t54\n- NT54 \u2192 t54\n- NT98 \u2192 t54\n- NT68 \u2192 t54\n- NT17 \u2192 t58\n- NT37 \u2192 t54\n- NT83 \u2192 t54\n- NT22 \u2192 t54\n- And others where t is a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking more carefully, here's the relevant part:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48 \u2192 t54 (since NT48 \u2192 t54)\n- NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54 \u2192 t54\n- NT83 \u2192 NT44 NT14 \u2192 maybe leading to t54\n- NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 \u2192 which might lead to T's\n- NT74 \u2192 NT74 NT77 \u2192 could have t54\n- NT54 \u2192 t54\n\nWait, but wait, let's look at the actual non-terminals that lead to 't54'. In the provided grammar:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48. NT48 \u2192 t54. So yes, NT26 can produce t54.\n- NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54. NT83 \u2192 't14' eventually, but under some rules, it could lead to a terminal involving 54? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, 83 is defined as:\n- NT83 \u2192 NT44 NT14 \u2192 then 44 \u2192 68 44, etc., but the terminal 't' in NT83 is 't71' in some cases?\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's make a list of all production rules where a non-terminal ends with t54.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n- NT48 \u2192 t54\n- NT26 \u2192 t54 (since NT48 \u2192 t54)\n- NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54 \u2192 so NT37 can produce t54 if the second part is NT54.\n- NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 \u2192 but NT68 and NT44 don't directly produce t54. However, NT44 \u2192 t68 \u2192 t44.

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The CFG is provided with a list of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. CNF has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most rules are of the form NTxyz \u2192 NTpq NTrs, meaning each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. There are also some rules where the non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal, like NT8 \u2192 't35', which I can consider as a production rule where NT8 produces terminal t35.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t60 t51 t60 t70 t79 t32 t32 t32 t63 t51 t46 t8 t44 t54 t74 t8 t71 t87 t74 t90 t35 t16 t12 t50 t68 t27 t15 t60`.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal symbol, and they are in order, so the entire string is a sequence of terminals. I need to determine if there's a derivation in the grammar that starts with the start symbol S and through a series of productions, ends up with exactly this string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can approach this problem by trying to parse the string using a CYK algorithm or by attempting to find a leftmost or rightmost derivation. However, given the complexity of the grammar, parsing manually might be tricky, so perhaps a step-by-step approach would be better.\n\nFirst, look at the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the first two symbols in the string must be the results of NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t12 and then t60. So, we check if NT3 can produce t12 and NT77 can produce t60.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT3 is defined as NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Let's see what those produce. NT17 is NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT6 is NT6 \u2192 't63'. So, NT3 would be NT17 and NT6, which when expanded become (NT8, NT58) and t63. NT8 is 't69' and NT58 \u2192 't54', so NT3 would produce 't63' and 't54'? Wait, no, NT6 is t63, and NT17 is t69 followed by t54. Wait, no, NT17 \u2192 NT8 (t69) and NT58? Wait, looking back, NT58 is NT58 \u2192 't54'. So, NT17 is NT8 \u2192 t69 and NT58 \u2192 t54, so NT17 is t69 followed by t54. So, NT3 is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 (t69, t54, t63). Wait, no, NT3's production is NT17 NT6. But NT6 is a terminal, so NT3 produces t63 and NT17, which is t69 t54. So, NT3 produces t63 and then the combination t69 t54. Wait, that might be a problem because in the string, the first two tokens are t12 and t60, not involving t63 or t54.\n\nWait, maybe I got this wrong. Let me recheck. NT3's rule is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT6 is directly 't63'. So, when expanding NT3, it first expands to NT17 and then to 't63'. But since it's in CNF, each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. However, NT3 is supposed to produce NT17 and NT6, both of which are NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, no. NT3 is an NT, and according to its rule, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, this production requires that NT3 is replaced by NT17 and NT6. Since these are non-terminals, each will be expanded further.\n\nSo, in the first step of S \u2192 NT3 NT77, we have to see if NT3 expands to produce the first symbol as 't12' and NT77 expands to produce the second symbol as 't60'.\n\nBut wait, if NT3's expansion starts with 't12' or 't60', let me see.\n\nLooking at NT3's expansion: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, during derivation, when expanding NT3, it would first produce NT17 and then NT6. NT6 is a terminal 't63', so that's one of the symbols. But according to the string, the first token is 't12'. So, this suggests that 't12' is directly from NT3. Let me check the productions for NT3.\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nAnd looking for any other rules that produce 't12' from NT3. But in the given grammar, is there any rule where NT3 directly produces 't12'? I don't see that. The only rule for NT3 is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, that means when NT3 is expanded, it produces two non-terminals, NT17 and NT6, which are then expanded.\n\nSince NT6 is a terminal 't63', that would mean the first token in the string should be 't63'. But in the string, it's 't12' as the first token. So, that's a problem because S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which would start with NT3 producing something. But according to the grammar, NT3 doesn't produce 't12'; it produces NT17 and NT6, which in turn produce t63.\n\nTherefore, the first token in the string is 't12', but according to the grammar, the first non-terminal NT3 can't produce 't12'. It can only produce t63 along with some combination from NT17.\n\nSo, that suggests that either the string is not correct or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some production rules. Let me scan through all the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice that some non-terminals are repeated, like NT3 appears several times, but I don't see any rule where NT3 directly produces a terminal other than 't63'. The same for NT77: looking up NT77's rule, it's NT77 \u2192 NT44 NT44. So, NT77 is an NT and it expands into two other NTs.\n\nSo, putting this together, S \u2192 NT3 NT77 would expand to NT3 producing (as above) t63 and NT77 producing two NTs, which in turn would need to expand to symbols.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't12', which doesn't match with 't63', so S can't start with 't63' or 't12' followed by other tokens to make the entire string. Therefore, the string is not compatible with the grammar because the first symbols don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the expansion. Let me double-check.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77: the first production is NT3 and then NT77. NT3 when expanded would first produce NT17 and NT6, which is t63 (since NT6 is 't63'). So, the first two symbols should be t63 and then the expansion of NT77. But the string starts with t12 followed by t60. Therefore, the first symbol is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the string.

Let me start by understanding the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the grammar, each non-terminal (like S, NT20, etc.) has two non-terminals on the right side. So each step in the derivation will replace one non-terminal with two others, moving left towards the terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t13 t10 t8 t8 t14 t60 t71 t69 t56 t44 t54 t46 t46 t78 t56 t27 t14 t44 t83 t27 t15 t24 t68 t87 t12 t32 t12 t27 t32`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t13, which is a literal. Looking at the grammar's productions, I remember there are entries like NT83 \u2192 't13' and NT65 \u2192 't73'. So, either NT83 or NT65 could produce t13. Since the string starts with t13, I'll need to see if the derivation starts with either NT83 or NT65.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S splits into NT3 and NT77. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\n1. NT3: From the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't17' or 't63' or 't12', etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT3 has two productions: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 and NT3 \u2192 't17'. But I also see NT36 \u2192 NT30 NT65 and other NT3 productions. Wait, looking back, the provided grammar has NT3 \u2192 't17' and other options. But I need to check if NT3 can produce 't13'. Hmm, in the grammar, looking for NT3's productions, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT3 \u2192 't63'\nWait, checking the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see NT3 has two productions: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 and NT3 \u2192 't17'. Are there other NT3 productions? Wait, no, only those two. So NT3 can directly produce 't17' or 't63' or 't12'? Wait, I'm a bit confused because in the user's provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nAlso, looking further, there's NT49 \u2192 't74', and NT8 \u2192 't35', but for NT3, it's only 't17' and that's it. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's grammar is very long, but looking at it, for NT3, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- And any other? No, only those two.\n\nWait, that can't be because in the grammar, NT3 is part of other productions, but for NT3 directly, it only can produce 't17' or 't63'. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT3, there's:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nAnd also, I think I see NT3 \u2192 't17'. Wait, let me check the full list. Looking through the lines, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT17 NT6\n- Also, no other productions for NT3 except the ones that depend on other non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, for NT3, the only productions are NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 and NT3 \u2192 't17'. So, it can directly produce 't17' or split into two non-terminals. But in the string, we have t13 as the first symbol. So, maybe S needs to go via a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding NT3's productions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe there's another production for NT3 that I missed. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any other NT3 productions except the two I mentioned. So, if the string starts with t13, then the derivation must start with S \u2192 NT77 NT3? Wait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, S splits into NT3 and NT77. So the first two symbols would be whatever NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nWait, the string starts with t13 t10 t8 t8..., so the first two tokens are t13 and t10. So NT3 must produce t13, and NT77 must produce t10. But wait, looking back, NT77 has a production NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Let's see if that can produce t10.\n\nWait, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, and NT49 \u2192 't74', so that path produces 't74' from NT68. Then NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5, and NT31 \u2192 NT37 NT22. NT37 can produce 't59' if I'm not mistaken? Wait, looking at the grammar, under NT37, I see two options: nt37 -> nt83 nt54 and NT37 \u2192 nt59 nt0. So, if NT37 is used, it can produce 't83' or 't59' or other things. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can parse the string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t13. So the first symbol is t13, which can be derived from either NT3 (if NT3 can produce 't13') or NT83 or NT65 (since looking at the grammar, NT83 or NT65 can produce 't13').\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT3 only can produce 't17' directly. There's no production that produces 't13' directly. Wait, maybe I missed that. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 't13' (line: NT83 -> 't13')\n- NT65 \u2192 't73' (line: NT65 -> 't73')\n- Also, NT3's productions: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 and NT3 \u2192 't17'\n\nSo, only NT83 directly produces 't13'. So, to get the first symbol 't13', the derivation must come from NT83.\n\nBut S starts the derivation as S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the initial split is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Therefore, the first two symbols should be from NT3 and NT77, not from NT83 or NT65 directly. So that suggests that the first symbol is produced by NT3, but in the string, the first symbol is t13, which is only possible if NT3 can produce 't13', but according to the grammar, NT3 cannot. Therefore, this string might not be in the language. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split isn't S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Let me check that. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string must be what NT3 and NT77 produce, in either order. But the string starts with t13 and t10, which doesn't fit because NT3 can't produce t13.\n\nWait, unless there's a way for NT3 to produce something else that eventually leads to t13, but that seems unlikely because the only way to get t13 is via NT83, which is not part of the initial split.\n\nSo, that suggests that the string cannot be generated because the initial symbol t13 can't be produced by any of the non-terminals that come from S's initial split.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing a non-terminal that can produce t13 through a series of steps. Let me think. Maybe starting from some deeper non-terminal that eventually leads to t13.\n\nFor example, suppose the string t13 t10 t8 t8... starts with t13, so it's the first symbol. If t13 is produced by NT83, then perhaps the derivation starts with NT83. But S doesn't produce NT83. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way for S to produce some other structure that includes t13, but considering S splits into NT3 and NT77, which can't produce t13 directly, this seems impossible unless there's an intermediate non-terminal that can produce t13, but that's not part of the initial split.\n\nWait, maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no. Looking back, NT22 isn't directly producing a terminal in the list, but wait: looking at the grammar, NT22 is part of other productions. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, NT22 is in several productions like NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18, NT25 \u2192 NT22, NT74 \u2192 NT22, and NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT22. But looking at the productions, only NT30, NT26, etc., produce terminals directly. Wait, no: in the grammar provided, I need to check all rules to see if any NT directly maps to a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production rule in the grammar, I think the ones that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17' (from NT3)\n- NT18 \u2192 't8' (from NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82 ... but then the productions for NT68 and NT82 might be non-terminals, which might eventually produce terminals. Wait no, looking at the grammar, I think the NTs that directly produce terminals are:\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. The grammar has some non-terminals that directly produce terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't17', NT18 \u2192 't8', etc. So each of these NTs can be considered as terminals when expanded.\n\nSo, the strategy is to model this as a parse tree where the root is S, and each symbol in the string must be generated by expanding the productions until terminal symbols are reached.\n\nGiven that, let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t30 t27 t18 t74 t30 t18 t60 t10 t50 t75 t7 t60 t87 t61 t32 t70 t16 t29 t42 t17 t61 t16 t8 t74 t32 t65 t74 t16 t74 t65`.\n\nSo, the string has 28 tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-560","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers or letters. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that the start symbol can also appear on the right-hand side. The end-of-string symbol, which in this case is probably 't', isn't a terminal because it's a production rule, but in this context, it's being used as a terminal symbol since the string consists of 't's. Hmm, actually, looking at the rules, some of them have 't' as part of the right-hand side, so they're terminals, I think.\n\nThe string given is `t61 t73 t65 t87 t50 t15 t12 t74 t72 t74 t7 t63 t56 t15 t88 t12 t50 t63 t65 t68 t56 t61 t13 t30 t16 t69 t87 t50 t10 t44`. Wait, that's a lot of 't's and numbers. Each symbol in the string is a production rule, so each 'tX' is a terminal symbol where X is a number, maybe corresponding to a non-terminal symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, many of these 't' symbols are defined as terminals, like `NT58 -> NT5 NT85` and then it has a rule `NT58 -> t54`. Wait, no, some rules are written as NT... -> NT... and others have a terminal like 't42' or 't13'.\n\nSo each time a rule has a terminal on the right-hand side, that's a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals. To figure out the string, I need to see if each symbol in the string matches a production rule or if there's a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nThis might be complicated, but maybe I can start from the top-down approach, using the start symbol S and see if it can derive the string. But the string is pretty long, so that would take a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree from the string up, ensuring that each part matches the production rules.\n\nWait, wait. Each element in the string is a single terminal symbol, right? So the string is a sequence of terminals, which should match the left-hand sides of the productions. But looking at the grammar, the productions have non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right. So, to parse the string, each terminal token must correspond to a production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, there's a production like `S -> NT3 NT77`. So S can generate NT3 and NT77 in sequence. Each of those NTs can produce other NTs or terminals. So the grammar is recursive, and the string must be built from these sub-productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to think of the string as a series of terminal symbols that the grammar can generate through a sequence of productions. Since each production in CNF can only produce two non-terminals, the string must be broken down into pairs of non-terminals at each step until reaching the terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, so each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. The end result is that each terminal in the string must be the result of a production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nSo each terminal in the string must be a production where the left side is a non-terminal, and the right side is exactly that terminal. So I need to check if each 't'X in the string is defined as a terminal production for the corresponding NT symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example, `NT58 -> t54` and `NT54 -> t9` etc. So any NT followed by '-> t'X may be a terminal production. So the first step is to check if each 't'X in the string matches any of these NT\u2192t rules.\n\nSo let's list out the NT symbols that have 't' endings:\n\n- NT58 -> t54\n- NT26 -> t44\n- NT44 -> t60\n- NT49 -> t12\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT79 -> t69\n- NT75 -> t79\n- NT54 -> t9\n- NT5 -> t14\n- NT22 -> t78\n- NT44 -> t68\n- NT17 -> t70\n- NT65 -> t46\n- NT93 -> t54\n- NT26 -> t29 (this might not be a terminal)\nWait, no: for example, NT15 -> 't73', so the string is 't73', so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, the string starts with t61, t73, etc. So each of these must be from a production where the left-hand side is an NT symbol that directly produces that terminal.\n\nSo let's check each symbol in the string:\n\nt61: In the grammar, does any NT have a production -> t61? Looking at the rules, yes: NT61 is defined as -> t61 (from NT61 -> t44 and others maybe, but specifically, in the rules after NT65 and others: NT61 -> t61 is not directly present. Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT65 -> t61 (Yes, in the section: NT65 -> t46 and others, but also NT65 -> 't44' and in another production it's used with 't46'. Wait, maybe I need to look again. Let me scan the rules carefully.\n\nWait, let's list all NT symbols and their productions:\n\n- NT65 -> t74? Or NT65 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT65:\n\nAt the beginning: NT65 appears in several rules. Checking line by line:\n\nLine 8: NT65 -> NT78 NT2\n\nLine 14: NT65 -> NT77 NT21\n\nLine 25: NT65 -> NT78 NT44\n\nLine 26: NT65 -> NT46 NT21\n\nWait, but later, at line 40: NT65 -> t46\n\nWait, no, line 40 is: NT65 -> t46?\n\nNo, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules from line 1 onwards:\n\nNT65 appears in several places. Let me look for lines where NT65 is on the left side.\n\nYes, lines 8, 14, 25, 26, 40, etc.\n\nWait, line 40: NT65 -> t46? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the rules, line 40 is NT60 -> t14.\n\nNo, let me look more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLine 37: NT26 -> t44\n\nLine 41: NT26 -> NT5 NT48\n\nLine 42: NT26 -> NT48 -> t18?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, step by step. Let me make a list of all NT symbols and their right-hand sides.\n\nLet's parse each rule and extract the right-hand sides where the right-hand side is a terminal (a 't'X).\n\nFrom the given grammar, here are the production rules where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\n- NT15 -> 't73'\n\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n\n- NT44 -> 't60'\n\n- NT58 -> 't54'\n\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n\n- NT65 -> 't46'\n\n- NT93 -> 't54'\n\n- NT26 -> 't29' (Wait, is that a terminal? Because NT26 -> NT19 NT... Or is that a non-terminal?)\n\nWait, no, line 13: NT26 -> NT5 NT48\n\nSo that's non-terminals. Then later, line 20: NT26 -> t44. So NT26's productions include both NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is either into two NTs or a terminal. So any production where the RHS is a single terminal can match a 't'X in the string.\n\nSo in the rules, for example:\n\n- NT5 -> t14\n\n- NT7 -> t7 (from NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-583","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure out the best way to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form where each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a single terminal symbol. In this case, I can see the grammar has several production rules. My task is to determine if the given string can be derived by the start symbol S.\n\nThe string provided is: `t63 t68 t44 t63 t65 t70 t32 t8 t16 t9 t15 t35 t15 t42 t50 t83 t56 t13 t71 t88 t60 t14 t83 t9 t63 t70 t63 t75 t18 t54 t50`.\n\nWow, that's a long string with a bunch of terminal symbols. In the grammar, the terminals are the strings that appear in the rules. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string from the end using a method like the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. Since the grammar is in CNF, CYK can be applied effectively.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals and production rules. Maybe I should start by looking at the string and break it down into smaller parts, seeing if I can find a way to group them into the productions.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string to better understand what I need to look for:\n\nt63, t68, t44, t63, t65, t70, t32, t8, t16, t9, t15, t35, t15, t42, t50, t83, t56, t13, t71, t88, t60, t14, t83, t9, t63, t70, t63, t75, t18, t54, t50.\n\nNow, I should go through each terminal and see if I can find a production that generates it. Let me look at the grammar rules and see which terminals can come from which non-terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at t63 in the string: From the grammar, I see that NT63 -> t63. So any 't63' in the string must come from the non-terminal NT63. Similarly, t50 comes from NT50.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine the sequence of non-terminals that can generate the entire string. It might be helpful to build a table for CYK, but since I'm doing this manually, I can try to break the string into possible chunks.\n\nLet me start by looking for the longest possible matches first. For instance, the first token is t63, which comes from NT63. Looking at the grammar, NT63: \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT63 -> NT49 NT25\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules: Oh, there's ND15 -> t42, but that's not helpful. Wait, ND63? Let me scan the rules to find NT63.\n\nWait, no, in the rules above, I don't see NT63 directly. Looking through all the rules, I see that NT63 isn't directly listed as a production. Wait, no, I think I missed it. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT50 -> t24, but that's not. Hmm, wait, the initial rule is S -> NT3 NT77. So S generates two non-terminals first. But since we're working our way through the string, maybe we can think of the entire string as a sequence of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The string is a sequence of terminals, and each terminal must come from a production in the grammar.\n\nSo, let's take each terminal and see if I can backtrack through the grammar.\n\nStart from the beginning:\n\n1. t63: This is produced by NT63. So NT63 must come from some rule. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT63 in the production list. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, I see:\n\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18\n\nNT22 -> t71 NT39\n\nSo, if there's a t71, it comes from NT22, which in turn may come from another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map all terminals to their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nHere's a list:\n\nt63: NT63?\n\nWait, no. In the rules, I don't see NT63. Looking through all the rules again, I might have missed it.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT65 -> t77, t65\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see the only terminals mapped from non-terminals are:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n\n- NT18 -> t8\n\n- NT20 -> t65\n\n- NT70 -> t78\n\n- NT50 -> t24\n\n- NT74 -> t75, t70, t32, t54\n\n- NT68 -> t63\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n\n- NT18 <- rules with NT18 are: NT18 -> NT68 NT82, etc.\n\n- NT20 -> t65 (so when a t65 appears in the string, it comes from NT20)\n\nWait, but the first token is t63. Where does t63 come from? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for where t63 is, let me check all the terminals:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT68 -> t63 (e.g., NT68 -> t63 ...?)\n\nYes, looking back:\n\nLooking for terminals in the production rules:\n\nNT68 -> NT36 NT17 NT65\n\nWait, no, that's three non-terminals. Let me find which NTs produce t63.\n\nWait, looking for t63, I see in the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\n- NT36 -> t50\n\n- NT63 isn't directly listed as a terminal, but perhaps from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I need to look through each rule to see which nt produce which t.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nLooking through each right-hand side, whenever a terminal is present, find the non-terminals that produce it.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n\n- NT18 -> t8\n\n- NT20 -> t65\n\n- NT70 -> t78\n\n- NT50 -> t24\n\n- NT74 -> t75, t70, t32, t54\n\n- NT68 -> t63\n\n- NT77 -> t32\n\n- NT44 -> t60\n\n- NT59 -> t17?

{"custom_id":"request-586","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by that grammar. Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The grammar here seems to consist of a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT20, NT68, etc.) and terminals which are the 't' followed by numbers like t12, t18, etc.\n\nThe task is to determine if the string `t12 t74 t8 t29 t22 t30 t83 t56 t54 t18 t44 t74 t44 t22 t17 t63 t54 t72 t83 t8 t35 t42 t30 t61 t17 t30 t70 t9 t10 t56 t27` is generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is made up of space-separated tokens like 't12', 't74', etc. So each token is a terminal symbol. So the goal is to see if this sequence of terminals can be derived by the start symbol S in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's a bit long, but let's see. The start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77. So S is a non-terminal that splits into two parts: NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the productions, each NT seems to be a non-terminal that expands into two other non-terminals until, eventually, it produces a terminal.\n\nWait, but wait. Actually, looking more closely, some of the NT productions have terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', meaning that when NT3 is derived, it directly produces the terminal 't17'. Similarly, some others like NT49 \u2192 't74', NT65 \u2192 't88', etc.\n\nSo the process to check if the string is in the language would involve trying to build a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal that produces two children, which can either be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut manually building a parse tree for such a long string would be time-consuming, especially since the grammar is quite large. Maybe a better approach is to use a method like the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars in CNF.\n\nHowever, considering that the string is pretty long (38 tokens) and the grammar is also extensive, CYK might be too tedious. So perhaps I can look for a pattern or make some observations.\n\nWait, first, let's note the structure. The start symbol S produces NT3 NT77. So S generates two parts: the first part is whatever NT3 produces, and the second is whatever NT77 produces. So the string should be a concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT3 and the other from NT77.\n\nLooking at the given string: it's 38 tokens long. Wait, let me count. Let me list them:\n\n1. t12\n2. t74\n3. t8\n4. t29\n5. t22\n6. t30\n7. t83\n8. t56\n9. t54\n10. t18\n11. t44\n12. t74\n13. t44\n14. t22\n15. t17\n16. t63\n17. t54\n18. t72\n19. t83\n20. t8\n21. t35\n22. t42\n23. t30\n24. t61\n25. t17\n26. t30\n27. t70\n28. t9\n29. t10\n30. t56\n31. t27\n\nWait, that's 31 tokens. Hmm, maybe I didn't count correctly. Let me recheck:\n\nString: `t12 t74 t8 t29 t22 t30 t83 t56 t54 t18 t44 t74 t44 t22 t17 t63 t54 t72 t83 t8 t35 t42 t30 t61 t17 t30 t70 t9 t10 t56 t27` \u2192 that's 30 tokens.\n\nBut since S produces two parts (NT3 and NT77), the overall string should be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT77. So we can split the string into two parts: the part before the first NT3-derived tokens, and the part after.\n\nWait, but in the given string, all the tokens start with 't', so each token is a terminal. So the question is, is the entire string the result of expanding NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, maybe the initial part is from NT3 and the latter from NT77. Or perhaps it's split differently. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me look at the start symbol's production: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the entire string should be a concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, for example, if NT3 generates a certain sequence of terminals, and NT77 generates another, the overall string should be their concatenation.\n\nSo, first, let's see what each production can generate.\n\nLooking at NT3: it's a non-terminal that can produce terminals or other non-terminals. Let's find its production table.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' (a terminal) or can expand into other non-terminals?\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are two non-terminals, except for the terminals which are single symbols. So looking at NT3's productions:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 and other possibilities? Wait, looking again:\n\nWait no, in the given grammar, looking for NT3's productions: oh, no, in the provided grammar snippet, I see lines like NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, but that's probably a mistake because in CNF, each production is only A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So the grammar has mixtures.\n\nWait, actually, wait. The user-provided grammar seems to have some patterns where NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, but some have NTx \u2192 't'? Or are all the NT productions either two NTs or a terminal?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT3 NT67: that's NT85 producing NT3 and NT67. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82.\n\nBut some non-terminals have productions that end with terminals. For example, NT67 \u2192 't56'.\n\nSo, in the right parts, some produce terminals directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 can produce 't17' directly, so it's a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT3 \u2192 't17' is a terminal. So that's the case.\n\nBut other NTs may expand into other NTs. Like NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because in CNF, each production should be a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps there might be some typos or mistakes in the grammar provided, but I'll assume the grammar is correctly presented.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the grammar correctly. Looking at the initial lines:\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nNT20 -> NT44 NT36\n\nWait, no, wait. The grammar is:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nNT20 -> NT44 NT36\n\nNT68 -> NT49 NT25\n\nAnd so on. So each NT is either a two-NT production or a terminal.\n\nBut I'm seeing that some NTs have multiple productions, perhaps two non-terminals, or one terminal.\n\nWait, let's take for example NT3. Looking at the list, NT3's productions are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, NT3 has:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nWait, but that's a two-NT production. Wait, but in the given grammar, I also see NT3 \u2192 't17' in the latter lines.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check again. The user provided a long list of productions. Let me parse the list:\n\nLooking through, I see lines like:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nEarlier lines have things like:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nWait, but also further down, I see lines where NT3 is on the left and the right side is a terminal or other combinations.\n\nWait, the grammar as given is a big list, but perhaps it's a mistake in formatting. Maybe some lines are indented differently, making it hard to read.\n\nWait, looking again, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nNT20 -> NT44 NT36"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-605","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of production rules for non-terminals S, NT20, NT68, and so on. The terminals are strings of the form 'tXX', where XX is a number. Each production rule either combines two smaller non-terminals or uses a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t9 t7 t35 t13 t56 t30 t88 t30 t9 t17 t54 t61 t12 t18 t88 t63 t74 t70 t73 t83 t50 t30 t9 t73 t32 t46 t68 t9 t7 t35 t16 t71`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either S \u2192 NT a NT or NT \u2192 a NT or NT \u2192 NT b, where a and b are terminals or non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the left or exactly one non-terminal and a single terminal as a result.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either S \u2192 NT A NT with A being a NT, or similar. Wait, no, actually, the grammar seems to be such that every production is of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or NTX \u2192 NTY a or a NTX, but since the grammar is in CNF, the productions are only two non-terminals on the left. Wait, the grammar is given with productions like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which is S producing two non-terminals. Then other productions are like NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, so each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right until we reach a terminal.\n\nSo, each production is a binary split, and the entire string is a sequence of terminals derived from expanding these non-terminals.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if we can parse it using the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to attempt to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S. Alternatively, I can see if the string length is compatible with the grammar.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production either results in two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the total number of terminals in a derivation is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of non-terminals derived. But that might not be directly helpful here.\n\nLet me count the number of terminals in the given string.\n\nThe string is: `t9 t7 t35 t13 t56 t30 t88 t30 t9 t17 t54 t61 t12 t18 t88 t63 t74 t70 t73 t83 t50 t30 t9 t73 t32 t46 t68 t9 t7 t35 t16 t71`.\n\nCounting each word: let's count them. Each is a single token, as they\u2019re all separated by spaces and don\u2019t have any multiple t\u2019s. Let's count: t9 (1), t7 (2), t35 (3), t13 (4), t56 (5), t30 (6), t88 (7), t30 (8), t9 (9), t17 (10), t54 (11), t61 (12), t12 (13), t18 (14), t88 (15), t63 (16), t74 (17), t70 (18), t73 (19), t83 (20), t50 (21), t30 (22), t9 (23), t73 (24), t32 (25), t46 (26), t68 (27), t9 (28), t7 (29), t35 (30), t16 (31), t71 (32).\n\nTotal is 32 terminals.\n\nHmm, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or a non-terminal generates a terminal. The number of symbols in the derivation tree would be 32, so the number of nodes in the parse tree would be 32, which would require a binary tree, but 32 is a power of 2, which fits since each non-terminal splits into two. Wait, but 32 is not a power of 2. Wait, 32 is 2^5, so a tree of depth 5 could generate that. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be generated through expansions that result in 32 symbols.\n\nBut wait, in CFG in CNF and for a regular language (which this is since it's in CNF), the number of symbols is one more than twice the number of productions, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to recursively split the string from the start symbol S, each time splitting into two parts and checking if each part can be generated from the left and right non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's try to find which non-terminals can generate it by splitting.\n\nThe entire string is 32 symbols. Let me check the possible splits according to the S production. The start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must split into two parts, the first generated by NT3 and the second by NT77.\n\nSo let's see: NT3's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 must generate a string starting with NT17's string followed by NT6's string.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo, the entire string would first need to split into two parts: the first part generated by NT3 (i.e., NT17 NT6) and the second part generated by NT77 (NT68 NT44).\n\nLet's see if that works. So, the string is: t9 t7 t35 t13 t56 t30 t88 t30 t9 t17 t54 t61 t12 t18 t88 t63 t74 t70 t73 t83 t50 t30 t9 t73 t32 t46 t68 t9 t7 t35 t16 t71.\n\nFirst, check if the entire string can be split into two parts where the first part starts with a string generated by NT17 and the second part by NT6, then the second part is generated by NT68 and NT44.\n\nWait, no: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, so the whole string would be NT17's string followed by NT6's string. Then NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, so the second part would be NT68's string followed by NT44's string.\n\nWait, but NT77 is derived as NT68 NT44, so the second part must be NT68's string followed by NT44's string. Therefore, the overall string is [NT17 NT6] [NT68 NT44]. So the entire string should be the concatenation of NT17's output and NT6's output, with the latter being the concatenation of NT68's output and NT44's output.\n\nSo, let's split the entire string into the first part (from the start of S) up to some point and the second part, which is the rest. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT77, the entire string is the concatenation of NT17's string (from NT3's NT17) and NT6's string (from NT3's NT6), which itself is NT68's string (from NT77's NT68) followed by NT44's string (from NT77's NT44).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this more systematically.\n\nThe entire string should be generated by the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So:\n\n- The first part is generated by NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n- The second part is generated by NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nThus, the entire string should be NT17's string followed by NT6's string, and NT6's string is itself NT68's string followed by NT44's string.\n\nSo the entire string must be split into four parts:\n\n1. Part a: generated by NT17\n2. Part b: generated by NT6\n   - Part b is further split into Part b1 (from NT68) and Part b2 (from NT44)\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a combination of two terminals or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t12 t75 t72 t42 t54 t75 t29 t9 t8 t72 t68 t78 t65 t69 t78 t60 t78 t9 t29 t65 t54 t24 t22 t88 t75 t44 t68 t56 t46 t60 t15 t56`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT3 NT77. So, the first step is looking at the first two tokens: 't12 t75'. I remember from the production rules that 't12' is produced by NT65. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT65, the productions are -> NT77 NT2, and also -> NT75 NT21. The second production generates t75 and t21. So, 't75' could come from NT75, which seems to produce t75. So, T75 -> t75.\n\nSo, the first two tokens 't12 t75' can be generated from NT65 -> 't75' NT21. Now, next, looking at the NT21 production: NT21 -> NT39 NT65. I need to see if these can be expanded into the next tokens.\n\nThe next tokens after 't75' are 't72 t42'. Let's see if NT65 can produce 't72' and 't42'. Looking at NT65's productions, I see NT65 -> NT68 NT33 and also NT65 -> NT98 NT26. Let's check the expansions for these:\n\nFor NT68 -> NT78 NT44. NT78 -> t78, and NT44 can produce t44, which is 't44'. But wait, the next token is t72 and then t42. Hmm, that might not fit. Let's look for another path.\n\nThinking again, maybe NT21 can be NT39 NT65. Let me see what NT39 produces. From the grammar, NT39 -> NT30 NT65. So, NT39 starts as two non-terminals. Then, NT30 is in the production rules: NT30 -> t54 and also NT30 appears elsewhere.\n\nLooking back, the next tokens after 't75 t72 t42'... Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Maybe I should break this down step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't's, so each token is a terminal. So, the entire string is a concatenation of t tokens. The grammar, when fully reduced, should generate a string where each 't' corresponds to the terminal production of a non-terminal.\n\nBut trying to expand step by step is going to be tedious. Maybe a better approach is to see if all the 't' tokens in the string correspond to the possible terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n- NT18 -> t8\n- NT20 -> t65\n- NT22 -> t71\n- NT25 -> t14\n- NT31 -> t14\n- NT36 -> t50\n- NT44 -> t68\n- NT59 -> t17\n- NT65 -> t46\n- NT65 -> t75 (since NT65 also produces t75)\n- NT74 -> t75 (another production)\n- NT83 -> t54\n- NT85 -> t27\n- NT93 -> t27\n- NT0 -> t8\n\nAdditionally, NT57 is not directly a terminal, but perhaps through further expansion.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t12: looking back at the grammar, 'NT65' produces 't75' and 't21' (from NT65 -> NT75 NT21 or NT65 -> NT21 NT78? Wait, looking at the grammar provided, I might have misread it before.\n\nWait, let's look back at the grammar more carefully. The grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT77. Then, various productions like NT68 -> NT49 NT25, etc.\n\nLooking for 't12', according to the grammar, 't12' is one of the terminals, and it's produced by NT65. Specifically, NT65 -> 't75', but wait, earlier I thought NT65 can produce t75 directly, but now looking, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for 't12': I see 't12' appears under NT49: NT49 -> t74 (as per the grammar, line NT49: 'NT49 -> 't74'). But in the string, the first token is t12. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, the lines are for non-terminals, and the strings are their terminals. So, perhaps 't12' is a terminal, but does any non-terminal produce it? Let me look through all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list again, the 't's that are terminals are t12, t17, t8, t65, t75, t85, t14, etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see lines like:\n\n- NT49 -> 't74' (so NT49 can produce t74)\n- NT75 -> 't75' (but that's more a non-terminal symbol; perhaps I misunderstood the grammar structure).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: each production is a non-terminal on the left, and on the right, it's either another non-terminal or a terminal. So, for each NT (like NT3, NT18, etc.), the right-hand side tells what they can expand to.\n\nSo, any production where the RHS has a terminal (e.g., 't17') means that NT3 can be expanded to that 't' token.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal productions (i.e., where the RHS has 't' followed by a number) are:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n- NT18 -> t8\n- NT20 -> t65\n- NT22 -> t71\n- NT25 -> t14\n- NT31 -> t14\n- NT36 -> t50\n- NT44 -> t68\n- NT59 -> t17\n- NT65 -> t75\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT83 -> t54\n- NT85 -> t27\n- NT93 -> t27\n- NT0 -> t8\n\nAdditionally, I see NT93 and NT85 can produce 't27', but 't27' isn't a terminal in the string, so I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nSo, the string in question is: t12 t75 t72 t42 t54 t75 t29 t9 t8 t72 t68 t78 t65 t69 t78 t60 t78 t9 t29 t65 t54 t24 t22 t88 t75 t44 t68 t56 t46 t60 t15 t56.\n\nWait a minute: the first token is 't12', but according to the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce 't12' except perhaps NT65. But according to the grammar, I think I saw that NT65 can produce 't75', but not 't12'.\n\nWait, in the grammar list above, looking under NT65: the productions are NT65 -> NT77 NT2 and NT65 -> NT75 NT21. So, 't75' is produced, not 't12'. So, how do we get 't12' in the string?\n\nThis suggests that the first token 't12' is produced by NT65, but according to the grammar, that's not the case. Therefore, the string starts with 't12', which, according to the grammar, might not be a possible production.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let's go through the grammar in detail again.\n\nLooking at NT65: is there a production for NT65 that produces 't12'? From the given grammar lines, I don't see any NT65 -> 't12'.

So, the given grammar should only have these types of rules.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, indeed, all the rules are in CNF because each production starts with a non-terminal followed by other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, `S -> NT3 NT377` is in CNF since it's a non-terminal producing two other symbols (NT3 and NT377). The right-hand side has either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNext, I need to understand what terminals and non-terminals are in the grammar. From the grammar, it looks like non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT3, NT16, etc., and terminals are strings starting with 't' followed by numbers or just numbers, like 't69', 't65', etc.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals. Since each production in CNF only has two symbols on the right-hand side, the parse tree should be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children.\n\nTo check if the string can be generated, I should try to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can produce the entire string. Since the grammar is in CNF, we'll use the leftmost derivation method.\n\nBut wait, this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I could represent the string as a series of productions and see if each step leads correctly.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens:\n\nt69 t65 t83 t54 t56 t35 t70 t79 t74 t12 t32 t9 t61 t14 t65 t15 t56 t8 t68 t42 t70 t12 t22 t60 t16 t10 t14 t71 t74 t22 t60 t32 t51\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the first two symbols should be NT3 and NT77, which correspond to t69 and t70, respectively. But looking at the string, the first token is t69, and the second is t65. So, that's a mismatch. Wait, that seems odd.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the first two terminals should be the expansions of NT3 and NT77. Let's check what NT3 and NT77 expand to.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 't7' and 't63'. So, NT3 expands to t7 followed by t63, which is 't7 t63'.\n\nWait, no, actually, each production in CNF is a single step. So NT3 is defined as NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and so on.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Alternatively, I can note that each production consists of two symbols. So the string is built by expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t69, t65, t83, etc., I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list the productions that result in a terminal symbol:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals expand to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t17\nWait, no: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 NT17 expands to NT8 NT58, which in turn, NT58 \u2192 't54', and NT8 \u2192 't69'. So NT3 \u2192 t8 t58? Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check each symbol in the string and see if there's a production that matches the current and next symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into steps where each step corresponds to a production rule.\n\nLet me try to parse the string:\n\nThe string is: t69, t65, t83, t54, t56, t35, t70, t79, t74, t12, t32, t9, t61, t14, t65, t15, t56, t8, t68, t42, t70, t12, t22, t60, t16, t10, t14, t71, t74, t22, t60, t32, t51\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. NT3 \u2192 t69 and NT77 \u2192 t32. So, in the string, the first two tokens should be t69 followed by t32. But the string starts with t69 followed by t65. That doesn't match. So, does this mean that the string can't be generated by this grammar? Because the first two symbols don't align with S's production.\n\nWait, that seems like a red flag. If S \u2192 NT3 NT77, then the string must start with the expansion of NT3 and NT77. Since NT3 expands to a sequence that includes t69, and NT77 to t77 (or other terms), but perhaps the first two symbols must be t69 and whatever NT77 expands to.\n\nBut in the given string, the first two are t69 and t65, which is not what S's first production would yield.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the first two non-terminals are NT3 and NT77. These, when expanded, produce sequences of terminals. So, the first two symbols in the string must match the concatenation of the expansion of NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, if S expands to NT3 and NT77, then the string starts with the expansion of NT3. The expansion of NT3 is... let's see: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 \u2192 't69'. NT58 \u2192 't54'. So, NT3 \u2192 t69 t54. Wait, no: NT3 is production NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 \u2192 't69', NT58 \u2192 't54'. So NT17 \u2192 t69 t54. Then, NT3 \u2192 t69 t54 and NT6 \u2192 't63'. So overall, NT3 expands to t69 t54 t63.\n\nWait, but that would mean the first three tokens of the string should be t69, t54, t63. But the string starts with t69, t65, t83... That's different. Moreover, if S's first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, then the first two symbols must be t69 and t77 (but according to the grammar, t77 is when NT77 is expanded, which is 't32').\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to clarify: in the grammar, NT77 \u2192 t32. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT77 would mean that the first symbols are the expansion of NT3, followed by the expansion of NT77.\n\nBut NT3's expansion starts with t69, and NT77's starts with t32. So the first two symbols are t69 and t32. But in the string, the first two symbols are t69 and t65. That's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the initial symbols don't align with the production rules of S.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the production can yield more than two symbols. For example, NT3 expands to a sequence, and NT77 expands to another, so the initial string could be longer than two symbols. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. So, NT3 expands to a sequence of symbols, each generated by applying productions until terminals are reached. So, the initial expansion of S would lead to a sequence starting with the expansion of NT3 followed by the expansion of NT77.\n\nWait, but in the string, the initial two symbols are t69 and t65.

So, in the given string, the first token is 't78', which corresponds to NT70. Then, the next token is 't61'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT61 is directly produced: NT61 \u2192 't61'. Then 't8' comes next. Let's check if there's a rule that directly produces 't8'. Yes, NT17 \u2192 't70'; but 't8' seems to be produced by NT8 \u2192 't8'.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the list I see NT8 \u2192 't8'\u2014yes, so NT8 produces 't8'. So 't8' is directly produced.\n\nNext, 't61' is directly produced by NT61. So far, it looks like we could have the following breakdown:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo 't78' is from NT77? Hmm, wait, no. Because NT77 can produce 't32' and others. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.\n\nWait, no, 't78' is produced by NT70: NT70 \u2192 't78'. So, to produce 't78' as the first token, the first production must involve NT70. So the string starts with NT70.\n\nBut S starts with NT3 and NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So NT3 produces 't17' (from NT3 \u2192 't17'). But in the string, the first token is 't78', which can't come from NT3 because NT3 \u2192 't17'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the breakdown.\n\nWait, no, the string is a series of tokens, which are the results of expanding non-terminals starting from S. So perhaps the first token comes from expanding S, and then so on.\n\nWait, let's think: in the grammar, S is the start symbol, and S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the expansion starts with NT3 and NT77, each producing something. If the string starts with 't78', that suggests that one of those non-terminals produces 't78' directly.\n\nLooking back: NT70 \u2192 't78', right? So 't78' comes from NT70. But S produces NT3 and NT77. So for the first token, it must be that either NT3 or NT77 expands to 't78' via some chain. But looking at NT3's rules, NT3 \u2192 't17' and so on. So how can NT3 produce 't78'? It doesn't. Similarly, NT77 can produce 't32' and when another non-terminal is expanded from it, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, each of which can then produce other non-terminals which can eventually produce the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, but according to the string, the first token is 't78', which is NT70's production. So perhaps the initial S expansion happens, and within that, one of the steps produces 't78' as the first token. Let me think.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\n   So the string starts with either the expansion of NT3 or NT77. Since the first token is 't78', which is produced by NT70, that suggests that in the process expanding NT3 or NT77, we must reach NT70.\n\nBut looking at NT3's rules, NT3 \u2192 't17' directly. It can't reach NT70 unless it expands further. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't70'. So if NT3 expands to NT17, which produces 't70'.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the given grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal symbol. That usually makes parsing easier, but here I need to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string in question is: `t68 t87 t65 t16 t54 t71 t75 t90 t32 t12 t17 t72 t35 t15 t27 t74 t9 t60 t7 t83 t22 t14 t54 t27 t83 t16 t46 t51 t68 t24 t13 t71 t79 t14`.\n\nOkay, the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is a terminal symbol, as there are no rules that expand them further except for the terminal tokens listed in the grammar. So, my job is to see if the sequence of these tokens can be produced by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first rule for S is S -> NT3 NT77. So, S starts by deriving two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. Each of these needs to be expanded further.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct how the string could be built. The first token is t68, which comes from NT77 -> t78. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT77 has a production NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Then, NT68 -> t78, and NT44 -> t68. So, NT68 can be terminal t78 or NT77, and NT44 can be t68 or other expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT65 -> NT77 NT2\n...\nWait, it's a bit confusing.

Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree for the given string, starting from the root S and seeing if it can derive the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, 35 tokens, it's going to take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be divided into segments that correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to start from the beginning. The string starts with t68. Let's see which NTs produce t68.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT49 -> t74\n- NT65 -> t88\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT98 -> t93\n- NT56 -> 't56' (Wait, NT67 -> t56)\nWait, no.

Let me check the rules again. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT44 -> NT22 NT18\n\nBut in the terminals, do any NT produce t68 directly? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT77's production includes t32 (from NT77 -> t32), and t78 (from NT68 -> t78), and so on. Wait, but earlier, I think NT68 is in the rule:\n\nLooking back, NT68's rule: NT68 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nWait, but in the terminal list, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> t63\n- NT79 -> t72\n- NT67 -> t56\n- NT54 -> t83\n- etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing.

Wait, no, NT6 is a non-terminal, looking for productions of NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for which NT nodes have a terminal as t68. Or is t68 a terminal?

So perhaps t68 is a non-terminal that must be expanded further.\n\nWait, but then if the string includes t68, that's a terminal, so it must be derived from a non-terminal with a production that includes t68. But if t68 is a terminal, it must appear in the grammar, right? So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.

The string is: `t18 t13 t90 t88 t65 t88 t18 t70 t10 t88 t69 t42 t87 t32 t54 t88 t10 t90 t44 t60 t63 t46 t50 t17 t87 t51 t68 t15 t46 t71 t54 t17 t13 t35`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each left-hand side (A) is a non-terminal and the right-hand side (B, C) are either terminals or non-terminals, with exactly two symbols. The goal is to see if we can derive the string step by step using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. \n\nNow, each production can be split into two parts, and we need to check if each part can generate the corresponding part of the string. \n\nLet me list out the string as a list of tokens: [t18, t13, t90, t88, t65, t88, t18, t70, t10, t88, t69, t42, t87, t32, t54, t88, t10, t90, t44, t60, t63, t46, t50, t17, t87, t51, t68, t15, t46, t71, t54, t17, t13, t35].\n\nSince S \u2192 NT3 NT77, both NT3 and NT77 need to derive their respective parts of the string. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, NT3: Looking at the productions for NT3, I see NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 can be replaced by NT17 and NT6. \n\nNT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT8. So NT3 becomes NT70 NT8 NT6.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t18. So let's see if any of the symbols can produce 't18'. Looking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT8, which then NT70 \u2192 t7 (from the '70' \u2192 t7 rule) and NT8 \u2192 t8 (from '8' \u2192 t8). So that would produce t7 t18, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. The string starts with t18, so perhaps NT70 is t70, which then produces t7, and NT8 is t8. But the beginning of the string is t18, not t7 or t8. Maybe I need to find a production that directly leads to a terminal. \n\nLooking at the NT17 rule, it doesn't produce a terminal directly. It's NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT8, which then may produce t7 and t8. But in the string, the first token is t18, so perhaps NT17 isn't the right way. Maybe another production for NT3.\n\nWait, can NT3 \u2192 't17' directly? Looking through the rules, I don't see that. It's always non-terminals. So perhaps the initial NT3 must generate t18. Maybe there's a chain of productions leading to a string of terminals. Alternatively, maybe I should look for any production that directly starts with the beginning tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT3 can produce 't18' through a chain of productions, but looking through the rules, I don't see a terminal as the leftmost symbol except in some cases like NT26 \u2192 t26, etc. Wait, let me check: NT26 \u2192 t26, but nowhere else. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's look at the string indices. The string is 31 tokens long. Each step in the derivation splits each non-terminal into two, so starting from S, we have two parts. Each part can split into two more each step. So the total depth is based on the number of tokens. For a string of length n, the depth is log2(n), but since the grammar is in CNF, each step can only split into two. Let me think about it more clearly.\n\nEach production is two symbols, so each step adds a split, so the number of leaves in the parse tree would correspond to the number of tokens. But since each non-terminal can be split into two, the total number of symbols at the end would be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. Wait, that might not be right because each non-terminal can be split multiple times. It might be more accurate to think of the derivation as a binary tree, with each step splitting a non-terminal into two parts. The total number of symbols would be twice the number of non-terminals in the derivation path. Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me try a different strategy. Let's try to map the string tokens to the possible derivations.\n\nThe first token is t18. Let me look at which non-terminals produce t18. From the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT8 \u2192 which would produce t7 and t8, but not t18.\n- NT18 \u2192 t8, not t18.\n- NT26 \u2192 t26, not t18.\n- NT46 \u2192 t46, not t18.\n- NT70 \u2192 t7, not t18.\n- NT21 \u2192 NT39 NT65 \u2192 which in the given rules seems not to produce a terminal in one step.\n- Others like NT65 \u2192 t46, etc., but not t18.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the productions in more detail.\n\nWait, there's NT36 \u2192 t50, but that's after a split. Maybe a deeper production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t18 is part of a terminal chain that starts from a non-terminal. For example, NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT8, then NT70 \u2192 t7, NT8 \u2192 t8, which gives t7 t8. But the string starts with t18, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the entire string. It starts with t18 t13... Let's see if any non-terminal can directly produce t18 or t13 through some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t8\n- NT70 \u2192 t7\n- NT13 \u2192 t13? Let me check: NT13 isn't defined in the grammar, so I think in the rules, NT13 is defined as t13. Wait, looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals are mapped directly to terminals, e.g., NT0 \u2192 t0, NT5 \u2192 t14, etc. Wait, I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules again, some non-terminals are mapped to terminals directly:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t8\n- NT5 \u2192 t14\n- NT7 \u2192 t7 (Wait, where is that? Looking back, I see NT65 \u2192 t7 or something else? Wait, let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t7 (Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT70 \u2192 t7, NT26 \u2192 t26, etc. Wait, no\u2014 looking at the given rules, in the list, the last lines include:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't8' (from '0 -> t8')\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n- NT67 -> 't56'\n- NT49 -> 't12'\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n- NT44 -> 't60'\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT15 -> 't73'\n- NT49 -> 't63'\n- NT33 -> 't10'\n- NT93 -> 't54'\n- NT26 -> 't29'\n- NT51 -> 't27'\n- NT93 -> 't27' again\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n- NT31 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't60'\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT79 -> 't69'\n- NT58 -> 't54'\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n- NT37 -> 't70'\n- NT59 -> 't17'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and I need to figure out whether each symbol can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It states that each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a single terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit because all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT3 NT77, and others like NT3 -> NT17 NT6, or terminals like 't87' in one of the productions.\n\nThe string given is: `t87 t90 t17 t35 t79 t61 t71 t83 t13 t17 t75 t30 t73 t79 t68 t18 t15 t14 t35 t30 t8 t65 t18 t12 t7 t8 t74 t27 t27 t27 t15 t69 t8 t7 t51`.\n\nI need to parse this string step by step to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can apply the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. The CYK algorithm works by determining which non-terminals can derive substrings of the input.\n\nBut before going into that, maybe I can try to match the string directly using the rules. Let's split the string into individual tokens: t87, t90, t17, t35, t79, t61, t71, t83, t13, t17, t75, t30, t73, t79, t68, t18, t15, t14, t35, t30, t8, t65, t18, t12, t7, t8, t74, t27, t27, t27, t15, t69, t8, t7, t51.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals, and others are non-terminals. The goal is to see if a derivation starting from S can produce this sequence of terminals.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The CYK algorithm builds a table where each cell [i,j] represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nLet me attempt to construct this table step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll number the tokens from 0 to n-1, where n is the length. The string has 34 tokens, so n=34.\n\nInitialize a table with 34 rows and 34 columns. Each cell [i][j] will hold a set of non-terminals that can produce the substring from i to j.\n\nFor i=0 to 33 (since it's 0-indexed in the table), set [i][i] to the non-terminals that produce the i-th token.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for each terminal token, the non-terminal rule producing it will be in [i][i].\n\nFor example, if the token is 't87', then it must match a production like NT22 -> t87?

Oh, I see NT22 -> t71 in the rule NT22 -> t71? No, actually, looking at the last lines:\n\nWait, the last line is: NT83 -> t51 and others, but let me double-check:\n\nLooking for 't71' in the productions, I see:\n\nYes, I see NT22 -> t71.\n\nWait, no, wait, looking at the grammar rules, the lines are:\n\nNT71 -> 't70' Wait, no: Looking through, I see NT71 -> 't70' as a production?\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit long, so perhaps I should make a list of all the productions for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that each terminal has exactly one production. So, for each 't' symbol in the string, we can find which non-terminal produces it.\n\nSo, let's list all the terminals in the string and map them to their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is on the right-hand side of exactly one production.

{"custom_id":"request-665","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which are likely representing non-terminals that have been expanded into terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. It's a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. But in this case, the grammar seems to have some special rules where some non-terminals are assigned to specific terminals, like 't...'. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17' and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t79 t16 t51 t9 t15 t46 t35 t24 t16 t35 t63 t72 t71 t12 t63 t51 t68 t79 t50 t74 t75 t51 t18 t17 t24 t10 t15 t35 t56 t61 t56 t54 t17 t9 t9`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parsing process would involve a series of productions expanding the start symbol S into a sequence of non-terminals until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have direct productions to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT67 \u2192 't56', etc. So, the string must be built by expanding the start symbol using the productions and ultimately getting all terminals.\n\nTo verify this, I can think about the parse steps:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: everything before NT77 and everything else.\n\n2. So the first two tokens should correspond to NT3 and NT77. Wait, but the string starts with 't79' which is a terminal, not NT3 or NT77. Hmm, this might mean that NT3 and NT77 must have direct productions to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3 and NT77, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT77 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, NT77 is a non-terminal, and in the grammar, I don't see it having a direct production. Instead, it's referenced in other productions, like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so NT77 must be further expanded. Let's see what NT77 can produce. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several rules like NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So, NT77 expands into NT68 and NT44. Therefore, the string after t79 would need to expand into NT77, which further becomes NT68 and NT44.\n\nBut the string starts with t79. Wait, that's conflicting because NT3 \u2192 't17', but the string starts with 't79', which may mean that either I'm misunderstanding the structure or the string is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me re-examine.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, S is expanded into NT3 and NT77.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't79'. So, 't79' must come from either NT3 or NT77, or more likely, the expansion of NT3 or NT77 must produce a sequence that starts with 't79'.\n\nBut NT3 \u2192 't17', so that's 17, not 79. Similarly, looking at NT77, is there a production that starts with 't79'? Looking through the list:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't75' and 't79'?\nWait, let's check NT77's productions. I don't see NT77 being a terminal, but let's check if any of the rules derive to 't79' directly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't79'\n- NT85 \u2192 't75' (twice)\n- NT58 \u2192 't54' and 't85'\n- Wait, looking for 't79', I see NT75 \u2192 't79' and also NT85 \u2192 't16' and 't75'.\n\nSo 't79' is only produced by NT75.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, one of the non-terminals in the expansion path must produce 't79'. Let's trace the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't79', which must be the result of some NT in the grammar that directly produces 't79'. So, looking back, NT75 directly produces 't79'.\n\nNow, if S \u2192 NT3 NT77, then NT3 produces 't17' and NT77 must produce something that starts with a part of the string. But wait, the string starts with 't79', so that suggests that either NT3 or NT77 must produce a sequence that starts with 't79'.\n\nBut NT3 \u2192 't17', so it can't be that. Therefore, NT77 must be the one producing 't79' as part of a chain.\n\nWait, but how? Because NT77 is followed by other non-terminals. So, in S \u2192 NT3 NT77, after NT3 is 't17', then NT77 must expand into something that starts with 't79' followed by the rest.\n\nBut let me look at how the string continues after 't79':\n\nt79 t16 t51 t9 t15 t46 t35 t24 t16 t35 t63 t72 t71 t12 t63 t51 t68 t79 t50 t74 t75 t51 t18 t17 t24 t10 t15 t35 t56 t61 t56 t54 t17 t9 t9.\n\nThe first token is 't79' which, as mentioned, comes from NT75. So looking at the grammar, NT77 is a parent of NT75. Wait, no: looking back, I see that NT77 is expanded into NT68 and NT44 (from the list: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44). Then, NT68 is expanded into NT36 and NT33 (NT68 \u2192 NT36 NT33), and NT36 can be broken down further.\n\nLooking at NT36's productions: It can expand into NT17 NT79 or NT70 NT33.\n\nIf NT36 expands into NT17 NT79, then the string after t79 could be 't17 t79', but the next token after t79 is t16, which is different. Alternatively, if it expands into NT70 NT33, then we have 't' followed by 't79'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the string starts with 't17' (from NT3) and '...'. But the string starts with 't79', which is 't79' from NT75. So perhaps NT77 is the one that needs to expand into 't79'.\n\nWait, but S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the start is NT3 (which is 't17') followed by NT77. Therefore, the string should start with 't17', but it starts with 't79'. This suggests that something is wrong unless maybe I got the order wrong.\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string should start with NT3 (which is 't17') followed by NT77. But the string starts with 't79', which isn't 't17'. Therefore, unless I'm missing something, this would imply that the string isn't generated by the grammar because the first symbol doesn't match.\n\nBut that can't be right because 't79' could be part of a longer expansion. So perhaps the start symbol S is expanded into NT3 followed by NT77, and NT77 eventually produces the rest of the string, including 't79'. Therefore, the first part after 't17' would come from NT77.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after 't79', it goes into more tokens. So perhaps the initial production is correct: S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which would yield 't17' followed by the expansion of NT77. But the string starts with 't79', which isn't 't17'. Therefore, unless there's a mistake, the string can't be generated because the first symbol doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing is done in reverse, but I don't think CFGs are"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-678","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces. I remember that CNF grammars have productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I think I should parse the string and list out the tokens to better understand what needs to be checked. The string is `t9 t70 t18 t51 t18 t61 t70 t44 t8 t17 t14 t83 t79 t7 t27 t7 t8 t22 t78 t10 t12 t54 t8 t42 t27 t10 t12 t35 t9 t79 t32 t16 t71 t42 t9 t16`.\n\nEach token after t is either a terminal or a non-terminal, based on the grammar. Looking at the grammar rules, for example, S -> NT3 NT77, which are two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions. So the parsing process would involve building a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and reducing it to the given string.\n\nI think I'll start by examining the top-level structure. The start symbol S produces NT3 and NT77. So the first step would be to have two branches: one starting with NT3 and the other starting with NT77. \n\nEach of these NT production rules is a combination of non-terminals, so I need to expand them step by step. For example, NT3 is defined as NT17 and NT6. NT17 is NT8 and NT58, and NT58 is NT5 and NT85. NT5 is a terminal 't14' and NT85 is NT23 and NT16, and so on.\n\nI think the best approach here is recursive descent parsing. I'll start with the S symbol and see if I can match the entire string from the root. Each time I reduce a non-terminal, the remaining string should match the next part.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n1. Start with S, which produces NT3 NT77. So the string should split into two parts corresponding to NT3 and NT77.\n\n2. For the first part, NT3 is NT17 NT6. So now, check the string starting at t9 until the end for NT17 NT6.\n\n3. NT17 is NT8 NT58. So now, split into NT8 and NT58.\n\n4. NT8 is a terminal 't8', so that consumes the 't8' in the string.\n\n5. NT58 is NT5 NT85. Check the next part of the string after 't8'.\n\n6. NT5 is 't14', which matches the next token.\n\n7. NT85 is NT23 NT16. Now, check the next tokens after 't14'.\n\n... And I'll continue this way until I either consume the entire string or get stuck.\n\nWait, but doing this manually for such a long string is going to be time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern or a better way to approach this.\n\nI notice that certain terminals appear multiple times. For instance, 't77' appears a few times. Looking back at the grammar, I see that NT77 is defined as NT68 NT44. So if I see 't77' in the string, it should come from NT77.\n\nSimilarly, NT78 is defined as NT77 NT68, and if 't78' is present, it comes from NT78. Wait, but in the grammar, I don't see NT78 directly, but it's part of another production, perhaps via another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for sequences of terminals and see if they correspond to the productions in reverse.\n\nStarting from the top, the entire string starts with 't9', which is 't9' in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT93 is 't9' and NT75 is 't75', and NT18 is 't18', etc. Hmm, not sure.\n\nMaybe it's better to break down the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nThe first token is 't9', which could be either NT93 or NT75 since both produce 't9'. Let me check the grammar definitions: NT93 is defined as NT44 NT14, and NT75 is NT74 NT21, right?\n\nWait, NT93 in the grammar is defined as NT93 -> NT44 NT14 (I think I saw that earlier; the user provided some rules, but I need to check if I have all of them correctly).\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar list is extensive. Let me try to reconstruct the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT93 -> NT17 NT54 (maybe not, let me check the provided list). Let me scan through the production rules:\n\nLooking at the production rules, the relevant ones for 't9' would be NT93 -> t44 t14? No, wait, perhaps NT93 is defined as NT44 NT14, which produces 't44' and 't14' as terminals. So if I see 't44 t14', that would come from NT93.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't9', which isn't directly a production, but let me check the possible productions that result in 't9' as the first terminal.\n\nLooking again, NT93 is defined as NT44 NT14, which produces 't44 t14' as terminal sequence. So 't9' by itself isn't a direct production, so that's not possible. Similarly, NT75 might produce 't74 t21', which would be 't74 t21', which isn't just 't75 t...' Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't9' is derived from some other path. Let me think about possible trees.\n\nWait, another approach: let's attempt to parse the string from left to right.\n\nStart with S -> NT3 NT77. So, S leads to two production rules: NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, the string should have a part that comes from NT3 and another from NT77.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with something that could come from NT3.\n\nNT3 is defined as NT17 NT6.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should start with NT17 NT6.\n\nLooking at the string tokens starting from the first token:\n\nThe first token is 't9'. So, how can 't9' be part of NT17 NT6? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 is NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 is 't8', and NT58 is NT5 NT85.\n\nNT5 is 't14', and NT85 is NT23 NT16.\n\nNT23 is 't23', and NT16 is 't18'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT16 -> NT95 NT18, which is 't95 t18', but in the string, we have 't18' as a separate token.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll outline the steps for each production.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the string must start with NT3 and end with NT77, with all tokens in between matching the expansion of NT3 followed by NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo, NT17 and NT6 must be expanded, and their expansions must concatenate to form the initial part of the string.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nSo starting from S, the first symbol is NT3 which becomes NT17 NT6, and then NT17 becomes NT8 NT58, then NT58 becomes NT5 NT85.\n\nWait, maybe we can track the symbols as a stack.\n\nWait, the parsing using recursive descent is tricky without writing out the code, but since this is a thought process, let's attempt it.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t9 t70 t18 t51 t18 t61 t70 t44 t8 t17 t14 t83 t79 t7 t27 t7 t8 t22 t78 t10 t12 t54 t8 t42 t27 t10 t12 t35 t9 t79 t32 t16 t71 t42 t9 t16.\n\nI'll start with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the next step is to parse the first part as NT3 and then the second part as NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo, after NT3, the next symbol is NT17, then NT6.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst token is 't9'.

{"custom_id":"request-679","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing easier. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols representing the actual tokens generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. A grammar is in CNF if each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol cannot be a non-terminal that can lead to terminals through these rules. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all productions are either from a non-terminal to two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT3 NT37) or from a non-terminal to a single terminal symbol. This checks out with CNF, so that's good.\n\nNext, I'll look at the string: `t27 t16 t18 t73 t46 t22 t83 t9 t44 t16 t30 t88 t60 t18 t30 t12 t51 t50 t65 t68 t78 t12 t79 t87 t7 t10 t44 t35 t72 t65 t10 t27 t73 t42 t75 t50`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. Since the string has 31 't's, each being a terminal, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string step by step through its productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar has 89 production rules, it's quite large, so doing this manually would be time-consuming. Instead, let's break down the approach I can take:\n\n1. **Identify the start symbol**: The start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first two elements of the derivation must be NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t27. So, NT3 must derive to t27. Let's check what NT3 does.\n\n2. **NT3 production**: The given grammar shows NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, NT3 must derive to NT17 followed by NT6. Since NT3 is being used as the first part of the start symbol, we can see if the string can be split into the two parts: t27 and t18.\n\nWait, no. NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So when we break down S, the first two NTs are NT3 and NT77. The first part of the string would be the derivation of NT3, which is NT17 followed by NT6. So the string starts with t27, which would correspond to NT17 \u2192 t27 or NT17 \u2192 something that derives to t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see what NT17 produces. From the rules, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. Now, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. Wait, that's a two-step process. Let me check further:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65 (from NT30: but wait, in the grammar, NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65? Wait no, looking back, the grammar has NT30 \u2192 other rules. Wait, actually, let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT30 \u2192 NT65 NT76 is not present. Let me search for NT30. Wait, according to the grammar provided, here's what I find:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65 is not a production. Wait, let's parse the grammar correctly. Let me list all the rules for NTs and terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\nNT30 \u2192 NT65 NT76 (Wait, not in the list). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT30, is there a rule? Looking through the list, I don't see NT30 having a production. Wait, this could be a mistake because if NT30 is a non-terminal, it must have a production. Let me check:\n\nYes, in the given grammar, under NT95: NT95 \u2192 't61', but that's a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me list all NTs and check their rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go step by step, but since I'm short on time, maybe a better approach is to check if the entire string can be matched by the start symbol S, considering the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a recursive descent approach or CYK algorithm, but given the time, perhaps a faster way is to see if the first part of the string can be derived by NT3.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, NT17 must derive to t27, and NT6 must derive to t18.\n\nWait, NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So, to get t27 from NT17, NT8 must derive to t27 or something else. Wait, no, because NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, so each part becomes a separate unit. So both NT8 and NT58 must derive to terminal strings.\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. So NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. Then, NT30 must derive to some string that ends up being t27, and NT50 must derive to t18.\n\nLooking at NT30: Is there a production for NT30? Let me scan through the list. I see NT30: let me check. In the grammar, under NT30, I don't see any production. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT30 is not listed. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each production carefully.\n\nLooking again, under NT30, I don't see a production. Wait, no, each line starts with NT, except the terminal productions. So, for NTs, we only see NT followed by other NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some NT rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50.\n\nWait, but then NT30 must have a production. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT30: no, NT30 isn't a non-terminal; actually, NT30 refers to NT0, I think. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list, under NT30, I see that NT30 isn't listed. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Looking at each line:\n\n1. S -> NT3 NT37\n...\n3. NT20 -> NT44 NT36\n...\nLooking for NT30: It's not directly listed as a production. Wait, but let's look through all lines more carefully.\n\nFor NT30: Looking in the list, I don't see NT30 being defined. So perhaps the production rules for NT30 are elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking through the list again:\n\n- NT44: multiple rules\n- NT18: NT68 NT82, etc.\n- NT36: rules\n- NT30: the first occurrence is under NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65 (line 82: \"NT30 -> NT49 NT65\"), yes! So NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65.\n\nSo NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65.\n\nNow, NT49: looking at the rules, under NT49: line 65 says NT49 \u2192 't74'.\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, under NT49:\n\nIn the provided grammar, when I look, I see:\n\n\"NT49 -> NT74\", wait no, checking the list:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLine 18: NT51 \u2192 't27'\n\nLine 49: NT49 \u2192 't14'? Wait:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n\"NT49 -> t74\", is that present? Yes, I see \"NT49 -> t74\" on line 49.\n\nWait, no, looking at the list as provided:\n\nLine 49: \"NT49 -> t74\"\n\nYes, so NT49 \u2192 t74, which is a terminal.\n\nAnd NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65.\n\nSo, NT30 becomes t74 followed by NT65.\n\nWait, but NT30 is being used in NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which is part of the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT37.\n\nSo NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nTo get t27 from NT3, we need:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nThen, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nSo, NT8: NT30 and NT50.\n\nNT30"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-698","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is either a number or a 't' followed by a number. From the structure of the grammar, I see that most non-terminals (like S, NT20, NT68, etc.) eventually produce these 't' followed by numbers, which I assume correspond to terminal symbols in the language.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the productions, for example, S -> NT3 NT77, which means S can only derive sequences that start with what NT3 produces and then what NT77 produces. Similarly, NT3 -> NT17 NT6, so NT3 will eventually produce sequences leading to t17 and t6.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t75 t8 t56 t7 t68 t54 t83 t60 t17 t73 t50 t7 t30 t13 t71 t14 t65 t74 t30 t69 t35 t56 t7 t24 t75 t61 t61 t13 t50 t29 t60 t9 t12 t87 t15 t16 t65.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, which suggests that the grammar is designed such that each non-terminal eventually expands into one of these terminals. My task is to check if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if I can find a derivation path that starts from S and through a series of productions, reaches exactly this string. Given the length of the string, which has 36 tokens, it's important to note that in a CFG in CNF, the number of steps in the derivation is related to the number of symbols times 2^n, where n is the number of non-terminals, but without specific details, it's more practical to use the CYK algorithm or a similar parsing method.\n\nAlternatively, since each step in CNF either splits or ends leaves, I can think of the string as a parse tree where each non-terminal can split into two others, ultimately leading to terminals. So, for a string of length m, the parse tree will have (m-1) internal nodes, each corresponding to a split.\n\nI can start by looking for the top-level non-terminal, which is S. From the grammar, S -> NT3 NT77. So, the string must be generated by first splitting into two parts: one generated from NT3 and another from NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, if I split it into two parts, say, the first k tokens and the remaining (36 - k) tokens, each part must be a valid derivation from NT3 and NT77, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> NT17 NT6, so the first part after S splits into NT3 and NT77, so NT3 must derive a sequence, and NT77 must derive another sequence.\n\nBut without knowing exactly how to split, perhaps it's better to think about the entire string as a combination of the right expansion paths. Since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol after S must correspond to a production that follows two non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps the better approach is to see if the string matches the grammar's derivations by checking each production step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the string recursively, matching the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the structure:\n\nThe string is 't75 t8 t56 t7 t68 t54 t83 t60 t17 t73 t50 t7 t30 t13 t71 t14 t65 t74 t30 t69 t35 t56 t7 t24 t75 t61 t61 t13 t50 t29 t60 t9 t12 t87 t15 t16 t65'\n\nI can look for tokens that are terminals which correspond directly to the grammar's rules. For example, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> NT5 NT85, and NT85 can produce t17 or t24, or other terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all the non-terminals and their possible terminal expansions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, most non-terminals eventually produce a \"tX\" where X is a number. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> NT17 NT6, so eventually, NT3 will expand to t17 and t6 through intermediate steps.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 -> t35, NT18 -> t8, etc.\n\nPerhaps a more efficient method is to see if each token in the string can be matched by the rightmost derivations of the grammar.\n\nWait, but since it's CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so the entire string must be a combination where each non-terminal produces a sequence of terminals through their own productions.\n\nAn alternative approach is to count the number of tokens each non-terminal can represent. For example, each non-terminal in CNF can produce a string of length equal to the number of terminal symbols it can reach through its productions. If the given string's length fits into the possible derivations from S, then it's possible.\n\nWait, let's consider the structure:\n\nEach rule in CNF either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the length of the derived string must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. For the start symbol S, each expansion from S adds one to the length. Wait, no, each rule either adds one terminal or two non-terminals. So for a string of length m, the parse tree must have (m) leaves and (m-1) internal nodes, each corresponding to a split.\n\nBut given the structure, the only way to have a string longer than one is through the splitting of non-terminals. So, for a string of length 36, starting from S, each split could potentially increase the number of tokens.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe I can model the grammar's terminal symbols and see if all tokens in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking through the string, I see 't75', 't8', 't56', 't7', etc. I can check whether each of these corresponds to any of the productions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't75': Looking at the grammar, NT74 -> t75, as I see NT74 -> t75 (from the rules given). So 't75' can come from NT74.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT74 has multiple productions, such as NT74 -> NT75 NT77, and also NT74 -> t75. So, 't75' can be derived directly from NT74.\n\nSimilarly, 't8' is derived from NT18, as NT18 -> t8 is one of the rules.\n\nSo each token in the string must be directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking back at the string: 't75 t8 t56 t7 t68...'\n\nSo, each of these 't' 'x' is a terminal that must have a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that each terminal 'tx' is defined as being produced directly by a non-terminal. For example:\n\n- 't75' \u2194 NT74\n- 't8' \u2194 NT18\n- 't56' \u2194 NT65\n- 't17' \u2194 NT3\n- 't24' \u2194 NT58\n- 't9' \u2194 NT65\n- 't12' \u2194 NT69\n- 't87' \u2194 NT22\n- 't15' \u2194 NT51\n- 't16' \u2194 NT71\n- 't65' \u2194 NT67\n- 't69' \u2194 NT77\n- 't61' \u2194 NT25 (from NT25 -> t61)\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT25 has a production NT25 -> t61.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-706","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to be either a 't' followed by a number or just a number. From the grammar, I see that some of these tokens are terminals (like 't88', 't65') and others are non-terminals (like S, NT3, NT77, etc.). \n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string into its components. The string is: `t88 t68 t15 t30 t17 t63 t50 t44 t65 t14 t79 t10 t56 t69 t10 t12 t24 t56 t83 t78 t83 t8 t56 t69 t73 t17 t46 t63 t44 t78 t12 t10 t54 t90 t9 t35 t73`. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT77. So the first step is to expand S into NT3 and NT77. Each of these non-terminals then expand into two other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFor example, the first symbol in the string is 't88'. Looking at the grammar, 't88' is associated with NT49 -> t74 t9. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: The grammar entries start with NT20, NT68, etc., and each has productions into two non-terminals. The terminals are those with 't' followed by a number, like t88, t68.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed that. The start symbol S is NT3 NT77, right? So from S, we get NT3 and NT77. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet's look at NT3. The productions for NT3 are: NT3 -> NT17 NT6 or NT3 -> t17. So if NT3 can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the string, the first token is t88, which isn't directly produced by NT3 directly unless maybe it's produced via other steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t88 t68 t15 t30 t17 t63 t50 t44 t65 t14 t79 t10 t56 t69 t10 t12 t24 t56 t83 t78 t83 t8 t56 t69 t73 t17 t46 t63 t44 t78 t12 t10 t54 t90 t9 t35 t73.\n\nWait, that's 37 tokens. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so the parse tree depth should be manageable. Each step in the string corresponds to a production.\n\nBut this is complicated; maybe I can try to split the string into substrings that match the possible sequences from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree for the given string. Let me start from the start symbol S, which produces NT3 NT77. So the left part is NT3, and the right part is NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, after S, the first symbol is t88, but NT3 can't directly produce t88, because NT3 is either NT17 NT6 or t17. Hmm, t17 is a terminal, so NT3 can produce t17. So perhaps the first part of the string, t88, is produced by a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is just a linear sequence of productions, not necessarily starting with S. But that seems not right because S is the start symbol.\n\nLet me try another approach: The string starts with t88. Let's see which NT produces t88. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see NT88, but I do see that NT54 -> t9, and NT93 -> t54, etc. Wait, perhaps t88 is a direct production. Looking back: Wait, in the grammar, NT22 -> NT31 NT5, NT31 -> NT14 NT65, and NT65 has several productions, one of which is t88. Yes! NT65 -> t88. So NT65 can produce t88 directly because one of the productions is NT65 -> t88 NT26. So t88 is from NT65.\n\nWait, but how does S get to produce something that eventually produces t88. So starting from S, which is NT3 NT77. The first production is S -> NT3 NT77. So the first symbol in the string should come from either NT3 or NT77. But the first token is t88, which is from NT65. That suggests that maybe the initial S production isn't the first step here, or perhaps I've misunderstood how the string is generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not directly derived from S, but perhaps it's a substring or part of a larger derivation. That doesn't make sense because S is the start symbol. So maybe the initial part of the string doesn't come directly from S but from a derivation path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, so the derivation begins with S.\n\n2. S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the first step is to derive something from NT3 and NT77. Suppose NT3 can produce a terminal or non-terminals, as can NT77.\n\nSo let's see, the first token is t88. How can t88 be produced? From NT65, which is part of the grammar. But NT65 is only derived from certain other non-terminals. Let's see, looking at the grammar, NT65 has productions:\n\nNT65 -> NT77 NT2 (from NT82?)\n\nWait, no. Let me check the grammar entries:\n\nLooking for NT65: \n\n- NT65 -> NT98 NT26\n- NT65 -> NT82 NT44\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar provided, I see multiple entries for NT65, like:\n\nNT65 -> NT98 NT26\n\nAnd NT54 -> NT82 NT98\n\nWait, but looking specifically:\n\nWait, I'm looking at the grammar entries, and I see NT65 has a production to t88:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT65 -> t88 is one of its productions. So NT65 can directly produce t88.\n\nSo for the string to start with t88, that would require that at some point in the derivation, NT65 produces t88. So perhaps in the string, t88 is from NT65, which in turn must be derived from its parents.\n\nSo looking at the grammar, NT65 can come from NT77 and NT26, or NT82 and NT44. So if we can show that NT65 is produced in the derivation, then t88 is generated.\n\nBut how does S reach NT65? S is NT3 and NT77. So the first symbol, t88, must be part of the expansion of either NT3 or NT77.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's try to see which NTs can produce t88. Looking through the grammar, the only NT that can produce t88 directly is NT65. So to get t88 in the string, we must have derived NT65 somewhere in the derivation.\n\nBut S is NT3 NT77. So to get NT65, it must be derived from either NT3 or NT77. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT3 -> NT17 NT6 or t17.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions: NT77 has several, like NT68 NT44, which is relevant because t88 is in the string.\n\nWait, NT77's productions include NT68 and NT44. So if NT77 is derived as NT68 NT44, then NT68 can be further split, and so on.\n\nWait, let me map the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t88. So how does t88 come into play? It must come from NT65. So to get t88, we must have derived it from NT65, which requires NT65 to be present earlier in the derivation.\n\nBut in S, which is NT3 and NT77, so how do we reach NT65? It depends on the way the derivation proceeds. Maybe NT77 can produce something that leads to NT65.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions, one of them is NT68 NT44. So if NT77 is expanded into NT68 and NT44, we"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-718","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has production rules for non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t followed by a number), and the string to check is a sequence of terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, all productions are of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. The start symbol is 'S', so every derivation starts with 'S'. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived from 'S' using these productions.\n\nThe string provided is: t16 t51 t17 t54 t29 t51 t18 t74 t83 t87 t75 t63 t90 t51 t14 t30 t72 t10 t74 t65 t16 t32 t12 t83 t68 t54 t83 t78 t9 t16 t69 t87 t30 t46 t35 t35 t29 t14.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules. Since CNF productions have only two non-terminals on the right, each step of the derivation would involve two symbols, but the string is a sequence of terminals. Wait, that's a bit confusing because in CNF, the right-hand side can only have terminals or non-terminals, not a mix. Oh, wait, no\u2014since it's in CNF, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, when generating the string, each production step will produce a terminal followed by another, so the string is built up as a series of terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is a concatenation of terminals, each corresponding to a production step. So each production in the derivation will produce a terminal, and non-terminals might produce other non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree where each non-terminal is expanded into terminals, and I need to check if the string matches the leaves of the parse tree in order.\n\nI think a better approach is to use the grammar's productions to see if the string can be broken down correctly. Starting from the string, perhaps I can backtrack using the productions to see if it can derive down to S.\n\nLet me list all the productions that produce a terminal:\n\nNT3 -> t17\n\nNT18 -> t8\n\nNT20 -> t65\n\nNT25 -> t31 NT5 (but that's a mix of terminal and non-terminal? Wait, that can't be right because CNF requires each production to be either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT25 -> NT31 NT5 \u2014 that's two non-terminals, so their product would produce two terminals if NT31 and NT5 are terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT25 -> NT31 NT5 would produce two tokens (if NT31 and NT5 are terminals). So, the string being a series of terminals, each production in the derivation will produce a pair of terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it's a single stream of terminals, so to parse it, I can try from the start and see if each production can generate the needed terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down parsing approach, using the grammar, would be suitable. Since the string is t16 t51 t17 t54... etc., I can start with the starting symbol S and see if it can produce this string.\n\nWait, S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the first two symbols must correspond to the expansion of NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the first token is t16. So, does NT3 produce t16? Let's check the rules.\n\nFrom the NT3 productions: NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So that's two non-terminals. So the production leads to two terminals (if NT17 and NT6 are terminals).\n\nLooking at the terminals: for NT17 -> 't70', and NT6 -> 't63'. So NT3 -> t70 t63 as two tokens. But the string starts with t16, which is not the same as t70 or t63.\n\nHmm, that suggests a problem because the initial production from S gives two non-terminals, which would generate two tokens, but the string starts with t16, which isn't covered by either of the non-terminals from NT3 or NT77.\n\nWait, what are the productions for NT77? Let me check:\n\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nAnd NT68 -> NT49 NT25.\n\nNT49 -> 't74' (since it's listed as NT49 -> t74).\n\nNT25 -> NT31 NT5.\n\nLooking at NT31: I don't immediately see a rule; maybe it's a terminal. Let me check: no, NT31 isn't listed as a terminal, but it's part of a production that's two non-terminals. Wait, let me check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the only terminals I see are:\n\nt16, t51, t17, t54, t29, t51, t18, t74, t83, t87, t75, t63, t90, t51, t14, t30, t72, t10, t74, t65, t16, t32, t12, t83, t68, t54, t83, t78, t9, t16, t69, t87, t30, t46, t35, t35, t29, t14.\n\nSo for NT25, I think it's part of a production NT25 -> NT31 NT5. So to expand NT25, we need to produce two non-terminals, which in turn would expand into more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step from left to right, using the grammar to see if it can be generated.\n\nLet me write down the string again:\n\nt16 t51 t17 t54 t29 t51 t18 t74 t83 t87 t75 t63 t90 t51 t14 t30 t72 t10 t74 t65 t16 t32 t12 t83 t68 t54 t83 t78 t9 t16 t69 t87 t30 t46 t35 t35 t29 t14.\n\nStarting with 'S' which leads to NT3 and NT77. Let's look at the string and see if the first symbols after S can match.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. The first expansion would produce two symbols. But looking at the string, the first symbol is t16.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. But these would expand into two tokens. NT17 is 't70' and NT6 is 't63'. So NT3's expansion would be t70 t63, but the string starts with t16, not either of those.\n\nWait, that's a problem because S's first expansion produces t70 and t63 as the first two symbols, but the string starts with t16. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it doesn't align with the initial expansion.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Maybe the first step isn't expanding NT3, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into multiple production steps. Let's consider that S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then each of NT3 and NT77 will produce their own sequences.\n\nWait, but S produces NT3 and NT77, which are two symbols, so each of these must be expanded into tokens. So the first two tokens in the generated string would be the expansions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t16. How do we get t16?\n\nLooking through the grammar, which non-terminals produce t16? Let's check:\n\nLooking for where t16 is a terminal: NT16 is 't95', NT22 is 't71', NT17 is 't70', NT74 is 't74', etc.\n\nWait, actually in the non-terminals, many NT rules produce terminals. For example, NT16 -> t95 and t18. Wait, no, NT16 is 't95', 't18'. So NT16 can produce t95 or t18 as a single terminal.\n\nBut in our case, S starts with NT3 and NT77.

{"custom_id":"request-721","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar using Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it mostly follows CNF. I see productions like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which fits A \u2192 BC. Other productions like NT3 \u2192 't17' are terminals, which is A \u2192 a. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t18 t13 t71 t73 t65 t30 t75 t61 t15 t10 t78 t87 t44 t60 t14 t83 t50 t29 t24 t70 t68 t88 t30 t46 t74 t87 t50 t18 t46 t63 t70 t61 t46 t73 t9 t50 t27 t71`.\n\nI notice that each terminal is followed by a space, so the string is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the length of the string increases exponentially with each step. But since we have a specific string, maybe it's shorter, so perhaps 10 steps or so would be sufficient. But the given string has 43 tokens, which is quite long. However, in CNF, the maximum possible length after n steps is 2^n, but it can vary depending on the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal might make the string correspond to a leftmost or rightmost derivation. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals map directly to terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't17', so those are simple. Others, like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which could lead to 't17' followed by whatever NT77 produces.\n\nBut I need a systematic way to check. Maybe I can look for how the terminals appear in the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start from S and see what rules it can take. The start symbol S maps to NT3 and NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. \n\nThe goal is to parse the given string using the grammar. I can consider the string as a sequence of terminals and try to match it by starting from S and expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut doing this manually for a string of 43 terms seems tedious. Perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a mapping of non-terminals that map to specific terminals. For example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\nNT54 \u2192 't83'\nNT67 \u2192 't56'\nNT49 \u2192 't8'\nNT74 \u2192 't75'\nNT85 \u2192 't32'\nNT77 \u2192 't32'\nNT18 \u2192 't8'\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\nNT74 \u2192 't60'\nNT79 \u2192 't72'\nNT44 \u2192 't68'\nNT98 \u2192 't93' (wait, no, NT98 is 't93'? Wait, looking back: NT98 \u2192 't93'? Or is it another terminal? Looking at the grammar, NT98 \u2192 't93' seems incorrect because NT98 probably maps to a terminal. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 't8', NT98 \u2192 't93', which suggests NT98 generates the string 't93'\u2014so 't93' is a terminal, which is part of the string? Wait, but the given string has 't93' at the end.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I see 't9' (last part: ...t61 t46 t73 t9 t50...). So 't9' is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT65 \u2192 't46'; NT58 \u2192 't5' followed by NT5? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, the grammar includes several rules where non-terminals map to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT18 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't83'\n- NT98 \u2192 't93'\n- NT58 \u2192 't5' (oh wait, NT58 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking further, NT58 \u2192 't9'? Wait, no\u2014let me check.\n\nThe grammar entries:\n\n... \nNT58 -> 't5'... Wait, looking for where NT58 is:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n\"NT58 -> 't54'\"? No, checking each line:\n\nLooking at:\n\"NT58 -> 't9'... Let's see:\n\nI see a line:\nNT58 -> 't9'\n\nWait, no: looking through:\n\nYes, here's one line: NT58 -> 't9'\n\nAnd another line: NT26 -> 't69'\n\nSo NT58 can produce a terminal 't9' or others\u2014no, looking further:\n\nWait, the grammar has a line: NT58 -> 't9' and possibly others?\n\nLooking here: \"NT58 -> 't9'\"\u2014so NT58 can become 't9'. Similarly, NT26 -> 't69'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, there's a 't9' which is the 32nd token. I need to see if that can come from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, first, I'll try to break down the string step by step.\n\nStart from the left: the first term is 't18'. In the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't8' but there's also NT74 \u2192 't60'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I don't see NT18 \u2192 't8'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through, yes: \"NT18 -> 't8'\". So that would mean NT18 can be 't8'. But the string starts with 't18', so how do we get 't18'? That suggests that there might be a mistake because NT18 cannot produce 't18'. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar directions.\n\nWait, NT18 is one of the non-terminals, and from the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't8', which is a terminal. So the string starts with 't18', which would suggest that NT18 should produce 't18', but according to the grammar, it produces 't8'. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, that can't be. Did I copy the grammar correctly? Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nThe grammar includes:\n\nNT18 -> 't8'\n\nYes, so NT18 can generate the terminal 't8', which is not 't18'. So in the string, the first token is 't18', which would require that NT18 can go to 't18', but according to the grammar, it's 't8', which is different.\n\nThat suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first 't18' is not generated by any NT that maps directly to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another NT that produces 't18'\u2014looking through the rules, let's check:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\n\nNT98 \u2192 t93\n\nNT53 \u2192 t83? Wait, perhaps I need to see all the terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't83'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't75'\n\nNT85 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each rule to map non-terminals to terminals.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n1. S -> NT3 NT77\n2. NT20 -> NT44 NT36\n3. NT68 -> NT49 NT25\n4. NT25 -> NT31 NT5\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-743","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the analysis because each production directly relates to two symbols (or a terminal) when deriving the string.\n\nThe string to check is: `t51 t30 t90 t35 t74 t27 t74 t30 t18 t46 t60 t15 t8 t35 t29 t17 t18 t32 t75 t61 t90 t13 t90 t42 t16 t27 t16 t8 t73 t17 t27 t14 t71 t74 t18 t24 t10 t8 t7`.\n\nI notice that each symbol in the string (like t51, t30, etc.) corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar. My first thought is to see if each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a production rule in the grammar that ends with that 't'.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal can produce two other non-terminals or a terminal. My goal is to build a parse tree from the bottom up (since the string starts with terminals) and see if I can derive the entire string.\n\nI'll start by checking the initial symbol in the string, which is 't51'. Looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT27 NT93\n- NT93 \u2192 NT27 NT54\n- NT27 \u2192 't74' (from NT27 \u2192 't74' because I see a line `NT27 -> t74 NT98` but wait, let me check again. Looking back, the rules for NT27 are: `NT27 -> t93` and `NT27 -> t90`. Hmm, maybe I have that wrong. Let me check the provided grammar rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the relevant rules for NT27 and NT93 (and NT54) are:\n\n- NT27 -> t93 | t90 (from lines: \"NT27 -> t93\", \"NT27 -> t90\")\n- NT93 -> t27 | t54 (from lines: \"NT93 -> t27\", \"NT93 -> t54\")\n- NT54 -> t82 | t9 (from lines: \"NT54 -> t82\", \"NT54 -> t9\")\n\nWait, but in our string, the 't51' needs to come from NT51, right? Let me see: the production rule for NT51 is NOT present in the provided grammar. Wait, the initial step is wrong. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see several NT rules but I'm trying to see if any NT's terminal production includes 't51'. Scanning through, I notice that some NTs have 't' productions, but I don't see 't51' directly in any of the given terminals.\n\nFor example, I see lines like:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT67 -> 't56'\n- NT49 -> 't74'\n- NT15 -> 't44'\n- etc.\n\nWait, I don't see 't51' as a terminal in any production. That's a problem because if the string contains 't51', but the grammar doesn't have a production rule that terminates with 't51', then the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nLet me check all the 'tX' entries in the grammar to see if 't51' is present as a terminal. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- 't42' appears for NT83,\n- 't13' for NT83,\n- 't17' for NT3,\n- 't56' for NT67,\n- 't74' for NT49,\n- 't24' for NT18,\n- 't90' for NT50,\n- 't27' for NT27,\n- 't82' for NT20,\n- 't15' for NT15,\n- 't93' for NT27,\n- 't68' for NT77,\n- and so on.\n\nI don't see 't51' anywhere. So the string contains 't51' which is a terminal that's not present in any of the grammar's production rules as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I can see that S is directly rewritten into NT3 and NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. \n\nI need to see if the given string can be derived from S by applying these production rules. The string provided is: `t46 t8 t83 t18 t63 t60 t65 t9 t51 t65 t83 t18 t78 t50 t14 t30 t74 t73 t78 t8 t51 t51 t79 t42 t74 t18 t10 t42 t30 t65 t46 t88 t79 t65 t51 t30 t78 t44 t51`. \n\nEach token in the string is a terminal symbol that must be matched by the right-hand side of the productions. Since all the rules are in CNF, each production breaks down the non-terminals into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols (like 't42', 't8', etc.). So, each non-terminal either expands into two other non-terminals or directly into a terminal.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to find if there's a way to parse the string by working backwards from S using the productions. This means checking if each pair of terminals or non-terminals can be matched by any production rule in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by checking the beginning of the string. The string starts with t46 t8. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t75\n- NT44 \u2192 t60\n- NT77 \u2192 t32\n- NT65 \u2192 t46\n\nSo NT44 \u2192 t60 and NT65 \u2192 t46. Let me check if these are direct terminals or have further productions. \n\nWait, NT44 has a production to NT22 and NT18, then looking at NT22 and NT18, and so on. But maybe there are some NT's that directly produce t46 and t8.\n\nWait, from the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't46', I see NG22 has a production to t78, and so on. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals that can produce 't46', 't8', etc., and see how the string can be broken down.\n\nLet me list out the direct terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, the ones that directly produce terminals (like 't42', 't8', etc.) are:\n\nNT83 \u2192 t13\nNT3 \u2192 t17\nNT18 \u2192 t8\nNT20 \u2192 t65\nNT70 \u2192 t78\nNT50 \u2192 t24\nNT8 \u2192 t35\nNT65 \u2192 t46\nNT74 \u2192 t75\nNT17 \u2192 t70\nNT82 \u2192 t20 \u2192 t15? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple rules with the same non-terminal mapping to different things. I need to see for each t in the string, what non-terminals produce it.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking for 't46':\nNT44 \u2192 t60? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me go through each terminal and find which non-terminals produce them:\n\n- 't46' appears in NT65 \u2192 t46 (so NT65 can produce 't46')\n- 't8' appears in NT18 \u2192 t8 (so NT18 \u2192 t8)\n- 't83' appears in NT18 \u2192 t83? Wait, let me check. \n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, I think I need to list all the non-terminals that produce each terminal.\n\nLooking for each terminal:\n\n1. 't46':\n   NT44 \u2192 t60\n   NT26 \u2192 t44? No, wait:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT44 has a production to NT22 NT18, and NT22 has NT39 NT65, and so on. Wait, looking for t46: from the given grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18, NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT5, NT71 \u2192 NT70 NT39, NT39 \u2192 NT30 NT65, NT30 \u2192 NT54, etc., which eventually produce t's. Alternatively, perhaps NT65 \u2192 t46.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t46? Let me see:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, there's:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t46\n\nSo NT65 can directly produce 't46'. Similarly, another NT65 \u2192 t89? Wait, no, wait:\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 t46\n\nSo yes, NT65 can produce t46. So the first two tokens in the string are t46 and t8. So how does that fit into the grammar?\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the top-level expansion is two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo in the string, the first two tokens are t46 t8. But S starts with NT3 NT77, which in the beginning would be two symbols. So in the string, the first two must come from NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first two are t46 and t8, but S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So if the string starts with t46 t8, that would suggest that either NT3 produces t46 and NT77 produces t8, or vice versa, since all productions are in pairs of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's see. Each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192 a. So when you have S \u2192 NT3 NT77, that means in the parse, the first two symbols must be generated by NT3 and NT77.\n\nBut the first symbol is t46, which is a terminal, and NT3 produces t46 or something else? Let me check NT3's productions.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo NT3 can only produce two non-terminals: NT17 and NT6.\n\nNow, NT17's production is: NT70 NT58.\n\nNT70 \u2192 t7 or NT50 NT17.\n\nAnd NT58 \u2192 NT54 NT33, then NT54 can produce 't54'? Let me see the grammar.\n\nWait, for each token in the string, I need to find which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nt46: comes from NT65 as per the list: NT65 \u2192 t46.\n\nt8: comes from NT18 \u2192 t8.\n\nt83: according to grammar, NT18 \u2192 t83? Let me check: \n\nNo, I think NT18 can produce t8, t83, etc.\n\nWait, NT18 \u2192 t8, and also from NT18 \u2192 NT30 NT50 \u2192 t8 comes from NT30 \u2192 t83 or something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, stepping back, perhaps the way to approach this is to split the string into pairs based on the grammar's production rules, which are all of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe given string has 44 tokens, which is even, so 22 pairs. Each pair must come from a production of a non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string is: t46 t8 t83 t18 t63 t60 t65 t9 t51 t65 t83 t18 t78 t50 t14 t30 t74 t73 t78 t8 t51 t51 t79 t42 t74 t18 t10 t42 t30 t65 t46 t88 t79 t65 t51 t30 t78 t44 t51.\n\nFirst, the first two tokens are t46 and t8.\n\nOption 1: The non-terminals at the top level are NT3 and NT77, as per S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, t46 must come from NT3, and t8 must come from NT77.\n\nBut wait, NT3 produces two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-765","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the string provided is generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a format where each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals. The starting symbol seems to be S, as it doesn't appear on the right side of any production. The right-hand sides of the rules have either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, except for some rules that end when a terminal (like 't54') or 't42' is reached. Wait, actually, looking at some of these, the terminals are like 't17', 't8', etc. So, each production either expands into two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. So, the leaves of the derivation tree would be these terminals.\n\nThe string given is: t50 t15 t68 t9 t18 t46 t30 t30 t90 t7 t68 t78 t74 t42 t65 t10 t69 t24 t70 t60 t60 t72 t51 t10 t32 t73 t42 t88 t68 t10 t32 t56 t65 t17 t73 t63 t15 t7 t61 t17.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do that, I can work backwards by trying to match the string to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by checking the beginning symbols. The first symbol in the string is t50. Looking at the grammar, t50 is a terminal that appears as the right-hand side of NT26 -> NT44 NT54. Wait, no, actually t50 is the result of some production. Wait, I should look through the productions to see where t50 appears.\n\nLooking through the list, I see a production: NT26 -> NT5 NT48, but that leads to t48 which doesn't match t50. Another one is NT54 -> t83 NT16, but t83 is a terminal. Wait, actually, some productions have terminals as their right-hand sides, which would mean that when expanding, we can end up with a terminal at the leaf. So, for example, NT98 -> NT93 NT16, and if both sides are terminals, then it would produce a token.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the non-terminals that can produce the terminals. So, for each terminal in the string, I can check which non-terminals can produce that terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I can see a list where some non-terminals are assigned to a terminal:\n\n- NT26 -> t44 (I think, but let me check the list again). Let me go through the list more carefully.\n\nLooking through the '->' rules:\n\n- NT48 -> NT18 NT93\n- NT26 -> NT5 NT48\n- NT40 -> t90\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT44 -> t60\n- NT77 -> t32\n- NT74 -> t16\n- NT59 -> t17\n- NT75 -> t79\n- NT44 -> t60\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT54 -> t82\n- NT79 -> t72\n- NT58 -> t54\n- NT29 -> NT? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to create a list of each non-terminal and whether it can produce a certain terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Looking for which non-terminals produce 't50': Hmm, going through the list, I see NT26 -> NT54 via some steps, but perhaps NT26 produces t69. Wait, let's look again.\n\nLooking for the production rules that result in a terminal:\n\n- NT26 -> NT54 (which is replaced by t82) but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is A->BC or A->a. So, the string can be decomposed into a series of binary expansions starting from S, each step replacing a non-terminal with two others until all are terminals.\n\nWait, the string provided is quite long, so maybe the approach is to see if each symbol can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed bottom-up, checking if each symbol can be derived by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at the number of symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step doubles the number of non-terminals, so the length of the string must be 2^k for some k, starting from the single non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: the length is let's see... counting the number of 't's:\n\nt50 t15 t68 t9 t18 t46 t30 t30 t90 t7 t68 t78 t74 t42 t65 t10 t69 t24 t70 t60 t60 t72 t51 t10 t32 t73 t42 t88 t68 t10 t32 t56 t65 t17 t73 t63 t15 t7 t61 t17.\n\nWait, that's 38 symbols. Hmm, 38 isn't a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So perhaps it's impossible because the grammar can only generate strings of length 2^n. So, 38 is not a power of two, meaning it can't be generated.\n\nWait, but wait, not necessarily. Because in some cases, the grammar can have rules that allow for more complex derivations. Wait, but in CNF, each expansion is a binary split, so the total number of symbols must be a power of two. So if the string has a length that is not a power of two, the answer is 'No'.\n\nLet me check: 38. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So, 38 isn't a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nBut wait, the grammar might allow for more complex structures, perhaps with multiple terminals in a single expansion. Wait, no, in CNF, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step of expansion increases the count by one (when a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals) or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal (reduces the count by one). Therefore, the total number of terminals can vary, but in any case, the parity might not be an issue. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, no. The standard Chomsky normal form for context-free grammars only allows for productions of the form A->BC (non-terminals) or A->a (terminals). Each application of a production can either split a non-terminal into two non-terminals (increasing the number of symbols by one) or replace a non-terminal with a terminal (decreasing the number of symbols by one).\n\nSo, starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each expansion can increase the number of symbols by 1 or decrease it, depending on the rule applied.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: When you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, you add one symbol (from one to two: +1). When you replace a non-terminal with a terminal, you remove one symbol (from one to none: -1). So, the minimum and maximum expansions are by one each time.\n\nTherefore, the total number of symbols in the leftmost derivation would be S(1) then after first expansion:\n\n- If replacing S with two non-terminals, 2.\n\nAfter the second step, each of those can be replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but this can lead to a lot of possibilities. The total count can vary because each expansion can either add, remove, or do nothing.\n\nWait, no, each production applied must be either A->BC (increases by one) or A->a (decreases by one). So each step, the length can increase or decrease by one.\n\nTherefore, the length of the generated string can be any number that can be obtained by a series of +1 and -1 steps starting from 1.\n\nSo, the possible lengths are all positive integers except perhaps 0, since you can't have zero symbols for a string.\n\nWait, but the production can lead to any length >=1, because each production increases or decreases by one. So, for example, 1 can go to 2 or 0, but the string cannot have length 0, so 1 can produce any length as long as you can reach it via a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not restricted to powers of two. So, perhaps the length of the string can be any number >=1, as long as it's reachable"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT3 NT77, right?\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t78, t51, t54, t70, t8, t8, t7, t30, t16, t10, t74, t88, t14, t56, t17, t35, t22, t7, t61, t54, t71, t63, t79, t18, t35, t24, t54, t14, t42, t46, t10, t24, t10, t12, t29, t27, t56, t9, t42.\n\nFirst, I think I should try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Parsing context-free grammars can be done using a stack-based approach like the CYK algorithm or by attempting a top-down or bottom-up method. Since the grammar is small, maybe a recursive descent parser would work, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me look at the grammar productions to see which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nLooking through, I see several NT productions that directly produce specific 't's or other non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n- NT18 \u2192 t8\n- NT74 \u2192 t75\n- NT65 \u2192 t77\n- NT3 \u2192 t17\n- NT15 \u2192 t73\n- NT58 \u2192 t54\n- NT26 \u2192 t44\n- NT51 \u2192 t27\n- NT22 \u2192 t71 or t23\n- NT77 \u2192 t32 or others, but I don't see an immediate t in its productions, unless it's through other rules.\nWait, NT77 is derived into NT68 and NT44, and then each of those might produce more rules. Let me try to see.\n\nThe first symbol is t78. Looking at the grammar, is there an NT78? Let's check the given productions. Scanning through all the non-terminals, I don't see NT78 as a terminal in any production. Wait, but perhaps it's generated via another NT.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see NT74 is an NT that can produce t75 (but that's not t78). What about NT77? It's NT68 NT44, which is t78? Wait, no\u2014let me look again. Oh, here's something: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then, where do these lead?\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. NT49 \u2192 t12, but also, I think, NT49 has another production: NT49 \u2192 t74. So, NT49 can produce t74 or t12? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT49 has two productions:\n- NT49 \u2192 t74\n- NT49 \u2192 t12.\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 NT49 \u2192 either t74 or t12. Let's track this. Wait, but our string starts with t78, so how is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me make a table of NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice the following NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\nNT18 \u2192 t8\nNT74 \u2192 t75\nNT15 \u2192 t73\nNT58 \u2192 t54\nNT26 \u2192 t44\nNT51 \u2192 t27\nNT22 \u2192 t71\nNT31 \u2192 t14\nNT36 \u2192 t50\nNT44 \u2192 t60\nNT77 \u2192 t68? Wait no, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, which leads to terminals.\n\nWait, let me see if any NT directly produces t78. Looking through all NTs in the production rules, I don't see an NT that directly produces t78. That means perhaps there's a non-terminal NT78 that's being used, but in the provided grammar, I don't see such a rule. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let's check again. The given grammar doesn't have any production where an NT directly produces t78. So, t78 must be produced by some NT that eventually leads to it. Or perhaps there's a non-terminal NT78 that's part of the rules, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, the given grammar's non-terminals include NT74, NT18, NT3, etc., but no NT78. So how is the string starting with t78?\n\nThis suggests that either the answer is No because there's no way to produce t78, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the list of productions again. Let me go through all the NTs:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2, etc.\n\nLooking, I don't see any NT directly producing t78. That's a problem because the string starts with t78, which can't be derived from any NT in the given grammar. So, perhaps the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss something. Maybe t78 is produced by NT78, which isn't listed here. Alternatively, perhaps it's produced through some other NT, but I don't see a production that leads to t78. So, perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string was generated using a different NT that eventually leads to t78, but looking through the productions, I don't see that happening. For example, NT77 produces NT68 and NT44, which I can break down further, but none of them seem to lead directly to t78.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps t78 is produced by NT76, but I don't see NT76 in the productions either. Let me check: NT26 \u2192 t44. So, NT26 produces t44, but that's it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try to see the possible way t78 could be produced. Since NT78 isn't directly a production, perhaps it's an abbreviation for NT78 \u2192 NTxxxx NTyyyy, but in the given grammar, there's no such production. So, I think t78 is not possible to derive from any NT in this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-778","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice that each rule on the left-hand side (LHS) has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS), except for the cases where a terminal appears, like NT3 \u2192 't17', which suggests that the grammar might not be strictly in CNF unless I'm missing something. However, the initial part specifies that the grammar is in CNF, so perhaps I need to verify that.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar given, most rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, but some have terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17' is a production to a terminal, which is allowed in CNF, as CNF allows for productions to terminals as well. So, the grammar is in CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNext, the given string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. I'll list them out:\n\nt88 t12 t87 t72 t46 t12 t74 t73 t83 t15 t12 t17 t42 t79 t83 t54 t13 t71 t65 t90 t44 t78 t46 t61 t73 t14 t16 t30 t46 t46 t7 t69 t61 t61 t14 t17 t13 t16 t60 t9 t63.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be generated by the given grammar. One approach is to construct a parse tree for the string and see if it adheres to the grammar rules. Alternatively, I could use the concept of a top-down parsing or bottom-up parsing, but given the complexity, a step-by-step analysis might be more feasible.\n\nFirst, perhaps starting from the root symbol 'S' and trying to match the string. Since 'S' can only produce NT3 NT77 (from S \u2192 NT3 NT77), the string must start with the concatenation of the productions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nLet me break down NT3 and NT77:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' (immediately gives 't17'), but looking at the string, the first elements are 't88', 't12', etc. So that's a problem because NT3 directly produces 't17', which would be the first output. But the string starts with 't88', which doesn't match 't17'. Therefore, if 'S' produces NT3 NT77, then the first token should be 't17'. But the string starts with 't88', which doesn't match, meaning either the string is incorrect or perhaps the grammar can derive the string through some combination.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The production S \u2192 NT3 NT77 is the only way to start, so the first two symbols must be the expansion of NT3 and NT77. However, looking at the grammar rules, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 't17', but also other possibilities? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT3 is defined as:\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\n\nSo, NT3 can only produce 't17'. Therefore, the first element in the string must be 't17', but in the given string, it starts with 't88'. That suggests that the string cannot be derived from the grammar because the first symbol 't88' doesn't match 't17'.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar definitions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT18 \u2192 't68'\n- NT69 is not directly defined here, but perhaps I can find a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the grammar builds up the string is more complex. Let me try to see if there are other production paths that could derive 't88' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps NT3 can produce 't17', but the start is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the first two elements must be 't17' followed by whatever NT77 produces. But the string starts with 't88', so that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol doesn't match, and there's no other production for NT3 that gives a different terminal.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe I misread the NT rules. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking at the NT3 production: NT3 \u2192 't17' only. No other options. So NT3 can only produce 't17'. Therefore, the string must start with 't17', but it starts with 't88', so the string is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. All non-terminals produce two non-terminals, except possibly the start symbol, which produces terminals in the case of the base grammar, but for this question, the start symbol S seems to produce non-terminals.\n\nI notice that non-terminals are represented as NT followed by numbers. The start symbol is S, which directly produces NT3 and NT77. So the initial step is that S expands to NT3 and NT77. Each of these can then expand further.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t79. Looking at the production rules, I see that NT79 can produce either t72 or NT22 NT22. But wait, in the given grammar, I don't see an immediate production for NT79 that produces t79. Let me check again: actually, scrolling through the production rules, I find that NT59 -> NT37 NT25, and NT75 -> NT74 NT21, etc. Wait, but in the initial list, I see that NT54 -> NT82 NT98, and other symbols. Hmm, perhaps I need to look for NT79 productions.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I don't immediately see NT79. Let me scan the given rules: no, it seems NT79 is not a non-terminal but a terminal, and the production exists as NT83 -> t44? Wait, no, actually, I see that NT83 has a production to t51, and others. Let me check carefully.\n\nWait, in the production rules, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT83 -> 't13' (with single quotes), meaning it's a terminal. Similarly, others. So NT79's production isn't listed as a terminal, which suggests that it might be a non-terminal and has a production.\n\nWait, looking again, let's check: the production NT79 -> 't72'? Or no. Let me scan for NT79. Hmm, no, I don't see any production for NT79 being a non-terminal. Or wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check: for example, looking for NT79, I see NT65 -> 't7', etc., but no NT79. So maybe NT79 is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the string, I see t79 multiple times, so perhaps NT79 is a non-terminal that can produce t79. But looking through all the production rules, none of the non-terminals directly produce t79 except if there's a rule I missed. Wait, for example, perhaps NT79 can be broken down into other non-terminals, which then produce t79.\n\nWait, looking for NT79's productions: I see in the grammar that NT59 is a non-terminal, and NT59's production is NT74 NT51. Hmm, not related. Let me check other non-terminals: For example, NT79 appears as a production on the right-hand side of other rules. Wait, looking for non-terminals that produce NT79. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can trace the string back through the grammar. The string starts with t79, which is a terminal. So at some point in the derivation, a non-terminal must derive this terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the non-terminal NT79 is a terminal, meaning it directly corresponds to that string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that NT79 produces t79. But looking at the production rules, there's no NT79 -> t79. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I can see NT77 -> NT68 NT44, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check for t79:\n\nIs there a production for any non-terminal that directly produces 't79'? Scanning:\n\nI see NT58 -> 't85', which isn't relevant. Looking through all, I don't see a production where a non-terminal A produces 't79' directly. Therefore, perhaps t79 is a terminal, and the grammar doesn't have a production that allows NT79 to derive 't79'. But the string starts with t79, so the grammar must have a derivation path that includes producing this.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string has 't79' at several points, so perhaps each of these is either derived directly from a non-terminal that produces 't79' or via a series of steps that result in 't79' as a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal NT89 is involved, but no NT89 exists. Alternatively, maybe a non-terminal that branches into other non-terminals which eventually produce 't79'.\n\nWait, perhaps the production rules allow some non-terminal to produce 't79'. Let me look again for any rules where a non-terminal leads to a 't79' as part of a two-step production.\n\nWait, for example, NT22 -> t71, but that's not relevant here. Let me think: perhaps NT22 can produce 't71' and another non-terminal which produces 't9', making 't71 t9', and so on.\n\nWait, but to produce 't79', perhaps a non-terminal production would be something like A -> B C, where B is a terminal or further non-terminals leading to 't79', but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Perhaps there's a non-terminal that eventually produces 't79' through a chain of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking for any non-terminals that can derive 't79' as a terminal. If such a non-terminal exists, then the string is possible.\n\nLooking through the production rules, the only way to get 't79' is through a non-terminal that directly produces 't79'. Looking through all the production rules:\n\n- I see that NT67 -> 't82', no.\n- NT44 -> 't60', no.\n- NT93 -> 't54', no.\n- Wait, looking again, the rule NT67 -> 't56' (yes, that's a terminal). Similarly, NT54 -> 't83', etc.\n\nWait, I think I may have missed the production for NT79. Let me scan through the production rules again:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal X where X -> 't79'. Scanning through all rules, I find:\n\n- NT49 -> 't74',\n- NT65 -> 't88',\n- NT74 -> 't75',\n- NT59 -> 't74', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal X directly produces 't79'. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and 't79' is a terminal symbol, and the production rules don't have any non-terminal that can produce it. But that can't be because the string contains 't79's. Therefore, the grammar must have some rule where a non-terminal produces 't79'.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked it. Let me check more carefully:\n\nLooking through all the production rules again, for example:\n\n- NT83 -> 't44', 't93', etc. Wait, NT83 can produce 't13' and 't51', as per: 't13', 't51', etc. Wait, no, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nYes, the production for NT83 is:\n\nNT83 -> 't44' and 't93'. Also, NT83 -> 't44' and 't13', and 't51'.

{"custom_id":"request-807","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can produce terminals. Looking at the start symbol S, it produces NT3 and NT77. Each of those is a non-terminal, so we'll need to expand from there.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like \"t14 t12 t79...\", and it's pretty long. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol, so each token in the string must be generated by a production that eventually ends in a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nIn the grammar, many non-terminals are eventually converted to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, but looking further, NT8 is 't8', NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85, and so on until they all resolve to terminals or lead through terminals.\n\nSo, the strategy is to check each 'tX' in the string against the possible terminal productions. Also, since it's in CNF, each step in the derivation must expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals, which then continue expanding until terminals are produced.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t14 t12 t79...\". Let's check what NT3, NT77, etc., produce in terms of terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT8 \u2192 't35', NT70 \u2192 't7', etc. But each 'tX' should be directly expandable from some non-terminal.\n\nSo, for example, 't14' is the result of NT8 \u2192 't35', but I need to see if there's a non-terminal that directly produces 't14'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't78', which doesn't help. Hmm, wait, there's also NT15 \u2192 't44', but that's not 't14'.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I need to see if any non-terminal production directly produces 't14'. I think NT58 \u2192 't54', but that's not helpful. Wait, the grammar has NT5 -> 't14'. Oh, that's critical. So NT5 can directly produce 't14'.\n\nNow, I need to check if 't14' is allowed in the string. Wait, the string starts with 't14 t12...', so NT5 produces 't14', and perhaps another non-terminal produces 't12'.\n\nLooking for 't12', I see in the grammar, NT93 \u2192 't54' and NT17 \u2192 't70', but maybe NT67 \u2192 't56', etc. Hmm, but where does 't12' come from? Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT67 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT70 \u2192 't78'\n\nWait, perhaps 't12' comes from NT93. Let me check:\n\nNT93 in the grammar is defined as NT22 and NT22. From the given rules, NT93 \u2192 't27'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, checking the grammar, NT93 is defined as:\n\nNT93 -> NT22 NT22\n\nBut I don't see NT22 being a terminal. Looking back, NT22 is:\n\nNT22 -> 't78' (I think in the given grammar, NT22 is defined as 't78')? Wait, no, checking the grammar provided by the user:\n\nLooking for NT22, in the given rules, I see NT22 is defined as several times, like 't78' in some production, but actually, no, wait:\n\nLooking again, in the grammar, the rule is NT22 -> 't78'? No, actually, in the given grammar, I don't see NT22 producing a terminal. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through all the given rules, I see:\n\nNT22 -> NT71\n\nNT71 -> 't70'\n\nWait, so in the given grammar, NT82 -> NT79 NT16, but I don't see NT22 directly producing 't78' as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking down, there's:\n\nNT83 -> 't44'\n\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not getting where 't12' comes from. Wait, the string is 't14 t12 t79...', so 't12' is the second token. How can we get 't12'?\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT12: I don't see any NT directly producing 't12' unless it's via a chain of productions. Maybe it comes from an intermediate non-terminal. For example, maybe NT12 is produced by some combination.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I don't see any rule that directly ends with 't12' except NT93, which seems to produce 't27' via some path. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't12' comes from NT25, which is 't25' via some production, but wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's from NT85.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach. Each non-terminal must produce a string of terminals and non-terminals, ending in terminals only. So, each token in the string must be covered by the grammar.\n\nI'll go through the string step by step, assuming that each 'tX' must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So:\n\n1. First token: 't14' \u2192 which NT? Looking, NT8 \u2192 't35', but also NT5 \u2192 't14'. So, yes, NT5 can produce 't14'.\n\n2. Second token: 't12' \u2192 Where does 't12' come from? Let's check the grammar rules. Hmm, I don't see any direct NT -> 't12'. Maybe it's a combination, like NT12, but in the grammar, I don't see NT12. So perhaps this is a problem. Wait, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar's rules are extensive. Let me search for 't12':\n\nLooking through all the given rules, the only place where a terminal shows up with 12 is:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT93 \u2192 't27', but I don't see any 't12' in the given rules. So maybe 't12' is not produced by the grammar, which would mean the string is invalid.\n\nBut then again, perhaps I missed something. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the string: t14 t12 t79 t78 t29 t24 t46 t72 t13 t13 t69 t74 t29 t46 t8 t60 t72 t71 t42 t74 t16 t78 t70 t61 t17 t65 t10 t18 t75 t22 t51 t90 t88 t27 t56 t61 t73 t46 t50 t83 t8 t87.\n\nSo, 't12' is the second token. If there's no NT that produces 't12', then the string cannot be generated. But wait, perhaps I'm mistaken in my parsing. Maybe NT12 is a typo, or maybe it's part of a longer production.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe provided grammar includes rules like:\n\nNT83 -> 't13' and NT74 -> 't16', but the only rule that ends with a 't' is when the non-terminal directly produces a terminal, like NT5 \u2192 't14', and some of the others.\n\nBut I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12'. So unless 't12' is derived via multiple steps, which seems unlikely since the grammar is in CNF and each step only expands into two non-terminals, leading to more steps.\n\nWait, maybe 't12' is part of a larger chain. Maybe it's a hidden symbol, but looking through the given productions, I don't see any path that leads to 't12'.\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs that have a terminal production:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each rule that ends with a terminal is:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't60'\n\n- NT85 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n\n- NT23 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-819","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex, with a bunch of productions. The string provided is a sequence of tokens which I assume correspond to the terminal symbols from the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should try to parse the grammar and see if I can understand the structure. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the start symbol is S, and it generates a concatenation of two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions, ultimately leading down to terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions, many of them have the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which suggests that they are splitting the non-terminal into two others. Some have direct terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't17', which means 't17' is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t70 t69 t90 t63 t29 t22 t87 t60 t9 t63 t74 t15 t10 t27 t79 t69 t18 t15 t35 t65 t15 t75 t32 t69 t72 t69 t54 t22 t90 t13 t27 t51 t71 t17 t50 t75 t24 t24 t32 t75 t87 t74 t18`. It's a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are presumably the terminals in the grammar.\n\nSince the string starts with 't70', I should check if 't70' is directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see NT74 and NT75 and NT93 have some 't' productions, but nothing directly for NT70. However, checking further down, I see NT70 \u2192 't7'. So 't7' is a terminal, but 't70' is different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check: NT74 \u2192 t75, NT79 \u2192 t69, NT70 \u2192 t7. Hmm, maybe I need to see how 't70' is generated. Looking back, I don't see a production for NT70 that leads directly to a terminal. Instead, NT70 \u2192 t7, which is a different token.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Are the tokens in the string each corresponding to a single non-terminal production? No, because the grammar's productions are in CNF, which means each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the starting symbol which may have more. So each step of the derivation can only replace a non-terminal with two others, each of which eventually becomes a terminal.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I can model this as a parsing process. Each step would involve breaking the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's start with the beginning of the string: 't70'. From the grammar, the only non-terminal that produces 't70' directly is NT70 \u2192 t7, but that gives 't7', not 't70'. So that can't be a direct production. Maybe 't70' is part of a longer production. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT70 in the grammar is a non-terminal, and when expanded, leads to something that includes 't70'. Let me check the production rules again. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t7 (so it can't produce 't70')\n- Other rules: NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, but no, that's about NT44 and NT36 leading to something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has 't70' which isn't directly produced by any single non-terminal, meaning it's impossible. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because 't70' isn't present as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check the initial rules again. Wait, the starting rule is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S generates a string that starts with NT3 and NT77. But if NT77 can produce 't32' and 't69', as per the rules, maybe the string is built by splitting these non-terminals down to terminals. But if 't70' isn't a terminal, then the string can't have that token, unless it's part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The string includes 't70', which isn't a terminal in the grammar because looking through all the productions, none directly produce 't70' as a terminal.

The grammar provided seems to be in CNF since I see productions with two non-terminals on the right side and some with terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terms connected by spaces, each representing a terminal symbol. The grammar defines how these terminals can be generated. \n\nI think the best approach here is to try to expand the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation can be visualized as a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children, except the leaves which are terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and seeing if it can be decomposed according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string starts with `t74`. Looking into the grammar, I see that `NT83` and `NT8` can derive `t74` and `t8`, respectively. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, maybe it's the other way around. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are rules where NT83 \u2192 't16' and other options. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example:\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT44 NT14\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\nNT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22\nNT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe starting from the beginning of the string.\n\nThe string starts with `t74 t73 t18...`. Let's see if `t74` can come from a rule. In the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT74 has multiple productions, including some that directly produce t16, t75, t79, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT74 can produce 't75', 't79', 't30', 't15', etc. Looking for t74, I see that 't74' is the terminal, but I don't see a direct production for NT74 \u2192 't74'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT74 has production 74 \u2192 NT74 NT77, 75 \u2192 NT75 \u2192 NT75 NT77, and other combinations, but no direct t74. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the NT and the terminals. Let me see:\n\nWait, for example, NT77 appears in production rules like NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and also NT77 \u2192 't32'. So 't77' is generated by NT77.\n\nWait, but I see that NT77 can produce 't32', but also as part of other rules. So to get 't74', I need to see if there's a rule that directly produces it or if it can be built from other NT symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT rule directly producing 't74' as a terminal. All the NT rules either have other NTs or combinations. Wait, that can't be right because then the grammar wouldn't produce any terminals except for specific ones, but I know from the production rules that some NTs produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see that some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT77 \u2192 't32', NT68 \u2192 't44', etc. But no NT directly produces 't74' in any of the rules. Hmm, that's odd because then how can 't74' appear in the string? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking closer, I see a rule: NT74 \u2192 NT75 NT77. But that's another NT, so no terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each rule again:\n\nLooking for 't74' in the production rules, I don't see any rule where a NT directly produces 't74'. For example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't8', but nope. NT22 \u2192 't78', etc. Hmm, this is confusing. How does 't74' get generated?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe the NT and the terminal are mixed up. Let me check the first part.\n\nNT74 has a production to 't75', 't79', etc., but not 't74'. Wait, does NT44 produce 't74'? Let me look at NT44's rules:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18 or 't68'? Wait, in the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, and NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18. Hmm, wait, in the production rules, perhaps NT44 can't produce 't44' directly either. Wait, let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, no, the rules for NT44 are:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT50\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT70 NT39\n\nWait, no direct t74. Hmm, maybe I need to see if 't74' is produced by some other NT.\n\nWait, perhaps 't74' is from NT65? Let's check NT65:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2 or other combinations, but doesn't directly produce 't74'. Wait, no, looking at the production rules, I don't see any rule that produces 't74' directly from any NT. That seems like a problem because if none of the NTs can directly produce 't74' as a terminal, then 't74' can't be part of any string derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule NT74 \u2192 t75, and so on. Maybe t74 isn't generated directly but indirectly? Or perhaps there's a typo in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the production rules again for NT44:\n\nLooking here, NT44 has a production: NT44 \u2192 't68'\n\nYes, NT44 can produce 't68'.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't74', but according to the grammar, no NT directly produces 't74', which would mean the string can't be generated. But the question asks if the string is generated, so perhaps the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NT production rules for terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT83 \u2192 't16', 't44', etc.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't75', 't79', 't30', 't15'\n\nWait, NT74 \u2192 't75' and 't79', but no 't74'. Similarly, looking for 't74' elsewhere, perhaps in NT85.\n\nLooking up NT85's rules:\n\nNT85 \u2192 't3', 't74', 't67'\n\nAh! Here we go. NT85 can produce 't74' directly. So, the first token 't74' in the string must come from NT85 \u2192 't74'.\n\nSo, that's the starting point. Now, how does NT85 derive 't74'? It directly produces 't74', so that's fine.\n\nNow, the next token is 't73'. But let's trace backward. If NT85 \u2192 't74', then the rest of the string would have to be part of the grammar following that. So after 't74', there should be a grammar derivation for the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. The string is 't74 t73...'. So after t74, there's t73. But since t74 is a terminal, the NT must be NT85, and after that, the next symbol would need to come from the next NT in the expansion. But in reality, after a terminal, the NT would split into two rules to continue the expansion. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see how the string can be formed. Starting with NT85 \u2192 't74', then the next step is to expand NT85 into its non-terminal components.\n\nWait, no. NT85 directly produces 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-838","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like 't17', 't24', etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. CNF is a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems most of the rules are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which fits CNF. Some have terminals on the right side, like NT0 -> 't8', which are the actual terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is 't17 t24 t65 t63 t35 t12 t68 t29 t8 t54 t50 t9 t68 t8 t72 t50 t75 t63 t71 t56 t79 t35 t83 t46 t74 t70 t74 t27 t14 t60 t79 t63 t46 t51 t71 t50 t68 t68 t30 t8 t44 t22 t22 t27'.\n\nWait, I notice that the string starts with several 't's followed by numbers, like 't17', 't24', etc. The grammar has several rules where non-terminals are replaced by pairs of other non-terminals or terminal symbols. For example, S -> NT3 NT77, and NT3 -> NT17 NT6, and NT67 -> 't56', and so on.\n\nSo, my approach should be to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the string is given in a linear form, I can simulate a pushdown automaton (which is how parsers for CNF work, right?), or use recursive descent parsing, but perhaps a better approach is to see if I can trace a possible derivation from the start symbol S to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, maybe I can look for a leftmost derivation. Each step would replace a non-terminal with its right-hand side, gradually building up the string from S.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps it's easier to break down the string into parts that match the rules. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then, to get the string, we need to have NT3 produce some symbols and NT77 produce others.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't17', which I need to see how it can be generated. Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So perhaps NT3 can produce 't17' and something else. Wait, NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 't70'? No, looking at the grammar, NT17's production is NT17 \u2192 't70' and also NT17 \u2192 't8 NT58'. Wait, actually, looking back: the grammar for NT17 is:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT17 -> 't70'\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT8 -> NT30 NT50\nThen, NT8's rule? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, after NT17, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nand then later a production for NT8:\nNT8 -> NT30 NT50.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The provided grammar has multiple lines, so I need to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for example, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nand later:\nNT8 -> NT30 NT50\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT17's productions. It seems like:\n\nNT17 has two productions:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT17 -> 't70'\n\nSo, NT17 can either produce a string consisting of NT8 and NT58, or just 't70'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has a production NT8 -> NT30 NT50.\n\nBut looking further, NT30 also has a production NT30 -> 't54'.\n\nWait, so if I start from NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nEach of these can be broken down further.\n\nNT17 can be 't70' or NT8 NT58.\n\nIf NT17 is 't70', and NT6 is, looking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo if NT6 is 't63', then NT3 \u2192 't70' 't63', meaning 't70 t63'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part of the string is 't17 t24 t65...', which is different from 't70 t63', so perhaps NT17 is taking the other path, i.e., NT8 NT58.\n\nWait, but the initial string starts with 't17', not 't70', so if NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and the string starts with 't17', then perhaps NT17 is producing 't17' and something else.\n\nWait, let's look again at NT17's productions. I think I may have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT17 in the list:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT17 -> 't70'\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, under NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nThen, the productions for NT17 are:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT17 in the provided grammar:\n\n- I see NT17 is defined as:\n  NT17 -> NT8 NT58\n  NT17 -> 't70'\n\nSo NT17 can produce either 't70' or NT8 NT58.\n\nBut the string starts with 't17', so that implies that something is producing 't17'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because in the grammar, the non-terminals start with NT0, NT1, etc., not just single letters. So, in the initial string, we have 't17', which is a terminal symbol, so it must come from a production that includes a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions that produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT67 -> 't56', NT36 -> 't50', NT44 -> 't60', etc.\n\nSo, 't17' would have to come from a production of a non-terminal that can produce 't17'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nThere's a rule NT65 -> 't74', NT75 -> 't79', NT22 -> 't78', etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see any production that directly has 't17'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake because the non-terminals are named NT followed by a number, so each NT is a separate non-terminal, and each has their own productions.\n\nWait, let me check specific productions. Let's see, is there a rule that produces 't17'? For example, looking at NT0:\n\nNT0 -> 't8'\n\nNT20 -> 't65'\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\n\nAh, yes! NT3 can produce 't17'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nAlso, later:\nNT3 -> 't17'\n\nSo, NT3 can either become NT17 NT6 or 't17'.\n\nGiven the string starts with 't17', that suggests that one of the NT3's (from S's production S \u2192 NT3 NT77) is replaced by 't17'.\n\nSo, that would fit: S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 't17' NT77.\n\nNow, after 't17', the next part of the string is 't24 t65 t63 t35...', which suggests that from 't24', which would come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-844","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string I need to check has a bunch of 't' followed by numbers, which probably correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar rules. Most of the non-terminals have productions that split into two other non-terminals, like S -> NT3 NT77. The leaves of this tree will be the terminals, which in this case seem to be combinations of 't's followed by numbers, such as t18, t46, etc.\n\nThe string provided is: `t18 t46 t54 t27 t73 t54 t13 t90 t18 t24 t51 t83 t56 t46 t27 t88 t56 t63 t73 t30 t29 t75 t70 t60 t74 t29 t30 t60 t88 t50 t46 t16 t17 t65 t14 t73 t30 t7 t73 t87 t18 t50 t18 t69`.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, my goal is to see if this entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, which generates NT3 and NT77. Then, each of those needs to produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT3 goes to NT17 NT6, which then go to t73 and t63, respectively. So NT3 can directly produce t73 t63.\n\nNext, NT77 goes to NT68 NT44. Let's check NT68: it goes to NT77 NT25. That seems like a loop, but let's see how it can resolve. NT77 again would produce more, but maybe there's a way to break it down.\n\nWait, another option: NT77 could also go to NT68 NT44, but looking deeper, NT68 is NT77 NT25, and NT44 is NT22 NT18. NT25 is NT31 NT5, which goes to t14 and t14. Wait, no, let me check: NT25 -> NT31 NT5, and NT5 is 't14'. So NT25 becomes t14 t14. Hmm, but in the string, I see t14 only once? Or wait, no, maybe that's a different part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let's take the grammar and the string and see how they match.\n\nThe string starts with t18, t46, t54, etc. So let me see what's the first production that can lead to t18.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 is not present, but in the string, t18 appears multiple times. Wait, let's check the grammar again. Oops, I realize that in the grammar, NT18 is defined as producing t69 and perhaps something else? Wait, no, let's recount.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT18 -> NT68 NT82\n\nAnd NT68 goes to NT77 NT25\n\nNT77 is NT68 NT44\n\nWait, this might be a loop. Alternatively, maybe I should look for a way to derive t18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the string is quite long, maybe I should look for a way to see if each part can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar productions.\n\nFor example, the first part is t18 t46 t54 t27 t73 t54 t13 t90 t18 t24 t51 t83 t56 t46 t27 t88 t56 t63 t73 t30 t29 t75 t70 t60 t74 t29 t30 t60 t88 t50 t46 t16 t17 t65 t14 t73 t30 t7 t73 t87 t18 t50 t18 t69\n\nWait, that's 47 tokens. The production rules are such that each production splits into two non-terminals, so the derivation tree would have a leftmost derivation where each step splits one symbol into two.\n\nGiven the structure, perhaps the string can be split into pairs that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet's start with the whole string. The first two are t18 and t46. Wait, but in the grammar, S is NT3 NT77. But in this string, the first is t18, so maybe t18 is derived from some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 is not directly present as a production; instead, NT8 -> t35, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production in the grammar is in the form of A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals. The terminals are things like t18, t24, etc. So, in the string, each 't' number is a terminal, and the sequence of terminals must be a valid derivation starting from S.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals; we need to see if this can be formed by a series of productions starting from S.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should try to find a path from S through the productions to generate the string.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which suggests that the minimum length of the string generated by any non-terminal A is 2 (e.g., A -> BC, which can expand to terminals via each symbol's rules).\n\nGiven that, the string must be a sequence that can be split into valid sub-sequences according to the grammar.\n\nLet me think: the grammar seems quite extensive, but maybe I can find that the string is derived by a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the first split is t18 and something else, but wait, the first token is t18. So, does S directly produce t18 followed by something? But S is NT3 NT77, not directly t18. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, S is split into NT3 and NT77. So, the string starts with t18, which would come from NT3. Let's check NT3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3-> NT17 NT6. NT17 is-> NT8 NT58. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should draw a tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the first few tokens: t18, t46, t54, etc.\n\nIf NT18 is not directly defined, but in the grammar, NT18 is not a non-terminal; instead, it's a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT18 is not listed as a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, NT18 is a production, right? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see non-terminals like NT18 -> NT68 NT82. So NT18 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. So the terminals are only when they're mapped to 't' numbers.\n\nTherefore, for example, NT59 -> NT74 NT51, and then, looking down, NT74 can be 't75', and NT51 can be 't27'.\n\nSo, all the 't's are leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nSo, in the string, each 't' is a terminal. Therefore, the string is a sequence of terminals that can be formed by the grammar's productions.\n\nGiven that, the string is quite long, so checking each part manually would be time-consuming. Instead, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the 't's are duplicates or have a particular pattern. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern in the string that matches the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if certain 't's are produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see how the grammar can start with S, which is NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo S starts as NT3 and NT77. Each of these must be expanded.\n\nLet's see, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So NT17 and NT6.\n\nThen, NT17 -> NT8 NT58. And NT6 -> NT63 t63. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT6 -> t63. So NT6 can directly produce t63.\n\nWait, no, the grammar for NT6 is: NT6 -> t63. So any occurrence of NT6 in the derivation will produce t63.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 -> NT8 NT58. Let's see what NT8 does"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-862","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal. \n\nLet me start by recalling what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most of the productions seem to fit this structure. For example, S -> NT3 NT77 is two non-terminals, and NT77 is a production that may eventually lead to a terminal or another two non-terminals down the line.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is:\n\nt71 t18 t74 t88 t68 t75 t27 t65 t42 t24 t68 t16 t17 t12 t32 t56 t71 t8 t87 t9 t61 t18 t65 t42 t13 t8 t56 t83 t51 t78 t90 t8 t42 t54 t88 t35 t68 t87 t63 t15 t88 t87 t16 t54 t60.\n\nEach token here is a terminal, I assume, unless it's a two-character string, but in the grammar, all terminals are single letters (like t followed by a number, perhaps). So I think each token is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, some of these might correspond to more than one character. For example, NT27 is a non-terminal, but in the grammar, NT27 may eventually resolve to something. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several of these terminals are defined. For example, NT3 -> t17, NT18 -> t8, etc. So each NT is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a single terminal string.\n\nSo the parsing process should involve starting from the start symbol S and applying productions until we can derive all terminals in the string in some order.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree is a binary tree, and the string should be a concatenation of the terminals directly produced by the leaves.\n\nTherefore, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to rewrite the start symbol S into a sequence of these terminals that exactly matches the given string.\n\nOne approach is to model the parsing process, perhaps using a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is typically used for CFGs, but modified since this is in CNF. The CYK algorithm can parse any CFG, and sinceCNF is a subset, it's applicable here.\n\nHowever, doing the CYK algorithm manually for the entire string might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a series of sub-productions that match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to construct parse trees for parts of the string and see if they fit the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t71. Let's check what can produce t71 in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a production NT71 -> NT70 NT39. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT71 -> NT70 NT39? Or looking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see at the top:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nThen other non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see a production for NT71 leading to t71.

Instead, NT71 seems to go to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT71, I see lines like:\n\nNT71 -> NT70 NT39\nNT23 -> NT29\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me re-examine the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking for NT71:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT74 -> NT74 NT77\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44\n\nNot NT71.

{"custom_id":"request-864","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows me to use algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just manually checking, I'll have to see if I can break down the string accordingly.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t51 t18 t70 t74 t27 t30 t17 t90 t83 t32 t74 t60 t75 t65 t46 t13 t35 t46 t68 t8 t15 t73 t14 t46 t88 t30 t7 t71 t63 t14 t32 t15 t79 t88 t32 t83 t63 t63 t12 t29 t79 t7 t63 t32 t87`.\n\nI notice that many of these are two-character sequences like 't5', 't18', etc., which likely correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. So, I'll parse this string as a sequence of these tokens and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S, the production is S -> NT3 NT77. So, the string must start with the symbols generated by NT3 and NT77. Let me check the string: it starts with 't51 t18 t70...', so I need to see if 't51' is generated by NT3 and 't18' by NT77, or vice versa. Wait, no, the grammar is S -> NT3 NT77, so it's a concatenation of NT3 and NT77. So, the string should be broken down into two parts, with NT3 generating the first part and NT77 generating the second.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't51', so the first part should be 't51...'. Let's see what 't51' is. Looking through the grammar production rules, I see that NT51 -> 't27' under the production NT51 -> 't27'. Wait, no, looking back, the production for NT51 is: NT51 -> 't27'. So, the symbol 't51' corresponds to NT51, which directly produces 't27'. Hmm, but in the string, we have 't51' followed by 't18' as the start of the string. So, is 't51' part of NT3 or NT77?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to split the string into parts that match the symbols in the grammar. Let me think differently. The entire string is a sequence of 't' tokens with numbers. Each token corresponds to a non-terminal (or terminal 't') production. So, 't51' would be the terminal string 't' followed by '51', which in the grammar is derived from NT51 -> 't27'. But in the start symbol S, it's NT3 and NT77, so perhaps the first part of the string must be the derivation of NT3, and the second part the derivation of NT77.\n\nBut wait, the string is a linear sequence. Let me think about how the grammar can generate this. Perhaps I need to check each part step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the structure of the string. Since S -> NT3 NT77, the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT77. So, I can split the string into two parts: one generated by NT3 and the other by NT77. But how? Because NT3 and NT77 may have multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can process the string step by step using the grammar rules. Let me try to parse the string token by token, applying the rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. 't51' -> NT51 -> 't27' (from the production NT51 -> 't27')\n2. 't18' -> NT18 -> 't8'\n3. 't70' -> NT70 -> 't7'\n4. 't74' -> NT74 -> 't75', 't74'?\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, NT74 has several productions:\n- NT74 -> NT44 NT77 (line 20)\n- NT74 -> NT5 -> 't14' (line 23)\n- NT74 -> 't60' (line 48)\nWait, in the given grammar, I think I might have misread some production rules. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, for NT74, in the given production rules, there are multiple entries:\nNT74 -> NT44 NT77 (line 20)\nNT74 -> NT5 -> 't14' (line 23)\nNT74 -> 't60' (line 48)\nAnd another line: NT74 -> NT26 NT44 (line 82)\nWait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe productions for NT74 are:\n- NT74 -> NT44 NT77 (line 37)\n- NT74 -> NT15 (line 74)\n- NT74 -> 't75' (line 79)\n- Also, line 82 says NT74 -> NT26 NT44\n- Line 48 is NT26 -> 't69'\n- Line 67 is NT67 -> 't56'\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me structure the grammar rules correctly.\n\nFrom the given grammar, here's what I can extract:\n\nNT74 has multiple production rules:\n- NT74 -> NT44 NT77 (from line 20)\n- NT74 -> NT5 -> 't14' (line 23)\n- NT74 -> 't75' (line 79)\n- NT74 -> NT26 NT44 (line 82)\nAlso, other lines may be relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting some rules wrong. Let me go line by line.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLine 20: NT74 -> NT44 NT77\n\nLine 23: NT74 -> 't14' (probably meant NT74 -> 't14', but some lines have production rules where X -> Y Z, others have X -> 'tN' or X directly to terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some rules are NTxyz -> terminal. For example, NT51 -> 't27', NT67 -> 't56', etc.\n\nSo for NT74:\n\n- NT74 -> NT44 NT77 (from line 20)\n- NT74 -> 't75' (from line 79, where NT79 -> 't75')\n- NT74 -> 't75' via NT79?\nWait, no. Line 79 says NT79 -> 't75' t something, no. Wait, line 79 says NT79 -> 't75'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the production rules for NT74:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, NT74 is produced in:\n\nLine 37: NT74 -> NT44 NT77\n\nLine 74: NT74 -> NT15\n\nLine 79: NT79 -> 't75'\n\nWait, that can't be. Line 79 says NT79 -> 't75'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the line is: NT79 -> 't75' (line 79).\n\nWait, perhaps NT74 has a production to itself, but that seems unlikely. Maybe I should make a list of all NT74 productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut maybe this is taking too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if any of the tokens correspond to NT3 and NT77 in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are 't51 t18 t70 t74 t27...' which I think correspond to NT51 (t27), NT18 (t8), NT70 (t7), NT74 (t75 or another step), and then another token.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the possible derivations.\n\nBut maybe I should try to split the string into two parts, say the first part is derived from NT3 and the second from NT77.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if the entire string can be broken down into a series of symbols that match the productions starting from S.\n\nGiven that S -> NT3 NT77, I'll start by seeing what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nLooking at NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-886","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My task is to determine if the string `t72 t9 t95 ...` can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nThe string seems to be a sequence of terminals ('t' followed by numbers). So, the string is a linear sequence of these tokens, which must correspond to the leftmost derivations in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can expand it step by step to match the entire string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step should produce two non-terminals, which can then be further expanded or replaced with terminals.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The production rule for S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, S can be replaced by NT3 and NT77. Now, the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t72. I need to see if either NT3 or NT77 can produce t72. Let me check the productions for NT3 and NT77.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n- NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\n- NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n- NT22 \u2192 t78 (from the production NT22 \u2192 t78)\nSo, NT77 expands to NT68 NT44, which then becomes NT49 NT25. NT49 \u2192 t12 (from NT49 \u2192 t12), and NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5. NT31 \u2192 t14 and NT5 \u2192 t14. So, putting it together, NT77 can produce t12 t14 t14... wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me trace that correctly.\n\nActually, each step in the expansion is a single non-terminal replacing with two non-terminals. So, starting with NT77:\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT49 \u2192 t12\nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\nNT31 \u2192 t14\nNT5 \u2192 t14\n\nSo, NT77 expands to t12 t14 t14... but wait, that's three tokens. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, each production for a non-terminal is a single step. So, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, then each of those can be expanded further. So, the expansion proceeds as:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nThen, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\nSo, NT77 \u2192 NT49 NT25 NT22 NT18\nThen, NT49 \u2192 t12, NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5, NT22 \u2192 t78, NT18 \u2192 t8\nSo, putting it all together, NT77 \u2192 t12 NT31 NT5 t78 t8\nWait, but NT31 is a non-terminal. So, NT31 \u2192 t14 (from NT31 \u2192 t14)\nAnd NT5 \u2192 t14 (from NT5 \u2192 t14)\n\nSo, NT77 \u2192 t12 t14 t14 t78 t8\n\nBut that gives us five tokens: 't12 t14 t14 t78 t8', which doesn't match the beginning of the string which starts with 't72 t9 ...'\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe NT77 is not the right path. Let me check if I made a mistake in interpreting the productions.\n\nWait, let me double-check the productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT49 \u2192 t12\nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\nNT31 \u2192 t14\nNT5 \u2192 t14\n\nSo, NT77 can't directly produce t72, which is the first token in the string. So, maybe I took the wrong production for S. S has only one production: S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nBut wait, how does the string start with t72? So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the entire string again.\n\nThe string is: `t72 t9 t75 t61 t79 t15 t30 t83 t65 t51 t79 t75 t68 t35 t69 t61 t68 t61 t83 t73 t88 t70 t15 t44 t24 t14 t8 t17 t42 t7 t74 t14 t29 t56 t13 t46 t54 t15 t65 t90 t69 t69 t35 t7 t63`\n\nLooking for 't72' anywhere. It's the very first token. So, the initial part of the string is 't72'. That suggests that either NT3 or NT77 in the expansion must directly or indirectly expand to 't72'. But according to the grammar, neither NT3 nor NT77 produce 't72'.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Maybe the string isn't the correct derivation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong starting point. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so S expands to NT3 NT77, which then each expand.\n\nBut the string starts with t72, which isn't produced by either NT3 or NT77. So, that would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar, hence the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but that seems too quick. Maybe I'm missing a leftmost derivation where NT3 or NT77 do produce t72 in some way.

{"custom_id":"request-878","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check against it. The string is all these tokens separated by spaces, so first thing is to parse it correctly. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is given in a list where each line is a production rule. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT3 NT77. So my job is to see if this string 't54 t75 t7 t18 t27 t71 t30 t30 t15 t15 t61 t68 t73 t10 t68 t68 t61 t8 t32 t73 t83 t18 t29 t16 t7 t83 t14 t56 t60 t17 t12 t29 t56 t35 t42 t7 t12 t46 t54 t9 t71 t72 t71 t30 t75 t87' can be generated by this grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can see several terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', so that's a terminal.\n\nThe string is a series of t followed by numbers, which are probably the non-terminals transformed into terminals. So each 't' followed by a number might be a terminal in the string. Wait, no, in the grammar, the non-terminals like NT3 go to terminals like 't17'. So each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers after them are specific to each production.\n\nSo, for example, NT3 is 't17', which means that when the parser is in NT3, it can only expand to 't17'. Similarly, NT8 is 't35', etc. So each non-terminal has exactly one production to a terminal.\n\nThis means that the grammar is essentially a right-linear grammar because all productions are of the form NT \u2192 terminal or NT \u2192 NT NT. But CNF allows productions of the form NT \u2192 NT NT, which are left- and right-branching, but not necessarily right-linear. Wait, no, CNF requires that each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, but in terms of derivations, it allows for any order as long as each step replaces non-terminals with one step.\n\nWait, but in this case, the grammar seems to have the non-terminals expanding into terminals directly, which would make each non-terminal a terminal in the end. Because each production like NT3 \u2192 't17' is a terminal, so the non-terminals NT3, NT8, etc., are all terminals. So the grammar is not a real grammar because it's producing terminals, making the language consist of all strings generated by replacing the non-terminals with their terminals.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's check each production:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' \u2013 so whenever we have NT3, it must become 't17'.\n\nSimilarly, NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22, but wait, NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54, NT54 \u2192 't9', etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals are further expanding into other non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\nNT8 \u2192 't69'\nNT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85\nNT5 \u2192 't14'\nNT85 \u2192 NT3 NT67\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT67 \u2192 't56'\n\nSo, let's take NT36. It can expand into NT17 NT79.\n\nNT17 becomes NT8 NT58. NT8 is 't69'. NT58 is NT5 NT85. NT5 is 't14'. NT85 is NT3 NT67. NT3 is 't17', NT67 is 't56'.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79\n\u2192 (NT8 NT58) NT79\n\u2192 (t69 NT58) NT79\n\u2192 t69 (NT5 NT85) NT79\n\u2192 t69 (t14 NT85) NT79\n\u2192 t69 t14 (NT3 NT67) NT79\n\u2192 t69 t14 (t17 NT67) NT79\n\u2192 t69 t14 t17 (t56) NT79\n\u2192 t69 t14 t17 t56 NT79\n\u2192 t69 t14 t17 t56 (NT37) (NT22)\nBecause NT79 is NT37 NT54, right?\n\nWait, no, NT79 is a production: in the given grammar, NT79 \u2192 't22' NT22 \u2013 wait, no, looking back, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, under the grammar, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT74 NT77\nNT79 \u2192 't69' NT22\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I think each line is a rule. Let me check:\n\nNT79 \u2192 't69' NT22 \u2013 no, that can\u2019t be right. Wait, in the list, it's written as 'NT79 -> 't69' NT22'\u2014so, actually, NT79 \u2192 't69' and NT22 as per some other rule.\n\nWait no, that can\u2019t be, because in Chomsky Normal Form, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, NT36 \u2192 't17' NT79 is possible, but that would mean NT36 expands to 't17' and NT79. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must have a single terminal or two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So a production like A \u2192 aB would be allowed in CNF.\n\nWait, actually, no, standard CNF is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So if a production has a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like 'aB', that's allowed if it's written as A \u2192 a B, right? So NT36 could be written as NT36 \u2192 NT17 NT79, but then NT17 and NT79 would have to have their own rules.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, for NT36, it's written as 'NT36 -> NT17 NT79'. Oh, wait, no, looking more carefully, the user wrote:\n\nNT36 -> NT17 NT79.\n\nSo that would be A \u2192 BC, which is correct for CNF. So each rule is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo the language generated by this grammar consists of strings where each non-terminal is replaced by either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. The process is a bit involved, so maybe I should build the parse tree for the given string.\n\nBut the given string is quite long, so perhaps I should look for a pattern. Each token in the string is a terminal, so I can map each token to the non-terminal it represents.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt54 t75 t7 t18 t27 t71 t30 t30 t15 t15 t61 t68 t73 t10 t68 t68 t61 t8 t32 t73 t83 t18 t29 t16 t7 t83 t14 t56 t60 t17 t12 t29 t56 t35 t42 t7 t12 t46 t54 t9 t71 t72 t71 t30 t75 t87\n\nEach t followed by a number is a terminal, so each tX is an abbreviation for a non-terminal that expands to X.\n\nNow, the first step is to see if each tX in the string can be found in the non-terminals and mapped correctly.\n\nFor example:\n\nt54: in the grammar, NT54 \u2192 't9' NT5 NT83.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see NT54 \u2192 't9' NT42, which is:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, here's what I find:\n\nAt the bottom, under NT54:\n\nNT54 -> 't9' NT42.\n\nWait, let me scan the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't...':\n\nThe user provided a long list, but looking through, for example, I see:\n\nNT49 -> 't74'\n\nNT44 -> 't60'\n\nNT74 -> 't75' \u2014 wait, let me check:\n\nIn the user's grammar list, the line is: NT74 -> 't3' NT67.

{"custom_id":"request-901","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is labeled with a number, either starting with 't' or a single digit like 't8', 't17', etc. The grammar has production rules that generate these tokens, and my job is to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is given with rules like S -> NT3 NT77, NT20 -> NT44 NT36, and so on. Each rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal (like S, NT3, NT20, etc.), and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals. Since it's in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. That's helpful because it means each step in a derivation replaces one non-terminal with two others, and the length of the string increases by one each time (since each production adds one token, considering that each non-terminal eventually becomes a terminal).\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's a series of terminals, not non-terminals. The string is `t13 t32 t13 t61 t17 t10 t69 t14 t73 t54 t50 t87 t13 t10 t27 t88 t69 t15 t75 t68 t17 t70 t32 t32 t42 t72 t16 t18 t78 t70 t61 t44 t27 t56 t71 t7 t9 t69 t51 t44 t24 t13 t18 t90 t46 t10 t69`. So each token is a terminal, which can be either a numerical string without 't' or a 't' followed by a number.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, some of the terminals correspond to non-terminals. For example, NT3 -> 't17', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT20 -> 't65'. So each non-terminal produces a specific terminal or combination of terminals. My approach should be to parse the string from the start symbol S, applying the grammar rules to expand S into a sequence of these terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step can only replace one non-terminal into two non-terminals, and the string grows in length each time. But the given string has a length of 42 tokens, so I need to see if that's possible through the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string. But with 42 tokens, it's going to be a long way. Perhaps I can write a recursive descent parser or use dynamic programming for this. But since this is a theoretical problem, I can outline the steps I would take rather than coding it.\n\nLet me try to map the given string tokens to the grammar's possible terminals. For example, the string starts with 't13', 't32', 't13', 't61'... Looking at the grammar rules, I can try to find which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nSo, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17' (so to get 't17', we need NT3)\n- NT37 -> 't70' and 't40' (so NT37 can produce 't70 t40')\n- Wait, no\u2014actually, the grammar rules for NT37 are: `NT37 -> NT83 NT54` and the terminals for NT83 and NT54 are 't44' and 't90', so NT37 produces 't44 t90', not 't70 t40'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Maybe I got some wrong. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT37 can produce `NT83 NT54`, and in the grammar, these are terminals: NT83 -> 't90' and NT54 -> 't90'? Wait no, let me check the rules carefully.\n\nActually, I need to map each non-terminal to its expansion. Let me list out the non-terminals and what they produce in the grammar:\n\nFrom the given grammar, non-terminals include NT1 to NT85, NT95, etc. Some of them expand into two non-terminals, others into terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT67 -> 't56'\n- NT49 -> 't74'\n- And so on.\n\nSo, any non-terminal that appears on the left side of a production will expand into two other parts. To parse the string, I'd start from S, which is NT3 NT77 (from S -> NT3 NT77). So, the start is S, which becomes NT3 NT77. Then, each of these can be replaced as per their rules.\n\nWait, let me correct that. S's production is S -> NT3 NT77. So starting with S, the first step is to replace S with NT3 NT77. Now, each NT3 and NT77 will be replaced in subsequent steps.\n\nLet me start breaking down the string:\n\nThe string is: t13 t32 t13 t61 t17 t10 t69 t14 t73 t54 t50 t87 t13 t10 t27 t88 t69 t15 t75 t68 t17 t70 t32 t32 t42 t72 t16 t18 t78 t70 t61 t44 t27 t56 t71 t7 t9 t69 t51 t44 t24 t13 t18 t90 t46 t10 t69.\n\nSo the string has 42 tokens. Starting with 't13', which corresponds to a non-terminal that produces 't13'. Looking at the grammar, let me see which non-terminals produce 't13'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT13: Wait, is there a NT13? Scanning the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals listed as having a production that ends with 't13'. The grammar has:\n\nLooking for productions that have a terminal 't13'. For example:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT37 -> 't44' and 't90' (since NT83 -> 't44' and NT54 -> 't90')\nWait, no, actually, according to the grammar rules, some are:\n\nNT15 -> 't73'\nNT44 -> 't68' (since NT22 and NT18 in the production for NT44, but both are non-terminals until they expand)\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to track possible expansion trees. Let's start with the entire string and see if it can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nBut given the length, perhaps I can look for possible matches at the beginning of the string.\n\nFirst token is 't13'. So, looking for a production that produces 't13' as a terminal. But scanning through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal with a production that directly produces 't13'. Hmm, does any NT produce 't13'? Let me check.\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal becomes 't13', but looking through the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't13'. Unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me scan through all the rules to see if any produce 't13':\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT25 -> 'nt... but the terminals in their productions are 't54', etc.\n- NT36 -> ... etc.\n\nLooking through all the terminals:\n\nWait, no NT directly produces 't13'. Because to get 't13' as a terminal, there must be a non-terminal NT13, but in the grammar, I don't see any production for NT13. So that's a problem. Wait, but in the string, the first token is 't13'. If no NT produces 't13', then the string cannot be generated by this grammar, right?\n\nWait, but looking back through the grammar rules, perhaps I missed one. Let me go through each production to see which terminals are present.\n\nLooking:\n\nEach production is either to a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking for any rule that has a terminal 't13'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't70' and 't48' (since NT74 -> 't75' and NT17 -> 't70' and maybe others).

{"custom_id":"request-898","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I remember that CNF has specific rules where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nThe grammar given starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which means the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. My task is to see if the provided string, which is a series of terminals, can be generated by this grammar. \n\nLooking at the string: `t79 t75 t69 t60 t42 t61 t54 t32 t17 t79 t69 t72 t35 t10 t35 t68 t75 t83 t29 t50 t22 t29 t13 t90 t68 t17 t35 t75 t27 t63 t50 t88 t29 t78 t10 t15 t8 t14 t70 t78 t12 t15 t15 t90 t87 t24 t71`.\n\nI notice that this string consists entirely of terminal symbols (like 't79', 't75', etc.), which makes sense because the grammar's rules end with terminals. So I need to work backwards from the string to see if I can derive it back to the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step either combines two symbols into a terminal or non-terminal. So I should check each symbol in the string to see if it can be derived from a non-terminal according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't79'. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT75 \u2192 't79'. So the first symbol 't79' comes from NT75. That's manageable. Next is 't75', which comes from NT75 as well, meaning NT75 must produce both 't79' and 't75'. In CNF, a non-terminal can have multiple productions, but each application can only produce one. But since the string has 't79' followed by 't75', I think that would require NT75 \u2192 't79' t75, but wait, in CNF, each production rule is a single production. Looking back, I see NT75 can produce 't79' or 't72' or 't63' etc., but not both. Hmm, that's a problem because 't75' would need to be somehow linked with NT75, but looking at the rules:\n\nWait, wait, the grammar has rules like NT75 -> 't79' and others. Let me check again: under NT75, the productions are NT75 \u2192 't79', NC? Wait, no: looking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT75, I see NT75 -> 't79' and others like 't17', 't65', etc. So NT75 can't go directly to 't75'. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the initial string has 't79 t75 t69 t60...', which suggests that the first symbols come from NT75, because NT75 \u2192 't79' and 't75'? Wait, but looking back at the rules, under NT75, I only see 't79' as a terminal production. Did I miss any? Let me search through all the NT75 rules:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT75 isn't the one; when I look, maybe other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me check the entire set of rules again.\n\nWait, I'm seeing a bunch of NT rules, and the only 't75' terminal is under NT72 or others. Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't75', I see in the list:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't70' but t75 is elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me search through each line for the terminal 't75'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n- NT75 \u2192 't79'\n- NT98 \u2192 't93'\n- NT58 \u2192 't54'\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's list all terminals:\n\nLooking at all the rules, the terminals are things like 't79', 't75', etc. So when the string starts with t79 t75...\n\nI think I need a better approach. Maybe I can represent the string as a series of steps starting from S. Let me try to build the parse tree from the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to see if the string can be divided into segments that correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\nt79 t75 t69 t60 t42 t61 t54 t32 t17 t79 t69 t72 t35 t10 t35 t68 t75 t83 t29 t50 t22 t29 t13 t90 t68 t17 t35 t75 t27 t63 t50 t88 t29 t78 t10 t15 t8 t14 t70 t78 t12 t15 t15 t90 t87 t24 t71\n\nFirst, the string starts with t79 t75. So perhaps the first two tokens are from NT75, since NT75 can go to 't79' and then something else. Wait, but in CNF, each production is a single rule, so in one step, a non-terminal can only become a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF, each production is a single rule, either to a single terminal or two non-terminals. So for example, if you have A \u2192 BC, then A can split into two non-terminals, B and C, which can then be terminals or further split.\n\nBut the string is t79 t75, which suggests that the first two symbols were generated by a production that splits into two terminals. But looking at the non-terminals, only rules like NTX \u2192 a produce a single terminal. There don't seem to be any non-terminals that split into two terminals, only two non-terminals.\n\nSo if the string starts with t79 and then t75, that's two terminals. That would require a production that splits into t75 and then something else. But unless there's a non-terminal that can split into t79 and t75, but looking through the rules, I see:\n\nFind a non-terminal that can produce t79 and t75. Looking for NT where NT \u2192 't79' and NT \u2192 't75' or some combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is generated by a series of splits. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe first token is t79. So the top-level symbol could have a production that starts with t79. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't79', but what else? Does any non-terminal produce t79 and something else? Wait, perhaps the first part of the string t79 t75 could come from a production of NT75 \u2192 't79' 't75'? But in the grammar, only single-terminals or two non-terminals. So for the first two symbols, we need a non-terminal that can split into t79 and t75. Looking up the rules, I don't see any non-terminal NT where NT \u2192 't79' 't75'. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps t75 is part of a longer production. For example, perhaps a non-terminal that can produce a sequence including t79 and t75. But I think it's more likely that the first two symbols couldn't form a production step because the grammar only allows single-terminals or splits into two non-terminals. Therefore, t79 t75 would have to come from two separate productions, which would require t79 from one non-terminal and t75 from another, but that seems unlikely because the string is a single sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial approach. Let's try to consider that each production step is a single split\u2014either into a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nSo, to generate the entire string, we can start from S. Let's see what S produces: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the initial split is two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. So both of these non-terminals need to be expanded further to produce the required string.\n\nLooking into the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' and 't6' (I think, but looking back: 'NT3 -> NT17 NT6', so it splits"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-919","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how Chomsky Normal Form works. CNF requires that each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The provided grammar fits this form since all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string given is: `t54 t83 t35 t27 t50 t32 t50 t22 t9 t73 t65 t71 t71 t32 t27 t70 t42 t18 t12 t10 t74 t54 t22 t90 t29 t50 t88 t35 t51 t29 t24 t14 t60 t65 t13 t71 t30 t90 t73 t63 t14 t70 t12 t79 t14 t46 t74 t35`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol S produces NT3 NT77. Each of these NTs can further produce other NTs or terminals. Some NTs produce terminals like 't14', 't17', 't35', etc. So each production either breaks down into more NTs or terminates with a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with `t54`, which I suspect comes from a production rule, and each next token is a terminal derived from some NT or non-NT.\n\nI'll need to model how the string is generated step by step. Let's see the grammar and the string tokens.\n\nFirst, the string has tokens like t54 which I see in the right-hand side of some rules, like NT26 \u2192 't44' or NT54 \u2192 't83'.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see NT54 \u2192 't83'. But in the string, I have t54, which appears at the start. Looking through the grammar, none of the nt productions directly produce t54 except perhaps NT54 \u2192 't83' and others. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t54 comes from a longer chain of productions. But let me check if any of the nt rules produce 't54'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, NT54 \u2192 't9', NT49 \u2192 't12', NT26 \u2192 't44' and 't37', NT75 \u2192 't79', etc. I don't see a production that directly gives t54. Wait, maybe I'm looking incorrectly.\n\nWait, in the list of grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48 (so that's not giving t54)\nNT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93\nNT26 \u2192 NT37 NT30 (t37 is 't71', t30 is 't54')\nYes, so NT26 \u2192 t71 and t54.\n\nLooking at the string, earlier tokens include t71 and t54. But the string starts with t54, not t71.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to work backwards or see how the string can be built step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string according to the grammar. Starting from the first symbol.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each production either splits into two non-terminals or terminates. So the string should have a binary expansion where each 'leaf' is a terminal.\n\nWait, the string is quite long, so tracking each step would be tedious. Maybe I can instead look for the structure of the string and see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nAnother thought is that each step in the derivation doubles the length of the string minus some, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, the string must be a leftmost derivation where each production either goes into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a tree and see if the tokens can be derived.\n\nLet me try to sketch the structure.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo S splits into NT3 and NT77. Then each of these can split further.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 (from the rules)\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 (rules given)\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50 (rules)\nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65 (rules)\nNT65 can split into multiple things, like 't9', 't46', or other NTs.\nWait, in the string, we have t9, t50, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT49 \u2192 't12', NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\nNT31 \u2192 NT37 NT22\nNT37 can split into 't71' or 't59', and so on.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should look for the sequence of symbols and see if each can be traced back to a production rule.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each symbol is either a non-terminal that leads to a terminal or a combination.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t54. Since t54 appears as a terminal in NT26, which is one of the non-terminals. So t54 must come from NT26. That means earlier in the derivation, one of the NTs must have produced NT26.\n\nSo the string starts with NT26.\n\nTherefore, somewhere in the derivation, we must have produced NT26, and then it expanded to 't54'.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is t54, so in the derivation tree, t54 must be the leftmost terminal generated by some non-terminal NT26.\n\nSo let's see: t54 is generated by NT26.\n\nNT26 can be derived from NT26 \u2192 NT37 NT30. So for t54, we would have NT37 \u2192 't71' and NT30 \u2192 't54', but the first symbol is t54, which doesn't match the leftmost production.\n\nAlternatively, there's another production for NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48.\n\nBut NT54 \u2192 't83', NT48 is 't93', which doesn't fit 't54'.\n\nSo which production of NT26 leads to t54? Looking at the grammar, the only way to get t54 is through NT30 \u2192 't54', but the production for NT30 is NT49 NT65.\n\nWait, NT30 can be derived from NT49 and NT65.\n\nWait, but t54 comes from NT26. So in the derivation, the NT26 must be the first to split into NT37 and NT30, and the NT30 must produce t54, while the NT37 must produce t71.\n\nSo the first part of the string would be t71 t54.\n\nBut the string starts with t54 t83..., not t71 t54.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when a non-terminal is a terminal, it ends there. For example, if NT26 directly produces t54, then the derivation would go S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 ... \u2192 t54. But looking at the grammar, I don't see NT26 \u2192 't54', only NT54 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nSo the only way to get t54 is through NT30.\n\nSo the starting point is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which becomes NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65, NT49 \u2192 something, and NT65 \u2192 something that can produce t54. \n\nBut NT65 can split into NT74 or other NTs.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t54, which would require that the leftmost NT26 is expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is longer and the beginning is t54 followed by other terms, which might be a consequence of multiple productions.\n\nThis seems confusing. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nAnother idea: in CNF, leftmost derivation builds the string by expanding the leftmost non-terminal each step. The string is effectively a sequence of terminals and non-terminals built in this way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed step by step by looking at each symbol and seeing how it can be generated.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this would take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the symbols in the grammar as they appear and see if there's a way to link them"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is a sequence of these 't' terms, which correspond to various terminals in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should parse the string and see if it fits the structure defined by the grammar. Let me write down the string step by step to understand its structure:\n\nThe string is: `t18 t74 t79 t22 t78 t22 t65 t14 t68 t54 t32 t72 t60 t9 t7 t35 t29 t46 t44 t44 t90 t75 t74 t60 t72 t32 t70 t69 t63 t60 t68 t74 t90 t63 t35 t51 t79 t73 t74 t29 t12 t17 t50 t44 t50 t78 t9 t24`\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.

So the start symbol must derive into two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT3 and NT77 definitions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\nNT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85\nNT5 \u2192 NT14\nNT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22\nNT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54\nNT83 \u2192 NT44 NT14\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n... and so on.\n\nWait, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can approach this by trying to find a parsing strategy, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but given the size of the string and the grammar, it might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps I can group the terms into pairs of NTs and see if they correspond to any grammar production.\n\nLet me try to split the string into the smallest possible units, grouping them into NTs, and see if they can match the grammar.\n\nWait, but each production is defined as either concatenating two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string is a series of terminals and non-terminals, but since the non-terminals ultimately derive into terminals, the entire string is a series of terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the parsing process would involve replacing non-terminals step by step until all are replaced by terminals. But since the string is given as all terminals, we need to see if it's a valid derivation.\n\nWait, the grammar has all non-terminals that eventually reduce to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 eventually terminal symbols. So each NT in the string can be thought of as a non-terminal that can derive into the given sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me list out each 't' term:\n\nt18, t74, t79, t22, t78, t22, t65, t14, t68, t54, t32, t72, t60, t9, t7, t35, t29, t46, t44, t44, t90, t75, t74, t60, t72, t32, t70, t69, t63, t60, t68, t74, t90, t63, t35, t51, t79, t73, t74, t29, t12, t17, t50, t44, t50, t78, t9, t24\n\nI need to see if this can be represented as a series of productions starting from S.\n\nGiven S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string should start with the expansions of NT3 and NT77, each of which starts with two NTs, recursively until the top-most productions (terminals) are reached.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps I can segment it into the structure S = [NT3] [NT77].\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's a bit challenging. Let's think about possible segments.\n\nStarting with the first few terms: t18 t74 t79 t22 t78 t22 t65...\n\nWait, but the NT77 production is NT3 and NT77, but wait no. Wait S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so S becomes NT3 NT77, and each of those must expand into sequences of NTs and terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see how to derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a parsing approach where I group the terms into the correct non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be represented as the concatenation of the expansions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's too time-consuming to trace every possible expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be split into sequences that match NT3 and NT77 derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the NT productions result in specific terminal sequences, and I can check if the string can be split accordingly.\n\nFor example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t69.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85.\n\nNT5 is NT14, which is NT37 NT22.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54.\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT44 NT14.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT78.\n\nNT18 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo expanding NT8 into terminals would yield t69, but NT58 would be NT5 NT85.

{"custom_id":"request-938","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string we're evaluating.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). From the production rules, it looks like each non-terminal (like S, NT20, etc.) can only produce pairs of other non-terminals. There are no terminals on the left side except in certain cases. I notice that some non-terminals eventually produce a single terminal (e.g., NT3 -> 't17', or NT22 -> 't78'), and some don't, like NT98 -> NT93 NT16 or NT65 -> NT77 NT2. The string we're evaluating has a bunch of terminals separated by spaces, like 't17 t79 t70...' which I assume is the sequence generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is quite long, so manually tracing through each production would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a way to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into chunks that fit the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S -> NT3 NT77. So S is the top symbol, and string starts with t17. Looking at NT3's production: NT3 -> NT17 NT6. But wait, NT3 is supposed to produce NT17 and NT6, but NT17 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT17's production: NT17 -> NT8 NT58, but NT8 is another non-terminal that eventually becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the NT3 production. Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me check the grammar again. Oh, no\u2014looking at the production rules, some may have been misread. Wait, let me check NT3 again. So, in the production rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nBut if NT3 is a non-terminal, then it's being split into NT17 and NT6. So the first part of the string is 't17', which might come from NT17 or another non-terminal that can derive to 't17'.\n\nLooking at NT17's production: NT17 -> NT8 NT58. And NT8 is a non-terminal that has a production NT8 -> NT30 NT50. Both NT30 and NT50 might eventually derive to 't's. For example, looking at NT30, some of its productions include NT30 -> t54, and others go deeper into NT30 -> t30. I might need to trace each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to start from the start symbol S and see how the string can be broken down.\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nSo the string should start with the concatenation of what NT3 produces and NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first four elements are 't17 t79 t70 t10', but since S is split into two parts, maybe the string is built by first generating part from NT3 and then from NT77.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string starting with the first part, which should correspond to NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, actually, since S -> NT3 NT77, the entire string must come from NT3 producing some sequence and NT77 producing another, concatenated together.\n\nSo the entire string is the concatenation of two parts: one from NT3 derivation and another from NT77 derivation.\n\nSo I can split the string into two parts, but I don't know how. Maybe the split happens where NT77 starts.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t79 t70 t10 t51 t17 t30 t15 t75 t27 t83 t46 t7 t65 t61 t70 t10 t18 t12 t70 t16 t9 t74 t13 t16 t70 t56 t14 t73 t16 t9 t50 t74 t87 t74 t18 t68 t16 t54 t32 t87 t30 t73 t8 t90 t56 t30 t17 t42.\n\nPerhaps the split is after 't79'? Let's see. But without knowing the exact split, I can try to see if the first part starts with 't17', which comes from NT3.\n\nLooking at NT3 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nSo the next thing after 't17' is what NT6 produces. Let me check NT6's productions. I see NT6 -> t63 and NT6 -> t6. So it could produce 't63' or 't6'.\n\nBut in the string, after 't17' comes 't79' and 't70', which don't seem to be 't6' or 't63'. So maybe NT3 doesn't derive directly via NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Wait, but the production for NT3 is fixed. Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the production. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT3 -> NT17 NT6, and NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT8 -> NT30 NT50, etc. So starting from NT3, the first element is 't17' which might come from NT17, and the next is 't79', which would come from NT6?\n\nWait, no\u2014NT6's production is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Looking again, I think I made an error earlier. Let's look at the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the grammar, I see that NT6 has the production NT6 -> 't63' or NT6 -> NT6. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Checking NT6, I see:\n\nNT6->t63, but also NT6->t6? Wait no. Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> t14\n\n- NT65 -> t46\n\n- NT26 -> t44\n\n- NT37 -> t40, t90, t17, etc.\n\nWait, but checking each non-terminal, I think I'm mixing up the rules. Maybe a better approach is to look for which terminals can come first.\n\nIn the grammar, only certain non-terminals have terminal productions. For example, looking through all the rules, some non-terminals like NT0, NT15, NT22 are defined by terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I can start by looking for the earliest terminal in the string and see if it matches any production. For example, the first terminal is 't17'.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can produce 't17':\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT3 -> 't17', NT17->'t17' (from NT93 -> ...). Wait, no: looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't17', yes: \"NT3 -> 't17'\". Similarly, looking for other non-terminals that produce 't17' elsewhere. Let's see:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\n\nBut I also see NT7 -> 't63', etc. So, the possible sources for 't17' are directly NT3 and NT17.\n\nBut since S -> NT3 NT77, the first part of the string is likely to be generated by NT3. So the first token would be 't17' from NT3. So that matches.\n\nNow, after 't17', what next? Let's see: the string is t17 t79 t70 t10...\n\nWait, after 't17', the grammar is NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So after 't17', come the elements from NT17 and NT6.\n\nWait, but in the string after t17 is t79, t70, t10. So perhaps the first part is more than one level deep.\n\nWait, let's think. S is NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo the string starts with something from NT3 and then from NT77.\n\nLet me attempt to split the string into two parts at the point where NT77 starts.\n\nLooking for the point where a production from NT77 would start.\n\nI see that NT77's production is NT68 NT44. So the string after the split would need to start with t68 t44..., but looking at the string, after the initial t17, the next terms are t79, t70, t10. Does t79 t70 t10 t51 t17... fit into NT77's production?\n\nAlternatively, maybe S's NT3 produces the first part, and NT77 produces the second.\n\nSo the overall string is the concatenation of NT3's expansion and NT77's expansion.\n\nLet me try to parse the string into two parts based on possible splits after NT3's expansion.\n\nBut this approach might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps I can work step by step, trying to construct the string from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-946","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal on the left, and on the right it's two non-terminals, or sometimes a terminal can be on the right in some forms, but perhaps in this case, all are non-terminals. Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules have the form NT followed by something else, like S -> NT3 NT77, and each NT production seems to break down into two other NTs until eventually, the non-terminals turn into terminals. The terminals are strings like 't17', 't8', etc. So the entire structure is that each rule represents a step towards replacing non-terminals with either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in this case, all the rules seem to be just two non-terminals, except some that have a terminal, like S and a few others. Wait, actually, no, looking closer, some rules have a terminal in the production, like NT74 -> 't65' NT93, which is a single non-terminal and a terminal, but in CNF, each rule should have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? No, wait, in standard CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So in this case, the production NT74 -> 't65' NT93 is correct because it's a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Similarly, there are other rules like NT58 -> NT5 't83', which are a non-terminal and a terminal. Okay, so that's okay.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of terminals: 't17 t7 t29 t46 t7 t79 t83 t32 t70 t73 t24 t44 t18 t8 t73 t71 t18 t18 t79 t10 t12 t14 t78 t13 t74 t30 t60 t69 t13 t12 t10 t30 t30 t69 t24 t15 t79 t88 t73 t17 t30 t46 t60 t87 t61 t54 t22 t50 t14'.\n\nSo my task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. The approach I need to take is probably to construct a parse tree or perform a backward or forward parsing. Alternatively, since the problem is binary\u2014yes or no\u2014I can check if any of the substring combinations fit into the rules until I reach the entire string.\n\nBut this could get messy. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single step from a non-terminal to two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So when building the string, each step must split a non-terminal into two parts, and the entire string must consist of leaves of these non-terminals expanding until they become terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to reconstruct the parse tree by splitting the string into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nThe string is: t17, t7, t29, t46, t7, t79, t83, t32, t70, t73, t24, t44, t18, t8, t73, t71, t18, 18, t79, t10, t12, t14, t78, t13, t74, t30, t60, t69, t13, t12, t10, t30, t30, t69, t24, t15, t79, t88, t73, t17, t30, t46, t60, t87, t61, t54, t22, t50, t14.\n\nI'll need to find a structure where each node in the parse tree can be broken down into two children which are either terminals or non-terminals that further split.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a top-down approach might be better, but that might take a lot of time. Alternatively, I can look for the top-level production S, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S needs to split into two parts: NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, the string should be split into two parts, and each part should correspond to NT3 and NT77 expansions.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t7 t29 t46 t7 t79 t83 t32 t70 t73 t24 t44 t18 t8 t73 t71 t18 t18 t79 t10 t12 t14 t78 t13 t74 t30 t60 t69 t13 t12 t10 t30 t30 t69 t24 t15 t79 t88 t73 t17 t30 t46 t60 t87 t61 t54 t22 t50 t14.\n\nI need to split the entire string into two parts, the first part expanding to NT3 and the second to NT77.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So the first part would need to expand to NT17 and then NT6, each producing terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So the second part should expand to NT68 and NT44.\n\nLet me try to split the string.\n\nLooking for the first part that can derive into NT3. NT3 is NT17 and NT6.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t17 t7 t29 t46 t7 t79 t83 t32 t70 t73 t24 t44 t18 t8 t73 t71 t18 18 t79 t10 t12 t14 t78 t13 t74 t30 t60 t69 t13 t12 t10 t30 t30 t69 t24 t15 t79 t88 t73 t17 t30 t46 t60 t87 t61 t54 t22 t50 t14.\n\nLooking at the first part: t17 t7 t29 t46 t7 t79 t83 t32 t70 t73 t24.\n\nWait, let me see. NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT17 is part of the first half, and NT6 is the second half. So the entire string must be broken into two, each of which is a split of NT17 and NT6.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be divided into the first part as t17 followed by something, and the second part as something that represents NT6.\n\nBut let's look at NT17. NT17 has a production: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So the first part must split into NT8 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t17 t7.\n\nT17 is part of NT17, which is split into NT8 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t17 is the start of NT17. Let me see, does NT17 split into two parts: the next symbols after t17 should be NT8 or something. Wait, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, so the first part is NT8, which is a non-terminal, and then NT58, which is another non-terminal.\n\nSo starting with t17, I expect the next symbols to correspond to NT8 and then NT58.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t7 t29... So if I take 't17' and then 't7', perhaps that corresponds to NT8 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what is NT8's production? Looking back, earlier:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. Hmm, so that's a non-terminal, not a terminal. Wait, but NT8 would have to split into two parts if I'm going that route.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me see the productions. Wait, in the grammar provided, the rules for NT8 are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nAlso, in the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't71' is a terminal, so 't71' is a terminal. Let me check: the list includes:\n\nLooking for NT8, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50: both non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to be structured with NT (non-terminal) symbols followed by numbers. The right-hand sides (RHS) of these productions are combinations of other NTs or literals like 't' followed by a number, which are probably terminals indicating the string's tokens.\n\nThe input string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so I need to see if these 't's match the terminals in the grammar. For example, in the grammar, certain NTs produce a specific 't' and a number. For instance, NT67 \u2192 't56', so the terminal is 't56' (assuming that 't' is a prefix and numbers are suffixed, but in this case, the string has 't9', 't30', etc., each combining 't' and a single digit, which might correspond to different terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking at the grammar, the terminals are like 't8', 't35', 't61', etc. So each terminal is in the form 'tX' where X is a number. The string provided has multiple 't's with numbers that correspond to these terminals.\n\nSo the first step is to map each 't' followed by a number in the string to the corresponding NT production that results in that terminal. For example, 't9' probably comes from NT67 \u2192 't56'\u2014no, wait, let me check the grammar rules. \n\nLooking through the grammar, the left-hand sides (LHS) and RHS have productions that result in various terminals.

For instance, the first 't9' would correspond to an NT that produces 't9', but looking through the grammar, none of the productions lead directly to 't9'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake because the 'tX' are each one digit, but in the grammar, some RHS are longer. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17' followed by another NT, so 't17' is a terminal followed by another NT.\n\nBut in the string, each element is a single 't' followed by one digit, so I think each 'tX' is a distinct terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: each token is 't' followed by a number. So each token corresponds to a terminal symbol, which in the grammar is a production where the RHS ends with a terminal of the form 'tX'.\n\nSo each token in the string is a terminal, and I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT77, proceeding through a series of productions.\n\nEach NT in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar that results in that 'tX' terminal.\n\nSo let's list all the 'tX' terms in the string and see if each is present in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the string: \n\n- t9: is there an NT that directly produces 't9'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't9'. Maybe it's from a longer production. For example, NT74 \u2192 't75' would give 't75', so that's not it. Wait, in the grammar, the only NT that directly produces a terminal is when it's on the RHS with a terminal. So for example, NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54; NT83 produces 't51' as per the grammar, so NT83 \u2192 't51'. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 't83' and 't50'. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I might need to trace down the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each 'tX' corresponds to an NT production that can reach that token through a series of steps.\n\nWait, I think the approach should be to model the string as a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to an NT, and check whether the entire sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nBut given that the grammar is CNF, the parse would be a binary tree, with each node being a production that results in the combined terminals or non-terminals. However, since we can't visualize the tree, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse table using the grammar and see if the string can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is whether the string is generated by the grammar, perhaps we can check the number of symbols. Each production in CNF either replaces a non-terminal with two symbols or a terminal. But the string seems quite long, with each token being separate. However, the problem is that each token in the string is a single terminal, which may require that each terminal in the string comes from a direct production step, and when two non-terminals are derived, they may each have their own sequence.\n\nThis could get complicated, but perhaps I can start by seeing if each 'tX' in the string is present in the list of terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n NT67 \u2192 't56'\n NT65 \u2192 't46'\n NT54 \u2192 't83'\n NT79 \u2192 't72'\n NT93 \u2192 't54'\n NT74 \u2192 't75'\n NT26 \u2192 't54'\n NT49 \u2192 't12'\n NT36 \u2192 't50'\n NT22 \u2192 't71'\n NT31 \u2192 't14'\n NT36 \u2192 't50'\n NT74 \u2192 't15'\n NT79 \u2192 't69'\n NT54 \u2192 't83'\n NT22 \u2192 't87'\n NT44 \u2192 't68'\n NT2 \u2192 't69'\n NT74 \u2192 't60'\n NT22 \u2192 't78'\n NT2 \u2192 't22'\n NT83 \u2192 't51'\n NT77 \u2192 't32'\n NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is useful because it simplifies parsing by having productions that are either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nThe strategy I'll use is to attempt a top-down parsing of the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can structure the parsing in a way that each step reduces a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the non-terminals. They are: S, NT20, NT68, NT25, NT59, NT85, NT44, NT16, NT39, NT14, NT3, NT18, NT36, NT44, NT37, NT65, NT85, NT65, NT98, NT58, NT36, NT77, NT74, NT83, NT8, NT65, NT98, NT74, NT82, NT21, NT25, NT54, NT82, NT79, NT71, NT37, NT37, NT37, NT82, NT79, NT15, NT23, NT54, NT54, NT82, NT67, NT26, NT48, NT26, NT37, NT67, NT26, NT15, NT83, NT12, NT75, NT49, NT65, NT74, NT54, NT18, NT74, NT22, NT2, NT74, NT79, NT6, NT79, NT58, NT22, NT44, NT5, NT71, NT23, NT23, NT18.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Actually, the non-terminals are all the NT... and the terminals are t followed by a number or perhaps some letters, but looking at the productions, it seems that the terminals are 't' followed by numbers.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt35 t68 t16 t17 t78 t15 t18 t73 t83 t60 t72 t13 t73 t12 t75 t63 t72 t8 t88 t69 t42 t74 t14 t29 t32 t60 t27 t54 t51 t74 t68 t87 t51 t61 t78 t73 t72 t7 t44 t14 t46 t9 t87 t9 t32 t61 t70 t68 t10 t75.\n\nI'll start with the start symbol S, which according to the grammar, is S -> NT3 NT77. So, the top-level production is S = NT3 and NT77.\n\nNow, I'll parse the string starting from S.\n\nFirst, check NT3 and NT77. Look for their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 has two productions:\n1. NT3 -> NT17 NT6\n2. NT3 -> NT67 NT54\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user provided a lot of productions, but for NT3, the productions are:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT3 -> NT67 NT54\n\nSo, NT3 can produce either of these two pairs.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 is produced by multiple rules. From the grammar:\n\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44\nAlso, looking back, I see NT77: NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Wait, is there another rule for NT77? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\nNT77: NT68 NT44\n\nSimilarly, other Nts also go to multiple non-terminals. \n\nTo parse the string, I'll need to choose the right production for each non-terminal as I go, matching the string token by token.\n\nLet me list all the tokens in order to keep track:\n\n1. t35\n2. t68\n3. t16\n4. t17\n5. t78\n6. t15\n7. t18\n8. t73\n9. t83\n10. t60\n11. t72\n12. t13\n13. t73\n14. t12\n15. t75\n16. t63\n17. t72\n18. t8\n19. t88\n20. t69\n21. t42\n22. t74\n23. t14\n24. t29\n25. t32\n26. t60\n27. t27\n28. t54\n29. t51\n30. t74\n31. t68\n32. t87\n33. t51\n34. t61\n35. t78\n36. t73\n37. t72\n38. t7\n39. t44\n40. t14\n41. t46\n42. t9\n43. t87\n44. t9\n45. t32\n46. t61\n47. t70\n48. t68\n49. t10\n50. t75\n\nNow, starting from S, which is NT3 and NT77. Let's assign the first two tokens to NT3 and NT77.\n\nToken 1: t35 is passed to NT3, which needs to be built. Looking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3->NT17 NT6 or NT3->NT67 NT54.\n\nWe need to see which can produce t35. Let's check the productions for NT17 and NT6, and NT67 and NT54.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17: NT17->NT8 NT58 (No t)\n- NT6: NT6->t63\n- NT67: NT67->t82 NT44\n- NT54: NT54->t83 NT NT... (Wait, NT54->t82 NT98, and so on?)\n\nWait, no. Let me check all the rules for each NT:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6: NT6->t63\n- NT67: NT67->t82 NT44\n- NT54: Let me check. Looking for NT54:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT54 is derived from:\n\nLooking back, I don't see a production for NT54. Wait, perhaps I missed it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser approach, but it might get too involved.\n\nAnother approach: Use the leftmost derivation, step by step, trying to match the string tokens.\n\nStarting with S = NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the first two tokens should be matched by NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the NT3's possible first tokens: if NT3 produces NT17 NT6, the first terminal would be the first symbol of NT17, which is 't8' (looking through the rules, NT17->NT8..., and NT8->t69, etc.). Alternatively, if NT3->NT67 NT54, then the first terminal is 't82' from NT67.\n\nBut the string starts with t35, so neither options would produce t35. So perhaps S cannot derive t35 as the first token. Therefore, perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the string starts with t35. So the first non-terminal to start with is S -> NT3 NT77, but neither of NT3's productions start with t35. \n\nSo, this suggests that the string cannot be generated because the first two tokens don't correspond to the productions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the productions.\n\nWait, let me check if NT3 can produce a sequence that includes t35.\n\nLooking for NT3's possible productions, as mentioned before:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-10","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t17 t32\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar first. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, to generate the string, the parser will start from S and apply the productions step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string to check is \"t17 t32\". This looks like two terminals, t17 and t32, separated by a space. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should produce two terminals, so the entire string should consist of two terminal symbols.\n\nLet me begin by expanding S. According to the rules, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the first thing generated is NT3 and NT77. Now, I need to see if both of these can produce 't17' and 't32' respectively.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, to get 't17', NT17 must produce 't17' directly. Let me check NT17's production. Oh, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. Then, NT8 \u2192 't69'? Wait, no, looking at NT8's production, NT8 \u2192 't35'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.\n\nWait, let me clarify. NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 't35' and also NT8 can split into other non-terminals, but in this case, it's more straightforward if one of the productions leads directly to 't17' or 't32'. Wait, no, wait. Looking back, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So to have NT3 produce 't17', NT17 must directly produce 't17'. Let me check: NT17's productions are NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 and NT17 \u2192 't70'. So, one of the paths for NT17 is to produce 't70', which doesn't help because we need 't17'. Alternatively, could it go through NT8?\n\nWait, NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 't35'. That's not helpful. So, perhaps NT17 cannot directly produce 't17'. So, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the NT hierarchy. Let me look more carefully:\n\nLooking for where 't17' appears, I see in the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n\nWait, so the only direct way to get a 't' from NT17 is 't70'. So, that's not 't17'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, where else is 't17' appearing? Oh, I see NT70 \u2192 't7'. So that's different. Let me check for 't17' in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the end productions, which are NT followed by a terminal, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'? Let me check the list again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines like NT17 \u2192 't70' and others, but I don't see an NT17 connecting directly to 't17'. Wait, no: Looking at the very end, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'? Wait, no, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT production directly producing 't17', except maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me scan the entire grammar for any terminal 't17' in the productions. Looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17' ?\n\nWait, no, I don't see that. Hmm, wait in the provided grammar, there's a line: NT17 \u2192 't70'. That's the production for NT17. So, I don't see an NT17 leading to 't17'. Similarly, NT6 appears in NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo, perhaps 't17' is produced by NT17, but the grammar doesn't allow that. Wait, perhaps my understanding is incorrect. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grammar. Let me look again:\n\nWait, line by line:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT67? Or is that a typo. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nAt the very beginning: S -> NT3 NT77\n\nThen many rules, for example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nWait, yes. So, NT3's production is NT17 NT6. If that's the case, then to get 't17', the NT17 must somehow produce 't17'. But looking at NT17, its productions are:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n\nSo, cannot produce 't17' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding where 't17' appears. Let me check all the end productions:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' ?\n\nNo, looking through all the provided end productions (those ending with a terminal), here are the relevant ones:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't74'\n- NT65 \u2192 't88'\n- NT49 \u2192 't74'\n- NT65 \u2192 't46'\n- NT95 \u2192 't61'\n- NT93 \u2192 't54'\n- NT54 \u2192 't83'\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n- NT8 \u2192 't69'\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n- NT22 \u2192 't78'\n- NT23 \u2192 't29'\n- NT54 \u2192 't8'\n- NT74 \u2192 't60'\n- NT22 \u2192 't44'\n- NT83 \u2192 't51'\n- NT77 \u2192 't30'\n- NT6 \u2192 't63'\n- NT79 \u2192 't72'\n- NT58 \u2192 't54'\n- NT22 \u2192 't87'\n- NT44 \u2192 't68'\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't10'\n- NT15 \u2192 't44'\n- NT23 \u2192 't18'\n\nWait, I notice that 't17' and 't32' aren't directly produced by any NT production. Only 't70' and 't69' from NT17 and NT8 respectively. So, this means that the grammar doesn't produce 't17' at all, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again for any NT production leading to 't17' or 't32'.\n\nLooking through all the end productions, I don't see any 't17' or 't32' being produced. So, that suggests that the string 't17 t32' can't be generated by this grammar, because it's unable to produce 't17' in the first place.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in another part. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the first step is to expand both NT3 and NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT6 appears in the productions as NT6 \u2192 some things, but not to terminals directly. Looking at the grammar, NT6's productions are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT50 NT33\n\nSo, that's a two-step production. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, which leads to terminal 't70'.\n\nThis suggests that NT3 cannot produce any terminal other than combinations that go into longer chains, not directly to 't17' or 't32'.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string 't17 t32' cannot be generated by this grammar because the grammar doesn't have any production rules that directly produce 't17' or 't32' as terminals. Instead, any terminal in the string must come from productions that lead to them, and since there are none, the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-11","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string `t17 t30` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it consists of multiple productions where each non-terminal on the left produces two other non-terminals on the right. Some of these productions eventually lead to terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers). My goal is to see if I can derive the string `t17 t30` starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT77 (S -> NT3 NT77). So I need to see how NT3 and NT77 can be expanded.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Expanding NT3 NT77:\n   - NT3 goes to NT17 NT6 (see rule NT3 -> NT17 NT6).\n   - NT77 goes to NT44 NT37 (rule NT77 -> NT44 NT37).\n\nSo, the string becomes NT17 NT6 NT44 NT37. Now, I need to expand these non-terminals.\n\n2. Expanding NT17:\n   - NT17 -> NT8 NT58 (rule NT17 -> NT8 NT58).\n   - NT8 -> NT30 NT50 (rule NT8 -> NT30 NT50).\n   - So, NT17 can expand to NT8 NT58, which then becomes NT30 NT50 NT58.\n\n3. Expanding NT6:\n   - NT6 -> 't63' (rule NT6 -> 't63'), so it's a terminal and remains as 't63'.\n\n4. Expanding NT44:\n   - NT44 -> NT22 NT18 (rule NT44 -> NT22 NT18).\n   - NT22 -> NT71 NT2 (rule NT22 -> NT71 NT2).\n   - NT71 -> NT70 NT39 (rule NT71 -> NT70 NT39).\n   - NT70 -> NT78 NT44 (rule NT70 -> NT78 NT44).\n     - NT78 -> 't7' (rule NT78 -> 't7').\n     - NT44 -> NT22 NT18 (as above, which eventually becomes 't42' via NT22 -> 't22' and NT18 -> 't8', but wait, maybe that's not needed here.\n   Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should see if there's a simpler path.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the target string: `t17 t30`.\n\nSo, the expansion should result in two terminals: first 't17' and then 't30'. Alternatively, if 't17' is the first part, the production is `t17 t30`. But wait, in the grammar, some of the productions for NTs directly go to terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT3 -> 't17' rule? Wait, no. Let me check. Yes, rule NT3 -> 't17' is there. So if NT3 expands directly to 't17', that's good. Then, I need NT77 to expand to 't30' or something that can produce 't30' when combined. But wait, when I look at NT77, it's expanded to NT44 NT37. Wait, maybe I should check how NT44 and NT37 can produce the second 't30'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need a different path. Let me think again.\n\nStarting from S -> NT3 NT77. If NT3 can expand to 't17', then NT77 needs to expand to 't30', but is that possible?\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT77: NT77 -> NT44 NT37. So NT44 and NT37. Let's see how those can produce.\n\nNT44 can expand in several ways. One of them is NT44 -> NT22 NT18. Then NT22 -> NT71 NT2. NT71 -> NT70 NT39. NT70 -> NT78 NT44. NT78 is 't7', and NT44 again, which would loop. This doesn't seem promising for getting 't30'.\n\nAnother path for NT44: NT44 -> NT37 NT25. NT37 can expand to NT83 NT54, and so on. Wait, maybe I'm going off track. Alternatively, perhaps NT77 can expand differently.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps there's a different way to expand NT77. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. The production for NT44 is:\n\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18 (also other rules like NT44 -> NT37 NT25 etc.). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm not seeing the simplest path. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string we need is `t17 t30`. So, the initial S produces NT3 NT77, which needs to expand to 't17' and 't30'.\n\nSo, NT3 must produce 't17', which it does (NT3 -> 't17').\n\nThen, NT77 must produce 't30'. So, can NT77 be expanded to 't30'?\n\nNT77's production is NT44 NT37. So, perhaps NT44 and NT37 together can generate 't30'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see if there's a way to get 't30' from NT77.\n\nWait, let me see if any NT leads to 't30'. Looking through the rules, I see NT18 -> 't8', NT74 -> 't15', NT36 -> 't50' (rule NT36 -> NT17 NT79; but NT17 is 't17' and NT79 is 't72', which combined makes 't17 t72', which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace a possible expansion:\n\nStarting with S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nNT3 -> 't17' (so the string starts with 't17').\n\nThen NT77 -> NT44 NT37.\n\nSo now the string is 't17' followed by whatever NT44 and NT37 produce, which must together produce 't30'.\n\nWait, but NT44 and NT37 need to produce two terminals: the next in the string is 't30', so perhaps a production that combines into 't30'.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT30 is derived from NT18 via NT18 -> NT68 NT82, then NT68 -> NT44 NT25, etc. Wait, maybe that's getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT30 can be a terminal on its own? Let me check. Looking at the grammar, I see NT30 -> 't54' (rule NT30 -> 't54')... no. Wait, not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering the chain of expansions correctly. Let's take it step by step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77.\n\nNT3 -> 't17'.\n\nNT77 -> NT44 NT37.\n\nSo now, the string is 't17' followed by the expansion of NT44 and NT37.\n\nWe need NT44 and NT37 to expand into 't30'. But since they are in concatenation, the first non-terminal (NT44) will produce the first terminal, and the second (NT37) the next. So, the entire expansion would be [NT44 produces 't'?] [NT37 produces 't30'?].\n\nSo, let's see if NT44 can produce a terminal 't...' that starts with the next letter in the string, which is '30'.\n\nWait, that's not quite clear. Alternatively, perhaps NT44 produces a terminal and NT37 produces another, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a production that leads directly from NT77 to 't30', but I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should check if 't30' can be produced by any NT directly.\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT30 -> 't54' (rule NT30 -> 't54').\n\nNo, that doesn't help. Wait, is NT30 on any other production? Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see that 't's are only on the right-hand side as single terminals. So, any derivation must go through NTs that eventually reach a 't' and a non-terminal that produces another 't'.\n\nWait, but the string is 't17 t30', which is two 't's with numbers. So, in the entire derivation, I need to have two 't's produced, each expanding from their respective non-terminals.\n\nLet me retrace:\n\n1."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-22","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the string `t70 t63 t32` is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the approach here is to see if we can break down the string step by step using the productions.\n\nFirst, let's look at each token in the string: `t70`, `t63`, `t32`. I'll need to see which productions correspond to each of these.\n\nStarting with `t70`. I'll scan the productions and find where `T70` is on the left side. Looking through the NT rules, I see NT70 -> NT74 NT26. Then, I check if the right-hand side of that production can produce `t70`. Wait, no, the terminals are on the right when the non-terminal expands. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, the non-terminals are on the left, and the right-hand side can be either a terminal or another non-terminal. So for `t70`, I need to see which production results in `t70` when expanded.\n\nLooking for `t70`, I see in the NT rules, NT70 -> NT74 NT26. But that's not a terminal yet. So I need to see what NT74 and NT26 produce.\n\nLooking at NT74: it has multiple productions. One is NT74 -> NT74 NT77 and another is NT74 -> NT23 NT16. Wait, but that's recursive. So maybe another production for NT74 leads to terminals or other non-terminals that eventually lead to `t74` or other terms.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production where the non-terminal directly produces `t70`. Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see any NT directly producing `t70`. So maybe I have to find a chain of productions that can lead to `t70`.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, S starts as S -> NT3 NT77. So S can be broken into NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT3 productions: NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Then NT17 is produced by NT8 -> t70? Wait, wait, let's look for NT17.\n\nWait, looking at the NT rules, NT17 -> NT8. So NT17 can produce NT8, and then NT8 can produce 't35' or other non-terminals. Wait, no:\n\nLooking again, NT8 -> 't8' or NT26? Wait, no, the productions for NT8: actually, no. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the productions listed include NT83 -> 't54' and other rules. Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nLet's start by looking for which non-terminals can produce `t70`.\n\nChecking the NT70 production: NT70 is -> NT74 NT26.\n\nSo NT70 can be replaced by NT74 NT26. Then, each of these can be expanded further.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT74. The productions for NT74 include:\n\n- NT74 -> NT23 NT16\n\n- NT74 -> NT74 NT77\n\n- NT74 -> NT51 NT93\n\n- NT74 -> NT49 NT54\n\nSo let's see if any of these can lead to `t74` or another terminal.\n\nLooking at NT74 again: NT74 can be `t75` via NT74 -> NT75 NT21 and then NT75 -> 't79', which isn't helpful. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's build the parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nSince the string is `t70 t63 t32`, maybe starting from the root S, which can be NT3 and NT77.\n\nLet\u2019s try to see how these can lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nFirst, NT3. Looking at NT3 productions: NT3 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nSo if I expand NT3 to NT17 NT6, then each of these can expand further.\n\nLooking at NT17: the productions are NT17 -> NT8 -> 't8' and NT17 -> NT8 -> etc. Wait, no, NT17 -> NT8 and then NT8 has some productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT8: the productions include NT8 -> 't8' (so that would be 't8'), but also NT8 -> NT74 (but I'm not sure about that. Wait, wait, I need to check the productions for NT8.\n\nWait, the production NT8: wait, looking at the list, I don't see NT8 as a non-terminal; maybe I mixed up the indices. Or perhaps I need to look for which non-terminals have 't8' as a production.\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT82 -> 't20'? Or maybe I'm getting the labels wrong. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the labels with the non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, I think I'm mixing up the non-terminals and the terminals. In the given grammar, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, and each non-terminal is represented as NT followed by a number. But in the given list, some non-terminals are immediately replaced by terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> 't73'\n\n- NT37 -> NT83 NT54\n\n- NT17 -> NT8 -> 't8'? Wait, no, looking again, NT17's productions are:\n\nWait, the grammar seems to list each production as NT followed by other symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals. Wait, in the list, some are just terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't73', which means NT15 directly produces the terminal 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, NT83 -> 't51'. So in that case, to produce 't70', I need to find a non-terminal that can expand into 't70'.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT directly producing 't70'. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check each non-terminal and see if any of their productions result in 't70'.\n\nFor example, NT70 is defined as NT74 NT26. So NT74 and NT26 need to expand into something that ends up as 't70'.\n\nLet me see. NT26: looking at the productions, NT26 appears several times. For example, NT26 can be NT5 NT48 or NT37 NT30, etc. So maybe NT26 can lead to some terminals that, when combined, can produce 't70'.\n\nWait, but again, perhaps 't70' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. So maybe the string `t70 t63 t32` isn't possible because none of the non-terminals directly produce these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each part of the string.\n\nFor `t70`, if it's not produced directly, maybe it's built from a combination. Let's consider NT70: so NT70 must be a non-terminal that can be expanded into NT74 and NT26, but to get 't70' as a terminal, both NT74 and NT26 would have to be 't70' as well, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe `t70` can be derived from a chain of productions. For example, NT70 -> NT74 NT26. Then, suppose NT74 can produce 't70' and NT26 produces a 't70', but looking at the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't70'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT74 has a production NT74 -> NT23 NT16, and also NT74 -> NT51 NT93, and others that might lead to terminals.\n\nWait, but none of these seem to directly produce 't70'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all non-terminals that can derive 't70'. Let's see: Maybe NT70 is derived from somewhere else.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals have 't70' in their productions: I see NT74 -> 't75' via NT74 -> NT75 NT21, and NT75 is 't79'. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the start symbol.\n\nGiven that the string is `t70 t63 t32`, let's see if we can parse it.\n\nAssume S is NT3 NT77, as S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nEach `t70` is in position 1, `t63` in position 2, and `t32` in position 3.\n\nSo we need to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because we can use methods like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing, but since I'm not coding, I'll try to analyze the string against the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t35 t54 t63 t30\". It looks like it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal. From the grammar, I can see that certain symbols like 't35', 't54', etc., are terminals. So, I need to check if each of these terminals in the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is the start symbol, which produces NT3 NT377. Wait, the right-hand side seems a bit off because NT377 is not present in the rules I see. Wait, the initial grammar is written as S \u2192 NT3 NT77.

Hmm, first, I should probably look at the grammar rules to see how the string can be formed. \n\nLet me see, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first step is NT3 and NT77. Looking at NT3, according to the rules, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Now, NT17 is another non-terminal. Checking NT17, it can be either NT8 NT58 or NT8 NT58 (wait, I see NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58). So NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT8 is another non-terminal, which according to the rules, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. \n\nLet me check NT30 \u2192 t54, because I see NT30 \u2192 t54 in the grammar. So NT8 \u2192 t54 t50. Now, NT58 \u2192 t8. So NT17 \u2192 t8 t58. Wait, no, NT58 is a terminal 't58' or maybe another rule? Wait, looking back, NT58 \u2192 NT54, and NT54 has multiple rules, including some that become terminals. Hmm, or perhaps I need to follow the rules more carefully. \n\nWait, the string we're checking is \"t69 t54 t63 t32\". Let me parse each token step by step. \n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must be split into two parts: first part derived from NT3, second from NT77. The given string is four tokens, so each non-terminal should produce two parts, but maybe overlapping? Wait, no, the string is four tokens, so each non-terminal must generate two parts, but perhaps the tokens interleave. Hmm, maybe I should consider a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for how each token in the string can be derived. Let's see:\n\nLooking at \"t69\". So where can t69 come from? Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT74 \u2192 t75 and NT22 \u2192 t78, but not t69. Wait, NT74 \u2192 NT22, then NT22 \u2192 t78, so perhaps that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rules.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. Oh, wait, I see NT74 \u2192 t75 and NT22 \u2192 t78, but nothing directly gives t69. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps t69 is from NT26. Looking at NT26's rules: NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48, and NT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93, then NT18 \u2192 t8, NT93 \u2192 t54, so that would give NT26 \u2192 t8 t54, right? Wait, that's \"t8 t54\". So \"t8 t54\" is a possible string from NT26.\n\nBut the string has \"t69\" at the beginning. Hmm, so perhaps another path. Let's see, maybe the first part of the string comes from NT3, leading to t69, but I'm not seeing where t69 comes from. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking again, does any non-terminal derive to t69? Let me check the rules. I see NT26 \u2192 t5 NT48 (which further goes to t8 and t54), but nothing directly has t69. Wait, does NT51 \u2192 t27, or something else? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to break down the string step by step. The string is \"t69 t54 t63 t32\".\n\nStarting with the entire string, maybe it's the result of S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So we need to see if \"t69\" comes from NT3 and \"t54\" from NT77. Wait, but the string is four tokens, so maybe each NT3 and NT77 produce two tokens each that interleave. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is split into parts where the first NT3 produces the first part, and NT77 the second. Let's try that.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 can derive to something that gives t69. Looking at NT17's rules: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, which as before gives t54 and t50, but t50 isn't in the string. Alternatively, wait, no: NT8 could be NT30 and NT50. NT30 \u2192 t54, and NT50 \u2192 t24. But the string has t69 first, which isn't t54. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each token in the string against the possible derivations.\n\nt69: Looking through the rules, does any NT produce t69? Let's see:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 t61\n- NT93 \u2192 t54 \u2192 no\n- NT54 \u2192 t83, but that's further down\n- NT67 \u2192 t56\n- NT74 \u2192 t75\n- NT5 \u2192 t14\n- NT71 \u2192 t10\n- NT8 \u2192 t69. Wait, look at the rules: NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. But then, when does NT8 result in t69? Wait, no, looking back, I see a rule for NT8: NT8 \u2192 t69. Yes! Wait, let me check the grammar. Looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I think I missed that earlier. Oh, yes! NT8's rule includes NT8 \u2192 t69. So NT8 can directly produce \"t69\". That's a key point.\n\nOkay, so S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Let's see if \"t69\" can come from NT3.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So NT8 \u2192 t69, and then NT58 \u2192 t58. Wait, but the string has \"t69\" as the first token, then \"t54\". So if NT8 produces \"t69\", and then NT17 needs to produce another token. But wait, NT17's second part is NT58, which is a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't58', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t69 t54 t63 t32\". So after \"t69\", the next is \"t54\". Let's see where \"t54\" comes from. Looking at the grammar, \"t54\" can come from NT54. So NT54's rules include NT54 \u2192 t83, NT54 \u2192 t9, etc. So, perhaps the second part of NT3 is NT6, which can derive to something.\n\nWait, NT6 \u2192 't63'. Yes, in the rules: NT6 \u2192 t63. So, in NT3's derivation: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, if NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT8 \u2192 t69, NT58 \u2192 t58, then NT17 would derive to \"t69 t58\". But in the string, after \"t69\", it's \"t54\". Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's think again: the string is \"t69 t54 t63 t32\". So four tokens. Let's see if each pair comes from NT3 and NT77.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so NT3 should derive the first two tokens, and NT77 the next two. But let's check:\n\nIf NT3 \u2192 t69 t63, then NT77 would have to derive t54 t32.\n\nWait, but let's see NT77's rules: looking for terminals. NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, etc. Wait, maybe that's too long. Alternatively, perhaps NT77 \u2192 t77. Wait, looking back, in the rules, do any non-terminals directly produce t77? Let me check: I see NT77 \u2192 t32, but I think that's not the case. Wait, no, looking for 't' tokens.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, I see some NTs convert to 't' tokens:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't58'\n- NT36 \u2192 't50'\n- NT26 \u2192 't29' and 't5'\n- NT54 \u2192 't9', but there's another rule: NT54 \u2192 't8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-53","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t17 t74 t14 t14 t68` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not entirely familiar with that. Maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S produces NT3 and NT77. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with either of these.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t74 t14 t14 t68.\n\nI notice that t17 is present as the first token. Let me check the grammar to see if NT3 can derive 't17'. Looking through the production rules, I see that NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Then, NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT58 -> 't8'. NT6 also has production rules, but I'm not sure if it leads to 't63' or anything else. Wait, the production for NT6 is 't63'. So, maybe NT3 can produce t17 via the chain NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Then NT17 produces t8, so maybe that's possible. But that would give us t8, not t17. Hmm, wait, no\u2014the NT3 production is NT3 -> NT17 NT6, but NT17 can produce 't8'. So if NT17 is used to generate 't8', then NT3 might produce t8 and t63, but I'm not sure how that connects to t17. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT3 has a production to 't17' directly? Let me check the production rules. Oh, yes, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\n\nSo, that's straightforward. So, the first token is t17, which can be derived directly by NT3. So starting with NT3.\n\nNext, the string starts with t17, which we get from NT3, so now the remaining part is t74 t14 t14 t68.\n\nNow, looking at the production rules, S -> NT3 NT77. Since we already used NT3 to produce t17, we need to produce the remaining part from NT77.\n\nSo, the remainder is t74 t14 t14 t68. Let's see what NT77 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT77 -> NT68 NT44. So, NT77 can split into nt68 and nt44.\n\nSo, we have t74 coming next. Let me check if NT68 can produce t74. NT68 has a production NT68 -> NT77 NT2. But wait, NT77 can produce t68? Looking at the rules: NT77 -> NT68 NT44, but then NT68 -> NT77 NT2. That seems recursive, but looking more closely, NT68 also has a production NT68 -> 't82' via NT68 -> NT79 NT22, which then NT79 -> 't69' and NT22 -> 't71', but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should look directly for any NT that can derive 't74'. Let's check all the production rules for terminals. I see:\n\nNT77 -> 't32'\nNT93 -> 't54'\nNT26 -> 't44'\nNT82 -> 't51'\nNT33 -> 't10'\nNT74 -> 't15'\nNT2 -> 't69'\nNT54 -> 't83'\nNT51 -> 't27'\nNT8 -> 't35'\nNT20 -> 't65'\nNT74 -> 't16'\nNT7 -> 't7'\nAnd others like NT49 -> 't12', etc.\n\nWait, so looking for 't74', I see that NT74 has a production NT74 -> 't60' and NT74 -> 't68' (Wait, no, let me check each rule. Hmm, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't74' except:\n\nLooking through all terminal productions:\n\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT93 -> 't54'\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n- NT82 -> 't51'\n- NT33 -> 't10'\n- NT74 -> 't15'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT54 -> 't83'\n- NT51 -> 't27'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT74 -> 't16'\n- NT7 -> 't7'\n- And others like NT22 -> 't78', NT8 -> 't35', etc.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing an NT directly producing 't74'. Did I miss any? Let me check again. Oh, yes, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't74'. Wait, unless I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should check more carefully:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT93 -> 't54'\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n- NT82 -> 't51'\n- NT33 -> 't10'\n- NT74 -> 't15'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT54 -> 't83'\n- NT51 -> 't27'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT74 -> 't16'\n- etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT producing 't74'. So that's a problem. The second token is 't74', so unless NT can produce it, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each rule to see if any NT rule has a terminal that's 't74'.\n\nLooking through all the production rules for NT:\n\nThe only NT with a terminal is:\n\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- So, no NT other than that is producing a 't74'. So, unless there's another way, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, let me check again. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT77 -> 't32': no 't74' here.\n- All other NT rules produce combinations of NTs, not terminals except for NT3 -> 't17', and others like NT8 -> 't35', etc.\n\nSo, unless my initial analysis is wrong, the second token t74 cannot be produced by any NT. That would mean the string is invalid.\n\nSo, the string starts with t17, which is from NT3. Then the next token is t74, which none of the NTs produce. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe through a different production chain. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps NT77 can produce 't74' through some production. Looking at NT77: NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Then, NT68 -> ... and NT44 -> ... Let me see:\n\nNT68 can be produced as follows:\nNT68 -> NT77 NT2 (via NT68's production rule)\nNT77, as above, is NT68 NT44. So NT68 -> (NT68 NT44) NT2.\n\nThat seems recursive.

{"custom_id":"request-51","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t17 t74 t14 t14 t60\". Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means that every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to have a mix of these, but I notice that many productions are actually single terminals, which is allowed because CNF can include rules that produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string to check is \"t17 t74 t14 t14 t60\". I think each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so the string consists of these terminals. My goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S must produce NT3 and NT77. Wait, but how does that lead to terminals? Let me think: each NT... is another non-terminal that eventually leads to some terminal. So I need to see if the string can be built from NTs down to the terminals.\n\nBreaking down the string into individual terminals: t17, t74, t14, t14, t60. So I need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nLet me map each non-terminal to its possible terminal and\/or next non-terminals. For example, looking at NT3, it has a production NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 can produce 't54' and NT8 is 't69', but wait, looking at the given grammar, NT8's production is 't69' plus maybe others. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50 and NT38 \u2192 NT... Hmm, wait, I think I misread. Let me scan the grammar again. Oh, wait, the grammar has several productions where NTx \u2192 't' followed by some number. For example, NT8 \u2192 't35', and others.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the parse tree from the bottom up. Let's try to see where a terminal like t60 comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 't60' plus another rule? Or wait, in the given grammar, there's a rule that says NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25, and another rule for NT44 \u2192 't60'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT44: NT44 -> NT37 NT25 | 't60'\n\nWait, no, checking again. The grammar entries are like \"NT20 -> NT44 NT36\", but I need to look for any NTx that directly produces t60. Wait, I see:\n\nLooking for t60 in the grammar:\n\n- NT40 has production NT40 \u2192 't90', so that's terminal.\n- NT14 has production NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22.\n- NT22 has production NT22 \u2192 't71' and NT22 \u2192 NT22 something else?\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list all the rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, because that's where terminal symbols come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't8' (via NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT8 is 't69', but that's not 't8'. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT39 NT65\n- NT25 \u2192 NT50 NT33\n- NT37 \u2192 NT71 NT40\n- NT37 \u2192 NT59 NT0\n- NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n- NT44 \u2192 't60' (Yes, that's one. NT44 can produce 't60'.)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT82 NT98\n- NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85\n- NT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2 (Here, wait, NT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2. NT77 can then produce 't32' or ...)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the production for each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the string can be generated by backtracking from the start symbol.\n\nThe string is t17 t74 t14 t14 t60. Let's think of it as a sequence that must be generated starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77, so first, the first symbol must come from NT3, which then produces the first part, and NT77 produces the rest.\n\nWait, the string has five symbols, so the entire derivation must result in these five. Each step in the grammar splits into two non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string starts with whatever NT3 produces. NT3's productions include:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 | NT18 NT58 ...\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT3 has several rules, but let me list which ones produce terminals:\n\nLooking for NTx \u2192 't' followed by a number:\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT71 NT40 (which produce 't70', 't8' respectively)\nWait, but earlier I thought NT37 has a production to 't70'? No, looking again:\n\nI see NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54, which then can produce terminals. Wait, no: Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, let me look again through all the grammar productions for where NTx produces a terminal.\n\nI think it's better to collect all rules where NTx \u2192 't' followed by a number:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT17 \u2192 't8' (via NT17 -> NT8 NT58, but wait, NT8 is 't69' which is 't69', not 't8'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Check NT8:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50 and maybe others. But I don't see NT8 \u2192 't69' in the given grammar. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLine: NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85.\n\nAnd NT85 has:\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT3 NT67 | NT23 NT16 | 't13'\n\nAh, so NT85 \u2192 't13' is one of its productions. So NT85 can produce 't13'.\n\nSimilarly, looking back, perhaps I can collect which NTs can produce which terminals.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't60' (from NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25 and also possibly other rules? Wait, does NT44 have multiple productions, one being 't60'? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each line starts with NT followed by non-terminal, so NT44 is defined as:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18 | 't60' \u2192 no, does it? Wait, line says:\n\nNT44: NT22 NT18 | NT37 NT25 | ... Wait, no, looking at the given grammar lines:\n\nNT44: NT22 NT18, NT37 NT25. So no direct 't60' production for NT44. Wait, but in the rule for NT44, the second production is NT37 NT25. So NT44 can only produce two non-terminals. Hmm, but wait the given line starts with NT44, and the production is either NT22 NT18 or NT37 NT25.\n\nWait, but in the list provided, each line is a production. So for NT44, the production is:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nand\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25.\n\nWait, did I miss any other production for NT44? Because in the user's message, the first few lines are:\n\nGrammar: ...\n\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18\nNT25 -> NT31 NT5\n...\n\nWait, so no, NT44 does not directly produce any terminals in this grammar. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, looking through all lines, I need to find if any NTx \u2192 't' followed by a number. Let's go through each line.\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-74","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t17 t63 t14 t14 t87 t8` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make things a bit easier because I can use a parsing approach where I break down the string from the start symbol, S, using these rules.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the given grammar. It seems a bit complex with a lot of NT productions and terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, and the production for S is NT3 NT37, I think? Wait, let me check: \"S -> NT3 NT37\". Hmm, maybe that's incorrect because in the initial list, the first line is \"S -> NT3 NT37 NT77\". Oh no, wait, let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar string, it starts with \"S -> NT3 NT37 NT77\". Oh, wait, no. Let me count: the first line is \"S -> NT3 NT37 NT77\". So, actually, S produces three NTs: NT3, NT37, and NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT37 NT77. That's a trigram production, so S is split into three NTs. But wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production should have two symbols on the right side. Hmm, maybe I misread it. Looking closer: \"S -> NT3 NT37 NT77\" seems like three NTs, which would make it a production with three symbols on the right, which isn't compatible with CNF, which requires each production to have exactly two symbols. Wait, maybe the string has a typo or I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the production should be S -> NT3 NT37 | NT77, but in the given, it's written as S -> NT3 NT37 NT77, which would be a production with three symbols, which is invalid for Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, this could be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the grammar correctly. Let me look again. The given grammar is presented as a list of productions, each line starting with a symbol and then the production rule. So the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT37 NT77. That would mean S is replaced by NT3, NT37, and NT77. But CNF requires each production to be two symbols. So S has a production with three symbols, which is a problem because that violates the CNF rule. Maybe I'm misunderstanding; perhaps it's a multi-red rule, but even so, in CNF, all productions must have exactly two symbols. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the production is S \u2192 NT3 NT37, and NT77 is another production, but no, looking at the lines, it's all in one. Oh wait, perhaps the line is S -> NT3 NT37 NT77, meaning three NTs. That's a problem because each right-hand side of a production in CNF must have exactly two symbols. So that's a mistake in the grammar, unless it's a typo and should be S \u2192 NT3 NT37 | NT77, meaning either NT3 and NT37 or NT77. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed. Maybe the user made a typo, but since I have to go with what's given, perhaps I need to consider that S has a production of three NTs. That might complicate things because then S would generate three NTs, each of which could be further divided, leading to a more complicated parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check each production line. The first line is S -> NT3 NT37 NT77, which is three NT symbols, so that's definitely a problem because in CNF, each production must be of two or less symbols. Therefore, this might mean that the grammar is not in proper CNF, but perhaps it's a mistake or perhaps it's allowed in some CNF variations. Hmm, but for parsing purposes, it's a problem because each production must have exactly two symbols. So that's a red flag. Maybe the user made a typo, and it should be S \u2192 NT3 NT37 | NT77, meaning S can produce either NT3 and NT37 or NT77 as a single NT. But that's speculative.\n\nAssuming that the grammar is correctly specified, perhaps I'll proceed, but I need to make an assumption here. Let me try to parse the string `t17 t63 t14 t14 t87 t8` step by step, trying to match it from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t's with numbers. The first step is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S, which may be producing multiple NTs. Since S \u2192 NT3 NT37 NT77, but if other productions are possible, maybe S can produce other NTs. Wait, but according to the first line, S \u2192 NT3 NT37 NT77. So the start symbol S would produce three NTs, which then need to be further expanded.\n\nWait, but the first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT37 NT77, but I'm not sure how that splits. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's S \u2192 NT3 NT37 | NT77, so S can produce either NT3 and NT37 or NT77. If it's the former, then S produces three NTs, which would complicate the parsing. But perhaps it's best to proceed by assuming that S produces the sequence NT3, NT37, NT77, as that's the given production.\n\nWait, but in any case, the string is a sequence of t's, so t17, t63, t14, etc. Looking through the grammar, there are terminals for various t's, such as `t17` is directly produced by NT3 according to one of the productions. Similarly, t63 is in NT26's production, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps I can approach this by looking at each t in the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminal symbols in the string: t17, t63, t14, t14, t87, t8.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, we can find which NTs produce these terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t17 (as per the production: NT3 -> 't17')\n- NT26 \u2192 t63 (since NT26's production includes 't63')\n- NT14 \u2192 t14 (from NT14: 't14'? Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nWait, let me check each NT production. For example, NT14 is in production:\n\nLooking back at the grammar list, I see:\nNT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22\nand also, looking for terminals, I see:\n- NT15 \u2192 't73' (so that's not here)\n- NT0 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't9' (so looking for t9 in t17, no)\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nLet me go through each t in the string and see what NTs can produce them:\n\n1. t17: This is produced directly by NT3 \u2192 t17.\n2. t63: This is produced by NT54 \u2192 t49 is part of another production, but NT54 \u2192 't9'? Or wait, looking back, I see NT26 \u2192 't63', so t63 is directly from NT26.\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let's reorganize.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string and matching to the NT productions:\n\n- t17: appears directly from NT3 \u2192 t17.\n- t63: appears in NT26's production (the line: NT26 \u2192 't63').\nWait no, let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT26: ... 't63' is in the production line \"NT26 -> 't63'\".\n\nWait, no, let me scan each line:\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't83' 'NT29'? Wait, not relevant. Wait, let's find any NT that directly produce the given t's:\n\nLooking at the given grammar lines:\n\n- Is there any NT whose production includes 't17' as a terminal?

So S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nBut in the string, we have t69, t54, etc. Let me see what NT3 expands to. NT3 \u2192 't17'. But in the string, the first token is t69, which comes from NT26, not NT3. So maybe the initial assumption is incorrect, or perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I got the initial expansion wrong.

So either NT3 can derive t26 followed by something else, or perhaps the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can produce a string that is a combination of NT3 and NT77, but in this case, the string might not start with t69, which is from NT26. So maybe this string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT3: it appears in several rules:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT18\n- NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT7\n- NT78 is a terminal?

Let me see, NT93's rules:\nLooking through the grammar, NT93 appears in NT93 \u2192 't54' once, and in the rule NT44 \u2192 't54' which is already covered.\n\nWait, looking at NT93's rules? I don't see one, but earlier in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 't54' (the last line, but I'm not sure if it's the same as the rule for NT93.

Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that each production rule either produces two terminal symbols or a non-terminal symbol that itself has two production rules. This structure helps in parsing the strings efficiently, often using the CYK algorithm. But since the user hasn't mentioned using a specific algorithm, maybe I can approach this by looking for patterns in the string that match the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see a bunch of NT (non-terminal) symbols that eventually produce 't' followed by some numbers, like 't14', 't32', etc. Each 't' is part of the terminal symbols, and the numbers after 't' are the specific tokens we need to match.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is \"t54 t24 t14 t17 t56 t63 t32\". Let me count the number of tokens here. There are 7 tokens, each separated by a space. Each of these tokens is a terminal symbol, so the string has 7 terminals. \n\nIn a grammar in CNF, a derivation tree for a string of length n will have a height of log\u2082n. Here, n=7, so log\u20827 is about 2.8, which means the height should be 3. Therefore, the string can be generated in 3 steps.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The number of steps (derivations) corresponds to the height of the parse tree. The minimum number of steps to generate a string of length n in CNF is ceiling(log\u2082n), and the maximum is n-1. So for 7, the minimum steps would be 3, and maximum 6. So the string might fit if the grammar allows it within 3 to 6 steps.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t54: I need to check the grammar to see if any production directly generates t54. Looking through the rules, I see that NT49 -> t74, but what about 't54'? Wait, in the non-terminals, there's NT54 which goes to t9 (from NT49?), but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar's non-terminals are listed alongside their productions. For example, NT49 -> t74, but also NT54 -> t9. Wait, but in the given substitution rules, I see lines like \"NT49 -> t74\", \"NT54 -> t9\". Wait, but the string has t54, so is there a non-terminal that produces t54?\n\nLooking back, I see that in the rules, NT54 appears: \"NT54 -> t82 NT98\", and \"NT54\" also appears in another rule: \"NT54 -> t9\". Wait, that's under the section where NT54 is defined. Let me see:\n\nThe line says: \"NT82 -> t51 NT98\", and \"NT54 -> t82 NT98\" is another production. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, in the given rules, under NT54: \"NT54 -> t9\". So is there a production where NT54 goes to \"t54\"? Or maybe I'm misreading. Let me look through all the NT entries:\n\nLooking carefully, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17', 't6'\n- NT67 -> 't56'\n- NT44 -> 't68', 't36' etc.\n- Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't54'. The production for NT54 is \"NT54 -> t9\", but that's 't9', not 't54'.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check the rules again. Maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me go through each line step by step.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nWait, under NT77, it's \"NT77 -> NT68 NT44\"\n\nUnder NT68: \"NT68 -> NT49 NT25\"\n\nNT49: \"NT49 -> NT74 NT51\"\n\nNT74: \"NT74 -> NT3 NT67\"\n\nWait, this seems like it's part of a cycle. But I'm looking for 't54' in the terminals. Let me see which NT productions end in 't' tokens.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> t17, t6\nWait, no, earlier in the rules, I think:\n\nWait, the rules start with S -> NT3 NT77 and so on. So each rule is a production for an NT, and the right-hand side is either two NTs or a t followed by a number.\n\nWait, let's list out the NT rules where they produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> t17, t6\n- NT67 -> t56\n- NT44 -> t68, t36\n- NT98 -> t93, t16\nWait, looking deeper:\n\nWait, the rules have lines like \"NT54 -> t9\". So is there any NT that produces t54?\n\nLooking through each NT's production:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> t9\n- NT74 -> t75\n- NT59 -> t17\n- NT18 -> t8\n- NT24 -> t24? Wait, no, in the rules, under NT24: \"NT24 -> 't24'\". Wait, no, looking at the rules, I think I see an error. Let me look for any NT that directly produces 't54' as a terminal.\n\nWait, under NT58: \"NT58 -> NT5 NT85\"\n\nUnder NT23: \"NT23 -> 't29' \"\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps the string includes t54, t24, etc., and each of these is produced directly by a non-terminal, but perhaps multiple steps are needed.\n\nWait, let me try to map each token in the string to a possible production.\n\n- t54: Looking for a rule where some NT produces t54. Looking at the rules, I think NT82 -> t51 NT65 and NT82 -> t79 NT65, etc., but no NT directly producing t54. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps 't54' is a terminal, but in the given rules, no NT directly leads to 't54'. Wait, perhaps the grammar's rules are written differently.\n\nWait, let me re-express the rules more systematically. Each production is of the form NT -> something. So the terminal symbols are the ones that immediately appear in each production.\n\nFrom the list:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a single terminal 'tX'.\n\n- NT77 -> t32\n- NT49 -> t74\n- NT50 -> t35\n- NT23 -> t29\n- NT54 -> t9\n- NT93 -> t54? Wait, is there such a rule? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I think I see under NT93: \"NT93 -> 't54'\". Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, yes! For example, \"NT93 -> t54\".\n\nSo yes, there's a rule where NT93 directly produces t54. So the string has t54, which would correspond to NT93 -> t54.\n\nSimilarly, let's check each token:\n\n1. t54: comes from NT93 -> t54.\n\n2. t24: Looking for a production that produces 't24'. From the rules, I think:\n\nLooking for any rule where a terminal is t24. I see \"NT24 -> 't24'\". Wait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, under which NT does 't24' appear? Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check:\n\nThe rules include for example:\n\n\"NT24 -> 't24'\". Wait, no, actually, looking at each line, each line defines an NT and its production. So for example, the line \"NT24 -> 't24'\" would mean that NT24 produces 't24', but looking through all the lines, I don't see any such rule. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through each line, I see lines like:\n\n- \"NT85 -> t3 NT67\"\n- \"NT77 -> t68 t44\"\n- \"NT3 -> t17 t6\"\n- \"NT54 -> t9\"\n\nHmm, that's it.

For example:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT65 -> 't82'\nWait, some NTs directly produce terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of CNF. Each rule's right-hand side is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. The string consists of a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar through a series of substitutions.\n\nI'll start by examining the last symbol in the string, which is 't8'. Looking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminal NT8 (since in CNF, all terminals are replaced by single non-terminals) might lead to 't8'. Wait, actually, in the grammar, many non-terminals end with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT67 \u2192 't56', which is t56.\n\nSo, let's see the rules that produce 't8'. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that NT8 \u2192 't8' directly. So the last symbol 't8' can be generated by NT8.\n\nNow, the previous symbol is 't14'. So we need a non-terminal that can derive 't14' followed by 't8'. Looking at the grammar, the rule NT22 \u2192 t71, but wait, no. Wait, NT22 has multiple rules: NT22 \u2192 t71, NT22 \u2192 ... Wait, actually, looking again: in the grammar, NT22 has several productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT31 NT5\n- NT22 \u2192 NT83 NT22\n- Others like NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25, etc. Wait, let me check all rules for NT22.\n\nIn the given grammar, NT22's rules are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT39 NT65\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT82\nNT22 \u2192 NT23 NT16\nNT22 \u2192 t71\nWait, no, looking again, I see:\n\nNT22 has:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT39 NT65\nNT22 \u2192 NT68 NT82\nNT22 \u2192 NT23 NT16\nNT22 \u2192 t71\nIs that right? Wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, one of them is:\nNT22 \u2192 t71. So yes, NT22 \u2192 t71 is a direct production. So NT22 can produce 't71', which would be followed by 't8' from NT8. So the last two symbols are 't71 t8', which can be generated by NT22 \u2192 t71 followed by NT8 \u2192 t8.\n\nNow, moving back, the next symbol is 't14', so let's see which non-terminals can produce 't14'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT31 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo NT31 must generate 't14', followed by NT22 \u2192 t71, then NT8 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo the part 't14 t71 t8' must come from NT31 NT22, which should go to NT31 \u2192 t14, then NT22 \u2192 t71, then NT8 \u2192 t8. But wait, in CNF, how do these connect? Let's think about the structure.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rule for NT31 is NT31 \u2192 t14. So to get 't14 t71 t8', we need NT31 to lead to t14, followed by NT22 leading to t71, which in turn must chain with NT8 leading to t8. So the production would be something like NT31 NT22 NT8, but wait, in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals.\n\nHmm, perhaps the structure is more like S \u2192 NT37 NT67, which then leads to more substitutions.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a parsing approach, trying to see if the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe string is t35 t54 t63 t63 t14 t14 t71 t8.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S \u2192 NT37 NT67.\n\nSo S can produce NT37 NT67. Now, looking at NT37 and NT67.\n\nLooking at NT37's rules: NT37\u2192 t83 NT54, and another rule NT37\u2192 NT59 NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT67\u2192 t82 NT44.\n\nWait, let me check: The rules for NT37 are:\n\nNT37 \u2192 t83 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT59 NT0\n\nSo from NT37, possible to get 't83' followed by NT54, or NT59 followed by NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT67 has rules:\n\nNT67 \u2192 t82 NT44\n\nSo let's map these.\n\nWait, but in our string, after t35, it's t54, t63, t63, t14, t14, t71, t8.\n\nSo maybe the steps go as follows:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT37 NT67.\n\n2. Now, the next symbols are t35. Wait, but looking at our string, the first symbol is 't35', but NT37 and NT67 don't directly start with 't35'.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. In the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't35'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t8\n\nNT71 \u2192 t70\n\nWait, looking through the terminals, some are t14, t17, t22, etc.\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each line ends with either a non-terminal or a 't' followed by a number. So for example:\n\nNT71 \u2192 t70\n\nNT22 \u2192 t71\n\nNT31 \u2192 t14\n\nNT36 \u2192 t50\n\nWait, so do any non-terminals lead to 't35'? Looking through, I don't see any rule that ends with t35. Let me check the given grammar again:\n\nIn the provided rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't35'. For example, in the lines:\n\nNT83 \u2192 t51\n\nNT26 \u2192 t44\n\nNT54 \u2192 t83\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each production and see if any terminal is 't35'.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT1 \u2192 ... ? Wait, looking at the provided rules, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't35'. So perhaps 't35' cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string starts with 't35', which is not derivable from any rule. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, in the provided grammar, the only way to get 't35' is if one of the non-terminals leads to it. Let me check all the lines again to confirm.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 t14\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t83\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t82\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t75\n\n- NT83 \u2192 t51\n\nIs there any 't35'? Hmm, I don't see any.\n\nTherefore, the first symbol 't35' cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar.

The string is `t17 t12 t24 t10 t16 t27 t8 t24 t10`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form look like. They typically have rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. From the provided grammar, it seems all the rules are two-part, either two non-terminals or a terminal, except maybe some. I'll verify that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most rules are like S -> NT3 NT37, which is two non-terminals. But some rules have terminals, like NT3 -> 't17'. Okay, so this grammar allows terminals on the right-hand side. That\u2019s fine because Chomsky normal form usually allows that as well, as it's a generalization.\n\nThe string to check is composed of a series of 't' followed by numbers, so it's a sequence of terminals. Each 't' is followed by a number, like 't17', 't12', etc. \n\nThe approach here is to see if the string can be generated step by step by the grammar. Since this is a top-down parsing approach, I can try to find a derivation path that matches the string. Alternatively, I can look for nodes in the parse tree where the symbols match the terminal string.\n\nGiven the length of the string, it's 9 elements, so the parse tree will have a depth corresponding to that. Each 't' symbol appears to be a terminal, so they must be the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nI need to check if each 't' can be derived from some non-terminal, and all rules must be followed. Let me attempt to break down the string:\n\nThe string is: t17, t12, t24, t10, t16, t27, t8, t24, t10.\n\nLet me see if each of these terminals appears in the RHS of any non-terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT12 -> 't12'?

{"custom_id":"request-136","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the string \"t17 t74 t24 t10 t30 t27 t8 t14 t14\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like all the production rules are in the form A \u2192 BC, which is Chomsky normal form. That means every production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal if it's a single symbol. Wait, no, actually in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this case, the grammar is fully in CNF because all the rules are A \u2192 two non-terminals. That might help in parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t17 t74 t24 t10 t30 t27 t8 t14 t14\". All of these are terminals except I think none of them are non-terminals because looking at the grammar, all the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to see if this sequence of terminals can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S starts by generating two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77.\n\nLet's break down the given string into individual symbols: t17, t74, t24, t10, t30, t27, t8, t14, t14.\n\nI think I should try to see if there's a way to parse this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser would work, but maybe I can approach it step by step.\n\nLet me first see which NTs might correspond to these t-values.\n\nLooking at the rules:\nNT3 -> t17 (as per the last line: NT3 -> 't17')\nNT74 -> t74 (NT74 is in the production: NT74 -> t74)\nSimilarly, NT24? Wait, looking back, I see NT74 -> t74, and in the production rules, NT74 appears in a rule: NT74 -> NT3 NT16. Oh, right, so NT74 first became t74 by a production that directly goes to it, but also, NT74 can be split into NT3 and NT16.\n\nWait, but how does that fit in? So, NT74 can produce t74, or it can produce NT3 and NT16. So in the string, the first symbol is t17, which comes from NT3. So S starts with NT3, which is t17, and the next is NT77.\n\nWait no, S is NT3 NT77. So the string starts with t17 (from NT3) followed by something that must produce t74 (from NT77).\n\nWait, let me think. The string is t17 t74 t24 t10 t30 t27 t8 t14 t14.\n\nSo S generates NT3 and NT77. So the string should start with t17 (NT3) and then something from NT77.\n\nNT77's production rule is: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Looking at the definition, NT77 is split into NT68 and NT44. So the next two symbols must come from NT68 and NT44.\n\nSo, after t17, the next part is t74, which would have to come from NT68 and NT44 combined. Let me check the grammar for NT68 and NT44.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. So NT68 becomes NT49 and NT25. Similarly, NT44 appears multiple times. From the rules, NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18. Wait, but does NT44 have other productions? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT44 -> NT22 NT18, NT44 -> NT37 NT25, and others, but in reality, in Chomsky normal form, each rule would have exactly two non-terminals. So in our case, the grammar has multiple rules for the same non-terminal, so NT44 can be split in multiple ways.\n\nSo, to get the next symbols, after t17, we need t74, which would come from NT68 and NT44. So NT68 is split into NT49 and NT25, and NT44 could be split into NT22 and NT18, or other options.\n\nWait, but the second symbol is t74, which is the result of the non-terminal NT74, but NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So after t17, the next symbols should be the expansion of NT77 into NT68 and NT44. So the second part of the string after t17 is t74, but wait, that's not how it works.\n\nWait, no. The NT77 rule is NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So the two symbols after t17 would be the two components from NT68 and NT44. But in the string, after t17, the next is t74, which is a single terminal. So that would mean that either NT68 or NT44 is producing t74. Let me check what t74 comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT74 \u2192 t74 directly, so if either NT68 or NT44 can produce NT74, then we can have t74 as one of the symbols. Alternatively, the other non-terminal could produce another terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. The NT77 rule is NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So when S starts, it becomes NT3 (t17) followed by NT77, which becomes NT68 and NT44. Then each of those can split further.\n\nSo the string is t17 t74 t24 t10 t30 t27 t8 t14 t14. So after t17, the next two symbols should be the expansion of NT68 and NT44. But the string has t74, which is a single terminal. So unless one of the NT68 or NT44 rules can produce a single terminal, but in Chomsky normal form, all productions are splitting into two non-terminals, so each non-terminal should split, unless a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Chomsky normal form requires that each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So in this case, some of the non-terminals have rules that directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT3 \u2192 t17, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, coming back, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. NT3 \u2192 t17, so first symbol is t17. Then NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Now, to get the next symbol, which is t74, that must come from either NT68 or NT44. But in the case of NT68 and NT44, they both have productions that can lead to terminals, right?\n\nLet me list all the terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\nNT74 \u2192 t74\nLooking elsewhere, other NTs have terminals, like NT24? Wait, no, looking at the rules: I see NT6 (from the lower part) \u2192 t63, but wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should make a list of each NT and the terminals they can derive to see if the given sequence is possible.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the top-down approach.\n\nSo, S starts as t17 (NT3) and then NT77, which is NT68 and NT44.\n\nSo the string after t17 should be the expansion of NT68 and NT44. Let's see what the next parts are. The string after t17 is t74 t24 t10 t30 t27 t8 t14 t14.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because NT77 would split into NT68 and NT44. So the next part is two symbols, but the string has only one symbol after t17, which is t74. So unless one of the NTs (NT68 or NT44) can produce a terminal, which would require a production A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking at NT68's productions: NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. So it splits into two non-terminals. So NT68 cannot produce a terminal directly. Similarly, NT44 has multiple productions, all of which split into two non-terminals. For example, NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18, or NT37 NT25, etc. So NT44 cannot directly produce a terminal. Therefore, the two symbols after t17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-148","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t69 t14 t17 t88 t35 t54 t78 t8 t63 t32`. \n\nFirst, I should remember what CNF means. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it indeed follows CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals or an terminals (like 't*').\n\nThe string is composed of terminal symbols, so each of these must be derived directly from the grammar. My goal is to trace the leftmost derivation of the string using the given productions.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t69. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT65 \u2192 t77 NT2, but wait, that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps NT43 or another non-terminal.

Let's check.\n\nIn the provided grammar:\n\n- The NT93 rule has NT93 \u2192 NT44 NT14. But looking for t69...\n\nWait, in the productions list, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't44'?\nNo, wait, wait. Let me look carefully.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for any NT rule that directly produces t69. I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't69' (Yes, NT2 \u2192 t69). That's a direct production.\n\nSimilarly, other terminal usages are:\n\nt14: Is there a NT rule that produces t14? Let's see. Looking at the list, I see NT23 \u2192 t29, NT31 \u2192 t14. So yes, NT31 \u2192 t14.\n\nt17: Looking for NT rules with t17. Yes: NT37 \u2192 t70 NT44, but that's with t70, which is not t17. Wait, actually, looking at NT3 \u2192 t17.\n\nWait, no: NT3 \u2192 t17 is in the initial list, right? The production for NT3 is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 and also in another place NT3 \u2192 t17? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the NT3 rules are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nand\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\n\nSo yes, NT3 can directly produce t17.\n\nContinuing:\n\nt88: Looking for a terminal NT rule. I see NT17 \u2192 t70 NT44 and others. Alternatively, NT65 \u2192 t88 is in the productions. Yes, NT65 \u2192 't88'\n\nt35: Looking for NT rules with t35. I see NT8 \u2192 t35.\n\nt54: Looking for NT rules with t54. NT25 \u2192 t54 is present.\n\nt78: Wait, t78 isn't in any terminals except in the initial string. Let's check for NT rules that produce t78. Wait, in the grammar, NT748? No, wait, let's look again.\n\nIn the productions, I see NT74 \u2192 t75 and others, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let me check the production for NT20. Hmm, looking at NT20 \u2192 't65'. That's a direct production.\n\nWait, looking through the given productions, I see:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t75?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see NT74 having a production NT74 \u2192 t75, which is one of the rules. So NT74 can produce t75. Wait, but the string has t78, which isn't directly a terminal I see. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, do I have a production that results in 't78'? Let me search the provided productions for any NT rule that directly produces 't78'. I don't see any. The closest is NT74 \u2192 t75, but that gives t75, not t78. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t78 is derived through a series of steps. Let me check if any NT rules can produce 't78'. Hmm, perhaps I overlooked it. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking through the NTx sections, I don't see any direct production for t78. For example, NT74 has a production to t75, and NT77 to t32, but the string has t78, which isn't directly there. Maybe it's derived through a longer process, but the string has a t78, so perhaps the grammar doesn't produce it directly, making the string invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me check carefully.\n\nLooking at the NT74 productions: NT74 \u2192 t75, so yes, produces t75. Are there any others that might produce t78? I don't see any NT rule producing 't78', so that could be a problem.\n\nBut wait, in the provided string, the fourth token is t88. Wait, no, the string is t69, t14, t17, t88, t35, t54, t78, t8, t63, t32.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused because when I check the grammar, the string includes t78, which I can't find directly. Let me see: perhaps I made a mistake in reviewing the grammar. Let me go through each production again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t75. That's one production.\n\nI don't see any NT74 \u2192 t78. So that suggests that 't78' is not directly produced by any rule, which would mean it's impossible for the string to contain 't78' because the grammar doesn't have any production rule that ends with 't78'.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar, so the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can derive 't78' via longer production steps. Let's see. For example, perhaps an NT rule that eventually produces t78 through a chain.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, it's unclear. For example, NT22 \u2192 t78 is one of the productions? Let me check.\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see under NT22: NT22 \u2192 t78. Oh wait, yes, looking back:\n\nYes, in the given grammar, under NT22, there's a production NT22 \u2192 t78. Wait, no: I'm confused now because I thought t78 wasn't there. Let me recheck the grammar list.\n\nLooking back at the provided grammar, I see under NT22:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t78.\n\nYes, that's present. So NT22 can directly produce t78. So the string has t78, which is the seventh token. So how do we derive t78? It must come from NT22 \u2192 t78. So that's a direct production.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So now I realize that there is a NT22 rule that produces t78. So the string t69 t14 t17 t88 t35 t54 t78 t8 t63 t32 has t78 as the seventh token, which comes from NT22 \u2192 t78.\n\nSo, now, let's re-examine the tokens:\n\nt69 (NT2 \u2192 t69), t14 (NT31 \u2192 t14), t17 (NT3 \u2192 t17), t88 (NT65 \u2192 t88), t35 (NT8 \u2192 t35), t54 (NT25 \u2192 t54), t78 (NT22 \u2192 t78), t8 (NT20 \u2192 t65 or other?), wait, t8 is produced by which rule?\n\nLooking back, I see NT26 \u2192 t44, and NT8 \u2192 t35. Wait, no, let me check. Wait, NT8 is a production: yes, in the given grammar, NT8 \u2192 t35.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's in the language defined by the grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the grammar: it's in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. All non-terminals on the left expand to two on the right, except maybe the start symbol. Wait, here, the start symbol seems to be S. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S generates NT3 and NT77, which are non-terminals. Then each of those, I assume, also split into two non-terminals or a terminal. But some of the non-terminals go directly to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT6 might go to a terminal or another split.\n\nWait, but looking at some of them, like NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. But then NT6 isn't directly a terminal yet. Let me see... Some have terminals like 't69', 't8', 't35', etc. So these are the terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string to check is: `t69 t14 t35 t54 t63 t65 t73 t60 t63 t30`.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, we can use a recursive descent approach or a stack-based method, but maybe a simpler way is to see if each part of the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me write down the string: t69, t14, t35, t54, t63, t65, t73, t60, t63, t30.\n\nFirst, the grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT3 and NT77. So the entire string must be produced starting from S.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Now, each of these NTs must be expanded until they reach terminals.\n\nLet me see what NT3 and NT77 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT3: The productions start with NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 splits into NT17 and NT6. Then each of these needs to generate a terminal.\n\nNT17: Looking at the productions, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So NT17 splits into NT8 and NT58. Each of these needs to generate a terminal.\n\nNT8: It seems to have several productions. For example, NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50. Then NT30 \u2192 t54, and NT50 \u2192 t24. So NT8 can generate t30 t50, which would be t54 t24, but wait, no, because NT30 is t54 and NT50 is t24. So NT8 \u2192 t54 t24.\n\nWait, but in our string, we have t69 after S's first component. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. Let me step back.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this from the string and try to match it against the grammar. That is, try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string. It's a series of 't's followed by numbers. Each of these could correspond to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo let's list the symbols in the string: t69, t14, t35, t54, t63, t65, t73, t60, t63, t30.\n\nWe'll start by thinking about the top-level production, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must be NT3 followed by NT77. But each of these NTs must produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which would mean the entire string must be NT3 NT77, where each is expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to see if the first part of the string (t69, t14, etc.) can be generated by NT3, and the second part (t35, t54, etc.) by NT77.\n\nWait, no, actually, the string is a complete sequence of symbols. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT3 and NT77. So the first half (or whatever) is generated by NT3, and the second half by NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more about the fact that the string must be divided into two parts, each corresponding to the expansion of NT3 and NT77 respectively.\n\nLet me see: S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the string is [NT3's expansion] [NT77's expansion]. So NT3 must generate the first half, and NT77 must generate the second half.\n\nAlternatively, it's not necessarily split into two equal parts, but each NT must generate a sequence that, when concatenated, equals the string.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is 10 symbols long. So the split between NT3 and NT77 would likely be into two parts, perhaps 5 and 5, but I'm not sure. I might have to explore different possibilities.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look at each NT separately and see what they can derive.\n\nStarting with NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo let's expand NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 can expand as NT30 NT50, ATributed to NT30 \u2192 t54, NT50 \u2192 t24. But wait, in our string, the first terminal is t69, which isn't t54 or t24. So maybe NT8 doesn't directly generate t54 t24. Let me check the productions for NT30 and NT50.\n\nLooking at NT30: The productions include NT30 \u2192 t54. So when NT30 is a non-terminal, it can directly become t54. So NT30 \u2192 t54.\n\nNT50: Looking at the productions, NT50 \u2192 t24. So NT50 \u2192 t24.\n\nTherefore, if NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50, then NT8 can be expanded to t54 t24.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t69, not t54 t24. So that suggests that NT8 cannot derive t69. Hmm, does that mean that NT3's expansion can't start with t69? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the expansions. Let me double-check the productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has many entries. Let me see if any NT can generate 't69'.\n\nLooking through the list, NT26 is in the productions. Specifically:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n\nNT68 produces nt49 nt25, which then could go further.\n\nWait, but wait: in the productions, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT82 NT98\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93\n\nOh, I see that NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n\nThen, looking further down, NT26 also has NT26 \u2192 NT44 NT18, which I didn't see earlier. Wait, no, it's another rule for NT26:\n\nLooking back, I think I wrote all the rules down. Let me re-examine the grammar to find if any NT can generate t69.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly translates to t69. So how could t69 appear in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a path from some NT to t69. Let me think. For example, looking for NTs that can derive t69.\n\nWait, perhaps NT93? Let me look for NT93. Yes, I see:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT27 NT27\n\nAnd NT27 is present in the rules? Wait, looking back:\n\nOh, wait, in the list of grammar rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't29', though I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the list, perhaps I can find which NT can derive t69.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t69. Let me scan the list for any NT that can produce 't69' as a terminal. Hmm, I don't immediately see any NT directly with 't69' in the productions.\n\nWait, but looking through all the productions:\n\nFor NT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93\n\nAnd NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82, both of which go further. Let's see if they can lead to t69.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\n\nNT49 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-173","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is \"t70 t63 t63 t14 t14 t87 t12 t14 t14 t65 t73\". \n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except for the terminals which produce themselves. Since all productions are in CNF, every step reduces the number of symbols by one until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, the approach I should take is to reverse engineer the string by tracing back through the grammar. Starting from the rightmost symbols, I'll check if each terminal can be derived from the left non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t70 t63 t63 t14 t14 t87 t12 t14 t14 t65 t73\". Let's break it down into individual terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. Each terminal corresponds to a production where a non-terminal expands into that terminal. So, for each \"tX\", I need to find the non-terminal that can directly produce it.\n\nLet's list the terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\n1. t70: Looking at the grammar, NT74 \u2192 t70. So, the non-terminal NT74 can produce t70.\n\n2. t63: Looking for a production that generates t63.

So, NT14 can produce t14.\n\n5. t14: Same as above, NT14 \u2192 t14.\n\n6. t87: Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't see an NT directly producing t87. Wait, maybe there's a chain. For example, NT87 might produce something that leads to t87. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking back, I don't see any NT that directly produces t87. So that could be a problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's list all possible NTs that produce the given terminals.\n\nLet's list each terminal and the NTs that can produce them:\n\nt70: NT74 \u2192 t70\n\nt63: NT65 \u2192 t63\n\nt14: NT14 \u2192 t14\n\nt87: Hmmm, looking at the grammar, is there any NT that can produce t87? Let me go through the rules. For example, NT22 \u2192 t78, but that's t78. Wait, NT77 \u2192 t32, etc. I don't see any NT that ends with producing t87. Maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking for where t87 is a terminal. Wait, in the rule NT22 \u2192 t78, NT23 \u2192 t29, etc. Hmm, no, I don't see any NT that directly produces t87. So that's a problem because there's a t87 in the string. So this could mean the string is invalid, because there's no NT that can produce t87.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nHere's the list of rules with terminals:\n\nLooking for any NT that has a production ending with t87.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT93 NT16\n\nNT93 \u2192 t54\n\nAnd other rules:\n\nNT74 \u2192 t75\n\nNT75 \u2192 t79\n\nWait, not helpful. Wait, let's see NT87: Oh wait, not in the given grammar. Because looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT with t87 as a terminal.\n\nSo, the t87 in the string can't be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar because none of the productions result in t87. So that makes me think the string isn't part of the language.\n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Let me double-check the grammar. Did I miss any NT that can produce t87? Hmm, looking through all productions, each NT that has a terminal on the RHS is followed by 't' and a number, but none of these numbers are 87.\n\nSo, that would mean the grammar doesn't produce t87, and thus the string isn't in the language. So the answer should be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in mapping the string to the grammar.

So that's t12.\n\nSo, t12 is the next symbol. So, the NT that expands to t12 would need to be something that can generate t12. But if none of the NTs produce t12, then this is impossible, so the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The string has \"t87 t12\".\n\nSo, if the grammar has any NT that can produce t87, but I don't think it does. Because going through the productions, the terminals I see are t74, t65, t70, t63, t14, etc. But no t87.\n\nSimilarly, the 't12' is not present as a terminal in any NT rule.

{"custom_id":"request-172","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar thoroughly. Context-free grammars have production rules that generate strings, and Chomsky normal form is a specific structure where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I notice that all the production rules are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 't' followed by a number. So, this fits the Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t17 t63 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t46 t35 t54`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the production rules.\n\nStarting with the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, S is composed of two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77.\n\nFrom the initial step, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded until we reach the terminals (the t followed by numbers). \n\nLooking at NT3, in the grammar, it has two production rules:\n1. NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n2. NT3 \u2192 NT67 (I think there might be more, but from the given list, it seems these are the ones)\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, NT3 has two productions: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 and NT3 \u2192 NT67. So both of these lead to terminals.\n\nLet me map the string's components against these possibilities. The string starts with t17, t63, etc. Wait, t17 is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT17 could lead to 't70' or 't69' or something else.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar shows that NT17 has two productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58? Or wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So, NT17 expands into two non-terminals, NT8 and NT58.\n\nEach of those needs to be checked.\n\nNT8 has two productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n- NT8 \u2192 another rule? Let me see in the provided grammar. Yes, NT8 \u2192 \"t35\". So that's an immediate terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has NT8 \u2192 \"t35\", so that is a production that can directly produce t35.\n\nOkay, so if we have NT8, it can either expand into NT30 and NT50, or directly produce t35.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 in the grammar has:\n- NT58 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT58 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, putting that together, if we have NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and each can be expanded further.\n\nLet's trace through the string.\n\nThe string starts with t17. So, we need to check if t17 can be derived from any of the non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. So, that's the only production for NT17.\n\nSo, to get t17, we need to see if t17 can be directly derived from NT17, but according to the grammar, it's two non-terminals. So, that would produce t17 followed by the expansions of NT8 and NT58.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t17, the next token is t63. Let me see if that fits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should process the string token by token and see if each can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string again: t17 t63 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t46 t35 t54.\n\nI can represent this as a sequence of terminals: t17, t63, t24, t10, t71, t74, t24, t10, t46, t35, t54.\n\nNow, I'll try to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can generate the string. Alternatively, I can parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree. Let's see.\n\nStarting with S, which becomes NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the first two symbols must come from NT3 and NT77. Let's process NT3 and NT77.\n\nNT3 can expand into either NT17 NT6 or NT67.\n\nLet's consider the production NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nThen, NT6 would need to expand to 't63' based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT6 in the grammar: NT6 \u2192 't63'. So that's an immediate production, yes.\n\nSo, the first three symbols: t17, t63, ... ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which is a sequence of two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, the first part is NT3, which could expand into NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 and NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35' or NT30 NT50.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t17, so if NT17 can only produce a sequence of two non-terminals, then the first terminal would have to come from the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing is more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each symbol in the string and see if it can be matched by each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to match the string step by step.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the first non-terminal is NT3, which can be NT17 NT6 or NT67.\n\nIf NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, then the first part is NT17, which expands to NT8 NT58.\n\nThen NT8 can be 't35' or NT30 NT50.\n\nThen NT58 \u2192 't49'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t17, which is 't17', so let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT17 with t17. Wait, in the grammar, NT17 is a non-terminal, and when it's expanded, it becomes either NT8 NT58 or something else.\n\nWait, I need to clarify: in the grammar, NT17 is a non-terminal, and when expanded, it can produce either NT8 NT58 or another option? Wait, looking back, the grammar for NT17 is: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nSo, NT17 cannot be directly expanded into t17, because it's always two non-terminals. Therefore, to get a t17, it must come from somewhere.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT17 doesn't produce t17. Hmm, that's an issue. Wait, but the string has t17 as the first symbol. So for the string to begin with t17, it must be that the first non-terminal is producing t17 directly, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t17.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules like NT3 \u2192 't17', so that's a production. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't63'.\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, NT3 can be 't17' as one of its productions.\n\nSo, NT3 \u2192 't17' OR NT17 NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 't63' OR NT30 NT50.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. NT3 can directly produce 't17' as per the grammar. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I find NT3 \u2192 't17' and NT6 \u2192 't63'. So yes, those are terminal productions.\n\nTherefore, in the string's first token, which is 't17', it must come from the terminal production of NT3. So, the first non-terminal in S must expand into NT3, and then NT3 directly produces 't17'.\n\nSo, let me try this.\n\nThe string is t17 t63 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t46 t35 t54.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n1. t17 \u2192 This must be from NT3 expanding directly.\n\nSo, NT3 is the first symbol in S's expansion.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 t17 followed by NT77.\n\nSo, the next symbol is t63, which is 't63'. Looking at NT77's productions.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo, NT77 expands into two non-terminals, NT68"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has either two terminals and nothing else or two non-terminals. Also, the start symbol is S, and the string must eventually derive all symbols down to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the RHS of the rules are either non-terminals or a combination of two non-terminals. That's consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t-something, which from the grammar, each 't' is the result of some production rule ending in that terminal. So each 't70', 't63', etc., corresponds to a non-terminal that eventually produces that terminal.\n\nSo the approach is to reconstruct a parse tree where each non-terminal breaks down into the given symbols.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, each production's RHS is a pair of non-terminals or terminals. I can map each non-terminal to the terminal it can produce. For example, NT98 -> t93, t16.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal when their production reaches the end. Wait, actually, the grammar includes rules where some non-terminals are immediately mapped to 'tX', right? Like NT83 -> 't44' and 't14', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, each production either ends with a terminal (like 't70', 't63', etc.) or continues further. So for each 't' in the string, I need to find a non-terminal that can produce that 't'.\n\nFor example, 't70' must come from NT70, and looking at the grammar, NT70 -> t7, which means NT70 produces t7. So to get 't70', that's not directly possible, unless I'm mixing something. Wait no, NT70's production is NT26 -> t74, but that's not correct. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT70 -> t7 is one of the rules. Wait no, looking through the list, I don't see NT70. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar again: let me check the rules for NT70.\n\nWait, the grammar has many rules, but for examples, I see NT74 -> t74, and others. Wait, I think I need to build a mapping between non-terminals and their possible terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the grammar as a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals in the string. So, the string is a series of terminals, and we need to see if this string can be generated by expanding S down to these terminals.\n\nThe string has 12 symbols: t70, t63, t74, t24, t10, t60, t10, t90, t78, t9, t24, t10.\n\nEach symbol corresponds to a non-terminal. So, for example, 't70' corresponds to NT70, which produces t7. Wait, that might not align with the string. Because the string has t70 as a symbol, which should come from a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list for each 'tX' what non-terminal it comes from. Then, working backward, see if the non-terminals can be derived from S.\n\nLet me go through each symbol in the string:\n\n1. t70: this comes from NT70. From the grammar, looking for NT70. Wait, in the given rules, I see things like NT74 -> t75, and others, but looking for NT70... Hmm, in the grammar, the rule for NT70 isn't present. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for where the RHS is just tX. For example, NT21 -> t71, which is \"t71\". But for t70, I see NT51 -> t27, which is \"t27\". Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me see the grammar again. I think I might have made a mistake. Looking through all the rules, I find NT18 is 't8', NT20 is 't65', etc. So actually, 't70' must come from NT70, but reviewing the grammar, I don't see a rule where NT70 directly produces t70. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal can produce a terminal, and in the grammar, all non-terminals eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, most non-terminals are defined as a combination of two non-terminals, but some rules directly produce a terminal. For example, NT44 -> t60. So, NT44 produces t60. Similarly, NT22 -> t78, NT25->t14, etc.\n\nBut for 't70', which is in the string, which non-terminal produces it? Let me search through the grammar for any rule where RHS is 't70'.\n\nLooking through all the rules: I don't see any rule where RHS is 't70'. Wait, actually I think I might have missed some. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT3->t17: so NT3->t17.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't70'. Hmm, that's a problem because in that case, 't70' is not generated by any rule, so the string can't be generated by the grammar since it would require a non-terminal that can produce 't70', which isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe each rule is written as NTx -> something. So, for example, NT49 -> t74, meaning NT49 can produce t74.\n\nWait, but in that case, to generate t70, we'd need a non-terminal NT70, which is defined as some other non-terminals. So, looking through the grammar, for NT70, let's see what is it defined as.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see NT74 -> t44, t16. So that's for NT74. What about NT70? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through, I see NT58 -> t54, t85. Not that.\n\nLooking for NT70: Do any lines have NT70 in the left-hand side? Let me see:\n\nNT26 is 't74' and 't98', which are terminals.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT70 in the LHS. So the only way to get 't70' is if there's a non-terminal NT70 in the grammar, but since I don't see it defined, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the initial grammar might have non-terminals that can eventually derive to 't70' via a series of expansions.\n\nWait, so perhaps 't70' comes from NT70, which is built from other non-terminals. But since I don't see any rules for NT70 in the grammar, it's impossible for 't70' to be produced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking through the rules.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which can produce a terminal symbol followed by another non-terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I should look at the production rules provided. The start symbol is S, which directly produces NT3 NT77. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. That means the start string from S is two non-terminals, which will be expanded further.\n\nThe given string starts with `t70`, which I assume is a terminal symbol, and ends with `t70`. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string must be built by expanding the non-terminals until we get terminals matching the given string.\n\nI should probably draw the parse tree for the given string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string: `t70 t63 t63 t24 t10 t78 t12 t24 t10 t30 t69 t70`.\n\nTo parse this string, I can break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo after expanding S, we have [NT3, NT77]. Now, each of these non-terminals will produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT3's production rules: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nSo expanding NT3 gives NT17 and NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo NT77 expands to NT68 and NT44.\n\nNow, I have [NT17, NT6, NT68, NT44].

Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar. It seems to have a start symbol S that generates NT3 NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then each of these NTe symbols (like NT3, NT77) can generate other NTe symbols or sometimes terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers like t17, t63, etc.\n\nSo the string given consists of these terminals. My job is to see if there's a way to derive this string from the start symbol S following the production rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from right to left or left to right, trying to see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt17 t63 t14 t14 t78 t54 t79 t54 t46 t88 t90 t24 t10\n\nEach 't' number is a terminal, so I need to see if each number can be generated by some NT rule. But more importantly, the sequence of terminals needs to correspond to a valid leftmost or rightmost derivation.\n\nLet me see what the right-hand sides of the grammar rules look like. For example, some rules produce two non-terminals each, except for certain rules that produce a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in the given grammar, some NT production rules generate a terminal, but others generate two NTs. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the production rules, some of them produce a terminal, e.g., NT3 -> 't17', which means that NT3 can directly produce 't17'. Similarly, NT59 -> NT74 NT51, but NT44 -> t68? Wait, no, looking back, let me check each production:\n\nWait, no, actually, some rules produce a terminal, like NT75 -> 't79' (is that right?), but when looking, I see:\n\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\n- NT37 -> NT83 NT54\n- NT3 -> 't17', so NT3 can produce t17 directly.\n- NT18 -> 't8'\n- NT83 -> 't13'\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT49 -> 't74'\n- NT65 -> 't46'\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n- NT54 -> 't83'\n- NT51 -> 't27'\n- So, each of these NTs may directly produce a terminal. So many of them are epsilon productions? Wait, no, because they produce single terminals.\n\nSo, for each NTe, we can directly produce a terminal, and other NTe can produce two other NTe.\n\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then each of these can produce their own sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of t's. To break it down, I can consider that each production in the grammar either results in a single terminal or two non-terminals. So if I can split the string into such parts, working from the start symbol, it would mean the string is generated.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of symbols is 13, and the grammar is binary, the derivation path must correspond to 12 splits. So, for T1: t17, T2: t63, ..., T13: t10. Each production either introduces two symbols or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider how the string can be split into the required sub-parts.\n\nLooking at the string, let me list the terms:\n\nt17, t63, t14, t14, t78, t54, t79, t54, t46, t88, t90, t24, t10.\n\nLet me see if I can match this from the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings derived from NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT77 => string = SderivedString = NT3derivedString + NT77derivedString.\n\nSo, I need to check if the given string can be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT3 and the second by NT77.\n\nWait, but how? Alternatively, since each production is binary, maybe the string can be broken down recursively.\n\nPerhaps it's better to look at the structure of the string and see if each part can be generated by the appropriate non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a parse table or a recursive approach would help, but given the complexity, perhaps using the CYK algorithm or something similar.\n\nBut since I need to reason through it, let me try to break down the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t63 t14 t14 t78 t54 t79 t54 t46 t88 t90 t24 t10.\n\nThat's 13 tokens, which is an odd number. Wait, since the start symbol is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, each step adds two symbols (either NTs or terminals). So, the total number of symbols in the derived string should be a series of binary expansions, leading to 2^n where n is the number of steps. Hmm, but 13 is not a power of two, nor is it 2n-1, so maybe it's not possible. Hmm, but perhaps not; sometimes the trees have varying depths.\n\nWait, but more importantly, let's see if the terminal string can be split into parts generated by NT3 and NT77.\n\nStarting with the entire string, let's see if the suffix of NT77 can be matched, then the remaining part is from NT3.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions. Looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT77's production rules. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\n- NT77 appears in several places as a right-hand side.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT77 is on the left in the production NT44 -> NT22 NT18, etc. Wait, no, in the grammar:\n\nWait, the list starts with S, then NT20, NT68, etc. Let me go through each production to find where NT77 is on the left.\n\nLooking: \n\nYes, looking through:\n\n- NT37 -> NT83 NT54\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- looking for NT77:\n\nYes, here: NT68 -> NT49 NT25, no. \n\nWait, looking:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\n\nWait, here at the end:\n\nNT77's productions are not directly present on the left, but in the right-hand sides of others.\n\nPerhaps I'm looking for NT77 as a non-terminal in the productions.\n\nWait, I don't see NT77 as a left-hand side in any rules.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that A can also be a terminal. This makes it easier for parsing algorithms like CYK. However, for this problem, I need to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive with multiple non-terminals. Each non-terminal seems to have multiple productions. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, except 't49', 't95', 't93', 't0', and a few others. So, each step in the derivation must replace a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. So, I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar. Let's break down the string:\n\n`t35 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t78 t78 t61 t8 t63 t32`\n\nFirst, I'll map each terminal to its possible non-terminals based on the productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for each terminal:\n\nt35: NT44?\nLooking at the productions, NT44 -> NT22 NT18, and NT8 -> 't35'. So, t35 is produced by NT8.\n\nt14: Looking at the productions, when does t14 appear? Checking, I see NT22 -> 't14'. So, t14 comes from NT22.\n\nt29: Looking at the non-terminals, NT67 -> 't26'? Wait, no. Wait, the productions have NT26 -> NT5 NT48, NT48 -> 't18' and NT5 -> 't14', NT26 -> 't48' as per some productions. Alternatively, checking other terminals:\n\nWait, more accurately, the productions for each non-terminal include terminals. Let me go through each occurrence:\n\nFirst token: t35 \u2192 NT8\n\nSecond: t14 \u2192 NT22\n\nThird: t29 \u2192 Looking at the productions, I don't see t29 in any terminal; but perhaps NT55 or similar? Wait, let me check. Oh, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking through all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for all non-terminals that can produce 't29'. Let's go through the non-terminals:\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nChecking each terminal:\n\nt35 is produced by NT8 \u2192 NT8's production is NT74 NT18, and NT8 is a terminal.\n\nt14 is produced by NT22 via NT22 \u2192 't14'.\n\nt29: Looking through the productions, perhaps NT25? Wait, NT25's productions are NT31 NT5, but where does t29 come from?\n\nWait, looking at the productions list, I see NT22 has a production leading to t29 via NT22->... Wait, perhaps I should list all the terminals and their sources.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backward from the string and see if the non-terminals can be connected via the productions.\n\nSo, let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t35. This comes from NT8. So, the first non-terminal is NT8.\n\nNext, after t35, we have t14. So, after NT8, what's the next non-terminal that can produce t14? Since NT8 only has one production: NT74 NT18. So maybe it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in CNF grammar, each production is two non-terminals, except terminals. So, perhaps the initial step is to see what the start symbol S can produce.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S. The production for S is S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT3 and NT77.\n\nEach of these NTs can then further expand.\n\nGiven that, the string is a series of terminals. So, perhaps it's a matter of checking if these terminals can be produced by the non-terminals in some derivation path starting from S.\n\nLet's consider that the string is a sequence of 13 terminals.\n\nI can model this as a series of steps where each step combines two non-terminals into a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each token in the string is a terminal that can be derived by a non-terminal, and the adjacent non-terminals can lead to that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the reverse. Since the string is t35 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t78 t78 t61 t8 t63 t32, let's write each token and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nt35: From the productions, NT8 \u2192 't35'.\n\nt14: From the productions, NT22 \u2192 't14'.\n\nt29: Looking for 't29' in the productions. Let me check the list. I don't see any non-terminal directly mapping to t29. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT22 has one production to 't14', and another to NT22 -> something else? Let me check.\n\nIn the productions, I see NT22 has several entries, including NT22 -> NT31 NT5 and others. Wait, perhaps I should look for 't29' being produced by any NT.\n\nLooking at the list: for example, NT26 has a production to 't48' and 't22'. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Maybe it's not directly a terminal, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t29 is produced by NT23 via NT23->... Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking for NT23, I see in the productions, NT22 -> NT23, but no production of NT23 leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the productions for NT22, I see:\n\nNT22 -> NT39 NT65\n\n...\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked it. Let me check:\n\nIn the list, under NT22:\n\nLooking through all NT22 productions:\n\nNT22-> NT39 NT65\n\nNT22-> NT31 NT5\n\nNT22-> NT37 NT22?\n\nWait, no, perhaps looking through the list:\n\nThe productions are a bit extensive. Wait, here's a portion:\n\nLooking through all productions for NT22:\n\n- NT22 -> NT39 NT65\n- NT22 -> NT31 NT5\n- NT22 -> NT37 NT22\n- NT22 -> NT54 NT5\nSo, none of these produce t29. Perhaps I've missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t29 comes from a different non-terminal. Let me check NT23.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions: NT23-> NT54 NT33, and NT23-> NT54 NT30 (Wait, no, looking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT23:\n\n- NT23-> NT54 NT33\n- NT23-> NT54 NT30\n- NT23-> NT15 NT65\nWait, I don't see any 't29' in any of NT23's productions.\n\nHmmm, this is an issue because t29 is not appearing in any of the given productions. That suggests that the string might not be derivable, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the productions for another non-terminal include t29.\n\nLooking through the list again.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that has 't29' in its productions. For example, maybe NT22 has a production with 't29' but I don't see it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their possible terminals.\n\nLet me go through each NT and see if any production leads to a terminal (t14, t15, etc.):\n\nLooking through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT2: produces 't69' via NT2->'t69'\n\n- NT7: ?\n\nNo, perhaps it's better to note that if any NT leads to t29, then the production exists. Since I don't see t29 in any non-terminal's production, perhaps the string cannot be generated. But let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Is there any production I missed? Let me re-examine the productions.\n\nLooking through the entire list, I can see that no non-terminal directly produces 't29'. All the terminals listed are from a few NTs.\n\nSo, perhaps 't29' is not present anywhere as a terminal production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is useful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and it produces NT3 NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. \n\nLet's break down NT3.

Looking at NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. Wait, no. Alternatively, NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT2. Wait, no.

Let me list each terminal and what they can come from:\n\n- t17 \u2192 NT3\n- t63 \u2192 NT49 (since NT49 \u2192 t74? Wait, no. Wait, NT49's rule is: NT49 \u2192 t12.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nOh, I see, some entries say things like \"t17\", \"t63\", etc. So each non-terminal is defined as a combination of terminals.\n\nFor example, NT3 is defined as NT17 NT6, and NT17 is defined as NT8 NT58, and so on. But for the terminals, they directly correspond to a specific token.\n\nSo, each terminal is associated with a specific non-terminal. For instance:\n\nT17 comes from NT3, T63 comes from NT25 (since NT25 \u2192 t63?), or wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the rules are written as \"NTabc \u2192 tdef\".

So NT6 is a terminal that represents 't63'.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 \u2192 NT71 NT40, etc., but some non-terminals map directly to terminals.\n\nSo let's list each terminal and its corresponding non-terminal:\n\n- t17 corresponds to NT3\n- t63 corresponds to NT6\n- t14 corresponds to NT14\n- t30 corresponds to NT30\n- t74 corresponds to NT44\n- t27 corresponds to NT54\n- t8 corresponds to NT74\n- t22 corresponds to NT22\n- t78 corresponds to NT78\n- t50 corresponds to NT50\n- t24 corresponds to NT75\n- t70 corresponds to NT70\n- t10 corresponds to NT40\n- t85 corresponds to NT51 or others\n- t98 corresponds to NT98\n- t9 corresponds to NT99?

{"custom_id":"request-232","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Chomsky Normal Form is a way of structuring grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is really useful because it simplifies parsing, like with the CYK algorithm, but for this problem, I don't need to implement any parsing algorithms. My focus is just on figuring out if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the grammar provided. It looks pretty extensive with multiple non-terminals and productions. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't54', 't24', etc. My string to evaluate is `t54 t24 t14 t18 t61 t8 t63 t12 t14 t14 t51 t9 t24 t10`.\n\nThe grammar's productions define how non-terminals can be broken down into other non-terminals or terminals. Since it's in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. That means each rule is a single step, so the derivation process would involve multiple steps where each rule is applied.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to work backwards from the string, trying to see if each segment of the string can be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar. Essentially, building parse trees in reverse to see if the entire string can be constructed.\n\nLooking at the string, the length is 14 tokens, so each token is a terminal. Let's list them for clarity:\n1. t54\n2. t24\n3. t14\n4. t18\n5. t61\n6. t8\n7. t63\n8. t12\n9. t14\n10. t14\n11. t51\n12. t9\n13. t24\n14. t10\n\nI'll start from the first token, t54. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production where a non-terminal (A) can produce t54. Looking through the productions, I see that NT49 \u2192 t12, and NT54 \u2192 t9, but I'm looking for t54. Wait, actually, looking through the list, I see that NT49 is rewritten as t74, but that's not relevant here. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan the entire set:\n\nLooking at NT44 \u2192 t60 appears on line 18, but that's for NT44. Wait, line 13: NT44 -> t68. Line 1: S -> NT3 NT77. So S is the start symbol, which goes to NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, the grammar has a lot of non-terminals. Maybe a better approach is to see where each terminal occurs on the right side of the productions. So, for each terminal in the string, check if there's a production that directly maps a non-terminal to it.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n1. t54: Looking at the productions, NT69 is not listed in the RHS as a terminal. Wait, no. Let's check each production line:\n\n- Line 2: NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36 \u2192 so NT20 produces NT44 and NT36. So no terminal here.\n- Line 45: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. No terminal.\n- Line 20: NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82. NT68 is line ???\nWait, maybe I should go through each terminal in the string and see if they are on the RHS of any production as a single terminal. Let's list all the terminals in the string: t54, t24, t14, t18, t61, t8, t63, t12, t14, t14, t51, t9, t24, t10.\n\nSo, for each of these:\n\nt54: Looking through the productions to see if any NT \u2192 t54. I see that:\n\n- Line 50: NT54 \u2192 t83. No, that's a production, but it's t83.\n- Line 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. No.\n- Line 21: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. No.\n- Line 14: NT36 \u2192 NT70 NT33. So, NT36 can produce NT70 and NT33. NT33 is line 33: NT33 \u2192 t10. So t33 is t10. So NT36 can produce t70 and t10. Hmm, not t54.\n\nWait, maybe t54 is from NT54, but looking at the productions, NT54 \u2192 t83 (line 50), so only t83.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look further. Let me check line 25: NT25 \u2192 NT50 NT33. So, NT25 can produce t50 (from line 48: NT50 \u2192 t24) and t33 (t10). So, NT25 can produce t50 or t33. Line 42: NT48 \u2192 t18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting somewhere. Let me make a list:\n\nt54: Not directly a production, so must come from a chain of derivations. So, to produce t54, there must be a non-terminal A such that A \u2192 NT something, which can produce t54.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I see that NT25 \u2192 NT50 NT33, and NT50 \u2192 t24. So NT25 can produce t24 and t33, which are t24 and t10. Hmm, but t54 isn't in that context. Alternatively, NT33 \u2192 t10, so I don't think that leads to t54.\n\nWait, is there any NT \u2192 t54? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT with t54 as a terminal. The closest is NT49 \u2192 t12, but not 54. Wait, line 53: NT79 \u2192 t72? No, t79 goes to t22 and t22. Line 21: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\u2192 t50 and t68 may be linked elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe t54 comes from NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 t70 and t6 (which is another non-terminal, NT6). NT6 \u2192 t63. So, NT3 \u2192 t70 and t63.\n\nSo, let's consider this step by step:\n\nThe first token is t54. But from the productions above, I can't find any NT directly producing t54. Therefore, if the string starts with t54, it would have to come from a larger non-terminal that can derive t54 through a chain. But since in the given grammar, there's no non-terminal that directly produces t54, perhaps t54 can only be produced by a non-terminal that itself is derived from other non-terminals, and if that chain ever leads to t54.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, no two-step productions except for terminals.\n\nWait, each production can only generate a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, for t54 to appear in the string, there must be a production that directly produces t54, or a non-terminal that can derive to t54 through a series of such steps. But looking at the grammar, there's no production where any non-terminal directly produces t54. Therefore, the string cannot contain t54 because the grammar doesn't produce it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the productions.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 t54. So, perhaps the string starts with a terminal that isn't present in the grammar, meaning the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me check all the productions just to be thorough. Looking through:\n\n- Line 1: S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 which could produce t70 and t8 (from NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 \u2192 t50 and t68, and NT68 might be t50? Wait, no. NT68 is on line 44: NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. NT49 is line 49: NT49 \u2192 t74. So NT68 \u2192 t74 and NT25. NT25 can produce t50 and t33. So NT68 could produce t74 and t50 or t33.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but the point is, t54 is not directly produced by any NT, so if"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string has only terminals, and each terminal corresponds to a rule in the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number points to a specific production. For example, t17 corresponds to NT3 -> t17 NT6, and t74 corresponds to NT17 -> t70 NT18, etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. But in our case, all terminals are single symbols. So the derivation should consist of breaking down each non-terminal into the relevant two parts, each time expanding them until we get all terminals, matching the string.\n\nLet me try to map the string to the non-terminals in the grammar. Starting with the entire string: `t17 t74 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t32 t69 t35 t14 t18 t61 t8`. Since the start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT3 NT77, each of these must be expanded into the respective sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I see that each NT (like NT3, NT74, etc.) will need to be broken down into their corresponding terminals. Each step in the grammar takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two other symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, etc., but in Chomsky NF, it's always two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Wait, no, in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals? Wait, no, in CNF, A \u2192 a is allowed for terminals, but in standard CNF, the rules are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but typically, a is a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but sometimes in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but B and C can be terminals or non-terminals, but in Chomsky's original normal form, I think it's more precise that it's two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, looking at the grammar provided, some of the non-terminals produce terminals directly, like NT83 \u2192 't44', etc. So it's a mix of some productions being two non-terminals and others being a terminal.\n\nBut regardless, to parse the string, I can approach it as a series of steps where each non-terminal expands into parts of the string. Let me try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nFrom the string, let's see the order. The string is:\n\nt17 t74 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t32 t69 t35 t14 t18 t61 t8\n\nWait, but S is NT3 followed by NT77. So in the initial step, S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nLet me check what NT3 and NT77 expand into, in terms of their terminals.\n\nLooking at NT3 \u2192 t17 NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 is a non-terminal; let me see what it expands into. Looking through the rules, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo S expands into (t17 NT6) (NT68 NT44). Wait, but NT77's productions: looking at the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT77 becomes t17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, each non-terminal in these positions must be expanded into their respective parts.\n\nSo let's unpack each non-terminal:\n\n1. NT6: From the rules, let's see NT6\u2192 t63.\n\nSo 1: t17 t63.\n\nNow, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25.\n\nSo NT68 is replaced by NT49 and NT25.\n\nSo now we have t17 t63 NT49 NT25.\n\nNext NT49 \u2192 t49? Wait, looking at the rules, I might have mixed up. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT49 \u2192 't74'? Or wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the given grammar includes rules like NT83 \u2192 't44', but for NT49, looking through the provided rules, I see entries that start with NT49.

Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S directly produces NT3 NT77. So, any valid derivation must start with NT3 and NT77. \n\nThe given string starts with `t69 t14 t17 t69 t61 t8 t10 t90 t14 t14 t63 t12 t14 t14 t60`. Looking at the first part, t69, t14, etc. I notice that the string splits into parts, so I should break it down step by step.\n\nLet me see if the string can be broken down into components that match the grammar's rules. Starting with NT3 and NT77 from S:\n\n1. NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 (from NT3's production)\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58 (production for NT17)\n3. NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50 (from NT8)\n4. NT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65 (from NT30)\n5. NT49 \u2192 't74' (terminal)\n6. NT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2 (from NT65)\n7. NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 (from NT77)\n8. NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25 (from NT68)\n9. NT49 \u2192 't74' (again)\n10. NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5 (from NT25)\n11. NT31 \u2192 NT14 (from NT31, as no further production seems to fit)\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Let me take another look at the string and see if I can parse it correctly. I should try to match the string to the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the first t69, which comes from NT74's production `t60`, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me refer to the grammar rules to see how each part can generate the string.\n\nAnother approach is to try performing a top-down derivation, starting from S and seeing if I can generate the entire string.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT77\n2. Now, I need to see if NT3 and NT77 can produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT49 \u2192 't74'\nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\nNT31 \u2192 NT14\nWait, that gives us t74 t14, but the string starts with t69 t14. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT77 \u2192 NT64 NT17 or something else, but wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT74 as a terminal except for specific rules. Looking back, let me check the grammar rules for NT74.\n\nWait, I see that NT74 \u2192 't75', NT77 \u2192 't32', and so on. But none of the non-terminals produce t69 directly. Looking at the provided grammar, I see rules where NT67 \u2192 't56', NT65 \u2192 't46', etc. However, t69 is not directly derived from any non-terminal in the provided rules.\n\nWait, looking at NT22: NT22 \u2192 t78, and NT74 \u2192 't60', but I don't see a production that leads to 't69' from any non-terminal. So if the string starts with t69, and there's no rule in the grammar that produces t69 from any non-terminal, then the string cannot be generated. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any of the non-terminals produce t69. Looking through all the grammar rules, I see various terminals like t74, t8, t17, t65, etc., but I don't see any rules that result in t69. For example, NT58 \u2192 t54, but that's not t69.\n\nTherefore, since there's no production rule that allows a non-terminal to produce t69, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Even though some other non-terminals produce tokens, none of them produce t69. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss a production that leads to t69. Scanning through the provided grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t69. For example, NT17 \u2192 t7 and t58, but those don't help with t69. Also, NT74 \u2192 't60', which is different.\n\nSo, the first token in the string is t69, but since no rule in the grammar produces t69, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The end symbols (like 't24') are terminals, so they correspond to single symbols in the string.\n\nFirst, I need to map the string tokens to the corresponding terminals in the grammar. Looking at the grammar rules, 't54' is directly mapped to NT54, 't24' to NT24, and so on. So each token like 't54' is a terminal derived from NT54, etc.\n\nThe grammar uses the start symbol S which expands to NT3 NT77, as per S -> NT3 NT77. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then, each NT3 and NT77 can further expand.\n\nLooking at NT77 in the grammar: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So, NT77 expands into NT68 and NT44. Now, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, and NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18, as per the rules.\n\nSo, starting from S:\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nNow, NT49 in the grammar is mapped to 't54' as per NT49 \u2192 't49'.

For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT8 \u2192 't35', etc. So the string is a sequence of 't's, each representing a terminal derived from an NT.\n\nSo, we have to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-272","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. First, I need to understand the grammar and the string properly.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S, which produces NT3 NT77. So S is the beginning, and it immediately breaks into two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. Each of these non-terminals then produces other combinations, like NT44 NT36 for NT20, and so on.\n\nLooking closer, some of these non-terminals are terminal symbols, identified by the 't' followed by a number. For example, NT3 is 't17', NT18 is 't8', and so on. My goal is to parse the given string to see if it can be derived from S using this grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t65 t73 t63 t74 t14 t14 t78 t8.\n\nEach part of the string is separated by a space, which suggests that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, start symbol S never appears on the right side.\n\nEach production in the grammar seems to be two non-terminals on the right and a terminal on the right only in specific cases. Wait, actually, looking back, most of the productions are of the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, except when they are terminals like NT3 \u2192 t17, etc.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminal symbols. We need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo check this, maybe I can model the derivation step by step, simulating how the grammar can produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string using the grammar rules. Since each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a single terminal, the string must be a combination of these.\n\nLet me list the string components:\n\nt54, t24, t14, t29, t61, t74, t14, t14, t65, t73, t63, t74, t14, t14, t78, t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT3 \u2192 t17, NT8 \u2192 t35, etc. Others produce other non-terminals.\n\nI think a way to approach this is to see if the string can be broken down into the correct sequence of productions.\n\nLet's start with the string: t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t65 t73 t63 t74 t14 t14 t78 t8.\n\nFirst, looking for which non-terminals produce what.\n\n- t54: Let's see which NT can produce t54. Looking at the grammar, NT54 \u2192 t9 and other productions? Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT54 has multiple productions. For example, NT54 \u2192 NT82 NT98, NT54 \u2192 something else? Wait, let me scan the grammar again.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT82 NT98.\n\nAlso, elsewhere: NT54 \u2192 t9. Hmm, wait, I'm looking at the provided grammar, and under NT54, it says:\n\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\nNT54 -> t9.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar under NT54 is:\n\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\n...\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, for NT54, the only production is NT54 \u2192 t9. So NT54 produces 't9'. So if the string has t54, that's not possible unless t54 is a terminal, which it's not. So this might be a problem. Or perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, there's a production:\n\nNT54 -> t9.\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT54 only produces 't9'. Therefore, t54 in the string can't be produced by any rule, since NT54 can only produce t9. So that suggests that the string has a terminal 't54', which isn't possible because in the grammar, NT54 only can give 't9'. So does that mean the string cannot be generated? But I'm not sure because maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the section for NT54 is:\n\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\n...\n\nBut wait, somewhere else in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 -> t9.\n\nYes, so NT54 has two productions: one that produces 't9' and another that produces NT82 NT98. Wait, but that can't be right. Each non-terminal in Chomsky normal form should have productions with exactly two non-terminals on the right. Unless the 't9' is the only production for that NT. Wait, perhaps I'm misparsing the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, I think I might have messed up the grammar structure.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except for the start symbol.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it indeed follows CNF because all productions are either non-terminals splitting into two non-terminals or non-terminals ending with a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of substitutions using the given rules.\n\nI'll start by examining each production rule. Some of them already have terminals; the right-hand sides of these can be constants. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, but NT17 has a rule that eventually leads to a terminal, and so on.\n\nBut the string has 16 symbols, all of which seem to be terminals. To derive such a string, it must be generated by a series of productions that lead to these terminals through intermediate non-terminals. Since each production in CNF splits into two non-terminals, the derivation tree would have a certain structure.\n\nI think a way to approach this is to look for a path from S down to the given string. Starting from S, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, both of which are non-terminals. Each of these needs to be expanded into a sequence of terminals or non-terminals. Since the string starts with multiple t70s, I should check the productions that directly produce t70.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT74 \u2192 t74, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT79 \u2192 t79, and NT82 \u2192 t82. Also, NT2 \u2192 t69, NT54 \u2192 t83, NT65 \u2192 t46, and others. But I'm especially looking for 't70' in the productions. Let me check each rule where a non-terminal can produce 't70'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT74 \u2192 NT77 NT82. Wait, but NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. Hmm, maybe that's not leading to 't70'. Alternatively, looking at NT65 \u2192 NT98 NT26, but NT98 \u2192 NT93 NT16, and so on. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Now, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. NT49 \u2192 NT65 NT98, which isn't directly helpful. NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5. NT31 \u2192 NT14, which is a terminal, but maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, looking for 't70': Let's see which non-terminals produce 't70'. Wait, I see in the rules that NT17 \u2192 't70', and NT95 \u2192 't61', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the ones that end with a terminal directly:\n\nNT83 \u2192 't13'\nNT75 \u2192 't79'\nNT98 \u2192 't93'\nNT93 \u2192 't54'\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT44 \u2192 't68'\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\nNT39 \u2192 NT30 NT65\nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\nNT23 \u2192 NT29\nNT54 \u2192 't82'\nNT18 \u2192 't8'\nNT70 \u2192 't78'\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\nNT74 \u2192 't75'\nNT59 \u2192 't17'\nNT33 \u2192 't10'\nNT74 \u2192 't30'\nNT95 \u2192 't61'\nNT93 \u2192 't54'\nNT0 \u2192 't8'\nNT65 \u2192 't46'\nNT23 \u2192 't29'\nNT37 \u2192 't83'\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me approach it differently.\n\nGiven the string is a series of terminals, I can check whether each part of the string can be derived by the grammar. To do this, I can try to represent the possible expansion of the non-terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the string will start with whatever NT3 produces and whatever NT77 produces.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. NT5 \u2192 NT25. NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5. NT5 is 't14'. NT31 \u2192 NT14, which is 't14'. So NT25 would produce t14, t31, but wait, maybe it's better to build the possible sequences step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a table or something to track each possible production, but this might take time.\n\nWait, perhaps it's faster to look for the string in the production rules directly. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t70 t63 t63 t24 t10 t78 t54 t27 t61 t8 t15 t27 t8 t54 t90 t14 t14\n\nHmm, that's 16 symbols. Since each production splits into two, the derivation tree will have depth such that the number of symbols increases exponentially. But since the string is a linear sequence, it must be that each production is directly producing terminals without further splitting, or that splits are arranged in a way that the terminals line up in sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a series of expansions starting from S, moving down. Let me try to parse the string backward.\n\nThe last symbol is 't14', which is a terminal. Let's see which non-terminals can end with 't14'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85, but NT5 is 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't70'\n- NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5 (t14)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18; NT22 \u2192 t78, etc. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking for a production that ends with 't14' as the last symbol:\n\nLooking at the production rules, 't14' is directly produced by NT8 (as in S \u2192 NT83 NT16, but that's not the end). Wait, no: Checking each rule, I see NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54. NT54 \u2192 t83 and NT54 \u2192 t83. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me attempt to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar, considering that we're using leftmost derivation.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. NT5 \u2192 't14'. NT85 \u2192 NT74 NT51. NT74 \u2192 't75'. NT51 \u2192 NT93 NT16. NT93 \u2192 't54'. NT16 \u2192 't8'. So the path so far is generating 't14', 't75', 't54', 't8'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me write down the initial steps:\n\n- Start with S: S \u2192 NT3 NT65 (Wait, original rule for S is S\u2192NT3 NT77, not NT65. I must have misread before. No, in the given grammar, S is S\u2192NT3 NT77. So let's stick with that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Now, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85.

{"custom_id":"request-295","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t17 t74 t24 t10 t87 t63 t14 t14 t72 t61 t63 t24 t10 t78 t71 t61 t8`. \n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The left-hand side is a single non-terminal. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with two others or with a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, many non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals. For example, NT3 is 't17', NT18 is 't8', and so on. So perhaps this grammar acts as a direct substitution for some of the symbols.\n\nWait, the user provided the entire grammar where each non-terminal either expands into two non-terminals, except for some that map to terminals. So the idea is that the string is a series of terminals, and we need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT77. So first, S must expand into NT3 and NT77. Then each of these can either expand further or be terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t17. From the grammar, NT3 is 't17', so the second symbol is another t17. Wait, no, in the string, the first is t17, second is t74, third t24, etc. So t17 is from NT3, which appears in S's production as NT3 NT77.\n\nSo let's break it down step by step. The string starts with t17, which is NT3. So the first non-terminal is NT3, which is 't17'. Then the second token is t74, which is NT74. So NT77 needs to expand into NT74 somewhere because S starts with NT77 after NT3.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is NT3 NT77. So the string starts with t17, which comes from NT3. Then the next token is t74, which is NT74. But NT77's production is needed to get t74. Let me check NT77's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT77 has productions like NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Then NT68 is NT77 NT2, which eventually leads to terminals. Hmm, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse engineer the string by starting from the end and seeing if the entire string can be built up from S.\n\nBut considering the length, the string has 17 tokens. Let's count how that maps to the grammar. Each NT production either leads to two tokens (if non-terminal) or one token (if terminal). So the maximum possible length after expanding S would be 2^(n-1) where n is the number of steps, but given the string is 17, which is odd, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals expand to terminals, so the length could be more controlled.\n\nWait, actually, the number of tokens isn't directly tied to the number of steps. Each expansion can either add more symbols or replace a single symbol with two. So the number of tokens can grow exponentially, but in this case, the string is 17 tokens, which is manageable.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\n1. The first token is t17, which is NT3. So S must expand to NT3 and NT77, which consumes the first t17, leaving the rest to be formed from NT77.\n\n2. The next token is t74, which is NT74. Looking at NT77's productions, I don't see a direct production to NT74. Let me check:\n\nNT77:\n- NT77 -> NT68 NT44\n- NT77 -> NT68 NT44 (is there anything else? No. So NT77 must expand into NT68 NT44. Then each of those would expand further.\n\nSo after the first step, the string is t17 t74 t10 t87 t63 t14 t14 t72 t61 t63 t24 t10 t78 t71 t61 t8.\n\nWait, no, actually, the string is already the sequence, so I need to see if starting from S, after expanding all possible non-terminals, whether this sequence can be formed.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to map each symbol to its possible parent in the grammar.\n\nLet's build a parse tree for the string step by step, starting from the root S.\n\nS -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the string starts with t17 (NT3) and then the next symbol must come from NT77. So the second symbol is t74, which is NT74. So the next non-terminal after NT77 must be NT74.\n\nWait, no, because NT77 must expand into two symbols: NT68 and NT44. So the second symbol would come from NT68, which could be a terminal or further expansion.\n\nNT68 is 't77' (from NT68 -> t77?), let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT68 -> t78? Wait, not exactly. Wait, in the grammar, some NTs have terminals, like NT8 -> 't35', etc. But looking for t74, which is NT74. How do we get t74 from NT77?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the second symbol t74 comes from NT77 expanding into something else, but in the grammar, NT77's only production is NT68 NT44. So the second symbol should come from NT68, which may itself be a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, the second token is t74, which is not a terminal, because in the grammar, NT74 is a terminal with value t74. So for the second symbol to be t74, one of the symbols from NT77's expansion must be NT74. But NT77's expansion is NT68 and NT44. So unless one of those expansions leads to NT74, which they don't, because in the grammar, NT74 is 't74' directly.\n\nWait, that would mean that in the string, after t17, the next token should come from NT68 or NT44. Since NT68 is 't78' (from some productions), and NT44 is 't44'. So the string's second symbol is t74, which would mean neither NT68 nor NT44 produce t74, which seems impossible. So perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me check the grammar again. Looking through the grammar, the only place where t74 appears is as terminal for NT74, right?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> t74? Or is it another path?\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. The grammar is given in a format where some non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, and some expand into terminals.\n\nLooking systematically, for example, NT74 has rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I don't see NT74 expanding into any other non-terminals except where?\n\nWait, actually, looking through the list:\n\n- NT77: '-> NT68 NT44' and so on. But for NT74, let's see: does it have any rules? Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> t75 (from NT74 -> NT75 -> t79 or something? Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, NT74 has a production: NT74 -> t75? Or is there another production.\n\nWait, scanning through the provided rules, I see for NT74:\n\n- NT74 -> t74 (I think). Because one entry is '-> t74' after NT74. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list, yes:\n\n\"NT74 -> t74\"\n\"NT74 -> t75\"\n\"NT74 -> t75\" again? Wait, no, perhaps it's the same rule. Let me check:\n\nIn the provided grammar, under the NT lines, I see:\n\n\"NT74 -> t74\"\n\nAnd then:\n\n\"NT74 -> t75\"\n\nWait, no, wait, in the provided transcription, the entries are:\n\n\"NT74 -> NT75 NT11\"\n\n\"NT74 -> t75\"\n\nSo NT74 can expand into either NT75 and NT11 or directly into 't75'?\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo in the way they listed the grammar, but according to the data, each line is a production rule. So for NT74, there are multiple productions:\n\n1. NT74 -> t74\n\n2. NT74 -> t75\n\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-309","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. That simplifies parsing a bit, but the string is quite long, so I should probably approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar rules and the string we need to evaluate. The string is: `t17 t63 t14 t14 t7 t54 t27 t61 t63 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 t44 t90 t24 t10`. That's 19 tokens, so each token is a terminal, probably representing a single character or a number, but in this context, each 't' followed by a number is a separate symbol.\n\nThe grammar has several NT rules leading down to terminals. Let me list out the grammar to see how the non-terminals generate into terminals.\n\nStarting from the start symbol, S.\n\n- S \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nNT3 is an intermediate non-terminal. Let's follow that:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nNT17 and NT6. Looking at NT17:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n- NT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nSo NT17 breaks down further. NT58:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85\n- NT5 \u2192 t14\n- NT85 \u2192 NT23 NT16\n- NT23 \u2192 NT29 NT39 (I don't think we need this path for now)\n- NT16 \u2192 NT95 NT18\n- NT95 \u2192 t61\n- NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n\nContinuing, NT6 is another non-terminal:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 T? Looking at NT6, it's not in the top-level, but in the grammar, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, so perhaps NT6 corresponds to a terminal? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any production for NT6. It only appears in NT37 \u2192 NT85 NT0, and NT0 which leads to 't8'. But NT6 isn't a non-terminal that goes into a terminal, so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a rule for NT6. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82\n- NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36\n- NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT6 could be another non-terminal, but in the grammar provided, there's no rule for NT6. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see NT6 as a left-hand side of any production except as part of NT3's production. So perhaps NT37's production has NT0, which goes to 't8'. So maybe NT37 could produce terminals. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map each non-terminal to its possible terminals. Let me go through each NT rule:\n\n1. NT39 \u2192 NT30 NT65\n2. NT30 \u2192 t54\n3. NT65 \u2192 NT77 NT2\n4. NT54 \u2192 NT82 NT98\n5. NT82 \u2192 NT65 NT17\n\nHmm, but this might lead into cycles, which would mean the string might be impossible to parse without a certain rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to build a parsing tree step by step.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt17 t63 t14 t14 t7 t54 t27 t61 t63 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 t44 t90 t24 t10\n\nLet's reverse the string because, often when parsing, it's easier to go from the end. Reverse the string to get:\n\nt10 t24 t90 t74 t61 t16 t63 t14 t94 t76 t73 t39 t14 t63 t14 t69 t61 t74 t17\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in reversing. Let me do that properly.\n\nWait, the original string is:\n\nt17 t63 t14 t14 t7 t54 t27 t61 t63 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 t44 t90 t24 t10\n\nSo, in order, the tokens are:\n\n1. t17\n2. t63\n3. t14\n4. t14\n5. t7\n6. t54\n7. t27\n8. t61\n9. t63\n10. t14\n11. t14\n12. t69\n13. t61\n14. t8\n15. t44\n16. t90\n17. t24\n18. t10\n\nSo when reversed, it's:\n\nt10, t24, t90, t44, t8, t61, t61, t72 (Wait, no, wait, no.

The original list is as written, so reversing would be:\n\n18. t10\n\n17. t24\n\n16. t90\n\n15. t44\n\n14. t8\n\n13. t61\n\n12. t63\n\n11. t14\n\n10. t14\n\n9. t63\n\n8. t27\n\n7. t54\n\n6. t61\n\n5. t7\n\n4. t14\n\n3. t14\n\n2. t63\n\n1. t17\n\nSo, maybe it's easier to parse bottom-up.

It can expand further:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nNT30 \u2192 t54\n\nSo, going down:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\n\u2192 (NT30) (something else?)\n\nWait, perhaps I need to map this out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a mapping from each NT to its possible terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should note that each NT either produces a terminal or two NTs.\n\nSince this could take a while, perhaps a better approach is to model this with symbols and see if each part can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all the possible terminal symbols each NT can represent.\n\nLet me try to create a dictionary mapping each NT to its possible terminal strings.\n\nStarting with NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nThen, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nNT30 \u2192 t54\n\nSo, tracing this, NT3 NT77 produces:\n\nt54 from NT30 and something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

The grammar provided has all rules in CNF since each production is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules. Since the grammar is context-free, each step of the derivation only depends on replacing a single non-terminal symbol with a pair of non-terminals that eventually lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that several non-terminals produce terminals. For example, S -> NT3 NT77, which might lead to sequences starting with t32 (from NT77) and t3 (from NT3). But looking at the string, it starts with t35, which is produced by NT65 -> t46, but wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, NT65 has two productions: one to t74 and NT74, and another to t46 and NT26. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT65 has entries:\n- NT65 -> NT77 NT2\n- NT65 -> t74\n- NT65 -> t46 NT26\n- NT65 -> t40 NT26\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT65 productions:\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes lines like:\nNT65 -> NT77 NT2\nNT65 -> NT75 NT21\nNT65 -> NT98 NT26\nNT65 -> NT82 NT44\nNT65 -> NT84 NT98 (Wait, no, checking again, I think I might be misremembering. Wait, the user input is a bit messy. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, some lines are:\n\nNT65:\n- NT65 -> NT77 NT2\n- NT65 -> NT75 NT21\n- NT65 -> NT98 NT26\n- NT82 -> NT65 NT17\n- NT82 -> NT79 NT16\n- NT26 -> NT5 NT48\n- NT26 -> NT37 NT30\n- NT15 -> 't44'\n- NT49 -> 't74'\n- NT65 -> 't88'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n- NT44 -> 't60'\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- etc.\n\nWait, no, NT65 has several productions, including NT65 -> t88. So one of the productions for NT65 is NT65 -> t88.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t35. Which non-terminals produce 't35'? Looking through the productions, I see NT25 -> t14 and NT65 is mentioned to produce t35? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, one production is NT8 -> t35. So NT8 can produce t35. Also, NT22 -> t78, NT31 -> t14, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit muddled. Maybe I should approach this methodically.\n\nI think the best way is to construct a parse tree for the given string, starting from the start symbol S and trying to match the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two symbols on the right, so each step in the parse tree splits a symbol into two, which may themselves be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven the string, each 't' is a terminal, and each NT is a non-terminal. But the string only consists of terminals, so the parse tree should consist of non-terminals expanding into terminals, and each expansion step corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut let's break down the string:\n\nThe string is:\nt35 t14 t54 t24 t14 t18 t61 t8 t63 t56 t63 t63 t14 t14 t51 t9 t24 t10\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so each must be produced by some non-terminal. Let me list the order:\n\n1. t35\n2. t14\n3. t54\n4. t24\n5. t14\n6. t18\n7. t61\n8. t8\n9. t63\n10. t56\n11. t63\n12. t63\n13. t14\n14. t14\n15. t51\n16. t9\n17. t24\n18. t10\n\nI need to see if these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S expands to NT3 and NT77. So S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo in the parse tree, the root is S, which splits into NT3 and NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 has production:\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 -> NT68 NT44, according to the line \"NT77 -> NT68 NT44\".\n\nSo NT77 splits into NT68 and NT44.\n\nNow, NT68 -> NT49 NT25, so NT68 splits into NT49 and NT25.\n\nNT49 can produce 't74' or other options. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT49 has production: NT49 -> t74. So if NT49 is expanded, it produces 't74'.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> NT31 NT5, according to \"NT25 -> NT31 NT5\". NT31 -> t14, and NT5 -> t14. So NT31 is t14, NT5 is t14, so NT25 can produce t14 t14, which is t14 t14.\n\nWait, let's think step by step from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t35. So the first symbol is t35. That must come from one of the non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT37 -> t70, NT36 -> t50, etc. Wait, from the grammar, the production NT8 -> t35 is present. So perhaps t35 comes from NT8.\n\nBut in S's first expansion, we have NT3 and NT77. So how does t35 come into play? It must come from one of these. So either NT3 or NT77 must be producing t35.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT3 -> NT17 NT6, so that's two non-terminals. It can't directly produce a terminal. So T3 cannot produce t35 directly.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions: NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Neither can directly produce a terminal. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S -> NT3 NT77, which then each of these can split further. So maybe NT77 splits into NT68 and NT44, both of which again split, etc., until their symbols produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire parse tree for the given string.\n\nBut it's going to take a while, so perhaps I can find if the string's length is compatible.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each expansion step either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or replaces it with a terminal. So the number of symbols in the string can be determined by the number of steps in the derivation.\n\nIn our case, the string is 18 symbols. Starting from S, which splits into two symbols, each of which can split again, etc. The length can be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. But the given string has length 18, which is not a power of two. So this might be a problem.\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which is two symbols. Each of these can split into two, so after two steps, it's four symbols. Each step doubles the count. So to reach 18 symbols, which is not a power of two, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but actually, the number of symbols in a derivation following CNF will always be a power of two. Because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, so each step adds one symbol to the count. Wait, no, more accurately, each non-terminal replacement increases the count by one, so if starting with two symbols (for S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-334","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with the task of determining whether the provided string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t35 t14 t54 t24 t14 t18 t61 t63 t14 t14 t72 t61 t8 t63 t46 t70 t68 t63 t30`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the problem. The grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and there are no epsilon productions. The terminals are any strings that end in 't' with numbers, like t35, t14, etc. The start symbol is S, and from the initial productions, it looks like S is rewritten into NT3 and NT77. So, the string starts with combinations of NTs that eventually resolve into terminals.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string according to the given grammar, working step by step to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. \n\nLet me outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Identify the initial symbols**: Since the grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT77, the string must start with the symbols generated by NT3 and NT77. Looking at the string, the first token is t35. I'll need to see if t35 can be generated from NT3 or NT77.\n\n2. **Check NT3 and NT77 productions**: Looking at the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So, NT3 can be split into NT17 and NT6. Similarly, NT77 -> NT68 NT44. So, NT77 splits into NT68 and NT44.\n\n3. **Analyze each part**:\n   - For the first part, t35. From NT3, we get NT17 and NT6. Let's see what can generate t35 from NT17 or NT6.\n     - NT17 -> NT8 NT58. Then NT8 -> NT30 NT50. NT30 -> t54, which might be relevant. Wait, NT8's productions don't directly lead to t35. Alternatively, NT58? NT58 -> NT5 NT85. Then NT58 leads to NT5 and NT85. NT5 -> t14, and NT85: looking at NT85's production, it's NT3 NT67. NT67 -> t56. Hmm, that gives t56 from NT85. Not t35.\n     - From NT6, which is a terminal 't63'. But the token is t35, not t63. So this approach doesn't yield t35. So perhaps NT3 isn't the right path? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe I should check if any other NT can produce t35. Looking through the list of NTs, t35 is listed under NT8's production: NT8 -> t35. So perhaps if I have a way to derive NT8, that might give t35.\n\nBut from NT3, as per the productions, NT3 splits into NT17 and NT6. So if we can derive t35 from NT8, perhaps there's a way through NT8 being part of the derivation from NT17 or NT6. Wait, but NT8 is not directly connected to NT3 or NT77. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is S -> NT3 NT77. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT3 and NT77. So, the string is split into two parts: the first part must be the derivation from NT3, and the second part from NT77.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is a single application of S, so S is split into NT3 and NT77, and the string is the concatenation of the derivations of these two NTs.\n\nSo, the string provided is a sequence of terminals, which must come from the concatenation of the derivations of NT3 and NT77. So, the total string is the result of NT3's derivation followed by NT77's derivation.\n\nNow, the string given is `t35 t14 t54 t24 t14 t18 t61 t63 t14 t14 t72 t61 t8 t63 t46 t70 t68 t63 t30`. That's 19 tokens. So, I need the first, say, n tokens to be generated by NT3's derivation, and the rest by NT77's, where n can be determined by how many steps each NT takes to reach terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a parsing problem, trying to follow the grammar from the start symbol and see if the entire string can be covered.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string from the beginning, breaking each NT into its components.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first two symbols are t35 and t14.\n\nWait, wait, the string starts with t35 t14, which suggests that the initial NT3 is generating t35, and NT77 is generating t14? But wait, looking at the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So NT3 can't directly produce t35. Because NT3 is two non-terminals: NT17 and NT6. Similarly, NT77 starts as NT68 and NT44.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me get this straight. Each production in the grammar is a single non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals on the right side. So, if we have S -> NT3 NT77, that means S is split into NT3 and NT77, and the string must be the result of NT3's derivation followed by NT77's.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a result of NT3 --> something (ending at position n), then NT77 --> the rest of the string.\n\nSo, the string is split into two parts, first by NT3, then by NT77.\n\nSo, first, I'll split the string into two parts: the first m symbols generated by NT3, and the remaining (19 - m) symbols generated by NT77. I need to find m such that the first m symbols can be derived from NT3's productions, and the rest can be derived from NT77.\n\nBut how do I determine m? It could be that NT3 and NT77 derive strings of various lengths. So, perhaps I need to find any possible splitting.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the entire string from the start, symbol by symbol, trying to match each symbol against the possible derivations of the current non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the process: take the entire string and try to reduce it to the start symbol by applying reverse productions. Each symbol is a terminal, so we can look for possible parents that can produce these terminals or a combination of symbols.\n\nLet me outline the reverse approach:\n\n1. The string is a sequence of terminals. Starting from the end, we can try to find if any non-terminal can be reduced to the end of the string, considering their productions.\n\n2. Similarly, moving backwards, checking if any production can be matched.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nThe string is: [t35, t14, t54, t24, t14, t18, t61, t63, t14, t14, t72, t61, t8, t63, t46, t70, t68, t63, t30]\n\nLet me start from the end and try to match the productions of each NT to see if any can generate the suffix.\n\nThe last token is t30. Looking into the grammar, which NT can produce t30?\n\nLooking through the NTs, t30 appears under NT30 -> t30. Wait, but NT30 is a non-terminal defined as NT30 -> t30. So, if we have a production of NT30, we can match t30.\n\nSo, going backwards, the last step would be to find if there's an NT that can produce t30 as its last token.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see:\n\n- NT30 -> t30. So, if we have a production of NT30, it's directly t30.\n\nBut perhaps other NTs can also produce t30 via longer derivations.

{"custom_id":"request-330","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t69 t14 t14 t54 ...` and so on. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Here, the start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the rules are of the form NTnx -> NTny NTnz, except for the t rules, which are terminals. For example, some rules like NT3 -> 't17' indicate that expanding NT3 will produce the terminal string 't17'.\n\nSo, the process for checking if the string is in the language is to parse it from left to right, but since the grammar is CNF, a suitable parsing method is the CYK algorithm. However, since this seems a bit complex, I might try to approach it more directly by considering how the string could be generated through the rules.\n\nThe string provided is a series of 't' symbols with numbers attached. Each 't' number might correspond to a terminal expansion from a non-terminal. For instance, 't69' must come from a rule like NT69 -> 't69', but I don't see such a rule in the grammar. Wait, looking back, I see that NT74 has a rule NT74 -> 't75', but that's not helpful here. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. The 't' numbers correspond directly to the non-terminals. For example, the production NT74 -> 't75' means that when we expand NT74, it generates 't75'. So, each 'tX' in the string must correspond to an expansion from a non-terminal that immediately derives that 'tX'.\n\nSo, starting with the string 't69 t14 t54 t24 t14 t17 t56 t63 t56 t63 t74 t24 t10 t78 t54 t88 t90 t14 t14', I should check if each 'tX' can be produced by some non-terminal, and then trace back the derivation.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce 't' symbols. For example:\n\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n- NT14 -> 't73'\n- NT25 -> 't14'\n- NT83 -> 't51'\n- And others like NT49 -> 't74', NT2 -> 't69', etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I see 't14' occurs multiple times. So, let me see which non-terminals produce 't14'. Looking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT25 -> 't14'\n- Also, NT83 -> 't51', but that's 't51', which is not 't14'.\n\nSo, the 't14's in the string must come from NT25's productions. So, the first step would be to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of these terminals generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the 'tX' in the string and see which non-terminals produce them:\n\nLooking through the grammar, here's a list of non-terminals that directly produce 't's:\n\n- NT22 -> 't71' \u2192 71\n- NT25 -> 't14' \u2192 14\n- NT83 -> 't51' \u219251\n- NT74 -> 't75' \u219275\n- NT49 -> 't74' \u219274\n- NT26 -> 't44' \u219244\n- NT40 -> 't90' \u219290\n- NT51 -> 't27' \u219227\n- NT67 -> 't82' \u219282 (wait, no, NT67 has rules like NT67 -> 't82'?\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I have:\n\nNT54 -> 't83' etc. Let me check all the terminal rules:\n\nFrom the extensive grammar list, the terminal rules (where NTnx -> 't...' ) are:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't8'\n- NT20 -> 't65'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT77 -> 't32'\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT65 -> 't88' (two rules)\n- NT59 -> 't17'\n- NT85 -> 't23'\n- NT98 -> 't93'\n- NT58 -> 't5'\n- NT79 -> 't69'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n- NT75 -> 't79'\n- NT82 -> 't51'\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n- NT31 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT71 -> 't10'\n- NT37 -> 't70'\n- NT79 -> 't69'\n- NT15 -> 't44'\n- NT54 -> 't83'\n- NT50 -> 't24'\n- NT30 -> 't54'\n- NT49 -> 't74'\n- NT22 -> 't87'\n- Wait, this is getting too long. Let me focus.\n\nFor each 'tX' in the input string, I need to find a non-terminal that directly produces it. For example:\n\nt69: looking through the terminal rules, let's see:\n\nLooking at all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT2 -> 't69'\n- NT74 -> 't75' \u2192 t75\n- NT50 -> 't24'\n- NT79 -> 't69'\n- NT54 -> 't69'\n- NT26 -> 't44'\n- Others?\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT74 -> 't75' (which is t75)\nNT54 -> 't83' \u2192 t83\nWait, but for t69, there's:\n\n- NT54 -> 't69' (Wait, no, the grammar includes lines like NT54 -> 't69'?) Wait, looking again: Oh, in the grammar provided, I see a line: NT54 -> 't69'? Let me check. Looking through the grammar:\n\nYes, at the end, I see NT54 -> 't69'. So NT54 directly produces 't69'.\n\nSimilarly, NT79 -> 't69' is another rule.\n\nSo, t69 can come from NT54 or NT79.\n\nSimilarly, t14 comes from NT25.\n\nt54: looking for 't54' as a terminal. I see that NT75 -> 't79' (which is t79), so no. Wait, perhaps I'm looking for 't54' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, perhaps NT30 -> 't54'? Let me check:\n\nYes, in the grammar, there's NT30 -> 't54'.\n\nSo, t54 comes from NT30.\n\nPutting this together, the string is a series of tX's. I need to see if they can be grouped into valid production rules.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to parse the string using CYK, but I might not have time to do that step-by-step. Alternatively, I can try to generate the string step by step through the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So each step of derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. Wait, no\u2014in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal might produce a terminal.\n\nWait, so in our grammar, only some non-terminals produce terminals, and others produce non-terminals. So, during derivation, when expanding a non-terminal, if it's a 't-producing' non-terminal, it replaces with a single terminal. If it's a non-terminal that doesn't produce a terminal, it replaces with two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no: In CNF, all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right. Except for the start symbol, which may produce terminals in the initial rule. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, it seems that some non-terminals produce a terminal (those with rules like NT3 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. The first symbol is t17. Looking at the grammar, where does t17 come from?\n\nIn the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.

NT3 is 't17', and NT77 is 't32'. So the first two symbols should be 't17 t32', but the given string starts with 't17 t63 t14...'. So that can't be right. That means the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nSo maybe the string doesn't start with 't17', but instead, the NT3 produced by S goes somewhere else. Wait, but NT3 can only go to NT17 NT6, and their productions don't include any terminals except for NT3 \u2192 't17' and NT6 \u2192 't63'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT3 is part of a longer chain.

So that doesn't match. Hmm, that suggests that the initial expansion is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT3 doesn't directly produce 't17'; perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, I need to look at each non-terminal and see if any of them produce the given string.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be divided into two parts: from S \u2192 NT3 NT77 (t17 and NT77), and then NT77 \u2192 something.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't17', then 't63', which is NT6 \u2192 t63.\n\nSo perhaps NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, then NT68 needs to produce something that can yield 't63'.

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t35 t14 t18 t61 t8 t63 t74 t14 t14 t78 t54 t54 t61 t8 t17 t8 t54 t90 t14 t14`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, I'm seeing that some rules have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, but I should check if any rules have more than two symbols. From the rules, they all seem to be of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. So, it's in CNF.\n\nThe string consists of a series of `t` followed by numbers. From the grammar, I think `t` follows a digit, so perhaps each `tX` is a terminal symbol corresponding to the non-terminal NT_X. So, for example, `t14` would correspond to NT14.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 is `t35`, NT14 is `t70`, etc. So each `tX` represents a non-terminal NTX.\n\nThe string is 20 symbols, so let's parse it as 20 steps where each step is a production.\n\nI need to see if there's a way to derive this string step by step using the given productions. Alternatively, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string by seeing which non-terminals can produce a sequence leading to it.\n\nLet me write out the sequence of `t`s and numbers:\n\nt35, t14, t18, t61, t8, t63, t74, t14, t14, t78, t54, t54, t61, t8, t17, t8, t54, t90, t14, t14.\n\nWait, no, the string is: `t35 t14 t18 t61 t8 t63 t74 t14 t14 t78 t54 t54 t61 t8 t17 t8 t54 t90 t14 t14`.\n\nSo that's 20 tokens, each is a terminal `tX`.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is NT3 NT77.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT77, each are non-terminals. So the first step is to expand NT3 and NT77 into their respective sequences.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nNT3's productions: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, right? Yes, so starting with S, we'll have NT3 and NT77, each needs to be expanded.\n\nLet me write down the initial expansion:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nNow, expand NT3 first. NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, NT6 \u2192 NT49 NT65.\n\nSo after two steps, we have NT17 NT6 \u2192 (NT8 NT58) (NT49 NT65). But wait, in CNF, each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the expansion for S would be the leaves coming from both NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think recursively. Each production expands non-terminals, and terminals are leaves. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need a path from S to these terminals.\n\nLet me think in terms of parse trees. The string starts with t35, which is NT35. But looking at the grammar, I don't see a non-terminal NT35. Wait, that might be a problem. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar has productions like NT3 \u2192 t37? No, wait, looking at the grammar, the rules are all for non-terminals. I'm looking for each tX corresponding to NTX.\n\nSo, t35 corresponds to NT35. Do any non-terminals produce NT35? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT35 except perhaps in the 't' rules. Wait, the grammar at the end lists several NTs as producing terminals. For example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17? No, wait, looking at the end of the grammar, it lists:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17?\n\nWait, looking more carefully, at the bottom, the grammar has rules like NT35 isn't present. Wait, perhaps I misread. The grammar seems to be a list of rules where each line has a non-terminal on the left and a production on the right, which for some have a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, for example, some rules like NT17 \u2192 t8. So NT17 can produce t8.\n\nWait, I need to carefully list all the NTs and what they produce.\n\nFor example, looking at the very bottom, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t30 NT50? Or wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the bottom:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\n\nWait no, let me parse it line by line.\n\nLooking at the last entries:\n\nNT37 \u2192 t83 t40\n\nNT37 \u2192 t59 t0\n\nNT82 \u2192 t22 t22\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused because the grammar is written in a way that each rule's right-hand side is a series of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, for example, rule NT36 \u2192 t17 t79. That would mean NT36 can produce the terminals t17 and t79 in that order.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT54: it's listed as t82 t98, so NT54 \u2192 t82 t98.\n\nHmm, okay, so the grammar consists of many non-terminals, each producing a pair of terminal and non-terminal or two terminals, etc.\n\nBut to parse the given string, each `tX` must be the terminal produced by a non-terminal, so the non-terminal must have a production that includes that terminal.\n\nSo, for each `tX` in the string, there must be a non-terminal NTX such that NTX has a production that includes tX.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t17, which is correct, but for t35, is there any NT35? Let me scan the end of the grammar. It says:\n\nNT37 \u2192 t83 t40\n\nNT59 \u2192 t17 t...? Wait, I'm looking for a non-terminal that ends with t35.\n\nWait, perhaps the string includes t14, which is NT14.\n\nWait, let me step back.\n\nThe string is t35, which is NT35, but I don't see any rule for NT35 except maybe in the terminal productions. Looking more carefully, in the grammar, all the terminal production rules are written as NTX \u2192 tY ... . For example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17 (so when NT3 is derived, it becomes t17)\n\nSimilarly, NT15 \u2192 t44.\n\nWait, looking for NT35 in the terminal rules, is there any? For example, is there a production like NT35 \u2192 t35? Let me see the given rules at the end.\n\nLooking at the list, the terminal productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\n\nNT67 \u2192 t56\n\nNT93 \u2192 t27\n\nNT79 \u2192 t69\n\nNT22 \u2192 t78\n\nNT74 \u2192 t15\n\nNT7 \u2192 t63\n\nNT26 \u2192 t44.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule where NT35 \u2192 t35. So if the string has t35, then NT35 must be a terminal, but since the grammar doesn't have it, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check. The string starts with t35, so that would mean that at some point in the derivation, there's a non-terminal NT35 that produces t35. But since I don't see any rule for NT35, it's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe NT35 is produced by another non-terminal. For example, perhaps there's a non-terminal that can produce NT35 through a production that eventually leads to t35. But since the grammar's rules only have certain terminals, I need to see if t35 is among them.\n\nLooking through the terminal list, do any rules have NT35 \u2192 t35? It doesn't seem so. Therefore, the string includes a terminal that isn't present in the grammar's production rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A -> BC or A -> terminal. This is helpful because it ensures that the parse trees are binary and each step replaces a symbol with two others, leading to a derivation of length proportional to the string length.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77 (S -> NT3 NT77). So, the first step is to replace S with NT3 and NT77.\n\nNow, I need to look at NT3 and NT77 and see how they can produce terminal symbols. From the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Let's check NT17: NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT8 -> NT30 NT50, and NT50 -> NT24. Wait, but NT24 is a terminal? Looking back, I don't see NT24 as a terminal. Wait, in the rules, I see NT24 is on the right side as a terminal? Let me double-check. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some symbols end with a number preceded by 't', like 't42', 't13', etc. But there's a line NT83 -> 't51', and others like NT74 -> 't75'. Hmm, but NT24 isn't listed as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the productions:\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines like NT49 -> 't74', NT65 -> 't88', etc. So NT24 isn't listed as a terminal. That might be a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in how I'm parsing the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe NT24 is a non-terminal because it's not listed as a terminal. So if NT24 is a symbol that needs to be further expanded, then the string might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nLet me take the string and split it into tokens to understand the structure. The string is a series of 't' followed by two-digit numbers, each representing a symbol in the grammar. So I have tokens like t70, t63, t74, etc.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT3 NT77.\n\nFirst, NT3 is replaced by NT17 NT6. So now, we have NT17 NT6 NT77.\n\nNext, NT17 is replaced by NT8 NT58. So now, NT8 NT58 NT6 NT77.\n\nNT8 is replaced by NT30 NT50. So now, NT30 NT50 NT58 NT6 NT77.\n\nNT50 is replaced by NT24. So now, NT30 NT24 NT58 NT6 NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t70. So maybe NT30 starts with t70? Let's check NT30's productions. From the grammar, NT30 -> NT49 NT65. And NT49 -> 't74', so possible. Also, NT65 could produce t something. Looking at NT65, it has multiple productions, including NT65 -> t46, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the first step, we have NT30. Let's see how NT30 can produce t70.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I don't see NT30 -> t70. Let me check the grammar. Oh, I see NT70 -> 't78', and NT65 -> 't78' as well. So what about NT30? Let me check if NT30 is a terminal or non-terminal. In the grammar, all the symbols ending with 't' are terminals, and others are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT30, I don't see it as a terminal in the given rules, only as a non-terminal. So NT30 can't produce t70 directly. I must have a rule where NT30 leads to a terminal, but it doesn't. The rules for NT30 are NT30 -> NT49 NT65. And NT49 can produce t74, and NT65 can produce t46 or other non-terminals. So NT30 can't produce t70 directly, so the first part isn't matching. \n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t70. If our first expansion leads to NT30, which can't produce t70, that means this path is invalid. Maybe I took the wrong steps earlier. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can be expanded differently? Wait, S only has one production, so we have to follow that. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that NT3 leads to NT17 NT6, but maybe NT6 leads to something else. Let me check NT6. Wait, looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT6? Let me scan through all the rules. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT6 occurs in a rule: NT79 -> NT22 NT22, and NT65 -> NT98 NT26. Wait, but I don't see NT6 as a left-hand side in any production. So NT6 is a terminal. Therefore, NT6 must be a terminal, which means in the string, any token that is t6 would be from NT6.\n\nWait, in the string, I see t10, t63, t74, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this with a different method, like the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. But since the grammar is large, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the start symbol expansion steps and see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t70 t63 t74 t14 t14 t78 t63 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t70 t10 t90 t54 t69 t54.\n\nLet me see if I can find a way to break this down, starting from the beginning.\n\nFirst, S expands to NT3 NT77.\n\nLet's try to see if the beginning of the string can match these symbols.\n\nWait, NT3 produces NT17 NT6, and NT77 produces NT68 NT44. So after expanding S, we have NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, NT17 is NT8 NT58, so now we have NT8 NT58 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNT8 is NT30 NT50, so now: NT30 NT50 NT58 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t70. So perhaps NT30 is the first symbol. But NT30 -> NT49 NT65. And NT49 can produce t74, NT65 can produce t46, but that's not matching t70. Alternatively, maybe NT30 leads to another path, but I don't think so. So perhaps this path is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S expands differently. Wait, but S only has one production. So that's not the case. So maybe the first token in the string, t70, comes from another symbol. Perhaps I made a mistake in looking at NT30.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for where t70 is produced. Looking through the grammar, I see NT70 -> 't78', but that's not t70. So perhaps I'm missing a production. Wait, looking again, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't70' directly, which would mean that any occurrence of t70 in the string must come from two non-terminals that each produce a token, but that sums to two symbols. However, t70 is a single token, so perhaps that can't be produced directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding NT3. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the string might be a parse tree where each non-terminal eventually produces the corresponding terminal tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-376","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t69 t14 t69 t54 t63 t78 t71 t61 t74 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 t60 t27 t8 t14 t14 t63 t30\". The grammar is quite extensive with a bunch of production rules. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the application of parsing algorithms like CYK, but here I don't need to parse; I just need to see if the string can be derived.\n\nThe approach is to model the possible ways the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules, starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is given, I can list all the production rules and see which parts of the string can correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t69, t14, t69, t54, etc. So, I need to see if these terminals correspond to the productions of the grammar.\n\nLet me start by examining the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, S generates two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. Each of these can be further expanded as per their own production rules.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Then NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85. Hmm, but wait, NT17 ends with NT8 and NT58. NT8 is 't35' according to the rules, which can be directly substituted. But I think this chain might lead to multiple 't' parts. Let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the first part is t69, t14, etc. Let me look for possible matches for t69. Scanning the rules, I see that NT26 \u2192 't44' and also NT26 can go through other productions. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT26 \u2192 't64' (Wait, no, in the rules, it's NT26 \u2192 't44' or NT26 can also be NT22. Hmm, maybe I should list all the production rules that end in terminals.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice that several non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT18 \u2192 't8'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT25 \u2192 't54'\n- NT36 \u2192 't50'\n- NT44 \u2192 't60'\n- NT54 \u2192 't83'\n- NT65 \u2192 't88'\n- NT77 \u2192 't32'\n- NT74 \u2192 't82'\n- NT85 \u2192 't61'\n- NT79 \u2192 't78'\n- NT93 \u2192 't27'\n- NT58 \u2192 't54'\n- NT95 \u2192 't61'\n- NT67 \u2192 't56'\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n- NT71 \u2192 't70'\n- NT74 \u2192 't16'\n- NT83 \u2192 't51'\n- NT22 \u2192 't78'\n- NT44 \u2192 't68'\n- NT2 \u2192 't69'\n- NT74 \u2192 't60', etc.\n\nHmm, so some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For instance, NT2 \u2192 't69'. That's exactly t69 in the string. So, the production NT2 \u2192 t69 can generate that part.\n\nNext, in the string, after t69 comes t14. Looking for t14 as a terminal, is it produced by any non-terminal? Yes, NT22 \u2192 't78' and NT25 \u2192 't54'. Wait, no, NT5 \u2192 't14', right? Because the grammar has NT5 \u2192 't14'. So, NT5 produces 't14'.\n\nSo, after having t69, which is generated by NT2 \u2192 t69, the next part would need to be part of the NT2's expansion or another non-terminal that produces t14.\n\nBut wait, the string after t69 is t14. So, perhaps the next non-terminal is NT5, which produces t14.\n\nSo the structure could be NT2 \u2192 t69 followed by NT5 \u2192 t14. Then, perhaps the next part is t69 again, which is another NT2 \u2192 t69.\n\nWait, but the string is t69 t14 t69 t54 t63 t78 t71 t61 t74 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 t60 t27 t8 t14 t14 t63 t30.\n\nSo after the initial t69 t14 t69, etc. So, the first three tokens are t69, t14, t69. Let me see which non-terminals can generate t69. Wait, only NT2: NT2 \u2192 t69. So, the first t69 must come from NT2.\n\nThen, the next t14 is from NT5 \u2192 t14.\n\nBut according to the grammar, the start symbol S is split into NT3 NT77. So, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nThen NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nWait, let me reconstruct the entire expansion starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, so:\n\n\u2192 NT8 NT58 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85.\n\n\u2192 NT8 NT5 NT85 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t14. So, the t14 would be produced by NT5.\n\nThen, NT8 \u2192 t8. So, t8.\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT74 NT77. So, let's expand that.\n\n\u2192 NT74 NT77.\n\nNT74 \u2192 t74 (Wait, checking the rules, NT74 can be 't60' or have other productions. Wait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT74 \u2192 t60, NT79 \u2192 t78, etc.\n\nWait, looking back, the production for NT74 is:\n\nNT74 \u2192 t60 (from the rule line NT74 \u2192 t60), but wait, let me check the rules correctly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLine by line:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t60: yes, so NT74 \u2192 t60.\n\n- NT74 also produces NT15 \u2192 't73' and so on, but since the string has a t60, we can consider if NT74 can produce t60. Wait, but the given string has t60, which would have to come from NT74.\n\nSo in the expansion above, NT74 \u2192 t60, and NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo after replacing NT74 with t60 and NT77 with NT68 NT44, the string so far is:\n\nt69 (from NT2) then t14 (from NT5), then t60 (from NT74's production), and then the remaining parts would come from NT68 and NT44.\n\nBut wait, the string after these three is t69 t14 t69 t54 t63 t78 t71 t61 t74 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 t60 t27 t8 t14 t14 t63 t30.\n\nWait, that would mean after the initial t69, t14, t60, the next part is t69. Let me see if this aligns.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar can produce a terminal or split into two non-terminals. So, when we start from S \u2192 NT3 NT77, we can try to expand each non-terminal step by step.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, to get 't69', we need NT2 \u2192 t69. So, perhaps either the NT3 or NT77 can produce a 't69'?

{"custom_id":"request-394","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly one production. Wait, no\u2014the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, checking the grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNext, the string I need to evaluate is: `t54 t24 t14 t70 t63 t65 t73 t17 t8 t24 t10 t63 t12 t14 t14 t71 t63 t24 t10 t68 t50 t44`.\n\nI notice that each element in the string is a terminal symbol, either a number or a letter. Wait, no, all are lowercase letters followed by numbers, like 't54', 't24', etc.\n\nNow, I should probably start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string. Since S is the start symbol, I'll begin with S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Wait, no, S \u2192 NT3 NT77? Let me double-check the grammar. Yes, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. But wait, all the non-terminals are uppercase, so perhaps I made a typo. Looking again, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Oh, right, so S expands into two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT3, NT77) can themselves expand into other non-terminals or terminals. So, I'll need to explore all possible derivations.\n\nLet me list the productions that result in terminals or combinations that can produce the given string.\n\nFirst, let's map the terminals in the string to the grammar symbols. So, 't54' must correspond to some production, and each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can find where terminals appear. For example:\n- 't54' appears under NT54: NT54 \u2192 't54'.\n- Similarly, 't24' is under NT24: NT24 \u2192 't24'.\n- 't14' is under NT14: NT14 \u2192 't14'.\n- 't70' is under NT70: NT70 \u2192 't70'.\n- 't63' is under NT63: NT63 \u2192 't63'.\n- 't65' is under NT65: NT65 \u2192 't65'.\n- 't73' is under NT73 \u2190 Wait, looking back at the grammar, I don't see NT73 defined as a terminal. So, that might be a problem. Maybe I need to check if any non-terminals produce t73.\n\nWait, the grammar does have NT17 \u2192 't70' and NT71 \u2192 't10', so maybe t73 comes from a different non-terminal. Let me see: NT71: 't70', but no, t73 isn't directly there. Wait, looking further, I see NT23 \u2192 't29', but that's not t73. Hmm, maybe NT73 is a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar. Oh, yes! There's a production NT73 \u2192 NT71 NT40.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT73 as a non-terminal that expands to 't73'. Let me list all the non-terminals that end with terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 't78'\n- NT21 \u2192 NT39 NT65\n- NT98 \u2192 NT93 NT16\n- NT93 \u2192 't54'\n- NT14 \u2192 't14'\n- NT70 \u2192 't70'\n- NT63 \u2192 't63'\n- NT54 \u2192 't54'\n- NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT22\nWait, no, NT54 \u2192 't54' is terminal. Similarly, NT58 is a non-terminal that expands into other non-terminals. So, in the string, I have 't73', which must be a terminal, but I can't see any non-terminal that directly expands into 't73'. Let me recheck the productions.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3: 't17'\n- NT67: 't56'\n- NT49 \u2192 't74'\n- NT65 \u2192 't88'\n- NT54 \u2192 't54'\n- NT18 \u2192 't8'\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\nWait, so no, I don't see 't73' in any production. Hmm, this is a problem because 't73' is in the string but not defined as a terminal in the grammar. That suggests that the string cannot be derived from the grammar, right? Because the grammar doesn't have a production that results in 't73'. Therefore, 't73' would imply that the production doesn't exist, making the string invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar for any non-terminals that expand into 't73'. Looking again, I don't see any. The closest is NT71 \u2192 't70' and NT73 might be a non-terminal, but no, looking at the productions, NT73 isn't even listed as a non-terminal; perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the string has a typo, but I assume the problem is correctly given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for 't73':\n\nI don't see any productions that end with 't73'. The NT70 is 't70', but the string needs 't73'. So, 't73' is not present in the grammar as a terminal. This would mean that the string is invalid because the grammar can't produce such a terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps I confused the index. Let me check again:\n\nThe string is: t54 t24 t14 t70 t63 t65 t73 t17 t8 t24 t10 t63 t12 t14 t14 t71 t63 t24 t10 t68 t50 t44.\n\nSo, the 7th element is 't73'. Since none of the non-terminals produce 't73' but instead expand into other non-terminals, the string can't be derived because you would end up with a non-terminal that can't be reduced to a terminal. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but no\u2014actually, let me make sure. Did I make a mistake in reading NT37 \u2192 't70'. Wait, no, the string has 't70' as the fourth element. Let me count the indices:\n\n1. t54\n2. t24\n3. t14\n4. t70\n5. t63\n6. t65\n7. t73 \u2192 here is the issue\nSo, 't73' is the 7th part of the string, which corresponds to NT73 \u2192 which isn't a terminal.\n\nThus, the string contains a terminal that isn't defined in the grammar, so it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string.

{"custom_id":"request-393","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with non-terminals (like S, NT3, NT20, etc.) and terminals (like 't17', 't69', etc.). The string I need to evaluate is: `t17 t63 t14 t14 t71 t74 t24 t10 t63 t24 t10 t78 t63 t14 t14 t69 t61 t8 69 54 t24 t54`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a single non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT77. So each production is in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string according to these rules. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to find a derivation path that produces this string from S.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into parts and see if they can be linked to the productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\nt17, t63, t14, t14, t71, t74, t24, t10, t63, t24, t10, t78, t63, t14, t14, t69, t61, t8, t69, t54, t24, t54.\n\nThe first symbol is t17. I need to find a production that starts with NT17 or where the right-hand side can derive to t17. Looking at the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT54, but I don't see NT3 being in this. Alternatively, from the start symbol S, which is NT3 NT77. So the start produces two parts.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must start with NT3 and NT77. Let's break the string into two main parts.\n\nFirst, the production for NT3: Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT54, which eventually leads to terminals. Let me try to see the terminal t17 coming from NT17.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 has productions, but the key one is NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. However, t17 is in NT3, which is derived from NT17 and NT6. So perhaps t17 comes from NT17, which is part of NT3. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nWait, let me look for t17 in the grammar. The productions where a terminal is t17 are several: NT67 \u2192 t56 (no), NT82 \u2192 t24, NT54 \u2192 t12, NT3 \u2192 t17, NT67 \u2192 t63, NT49 \u2192 t74, NT93 \u2192 t90, etc. Wait, I see NT3 \u2192 t17. So perhaps the start symbol S is producing NT3 and NT77, and the first symbol t17 comes directly from NT3.\n\nSo the start S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and in the string, the first symbol is t17. NT3 can produce 't17' because NT3 \u2192 't17' directly. So that's good.\n\nNow, after t17, the next symbols are t63, t14, etc. So the production for NT3 is done, and now the second part is NT77. So the second part is NT77, which breaks down into NT68 and NT44, because S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part of the string: after t17, we have t63, t14, t14, etc. So the production for NT77 must be NT68 NT44, which then needs to be broken down.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. Let's see what comes from NT68.\n\nLooking at NT49, it can produce 't74' directly (from NT49 \u2192 't74') or maybe other paths. Also, NT25 \u2192 't14'? Or let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar for non-terminals:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. So NT68's productions lead to NT49 and NT25.\n\nSo after NT68, the string has t63, t14, etc. So NT68's first part is t63? Wait, looking for terminals in NT49 and NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps NT49 can produce 't74' because NT49's production includes NT25 (which can produce something else) and another rule: NT49 \u2192 NT63 NT14. So NT49 has a production NT63 \u2192 't63' and NT14 \u2192 't14'.\n\nSo if NT49 \u2192 NT63 NT14, that would produce t63 t14.\n\nLooking back at NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. So after NT68, you have NT49 and NT25. NT49 could be producing t63 t14, and NT25 could be producing t14 as well.\n\nWait, let me try to map this step by step.\n\nString starts with t17, which is from NT3. Then the next part is the second half: starting with t63, t14, etc.\n\nSo after t17, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, which then each of these can break down:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\nNT22 \u2192 t71 (from NT22 \u2192 't71')\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18. Then, NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82 or NT20 \u2192 NT70.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's list out all the possible productions again.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT3 NT77. NT3 \u2192 't17' (good), so the first symbol is correct. Now, the second part is NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So the next symbols should be from NT68 and NT44.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. So after NT68, we have NT49 and NT25. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't74' (one production) or NT63 NT14 (another). So if NT49 \u2192 NT63 NT14, that would produce t63 t14.\n\nNT25 \u2192 't14' (from NT25 \u2192 't14').\n\nSo putting this together, after S \u2192 NT3 NT77, we have:\n\nt17 (from NT3) followed by t63 t14 (from NT49) and t14 (from NT25). So that would be t17 t63 t14 t14 so far. That seems to match the start of the string: t17 t63 t14 t14.\n\nSo the second part after t17 is t63 t14 t14, which fits because NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 \u2192 NT49 NT25 \u2192 t63 t14 t14.\n\nNow, moving forward, after these four symbols, the string continues with t71, t74, etc. So let's see what comes next.\n\nAfter NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 \u2192 NT49 NT25 \u2192 t63 t14 t14, the next symbols are t71, t74, t24, etc.\n\nLooking at the production for NT44: NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18. So after NT44, we have NT22 and NT18.\n\nNT22 \u2192 't71' (from NT22 \u2192 't71'). So the next symbol is t71, which is correct.\n\nThen, NT18 \u2192 NT68 NT82. So the next part is NT68 and NT82.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25 (we already did that), but perhaps it's another production. Wait, in the grammar, for NT44, after NT22 and NT18, but specifically, after getting to NT18, we have NT68 and NT82.\n\nSo after t71 comes t74, which would be NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or terminal on the right. This simplifies parsing because each step in the derivation processes one production rule.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which expands to NT3 NT77. So any correct string must start with NT3 and NT77. The given string starts with t17 t74, so I need to see if t17 and t74 can result from expanding NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT3 has two options: NT17 NT6 and NT8 NT58. Since the string starts with t17, which is the result of NT74 expanding to t17, maybe NT3 expands to NT8 NT58. But wait, NT8 can be NT30 NT50, which then becomes t54, and NT58 is NT59 NT0, which can be t17 and t8. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's pause. Let me list all the terminal productions in the grammar. Each NT rule eventually leads to a terminal symbol, like NT3 -> t17, NT6 -> t63, etc. So, when a non-terminal is expanded, it must generate a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the string starts with t17. So, somewhere, an NT must generate t17. Looking through the grammar, I see NT74 -> t17. So, either NT74 is the start or one of the symbols it can derive must produce t17. But starting from S = NT3 NT77, so S must expand to NT3 and NT77. Therefore, the first part should be NT3 expanding to a sequence that starts with t17.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: NT17 NT6 and NT8 NT58. Let's see if either can generate the initial t17.\n\nLooking at NT17: it can produce t70, t74, t58, t30, etc. But nt17 can also produce NT8 NT58. Wait, that's another non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar rules, I see NT17 -> NT8 NT58. So, NT17 must expand to NT8 and NT58.\n\nNT8 can be NT30 NT50 or another rule. Wait, looking back, maybe I need to check all NT rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Starting from the string, let me try to split it into the correct non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t17 t74 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t79 t54 t27 t61 t8 t44 t79 t54 t74 t24 t10 t68 t69 t46 t70.\n\nSince the string must start with NT3 and NT77, I need to see if the two parts of the string can be derived from those.\n\nSo, the first part is t17 and t74. Wait, no, S is NT3 NT77, so the string must consist of the productions of NT3 and NT77 in sequence. So the string should be a sequence where the first chunk is from NT3 and the second from NT77.\n\nBut the string starts with t17 and t74. Let's see how that can happen. Let's see NT3's options: it can be NT17 NT6 or NT8 NT58.\n\nIf NT3 is expanded to NT8 NT58, then NT8 could be NT30 NT50 or whatever it expands to. Wait, perhaps I need to see the string as two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string should be a concatenation of two sequences, one derived from NT3 and the other from NT77.\n\nLet me try to divide the string into two parts. Since NT3 and NT77 each generate a certain number of terminals, maybe the string is structured as NT3's expansion followed by NT77's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string: t17 t74 t24 t10 t71 t74 t24 t10 t79 t54 t27 t61 t8 t44 t79 t54 t74 t24 t10 t68 t69 t46 t70.\n\nThe first part is longer than the second, or maybe not? Let me count: from t17 to t70, that's 19 tokens. The second half might be 10 tokens? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's structured differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, expanding NT3 and NT77.\n\nStarting with S: NT3 NT77.\n\nFirst production: NT3 can be NT17 NT6 or NT8 NT58.\n\nIf NT3 expands to NT17 NT6:\n\nThen NT17 can expand to NT8 NT58. NT8 can be NT30 NT50, which would be t54 and t27?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies the rules to be in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. This means that the entire derivation starts with NT3 and NT77. So, every string generated by this grammar should start with a terminal symbol as per these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t35 t14 t17 t27 t61 t8 t17 t8 t54 t69 t14 t29 t61 t8 t71 t74 t14 t14 t60 t50 t42 t63 t32`. The first token is 't35', which I should check if it appears as a terminal in the grammar. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT3 \u2192 't17'. But 't35' isn't directly a terminal here; however, looking further, the non-terminal NT8 \u2192 't35' according to the production NT83 \u2192 't54', but wait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see that NT8 \u2192 't35' is present. So 't35' is the result of NT8. So the first token could come from NT8.\n\nNext, looking at the production S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So after S, we have NT3 and NT77. The next token after 't35' (which is derived from NT8, but wait, that might not be part of the initial S. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the S production is NT3 followed by NT77. So S expands into NT3 NT77, but each of these can be non-terminals that further expand until terminals.\n\nSo for the string, the first token comes from the initial expansion of NT3 and NT77. But in the string, the first token is 't35', which has to come from either NT3 or NT77. Wait, NT3 and NT77 are derived from their respective rules.\n\nWait, looking at the production NT3 \u2192 't17'. So if the first token is 't17', but our string starts with 't35', which isn't 't17', so that can't be. So maybe I need to look at other productions. Let me check if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't35'. Looking back, the productions for NT14, NT8, etc., I see NT8 \u2192 't35' as per the provided grammar. So the first token 't35' must come from NT8.\n\nWait, but the S production starts with NT3. So how does the S's NT3 and NT77 derive into the string? Maybe it's the case where NT3 and NT77 expand into other non-terminals that eventually produce terminals, which are the string tokens. So let's map this.\n\nThe first token is 't35', which needs to come from a production. Let's see which rule produces 't35'. Looking through the provided rules, I find that NT8 \u2192 't35' (from NT83 \u2192 't54'? Wait, no. Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT17 \u2192 't70' etc.\n\nSo 't35' must come from NT8.\n\nSo for the string, the first token is 't35' from NT8. Then the next tokens follow from the expansion of S.\n\nWait, no, S produces NT3 and NT77. So maybe the entire string is built by expanding S into these two non-terminals, which then further expand into other non-terminals until the tokens are produced.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string has 24 tokens. To parse it, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut 24 tokens is a lot. Maybe there's a better way. Instead of parsing the entire thing, perhaps I can check whether each token in the string corresponds to the productions of the grammar.\n\nBut for a context-free grammar, the order of the tokens must follow the derivation. So each step can reduce a part of the string if we're using a top-down approach, or we can try to build it bottom-up with a bottom-up parser.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to see if each token can be generated by the grammar, considering the possible productions and the context.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a leftmost derivation or a rightmost derivation that would produce the given string.\n\nBut with the string length, that might be time-consuming. Maybe I can break the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t35 t14 t17 t27 t61 t8 t17 t8 t54 t69 t14 t29 t61 t8 t71 t74 t14 t14 t60 t50 t42 t63 t32`.\n\nI notice that 't35' is first, which, as established, comes from NT8. Let's see what comes after 't35'.\n\nAfter 't35', the next token is 't14'. So maybe after NT8, we have another non-terminal that expands to 't14'. Looking at the grammar, NT14 \u2192 't71' and also NT5 \u2192 't14'. Wait, so 't14' could come from NT5 or NT14.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22. Let me check what that expands to.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built as follows:\n\nt35 (NT8) followed by 't14'. So NT8 \u2192 't35' and then maybe the next part is NT14 \u2192 't14'. So after NT8, we have NT14.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is NT8 followed by NT14, and then the next tokens follow.\n\nBut NT14 expands to NT37 NT22.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to track the entire string step by step.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to model the grammar's possible terminal sequences.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if the grammar can generate the string by looking at each token and seeing if it's possible to have the production chain.\n\nAnother idea is to use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for context-free grammars, but setting that up manually for 24 tokens would be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC (two symbols) or A\u2192a (a single symbol). So the parse tree will only have binary and unary productions, which implies that the length of the string must be a Fibonacci number, but given that, for a string of length n, the required number of symbols in the parse tree would be such that the string length is within the Catalan numbers, which perhaps this string is too long. But more importantly, perhaps the grammar can't generate such a string because the number of non-terminals is limited.\n\nWait, perhaps each production step increases the number of symbols by one (since A\u2192BC adds one symbol, replacing one non-terminal with two symbols, so if starting from a single non-terminal, each step increases the length by one). Alternatively, in CNF, the string's length must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, let's correct that. In a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. When converting a sentence into a derivation, each step increases the length by one. So the number of steps is related to the length of the string. For a string of length m, the number of productions needed would be m-1, but the maximum possible length of the string is unbounded, so that doesn't limit it. So the string's length isn't inherently a problem.\n\nBut to proceed, let me consider the first token, 't35', which comes from NT8. So after that, what comes next? Maybe the next tokens come from NT14.\n\nWait, let me try to map the string as a sequence of productions. Starting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Since each production is two symbols, but in the string, we have 24 tokens, which is even, perhaps it's a concatenation of two initial symbols.\n\nSo starting with NT3 and NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' (from the production NT3 \u2192 't17'). So the next token should be 't17'. But in the string, after 't35', the next token is 't14', not 't17'. So that can't be. Therefore, the initial expansion of S must be such that NT3 and NT77 expand into non-terminals that produce 't35' as the first token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first two symbols are NT3 and NT77, which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-432","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The starting symbol is S, and each production builds up the string by replacing non-terminals with other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are all the words like 't35', 't14', etc., and the non-terminals are the NTs like NT3, NT14, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t35 t14 t17 t46 t70 t13 t51 t9 t24 t10 t50 t42 t54 t61 t12 t14 t14 t30 t69 t70 t14 t14 t63 t32`.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to match it against the grammar's productions. This method is called the CYK algorithm, I believe, which is used for parsing context-free grammars, but maybe I can do it manually here.\n\nStarting with the entire string, the first step is to look for any productions that can generate the first part of the string. Let's see which NTs have terminal symbols that start with 't35' or one of the other tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that NT83 -> 't54', NT93 -> 't54', and NT74 -> 't60' among others. Wait, but I don't see an NT that directly produces 't35' except for looking at the rules: oh, I do! NT8 -> 't35'. So the first symbol 't35' comes from NT8. So 't35' must be derived from NT8.\n\nNow, looking at the production for NT8: According to the grammar, NT8 -> NT30 NT50.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't35' which is NT8. Now, we need to split the remaining string into two parts: the first part would be 't14 t17 t46 t70 t13 t51 t9 t24 t10 t50 t42 t54 t61 t12 t14 t14 t30 t69 t70 t14 t14 t63 t32', and the second part would be empty because NT8 produces two symbols. Wait, no, actually, the string after 't35' is the rest of the symbols, right? So the entire string is 't35' followed by the rest, which needs to be split into two parts because NT8 -> two symbols.\n\nWait, actually, when we split the string for NT8, the entire string after 't35' must be split into two parts, left and right, and each part must be matched against the productions of NT30 and NT50 respectively.\n\nSo, the string after 't35' is: t14 t17 t46 t70 t13 t51 t9 t24 t10 t50 t42 t54 t61 t12 t14 t14 t30 t69 t70 t14 t14 t63 t32.\n\nWe need to find a split point where the left part is generated by NT30 and the right part by NT50, for some split between 0 and the length of this substring.\n\nBut wait, this seems complicated because I have to check all possible splits, which is a lot. Maybe I can find the productions for NT30 and NT50 and see if any of their first symbols match the beginning token, which is 't14' next.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT30: Looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT30 directly. Let me check. The rules listed have NT30 appearing in productions like NT44 -> NT37 NT25 and others. Also, looking further, I find NT30 -> 't63' from the grammar (NT30 -> 't63') and NT30 also appears in NT49 -> NT30 NT65, so NT30 is used in multiple places. Similarly, NT50: from the grammar, I see NT30 -> 't63' and NT50 is used in NT82 -> NT20 NT50 (as there's a rule NT82 -> NT20 NT50) and others.\n\nWait, hold on. I think NT30->'t63' is a production. Similarly, NT50->'t24' is a production (from NT26 -> NT5 NT48, among others, but wait: in the grammar, looking for NT50, I see NT26 -> NT5 NT48, but that's not NT50. Wait, actually, in the grammar, there's a rule NT26 -> NT5 NT48, but no NT50. Or maybe I misread. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> NT30 NT50\n\nWait, that's the rule. So for NT8, when we split, the next two symbols must come from NT30 and NT50. But in our current split after 't35', the first token is 't14', which is the start of the next part. Wait, no, the initial split for NT8 is that the next two symbols come from NT30 and NT50. So the string after 't35' must split into two parts: the left part (before the split) is generated by NT30 and the right part is generated by NT50.\n\nSo, the string after 't35' is 't14 t17 t46 t70 t13 t51 t9 t24 t10 t50 t42 t54 t61 t12 t14 t14 t30 t69 t70 t14 t14 t63 t32'.\n\nSo, that's a long string. I need to find a split point where the left part (from the start of this substring) is generated by NT30 and the right part is generated by NT50.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, the production NT30 -> 't63' exists. So, if I can reach 't14' after 't35', perhaps NT30 is producing 't63', but that's the last symbol in the string, right?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. When we split the string after 't35' into two parts, the left part must be generated by NT30 and the right part by NT50.\n\nBut NT30 in the grammar has a production that generates a terminal, 't63'. So, if the left part is 't14...t63', then 't14' must be the start of the next symbols, which would need to be generated by NT30. But if NT30's only production is 't63', then the left part must be just 't63', but here the left part starts with 't14', so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should try reconstructing the parse tree from the top down or bottom up.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each NT in the grammar must expand into a sequence of terminals and NTs, and I can work backwards from the string to the start symbol S.\n\nSo, the string starts with t35. As we saw, t35 comes from NT8. NT8 expands to NT30 NT50.\n\nSo, the string is t35 followed by [t14 ... ] and then the expansions of NT30 and NT50.\n\nBut let's see: the next token is t14. So after t35, the next part must be the expansion of NT30, which starts with NT30. So the first symbol in the expansion of NT30 is t14. Let's check the grammar for NT30's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar: I don't see a direct production for NT30->'t14'. Instead, NT30 only produces a terminal symbol or other NTs. For example, NT30 -> 't63' and in the rule NT49 -> NT30 NT65. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier: looking back at the grammar, I think NT30 is used in some production, but does it produce any terminal?\n\nLooking through the list of grammar rules: I see NT30 appears as part of NT59, NT18, etc., but does it have a production that generates a terminal? Yes, in the rules, there's NT8 -> NT30 NT50, and NT53?

{"custom_id":"request-435","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is: `t17 t74 t14 t14 t78 t63 t24 t10 t54 t61 t74 t24 t10 t78 t71 t61 t8 t29 t35 t14 t35 t54 t63 t56`.\n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the grammar. It seems quite extensive, with many NTs (Non-terminals) that eventually resolve to terminals with 't' followed by numbers. The start symbol is S, which produces NT3 and NT77.\n\nMy approach will be to trace the string through the grammar, checking if each token in the string can be derived from the NTs. I'll start from the beginning and see if I can find a path through the grammar that matches each part of the string.\n\n1. The first token is 't17'. Looking at the grammar, NT3 can produce 't17' as per the rule `NT3 -> 't17'`. So, the first token can be traced back to NT3.\n\n2. The next token is 't74'. NT77 can produce 't74' via `NT77 -> 't74'`. But looking back, the start symbol S produces NT3 and NT77. So, in the first step, S can produce NT3 which is 't17', then the next production must come from NT77. Wait, no, because S is S -> NT3 NT77, which are two separate non-terminals. So, after S, we get NT3 and NT77, which would produce 't17' and then 't74' as the next tokens. So far, that's matching: 't17' followed by 't74'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't17', so that's the first token. Then, according to the grammar, S starts with NT3 and NT77. So, after S, the first two tokens would be 't17' (from NT3) and whatever NT77 produces. Looking at NT77's productions, it can produce several things, but let's see. Is NT77 producing 't74'? From the grammar, yes: `NT77 -> 't74'`. So, after 't17', the next token would be 't74'. That matches the string's second token: 't17 t74'.\n\n3. Now, the third token is 't14'. We need to see what comes after 't74'. Wait, no, because the string is a flat sequence of tokens, so each step in the derivation should produce a single token. Let me think. Each production step generates sequences of non-terminals, which are then further expanded. So, after S, we have NT3 -> 't17' and NT77 -> 't74', so the string so far is 't17 t74'.\n\nBut the next token in the string is 't14'. So, I need to see what comes after NT77. Wait, perhaps I should think in reverse. Let's look for the end of the string and see if it can be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe last token in the string is 't56', which comes from NT65 -> 't56'. So, to get 't56', the last part of the derivation must come from NT65 -> 't56'. So, we need to see if the preceding part leads into NT65.\n\nLooking at the string, the token before 't56' is 't63', which comes from NT75 -> 't79' isn't relevant here. Wait, looking at the grammar, let's see the production rules that end with 't56'. From the rules, `NT67 -> 't56'`. So, the last token 't56' comes from NT67. But earlier, we thought the last part was NT65. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string from the end, backtracking through the grammar to see if it can be generated.\n\nSo, starting from the end:\n\nThe last token is 't56', which comes from NT67 -> 't56'. So, before that, the previous token is 't63'. Looking at NT75 -> 't79' isn't relevant. Wait, let's see which NTs produce 't56'. From the rules, `NT67 -> 't56'`. So, the last part is NT67, which must be preceded by something that connects to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's try to trace the entire string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t17 t74 t14 t14 t78 t63 t24 t10 t54 t61 t74 t24 t10 t78 t71 t61 t8 t29 t35 t14 t35 t54 t63 t56.\n\nLet me index each token for clarity:\n\n1: t17\n2: t74\n3: t14\n4: t14\n5: t78\n6: t63\n7: t24\n8: t10\n9: t54\n10: t61\n11: t74\n12: t24\n13: t10\n14: t78\n15: t71\n16: t61\n17: t8\n18: t29\n19: t35\n20: t14\n21: t35\n22: t54\n23: t63\n24: t56\n\nNow, the last token is 24: t56, which must come from NT67 -> 't56'. So, before 67, there must be some production leading to 67. Let's see what produces 67.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT67 -> 't56' is the only rule ending with t56. So, to get 67, perhaps it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the prior token could help. The token before 67 is t61 (position 16). Let's see what t61 comes from.\n\nt61 is from NT54 -> 't61'. Because `NT54 -> 't61'`. So, position 16 is t61, which comes from NT54 -> 't61'. So, before that, we must have something that produces NT54.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT54 can produce 't61' directly. So, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the token before t61 (position 16) is t74 (position 11), which is 't74' from NT77 -> 't74'. So, after that, NT77 must be followed by something that produces NT67. Let's look at the rules to see how NT77 can produce something that leads to NT67.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions, I see `NT77 -> 't74'` but that's the only way to get t74. But to get NT67, maybe there's another path. Wait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that NT77 can produce other non-terminals, which then produce 't74'.\n\nWait, no. In the initial grammar, NT77 has production `NT77 -> 't74'`. So, it directly produces 't74'. Therefore, there's no way for NT77 to produce another non-terminal like NT67. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look elsewhere. Let's go back to the last tokens. Maybe the sequence before the last few tokens can be checked.\n\nWait, let's check token 24: t56 comes from NT67. So, before that, we have NT54 -> 't61', which would be position 16. Then, position 11 is t74, which is from NT77.\n\nSo, the production would be something like NT77 -> NT67, which is not directly possible because NT77 only produces 't74'. So, unless NT77 can produce another non-terminal that then leads to NT67.\n\nWait, that would require NT77 -> NTX, where NTX -> NT67. Looking at the rules, perhaps NTX is 'nt77' -> NT65.\n\nWait, perhaps NT77 can produce NT65. Let me check the rules: looking for any production where NT77 is on the left side and another NT on the right. I see `NT85 -> NT3 NT67`, but that's not NT77.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can also produce a terminal directly. But wait, looking at the grammar, all production rules have two non-terminals, so no direct terminals except perhaps the start symbol. Hmm, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT77. So, the initial step would involve both NT3 and NT77.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals. My plan is to parse the string using the provided grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parsing would be efficient. Alternatively, I can try to trace through the derivations of each part of the string.\n\nThe string is quite long, so stepping through each token analytically might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or key points where certain non-terminals derive specific strings.\n\nFirst, let's list the terminals and ensure they correspond to existing productions. For example, 't69' must be produced by some non-terminal, which seems to be the case since the grammar defines NT32 -> NT77 NT68, but wait, looking at the grammar rules, 't32' is actually the terminal. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for terminals: the grammar expands NT74 to 't75', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT98 -> 't93', NT65 -> 't7', etc. So, each terminal is a specific 't' followed by a number, like 't14', 't69', etc.\n\nNow, I can create a mapping of non-terminals to their possible terminals. For example, NT8 -> 't35', NT26 -> 't69', and so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal actually expands into a pair of non-terminals except those that derive terminals. So, every production has two non-terminals on the right side except for the cases where the NT directly maps to a 't'. For example, NT8 -> 't35' is a direct production, which is a production where the non-terminal NT8 produces the terminal t35. Similarly, many other non-terminals in the grammar have direct terminal outputs.\n\nSo, given that, each step in the derivation applies some production rules. The start symbol S starts a tree where the first step would be S-> NT3 NT77. So, the entire string must be generated by first splitting into NT3 and NT77, each of which expands further until terminals are produced.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t69. So, the first step would generate t69, then continue expanding the remaining terms. But perhaps another approach is to look for non-terminals that could produce a particular terminal, working backwards.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal in the string can be directly produced by some non-terminal. For example:\n\n- t69 is produced by NT26. Because in the grammar, NT26 -> 't69'. So, NT26 can directly produce t69.\n- t14 is produced by NT8. Because NT8 -> t35 is given, wait, no, looking back: No, wait, looking at the productions, let's check NT8's productions. The productions for NT8: looking through the grammar, I see NT58->'t54', NT30->'t54', NT49->'t12', etc. Wait, I don't see NT8 as a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal. Wait, in the earlier productions, looking at NT8: I don't see 't8' directly in the grammar. Wait, earlier in the user's message, under NT8: 'NT8: 't69' is mapped from which production? Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back, I see NT8: in the grammar rules, under NT8:\n\nYes, under the grammar, 'NT83 -> NT51 -> t27', but 't8' is not directly a product of any non-terminal except perhaps NT3 -> 't17', etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each production rule carefully to see which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT36->'t50' (from NT36->'t50'), NT44->'t68', NT2 -> 't69', NT25->'t31', etc. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, some of the non-terminals like NT26 produce 't69' (NT26 -> 't69'), for example.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT83 -> 't51'\n- NT74 -> 't75'\n- NT44 -> 't68'\n- NT49 -> 't12'\n- NT22 -> 't71'\n- NT79 -> 't72'\n- NT67 -> 't56'\n- NT17 -> 't70'\n- NT82 -> 't24'\n- NT33 -> 't10'\n- etc.\n\nSo, many non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Others are non-terminals that expand into pairs of non-terminals.\n\nSo, to approach parsing, each token in the string must come from a production that can derive that token, either directly or through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as building a parse tree step by step, ensuring that the string can be fully divided into the required non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string length is 27 tokens, and S-> NT3 NT77, which would split the string into parts derived by NT3 and NT77.\n\nSo, perhaps I can split the string into two parts, each generated by NT3 and NT77, respectively.\n\nLooking at the starting string: 't69 t14 t29 t61 t63 t24 t10 t79 t54 t27 t61 t12 t24 t10 t65 t73 t44 t32 t69 t35 t14 t17 t56 t63 t30'.\n\nIf S->NT3 NT77, then the string must be a concatenation of the expansion of NT3 followed by the expansion of NT77.\n\nSo, the first part of the string would be the expansion of NT3, and the second part the expansion of NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see what's t69. The expansion for NT3 is:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So, NT3 expands into two non-terminals, NT17 and NT6.\n\nSo, the expansion of NT3 would be NT17 NT6, which further expand. Each token in the first part of the string must be generated by the expansion of NT17 and NT6.\n\nWait, but that might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for matches in the string that can be directly produced by rules, and then see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find if the entire string can be parsed without any conflicts.\n\nBut given the time it would take to parse 27 tokens manually, perhaps I can look for inconsistencies.\n\nWait, let's check if all tokens in the string are present in the terminal list of the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the grammar's terminal productions are as follows:\n\nFrom the rules, the terminals correspond to:\n\n- t69 (from NT26)\n- t14 (from NT8?)\nWait, earlier I thought NT8 doesn't directly produce t14. Wait, perhaps I need to confirm. Looking through the rules, when does a NT produce 't14'?\n\nLooking for 't14', is there a production with NT deriving it? Yes, in the rules:\n\nNT59 -> 't17' (no), NT22 -> 't71' (no), NT31 -> 't14' yes! So, NT31 -> 't14'. So yes, 't14' is produced by NT31.\n\nSimilarly, let's check for each token:\n\nt69: NT26 -> 't69'\nt14: NT31 -> 't14'\nt29: Looking for NT that produce 't29'. Let's see: NT26 in other rules?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.

Let me make sure I have all the relevant rules correct.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is as follows, truncated for brevity. I need to collect all the rules where a non-terminal expands into another non-terminal and two terminals.\n\nSo the key is to represent S as NT3 \u00b7 NT77, which then must produce the given string. Each step in the derivation will expand non-terminals into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLet's break down the given string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe string is: t69 t14 t17 t54 t61 t63 t24 t10 t65 t73 t14 t63 t14 t14 t46 t69 t14 t29 t61 t8 t54 t70 t60 t63 t32.\n\nIt's a series of terminals, so each 't' is a single symbol. The order will determine the parsing.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo S must first expand into NT3 and NT77. Then, each of these must produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet's see NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So from the start, NT3 expands to NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t35.\n\nNT58 \u2192 t54.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t69, not t35. Hmm, this doesn't add up. Maybe I made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, the string starts with t69. Let's check what NT2 is. From the grammar, NT2 \u2192 t69. So if in the parse, any path leads to NT2, it can emit t69.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start production S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Each of these starts from NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT3: it's NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t35.\n\nNT58 \u2192 t54.\n\nSo NT3 produces t35 followed by t54, but the string starts with t69. So that's a conflict.\n\nWait, maybe I have an error here. Let me check NT2. NT2 \u2192 t69 is correct. So perhaps the initial step should involve NT2 somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial NT3 must expand into something else. Wait, let me check all the rules for NT3.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n\nAnd NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t35.\n\nNT58 \u2192 t54.\n\nWait, so NT3 \u2192 t35 t54. But the string starts with t69. So that's a problem because S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and if NT3 produces t35 t54, but the string starts with t69, which can be produced by NT2, perhaps that path is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption is that S can't produce the string because NT3 leads to t35, but the string starts with t69. So perhaps this is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe NT77 also expands into something with t69.\n\nLooking at NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nThen, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT14.\n\nWait, NT14 \u2192 NT37 NT22.\n\nNT37 may expand into other things, but is there any way to get to t69?\n\nLooking at NT44: it can be expanded via multiple rules.\n\nWait, the initial step for S is NT3 NT77.

{"custom_id":"request-468","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions that are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all the productions end with either a terminal or two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string I'm given is `t54 t24 t54 t63 t12 t24 t10 t87 t12 t24 t10 t72 t61 t74 t14 t14 t60 t70 t69 t44 t13 t83 t71 t9 t14 t14`. I notice that all of these are terminals like 't54', 't24', etc. So, each 't' followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal. That makes sense because non-terminals would be variables like S, NT20, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, as indicated by the first production: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the start symbol is S, and it expands into two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can further expand into other non-terminals or terminals, depending on their productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't54', which I need to trace back to see if it can be derived from any production rule. I'll go through the string step by step.\n\nStarting from the left, the first token is 't54'. Looking at the grammar, the production for NT54 is NT54 \u2192 t83 t54. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a production NT54 \u2192 t83 t54? No, wait: Actually, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT54: Hmm, the list seems a bit extensive. Let me scan through the productions for NT54. Actually, in the list provided, I see NT54 appears towards the end:\n\nYes, here's one: NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98. Another: NT54 \u2192 t9 NT83. Wait, but the string starts with t54. So, which production could lead to t54? Maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about how the string is built. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so in the derivation, each 't' must come from a production that ends in that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll note each 't' and see which non-terminals can produce that.\n\nFor example, the first token is t54. So, we need a production that gives t54. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT54's productions: Let me scan the list.\n\nHere are some entries:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t83 NT8? Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the entire list, I find:\n\nNT54 \u2192 t82 NT98\nNT54 \u2192 t9 NT83\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. The user input had:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, I see in the middle: NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98. Also, later on: NT54 \u2192 t9 NT83. Hmm. So NT54 has two possible productions leading to terminals.\n\nSo, the first token is t54. Looking at the possible productions, is there a way to get t54 from a non-terminal? Let's see. Wait, wait\u2014NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98 would lead to t82 and then NT98, and then NT98 may produce other things.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I should look at known values.\n\nWait, perhaps it would be better to use the fact that in the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the first two symbols in the string should come from NT3 and NT77, respectively. But looking at the string, the first two 't's are t54 and t24. Hmm, let me see.\n\nWait, no. Because in the string, each 't' is a single terminal token. So, the string is a sequence of these 't' symbols. So the first symbol is t54, then t24, then t54, etc.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then, each of those non-terminals must expand into a sequence that starts with these t's.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, let me see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nLooking up NT3: In the grammar, NT3 \u2192 t17 t6. So NT3 expands into t17 t6.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's t54 followed by t24. Wait, that's inconsistent with NT3. Because NT3 would produce t17 and t6.\n\nWait, that suggests that the first symbols in the string might not match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string is t54 t24 t54 t63 t12 t24 t10 t87 t12 t24 t10 t72 t61 t74 t14 t14 t60 t70 t69 t44 t13 t83 t71 t9 t14 t14. So, it's a list of 25 tokens, all starting with 't's.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT3 NT77, then NT3 would have to produce t54 t24 t54... So let me check what NT3 produces.\n\nLooking back at the grammar: NT3 \u2192 t17 t6. That's it. But in the string, the first token is t54, but NT3 can't produce t54. So that suggests that either the start symbol is S, but its expansions don't lead to the string.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is being matched. Alternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of these tokens, and each production in the derivation can produce this sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a sequence of productions that can derive this exact string.\n\nBut the first symbol is t54. So which non-terminal, when expanded, produces t54 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which NT54 can produce t54 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT54's productions:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98: So the first symbol is t82, which isn't in the string.\n- NT54 \u2192 t9 NT83: First symbol is t9.\n- Another line: NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98 again?\nWait, maybe I'm missing other productions. Wait, let's make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking through the grammar, NT54's rules are:\n\nLooking down the list, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98\n- NT54 \u2192 t9 NT83\nThere are more:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t82 NT98\n- NT54 \u2192 t9 NT83\n- NT54 \u2192 t83 NT54\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, here's the grammar line: `NT54 -> t9 NT83`\n\nSo NT54 can go to t9 followed by NT83, which would then produce some other tokens. But in the string, it starts with t54, so unless there's a production where t54 comes first, which I don't see.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the string is just a list of t's and numbers, so each 't54' is treated as a single token. So in the string, t54 is one token. So the parser needs to derive this string as a sequence of these tokens.\n\nSo, the first token is t54. So which production starts with t54.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's check all NTs that can produce t54 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly goes to t54. Because all the NT productions either go to two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something, but not t54 directly.\n\nWait, maybe that's a problem. So if the first token is t54, that would require that somewhere in the grammar, a non-terminal produces t54 as the first symbol. But from what I see, no NT has a production starting with t54.\n\nSo, perhaps the conclusion is that this string cannot be derived from the grammar, because t54 appears as the first token, but there's no NT that starts with t54.\n\nBut wait, perhaps t54 comes from a production that has t54 in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-475","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t69 t14 t14 t65 t73 t10 t90 t54 t54 t24 t10 t65 t73 t10 t90 t54 t54 t24 t54 t87 t12 t14 t14 t65 t44 t63 t32`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base case when a terminal is the result. Looking at the grammar, it seems that many of the non-terminals expand into two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking at this, some of the productions do produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 t17, NT8 \u2192 t35, etc. So, the grammar has both terminals and non-terminals, and some non-terminals directly map to terminals.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be produced by this grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, but some non-terminals may produce terminals, perhaps the grammar is in modified CNF. The string seems to consist entirely of terminals, so any non-terminals in the derivation must be expanded into terminals directly or through these productions.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production (except for terminals) introduces exactly two symbols. Therefore, the derivation's length depends on the number of steps. The string length is 27, which is an odd number, which might pose a problem because in a binary tree structure (which is the case for Chomsky normal form), the derivation tree would have a leaf count that's a power of two. But 27 is not a power of two, so that might be a sign that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me test that. Chomsky normal form allows the start symbol to derive a string with length 2^n, where n is the number of productions. But the actual language can include strings of any length that satisfies that property, depending on the starting symbol and the productions used. However, the string length should be a power of two, right?\n\nWait, no, the total number of leaves in the derivation tree is 2^n for n steps. So if the string length is not a power of two, the grammar cannot produce it.\n\nBut 27 is 2^5 = 32, which is larger, so 27 is 3 less than 32. But 27 isn't a power of two, so that suggests the string might not be in the language.\n\nBut maybe I should also look for specific derivation paths. Let's see the given string tokens: t69, t14, t14, t65, t73, t10, t90, t54, t54, t24, t10, t65, t73, t10, t90, t54, t54, t24, t54, t87, t12, t14, t14, t65, t44, t63, t32.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So NT3 and NT77 must each be expanded into something that eventually leads to these t tokens.\n\nLet's map out the first few steps. S produces NT3 and NT77. Now, each of these must be derived into strings of terminal symbols.\n\nLet me try to see if t69 is generated by any non-terminal. Looking at the list, NT49 \u2192 t74? Wait, no, in the grammar, many non-terminals have terminal assignments. For example, NT49 \u2192 t74, but t74 isn't a terminal; that's a rule that a non-terminal becomes a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, many of the NT rules are actually terminal, meaning they don't go further. So, for example, NT3 \u2192 t17, NT8 \u2192 t35, etc.\n\nBut then, the problem is that the string tokens don't match the possible terminal symbols that the NT rules can produce.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF for context-free grammars typically has rules where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the given grammar, I notice each production is either a two-symbol non-terminal production (like S \u2192 NT3 NT36) or a terminal symbol (which are the 't' followed by numbers like 't70'), except for the starting symbol S which is initially two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t70 t63 t12 t24 t10 t71 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t63 t24 t10 t78 t71 t61 t8 t10 t90 t54 t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t8`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm, but maybe there's a more straightforward way here.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the terminal symbols in the string. They are: t70, t63, t12, t24, t10, t71, t14, t27, t61, t78, t8, t90, t54, t29. Each of these must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are only the ones in the productions. So I'll check which terminals in the string correspond to these productions.\n\nLet me list some key terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n- t70: So looking at the grammar, the only production that ends with t70 is NT70 \u2192 t7. Wait, is that correct? Wait, in the grammar, there's NT70 \u2192 t7. No, wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 t70? Yes, in the provided grammar, under NT17, the production is NT17 \u2192 t70. So for t70, the non-terminal is NT17, which produces t70.\n\nSimilarly:\n- t63: I see in the grammar NT30 \u2192 t54 (not 63). Wait, looking for 't63', it's under which non-terminal? Let me check each production that results in a 't' with a number.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, under NT26, there's a production NT26 \u2192 t65. Hmm, not 63. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's go through each production that results in a 't' symbol.\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 t73, NT8 \u2192 t35, NT22 \u2192 t78, NS \u2192 t69. Wait, I'm not seeing a 't63' here. Or did I miss any? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, under NT3 \u2192 t17, that's for t17. Looking for t63: Hmm, under NT54, we have NT54 \u2192 t63. So t63 corresponds to NT54.\n\nSimilarly, t30: looking for that, I see NT10 is used in various places but maybe under NT3: in the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t17 as well. Wait, NT36 \u2192 t50? Let me check.\n\nI think I need a mapping of each terminal symbol (the 'tX') to their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet me list all the 't' symbols and their corresponding grammar non-terminals:\n\n- t70: NT17 \u2192 t70\n- t63: NT54 \u2192 t63\n- t12: NT22 \u2192 t78? Wait no, NT22 \u2192 t78. Wait, let me see:\nLooking through the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t78 is correct. But t12 is in the string, so perhaps NT22 isn't the one. Wait, no, I'm mixing symbols. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nEach production that ends in t followed by a number is for a non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t74\n- NT65 \u2192 t88\n- NT85 \u2192 t75\n- And so on. So each production like NT3 \u2192 t17 would mean that whenever we encounter 't17' in the string, it must be derived from NT3.\n\nWait, given that, perhaps it's easier to create a reverse mapping of each 'tX' to the non-terminal that produces it. So for each terminal symbol in the string, find which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLet me compile this:\n\n1. t70: From the grammar, only NT17 \u2192 t70. So t70 must come from NT17.\n\n2. t63: In the grammar, looking for t63, I see NT54 \u2192 t63.\n\n3. t12: Let's find t12. Looking through the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t78. Wait, is that correct? Or is t12 from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT71 \u2192 't44' etc. Hmm, perhaps I should check each production that ends in a 't'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 t63 (Wait, no, that's NT65 \u2192 t88).\n\nWait, let me check each production for NT:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each 'tX' and the NT that produces it.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t74 \u2192 t74 is 't74' in the string.

Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, are these NT symbols like NT0, NT1, etc. or are they other symbols?\n\nYes, all the rules start with 'NT', then a number.

Wait, to find which NT produces 't12', I need to look for any production that includes 't12'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't12' except perhaps through other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-489","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. But wait, some rules here have more than two parts, like S -> NT3 NT77. That's two non-terminals, so it fits CNF.\n\nLooking at the string: `t35 t14 t18 t61 t74 t24 t10 t72 t61 t63 t24 t10 t27 t61 t74 t24 t10 t87 t71 t61 t8 t51 t69 t54 t70 t63 t32`. I see that the string is split by spaces, so each part is a terminal symbol, except some of them look like non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014actually, the non-terminals are like NT3, NT20, etc., but in the string, it's all lowercase t's followed by numbers and other letters. Wait, no\u2014it seems like the string is a sequence of lowercase tokens like 't35', 't14', etc., which might actually correspond to the terminal symbols defined in the grammar.\n\nWait, I think I got confused. In the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols, like NT3 -> 't17', so 't17' is a terminal. So in the string, each token is a terminal symbol, and I need to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S through some sequence of productions.\n\nSo the string is: [\"t35\", \"t14\", \"t18\", \"t61\", \"t74\", \"t24\", \"t10\", \"t72\", \"t61\", \"t63\", \"t24\", \"t10\", \"t27\", \"t61\", \"t74\", \"t24\", \"t10\", \"t87\", \"t71\", \"t61\", \"t8\", \"t51\", \"t69\", \"t54\", \"t70\", \"t63\", \"t32\"]\n\nThat's 31 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, which themselves can be terminals or further split into two. So the entire string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the string is quite long, maybe I should start by looking for sequences in the string that can be grouped into larger chunks according to the grammar. Alternatively, I can reverse the process: instead of starting from S and expanding, maybe parse the string by looking for chains that match any production.\n\nAlternatively, I can construct a parse tree by trying to split the string into parts based on non-terminals. Since the grammar is CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree.\n\nLet's see what the start symbol is. S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the entire string should be a concatenation of two parts: the first part derived from NT3 and the second from NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t35, which corresponds to the production NT3 -> 't17'? Wait, no\u2014NT3 in the grammar has a production: NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So let's check that.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT3 is defined as NT17 NT6. So it's a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals. Let's see what NT17 produces: looking at the grammar, NT17 -> NT8 NT58. NT8 -> 't30' NT50, but wait, in the given string, t35 is present, not t30. Wait, maybe I should look at the string: 't35', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should step back. Let's try to see which non-terminals correspond to the string tokens.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal production either leads to terminal symbols or other non-terminals. So I can make a list of the possible productions that result in each token.\n\nFor example:\n- 't17' comes from NT3.\n- 't63' comes from NT49.\n- 't32' comes from NT77.\n- 't8' comes from NT23.\n- 't16' comes from NT44.\n- 't54' comes from NT39, etc.\n\nWait, but the string has tokens like t35, which I don't see in the grammar. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in the grammar, most non-terminals lead to terminals with names like 't1', 't4', etc. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\nNT18 -> 't8'\nNT15 -> 't73'\nNT22 -> 't78'\nNT23 -> 't29'\nNT25 -> 't14'\nNT37 -> 't70'\nNT44 -> 't68'\nNT45? No, wait, looking for NTs that have -> 't' ...\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT25 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't26' (Wait, wait no, the grammar has NT26 -> 't26' which is a terminal? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, some of them end with a lowercase letter followed by a number. For example, NT22 -> 't78' (so 't78' is a terminal). Similarly, NT8 -> 't69'. Wait, some of these might be terminals, but looking at the string, I see tokens like 't35', which probably isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the parsing. Maybe the string is split incorrectly, but according to the given input, it's split as individual tokens. So each token is 't' followed by letters, like 't35', which probably is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, only certain non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, for each production rule, if the right-hand side is a lowercase letter with numbers, like 't35', that's a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar provided, for example, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. The right side is NT17 and NT6, which are non-terminals. But other productions, like NT20 -> NT44 NT36: both are non-terminals as well.\n\nWait a minute, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should parse the entire string and see if each token corresponds to a possible terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, let's list all the tokens in the string and see which ones are terminals and which might be non-terminals.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt35, t14, t18, t61, t74, t24, t10, t72, t61, t63, t24, t10, t27, t61, t74, t24, t10, t87, t71, t61, t8, t51, t69, t54, t70, t63, t32.\n\nSo each token is like 't35', which could be a terminal or a non-terminal. But in the grammar, the terminals are specific, like 't17', 't68', etc. For example, NT3 -> 't17', so 't17' is a terminal. But 't35' isn't in the grammar's terminals. So 't35' would have to be generated by a non-terminal that somehow leads directly to 't35', but in the given grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't35' as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the entire grammar. Maybe I overlooked some terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT22 -> 't78'\n- NT23 -> 't29'\n- NT25 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't26' (Wait, NT26 -> 't26'? Or is that in another rule?

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) can be transformed into a pushdown automaton (PDA) or analyzed using methods like the CYK algorithm. However, since the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (GNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Additionally, the string to test is pretty long, so parsing it manually might be time-consuming, but let's try breaking it down.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is standard for GNF, so the grammar is suitable for parsing using a top-down approach, perhaps with a recursive descent parser.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t14 t70 t63 t68 t7 t10 t42 t68 t17 t8 t78 t72 t61 t8 t27 t61 t12 t14 t14 t71 t71 t61 t8 t24 t10 t63 t30`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which likely correspond to specific non-terminals in the grammar. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77 (from the first production). So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. Let's see:\n\nSo, S first produces NT3 and NT77. The string starts with t35, which must come from NT3.\n\nLooking up NT3 rules: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So NT3 produces NT17 and NT6. The terminal t35 must correspond to a specific production for NT3 or its children.\n\nLooking at the terminal list, I see that NT3 \u2192 't17'. So, when NT3 is reduced, it's replaced by 't17'. Therefore, the first part t35 must come from somewhere else. Wait, that can't be right because NT3 is supposed to generate 't17'.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar again. There's a production NT3 \u2192 't17'. But in the string, the first token is 't35'. Hmm, that doesn't match. So unless NT3 can produce a different combination, but in GNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Since the first symbol is t35, which isn't 't17', maybe the grammar can't generate this string starting with t35?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So in GNF, this would mean that when we reduce NT3, it becomes 't17' (if NT17 and NT6 derive to it) or other combinations, but wait, in GNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals on the left. Here, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 is already in GNF, meaning that the only way to produce a terminal is if one of the non-terminals produces that terminal.\n\nWait, no. In GNF, a production like A \u2192 a B would mean that A derives to a followed by B, but in our case, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which is two non-terminals. So when parsing, we can only reduce two non-terminals at a time. The first symbol in the string is t35, which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar except maybe NT35, but looking through the productions, I don't see any NT35. Wait, but in the terminal list, some non-terminals are mapped directly to 't' and numbers.\n\nLooking back, I see NT3 \u2192 't17', which is a terminal. But t35 isn't in the list. So unless there's another path, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly maps to t35. The only 't's are t35, t14, t70, etc., but they are all direct productions from specific non-terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT14 \u2192 't30' (wait, looking at the productions, NT14 produces 't30'? Or is it NT14 \u2192 't30'? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT14 has multiple productions like NT14 \u2192 NT22 NT71, etc., but looking at the terminals, yes, NT30 \u2192 't54', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's list out all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT14 \u2192 't30'\nNT30 \u2192 't54'\nNT42 \u2192 't69'\nNT68 \u2192 't44'\nNT77 \u2192 't32'\nNT17 \u2192 't70'\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\nNT70 \u2192 't7'\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\nNT65 \u2192 't46'\nNT26 \u2192 't29'\nNT49 \u2192 't12'\nNT75 \u2192 't79'\nNT17 \u2192 't70'\nNT82 \u2192 't27'\nNT22 \u2192 't78'\nNT31 \u2192 't14'\nNT25 \u2192 't50', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t35, which is from NT8 \u2192 't35'. So to get t35, the non-terminal must be NT8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, when does NT8 produce 't35'? Looking through the productions, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't35' directly. Instead, in the list of productions, NT8 has multiple rules like NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, NT74 \u2192 NT74 NT77, etc. But looking at the direct terminals: NT8 \u2192 't35' is listed as a production elsewhere? Or is it under NT74 \u2192 't35'? Wait, no, in the productions, NT8 is listed as NT8 \u2192 't35'.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar section. I see a line: NT8 \u2192 't35'.\n\nSo yes, NT8 \u2192 't35' is a production. So for the first token 't35', the rule must be S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and then one of those NTs must produce t35.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So to produce t35, one of NT3 or NT77 must derive to 't35'. But from the grammar, NT3 can only generate 't17' (if directly) or combinations. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So to get t35, which is generated by NT8, perhaps I'm missing a path here.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Let's see what NT3 and NT77 can produce.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. The terminal here is 't17'. So 't17' would come from this production, not t35. So how can the first token be t35?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the initial S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and one of NT3 or NT77 can produce a terminal. Let's see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. This is a production that produces two non-terminals, so it can't directly produce a terminal like t35. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 (from the grammar). So NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, which in turn: NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, and so on.\n\nWait, this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string cannot be generated because the first token t35 can't be derived directly from any production starting with S, since S starts with NT3 and NT77, which don't produce t35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar structure. Let's list all the rules to see which productions produce terminals.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo NT8 \u2192 't35' is a production. So if any non-terminal can produce NT8, then that would produce t35.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, is there a rule that produces NT8?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies things a bit since each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t54 t24 t14 t18 t61 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t88 t46 t69 t14 t35 t54 t63 t65 t73 t60 t63 t12 t14 t14 t10 t90 t24 t10`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals according to the given rules.\n\nStarting from the grammar, I see that S -> NT3 NT77. So, the string must be a concatenation of two parts derived from NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at each symbol in the string, I notice that the string contains a bunch of numerical tokens that correspond to the symbols in the grammar. The key is that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, meaning it must correspond directly to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nI'll need to check if each token is covered by the rules. Let's go through the string step by step, but since it's quite long, maybe I can split it into two parts: the left part (from S) and the right part (also from S). Since S splits into NT3 and NT77, the string should be S's expansion of NT3 followed by NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check if each token is allowed in NT3 and NT77.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar rules, the non-terminals may eventually produce sequences that when expanded, produce these 't' tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, let me note that in the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that include 't' as a terminal.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find all the rules that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking for all rules where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\nLooking through all rules, here are the ones that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT59 -> 't74' (Wait, no, NT59 is defined as NT74 and NT51)\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. I think I'm looking for rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals, except for the starting symbol. So perhaps all rules are of the form A->BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, are any of the rules directly a terminal? For example, does any non-terminal directly produce a terminal, or are all rules for non-terminals combining other non-terminals?\n\nLooking back at the given grammar, let me see:\n\nAll the rules seem to be of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except for perhaps some that might have a terminal on the RHS.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT77 -> NT68 NT44\n- NT74 -> NT3 NT67\n- NT3 -> NT17 NT6\n- NT17 -> NT8 NT58\n- NT82 -> NT79 NT16\n- So, all of these rules have two non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, but what about production rules that might have a single non-terminal? No, all seem to be two non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way a terminal is produced is through the recursion of these non-terminals, but ultimately, when a non-terminal is reduced, it must ultimately lead to a terminal. But in this case, since all rules are non-terminals, maybe each application of a rule doesn't produce a terminal directly. Instead, the terminals are produced through the substitution paths.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again. In a typical CFG, each production is a non-terminal expanding into a sequence of terminals or non-terminals. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except for the start"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure should help in parsing the string by breaking it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol. The first production of S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the entire string must start with two parts: one generated by NT3 and another by NT77.\n\nLet me break down the string into these two parts. The first token is 't17', which I need to check against the production of NT3. Looking at the rules for NT3, I see that NT3 can produce 't74' by itself or it can produce 't17' and 't6'. Wait, no, actually, from the rules, NT3's production is either 't74' or 't17 t6'\u2014or is it? Wait, looking back, I see NT3 has rules like NT3 \u2192 NT36 NT17 and also NT3 \u2192 NT67 NT49, but the string starts with 't17', so I should check the production rules for NT3 that directly give a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that NT3 has a production to 't17'? No, I think I'm mixing something up. Let me check again. The rules for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT36 NT17\nNT3 \u2192 NT67 NT49\n NT3 \u2192 NT58? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3: NT36 NT17 and NT44 NT14... Wait, actually, going through the grammar provided, I need to list all the rules for NT3, NT17, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts: the first part is generated by NT3, the second by NT77.\n\nThe string is: t17 t12 t14 t14 t78 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t79 t54 t46 t46 t79 t54 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t70 t75 t27 t8 t54 t88 t70.\n\nSo S must produce S1 S2, where S1 is generated by NT3 and S2 by NT77. Let's split the string into two:\n\nWait, no, S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which are two separate non-terminals, so each must generate their own strings. Thus, the entire string would be the concatenation of the string generated by NT3 and the string generated by NT77.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a sequence of 31 tokens. Let's see if the first part starts with t17, which likely comes from NT3.\n\nSo the first token is t17. From the grammar, NT3 has productions. Let's see if any production of NT3 directly results in t17.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT3 can go to NT36 NT17, which suggests that when NT3 is used, it can split into two parts. Alternatively, does NT3 have a direct production to t17? From the given rules, I think not. Wait, let me list the productions for NT3:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT36 NT17\n- NT3 \u2192 NT44 NT25\n- NT3 \u2192 NT49 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT58 NT44?

So each production of NT3 splits into two non-terminals. But from the string, the first token is 't17', which suggests that perhaps one of these splits produces a terminal, but since both are non-terminals, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-537","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I believe corresponds to terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar again. It's quite extensive with many non-terminals (like S, NT20, NT68, etc.) and each production either breaks down a non-terminal into two others or terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t71 t78 t61 t74 t24 t10 t72 t61 t12 t14 t14 t87 t87 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t70 t63 t32`.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens in the string. Let me see: 32 tokens. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either leads to exactly two tokens or one. So the parsing will involve splitting the string into pairs or single terminals, working backwards from the start symbol S.\n\nHowever, manually expanding this for 32 tokens would be really time-consuming, so I'll look for patterns or perhaps try to decompose the string into parts that correspond to known production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some non-terminals that correspond directly to terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't63', so if there's a 't63' in the string, it's generated by NT6. Similarly, NT74 -> 't75' or 't16', so 't75' and 't16' are generated directly.\n\nI also see that the start symbol S produces NT3 NT77. So the first two non-terminals to expand would be NT3 and NT77. Let's see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So expanding NT3 would give NT17 and NT6. Then NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT58 -> NT5 NT85. Wait, that doesn't seem to directly produce a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLooking at another approach, perhaps I can work backwards from the string. The string starts with 't54', which is generated by NT54 according to the grammar, since NT54 -> 't9'. Wait, no, actually looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54: NT18 -> NT93 NT16\nNT93 -> 't54'\nNT16 -> 't8'\nSo NT93 produces 't54' and NT16 produces 't8'. But that might not directly help.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules. Wait, for example, NT54 has multiple entries, like NT36 -> NT17 NT79, but wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me look for each non-terminal that maps directly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't9' \u2014 so 't9' is derived from NT54. Similarly, NT17 -> 't70', NT22 -> 't78', etc. But in the string, I don't see 't9' so maybe that's not involved here.\n\nAlternatively, looking for non-terminals that produce terminals that are present in the string.\n\nFor instance, looking at 't24' in the string. I see NT24 isn't a non-terminal, but perhaps in the grammar, some NT produces 't24'. Wait, NT54 -> 't24'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT95 -> 't61', NT93 -> 't54', NT26 -> 't29', etc. Hmm, perhaps 't24' is generated by NT26: NT26 -> NT5 NT48? No, looking at the grammar entries for NT26, I see:\n\nNT26 -> NT48 -> 't18', wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar under NT26: NT26 -> NT5 NT48. Wait, no, under NT26, I see:\n\nWait, under NT26, let me look again: The entry for NT26 is under NT48 as well? Let me check the provided grammar again. Wait, perhaps I'm misparsing.\n\nLooking through the grammar again:\n\nI see several entries like:\n\nNT26 -> NT5 NT48\nNT48 -> NT18 NT93\nNT26 -> NT37 NT30\n\nWait, so NT26 has two rules: it can either go to NT5 and NT48, or NT37 and NT30. Then NT48 itself has a production:\n\nNT48 -> NT18 NT93\n\nAnd NT18 -> 't8' and NT93 -> 't54'. So perhaps NT26 can be broken down as NT26 -> NT5 NT48, then NT48 -> 't8' NT93, but wait, that's more than two tokens.\n\nAlternatively, since each rule is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production splits into two symbols. So for the string, each token can either come from a terminal or from a non-terminal that splits into two symbols.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe a better approach is to represent the string as a series of symbols and see if I can parse it using the grammar rules, starting from the shortest possible substrings and seeing if they match any rule.\n\nAnother idea is to look for sequences that match the right-hand sides of the rules. For example, the first rule is S -> NT3 NT77, so the entire string must derive from S, which splits into NT3 and NT77. So the string should start with the expansion of NT3 followed by NT77.\n\nSo the string is: t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t71 t78 t61 t74 t24 t10 t72 t61 t12 t14 t14 t87 t87 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t70 t63 t32.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces NT3 NT77. So the string must start with the expansion of NT3 and then the expansion of NT77.\n\nLet's look at the first part: t54 t24 t14...\n\nLooking at NT3's productions. From the grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So NT3 must expand to NT17 and NT6. Then NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT58 -> NT5 NT85. So far, that's a lot of non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps NT3 can directly produce a terminal. But looking at the grammar, NT3 doesn't have a rule that directly produces a terminal, it only splits further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine NT3. The production is NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So NT3 cannot produce a terminal directly. So the first symbol after S's expansion would be the first symbol produced by NT3, which is NT17.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't54'. So how is that possible? Unless 't54' is derived from a later rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string is a list of 't's followed by numbers, which correspond to the terminals in the grammar. So the structure is a concatenation of these tokens.\n\nSo, perhaps the parsing is such that the entire string is divided into the symbols t54, t24, t14, etc., and each of these tokens must be compatible with the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is that the entire string can be split into parts where each part is generated by a rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should note which non-terminals correspond to which terminals in the string.\n\nFrom the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT8 -> 't8'\nNT6 -> 't63'\n\nSo t8 and t63 can come from NT8 and NT6, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, I don't see t63, but I do see t70, t74, t14, etc.\n\nWait, let me think of the entire string as a tree. The string starts with t54, which is produced by NT26 via NT48's 't8' and NT93's 't54', but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the later parts of the string can be checked for consistency with the grammar.\n\nAnother approach"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-551","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string to check. The grammar is a set of production rules that expand non-terminal symbols (NT) until all symbols are terminals (like 't' followed by a number). Each production is a CNF rule, meaning each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left, and on the right, each non-terminal is replaced by another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nThe string given is `t54 t24 t14 t35 t14 t17 t65 t44 t68 t63 t65 t44 t60 t63 t12 t14 t14 t87 t63 t24 t10 t69 t61 t74 t24 t10 t60 t78 t10 t44`. I notice that it's a sequence of tokens starting with 't' and numbers, but some of these tokens correspond to specific non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the start symbol is S, which is rewritten as NT3 NT77. So S -> NT3 NT77. NT3 and NT77 are non-terminals, so I need to derive the string through these.\n\nLet me map each token to the corresponding NT or terminal. Some tokens like 't54', 't24', etc., are terminals. Others like NT3, NT77, etc., are non-terminals. So the first step is to see how the string can be broken down into these components.\n\nLet me list out the tokens in the string and see which NT or terminal they represent:\n\nt54 -> NT54\nt24 -> NT24\nt14 -> NT14\nt35 -> NT35 (Wait, I don't see NT35 defined. Hmm, maybe terminal? But in the grammar, NT35 isn't a non-terminal. So perhaps this is a problem. But let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the non-terminals go up to NT98, NT22, etc., but I don't see NT35. So if the string has a token 't35', that would correspond to NT35, but since there's no production for NT35, it's a terminal. So the string can have 't35' as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all the non-terminals on the right side are either non-terminals or terminals. So if a non-terminal can only produce other non-terminals (except for when it's a terminal), then any token in the string that isn't a non-terminal is a terminal.\n\nSo maybe I should first parse the string into a sequence of NTs and terminals. Let's try that.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt54 (terminal)\nt24 (terminal)\nt14 (terminal)\nt35 (terminal)\nt14 (terminal)\nt17 (terminal)\nt65 (terminal)\nt44 (terminal)\nt68 (terminal)\nt63 (terminal)\nt65 (terminal)\nt44 (terminal)\nt60 (terminal)\nt63 (terminal)\nt12 (terminal)\nt14 (terminal)\nt14 (terminal)\nt87 (terminal)\nt63 (terminal)\nt24 (terminal)\nt10 (terminal)\nt69 (terminal)\nt61 (terminal)\nt74 (terminal)\nt24 (terminal)\nt10 (terminal)\nt60 (terminal)\nt78 (terminal)\nt10 (terminal)\nt44 (terminal)\n\nSo each token corresponds to NT or terminal. Now, we can see that:\n\n- NT44 is in the start symbol S -> NT3 NT77.\n- Looking at the first token t54, which would be NT54.\n\nLet me look at NT54 in the grammar. Checking the production rules, I see:\n\nNT54 -> NT12\n\nWait, the production is NT54 -> NT12. But NT12 is also a terminal? Because looking at NT12, it's in multiple rules, but not as a left-hand side. But in the start symbol, I think NT54 is derived from NT12. Hmm, but maybe NT12 is a terminal.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nEach production rule in the grammar is something like NTXYZ -> NTABC NTDEF, etc. So to derive the string, we need to expand S step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that, S expands to NT3 NT77. So the string starts with something derived from NT3 and NT77.\n\nLet me see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nLooking at NT3: Its production is NT3 -> NT50 NT14. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking back, NT3 is defined as:\n\nNT3 -> NT50 NT14\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the grammar properly.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT6 -> 't63'\nNT58 -> NT54\nSo, NT3 -> NT17 NT6, and NT17-> NT8 NT58, and NT58-> NT54.\n\nThis recursive expansion would need to terminate when we reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simulate the derivation.\n\nLet me try to see the overall structure.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT3 NT77.\n\nSo we need to get the string starting with NT3 and NT77.\n\nFrom NT3, production is NT35? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let's clarify. NT3's production is NT3 -> NT17 NT6. Let's replace that. Then NT77's production is NT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nSo string starts with NT3 -> NT17 NT6 and NT77 -> NT68 NT46.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT77's rule is NT77 -> NT68 NT44. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44\n\nYes, right.\n\nSo starting with NT3 -> NT17 NT6, and NT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nSo the string so far is: NT17 NT6, NT68 NT44.\n\nThen, replace each non-terminal as follows.\n\nFirst, NT17's production is NT17 -> NT8 NT58.\n\nSo NT17 becomes NT8 NT58.\n\nThen NT58's production is NT58 -> NT54.\n\nSo NT58 becomes NT54.\n\nThen NT8's production is NT8 -> 't8'.\n\nAnd NT54's production is NT54 -> NT12.\n\nWait, no, NT54 is a non-terminal; let's check the grammar for NT54.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 -> NT5 NT83\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nIt's hard to track, but I see:\n\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\n\nWait, no, that's not NT54. Let me check the productions.\n\nWait, here's a line:\n\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\n\nSo NT54 produces NT82 and NT98.\n\nWait, then I go back. Wait, the initial NT3 is leading to NT17 NT6, then NT17 becomes NT8 NT58, then NT8 is 't8', and NT58 becomes NT54, which becomes NT82 NT98.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should map each token back to its Nts and see if it's possible to reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string by seeing if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nEach token is a terminal (like 't54') or a non-terminal (like NT54). The string is a sequence of these, so we can think of it as a list to be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, so each production is AB, meaning the entire string must be structured as a series of such steps.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to model the string as a series of symbols and see if we can reduce them using the grammar.\n\nIn this approach, we can look for symbols in the string that match the left-hand sides of the grammar rules.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should help because CNF grammars have specific properties that might make parsing easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's a collection of productions where each non-terminal on the left leads to exactly two other non-terminals or a terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of t-terms, which I assume are terminals. The string is: `t35 t14 t17 t56 t63 t74 t14 t14 t87 t63 t14 t14 t88 t35 t14 t69 t14 t17 t32 t69 t70 t87 t63 t24 t10 t72 t61 t8 t63 t56`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar can generate these terms. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would produce the string by expanding non-terminals step by step. Each step would double the length of the string because each production results in two symbols. So, starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols, and after n steps, the length is 2^n.\n\nLooking at the string, its length is 30 terms. Let's see if 30 is a power of 2. But 2^5 is 32, and 2^4 is 16. 30 is not a power of two, which means it might not even be possible to derive this string if it's the result of a leftmost derivation. However, I'm not entirely sure if this is a strict rule because the string could be a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but since all symbols here are terminals, perhaps the derivation structure needs to have exactly enough steps.\n\nWait, but each step in the derivation increases the length exponentially. So, if the string has 30 symbols, it can't be derived unless 30 is 2^n - 1 because the problem might require a certain structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of steps needed and see if it's feasible.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see which terminals can be produced by certain non-terminals. For example, NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36. NT20 can produce terms from NT44 and NT36. If NT44 can produce t16 and NT36 can produce t50, then NT20 \u2192 t16 t50, which is like t16 t50. But in the string, t16 t50 is not present. Hmm, maybe I should check each production for possible terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the productions, many end up producing terminals. Let me list some of them:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6 \u2192 eventually leads to t17 and t6. NT6 is another non-terminal that leads to t63.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see t35, t14, t17, etc. So I need to see if these terminals can be reached from the starting symbol S.\n\nLet me try to find the steps backwards. For example, the string starts with t35. So, which non-terminals can produce 't35'? Looking through the productions, I see NT83 \u2192 t44 NT14, and NT83 also \u2192 't13'. Hmm, but that's when NT83 produces t13. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar has several productions where the right-hand side includes terminal strings. For example, NT93 \u2192 't54', NT49 \u2192 't12', etc. But in the provided grammar, in some cases, the productions have multiple terminals. Let me go through them:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48: NT5 is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 \u2192 which could lead to t17 or t63. NT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93: NT18 is \u2192 t8, NT93 can produce 't13' or other terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that can directly produce a single terminal. But in most cases, non-terminals expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, the grammar seems a bit ambiguous. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, which then can produce 't70' or other things. It's getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should approach this by trying to see how the starting symbol S can expand. S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT3 and NT77. Then each of those would expand into two more non-terminals, and so on, until all are terminals.\n\nSo let's think about the derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77\n\nNT3 can produce multiple terms. NT77 expands to NT68 and NT44.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25.\n\nNT49 can produce 't12' or other things, but looking at NT49's productions, I see NT49 \u2192 't74' and others. Wait, in the productions list, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't74' and other productions like NT49 \u2192 NT30 NT65, which further break down.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see the entire derivation, but with 30 terms, it's too long. Alternatively, maybe we can check for any possible productions that lead to the given string.\n\nAnother approach: the length of the string is 30, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it can't be generated by a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, because the length of the string must be 2^n after n derivations, starting from one symbol. So 30 is not a power of two. Wait, but that's only if all the non-terminals are expanded into two symbols each time. However, in the grammar, some non-terminals might produce two non-terminals, which would continue the chain, while others might produce a terminal. So actually, each production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. This makes it possible for the string length to be 1 + 2k, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. Starting from S, the initial string has length 1 (S). Then, after one expansion, it could be two non-terminals, making length 2. After another expansion, each non-terminal could expand into two, so 4. Then 8, 16, 32, etc. If the string's length is 30, which is between 16 and 32, that would suggest that some non-terminals must have produced a terminal in the last expansion, thus terminating the chain earlier. That would require that during the last expansion step, some non-terminals replaced with a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, all symbols are terminals. That would mean that the entire derivation must end in terminals. Therefore, each step must have non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals, without any non-terminals left at the end.\n\nBut the problem is that the length of the string is 30, which isn't one less than a power of two. Wait, because each expansion step (when replacing a non-terminal with two symbols) increases the length multiplicatively. But if some non-terminals are replaced by a single terminal, the length increases additively.\n\nWait, for example, starting from S: length 1. If S is expanded into two non-terminals, total length becomes 2. Suppose both expand into terminals: total length 2. Or one into a non-terminal and the other into a terminal: length 3. Or both into non-terminals: length 4. So the possible lengths can be any number that can be built by these expansions.\n\nBut in the case of all terminals at the end, the entire derivation would have gone through a series of steps where non-terminals are expanded into terminals, and other non-terminals are further expanded until they reach terminals. Therefore, the length of the generated string must be a number that can be represented as 2^k - m, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of terminal symbols is equal to 1 + 2^d - 1 = 2^d, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the number of terminals in the leftmost derivation will always be one less than a power of two. But 30 is 32-2, which is 2^5-2. Maybe that's acceptable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of terminals in the string is equal to the number of steps plus one or something like that. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since the given string has 30 terminal symbols, let's assume that each non-terminal that's replaced must contribute one terminal. For that to happen, each non-terminal in the expansion must be replaced by a terminal, which would mean that the number of terminal symbols would be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nIn a binary tree, the number of leaves is equal to the number of internal nodes plus one.

Looking at the grammar, each production either combines two symbols (like S \u2192 NT3 NT77) or ends with a terminal symbol. The terminals seem to be things like 't42', 't54', etc. Each rule that ends with a number is a terminal, while the others continue to break down into more non-terminals.\n\nSo, the strategy should be to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and expanding non-terminals until we reach the terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or something similar.\n\nLet's outline the grammar's terminals and non-terminals:\n\nTerminal symbols are all the 't's followed by numbers, like 't54', 't24', etc. But wait, looking at the grammar, some rules like S \u2192 NT3 NT77 have two non-terminals on the right.

Hmm, that might be a typo. Or maybe it's a typo and it should be NT22 or something else. Alternatively, maybe NT0 is 't8'. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see that NT0 has 't8'. So that terminal comes from NT0. But in the string, it's 't8' which is okay.\n\nWait, no, in the string, 't8' is present. So we need to ensure that when we expand NT0, we can get 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals are:\n\n- 't14' can come from NT14, which is 't14' directly.\n- 't70' comes from NT70.\n- 't78' from NT78.\n- 't61' from NT61.\n- 't42' is a terminal in the string, but I don't see a production in the grammar for 't42'. Wait, in the grammar rules, S \u2192 NT74 NT22, which after expansion might lead to 't74' and NT22 could expand to 't23' or something else. Or perhaps 't42' is a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have a production that directly gives 't42'. Wait, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't42'. So that's a problem. Is 't42' present in the grammar? Or is that a typo?\n\nWait, in the string, the last part is 't42', so if that's not present in any terminal production, then that's a red flag. Because every terminal in the string must come from a rule that directly produces it.\n\nLooking through the grammar again, the only terminals are 't' followed by numbers, such as 't54' (from NT54), 't24' (from NT24), etc. But the string has 't42' which isn't present in any production. Therefore, that terminal can't come from any rule because none of the non-terminals directly produce 't42'. So that suggests the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a terminal production. Let me look through all the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that most of them either produce two non-terminals or some terminals. For example:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't83'\n- NT26 \u2192 't29'\n- NT93 \u2192 't93'\n- NT49 \u2192 't12'\n- NT22 \u2192 't71' or other rules, perhaps\n- NT51 \u2192 't27'\n- NT36 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't69'\n\nBut I don't see any rule that directly ends with 't42'. So if the string contains 't42' as a literal, that must be a terminal, but since no rule produces 't42', the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Are the terminals 't' followed by numbers, like 't54' is 't' concatenated with '54'? Or are they single 't's followed by numbers as symbols? For example, in the grammar, some rules have 't17', so that would be 't' followed by 17 as separate symbols. So 't17' is a single terminal symbol, consisting of the literal 't' and the number 17? Or perhaps it's a single token 't17'.\n\nIn the string, we have symbols like 't54', 't24', etc. So each of these is a single terminal symbol consisting of 't' followed by a number. Therefore, each of these needs to come from a production that directly gives that string as a terminal.\n\nLooking back, do any of the grammar rules produce such terminals?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT3 \u2192 't17', so 't17' is a possible terminal. Similarly, for 't24', I don't see any rule that directly gives that. Wait, NT44 \u2192 't68', which is an earlier example. Let me go through all the rules to see if any produce 't54', 't24', etc.\n\nWait, NT36 \u2192 't50', so 't50' is a terminal. NT68 \u2192 't49' as per one rule. NT25 \u2192 't44', which is another example. Hmm, none of them produce 't54', 't24', 't14', etc. except where they might be produced.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NT and NT followed by numbers. Let me go through the rules systematically.\n\nLooking for any production that has a terminal string as 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nFor example, NT3 \u2192 't17' is a production.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string, and I need to determine if the string is generated by this grammar. The grammar is a bit complex, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. Each rule is of the form A -> BC, which aligns with CNF. The start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77. Each of these non-terminals then breaks down into other non-terminals until some of them become terminals, which are represented as 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t17 t12 t24 t10 t68 t78 t54 t74 t14 t14 t87 t74 t14 t14 t87 t87 t61 t12 t24 t10 t71 t8 t78 t10 t73 t22 t90 t78 t83 t14 t14`.\n\nSince the grammar is CNF, the string's length can be traced back to the application of production rules. Let's note that in CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or breaks down into two non-terminals. Therefore, the total number of symbols in a derivation starting at S must follow 2^n, where n is the number of steps after the initial S.\n\nThe given string has 34 symbols (including spaces), so 34 = 2^k. Let me check: 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 34 isn't a power of 2, so this raises a red flag. But wait, the initial application of S -> NT3 NT77 would produce two symbols, then each subsequent production could either add one or more. Hmm, no, in CNF, every non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. So the string's length must be 2^n. Here, 34 isn't a power of two, implying that either the string isn't generated or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's count again. The string is: t17 t12 t24 t10 t68 t78 t54 t74 t14 t14 t87 t74 t14 t14 t87 t87 t61 t12 t24 t10 t71 t8 t78 t10 t73 t22 t90 t78 t83 t14 t14.\n\nI count 34 tokens, so 34 = 2^n?\n\nWell, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, so 34 isn't possible. Therefore, unless there are some terminals in the middle of non-terms, but no, each expansion in CNF doubles the count, starting from 1 (the start symbol S). So S expands into two non-terminals, then each of those could expand further, leading to increasing the number of symbols as 2,4,8,... etc.\n\nBut 34 isn't a power of two. So this suggests that the string isn't generated by the grammar because the length doesn't fit the required form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount: The string is 34 tokens. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let me see the production. The start symbol S produces NT3 and NT77, leading to two non-terminals. Each production of NTs must result in pairs until they all break down into terminals. The string length is the sum of all the terminal symbols, and each expansion adds two symbols until all are terminals.\n\nSo the total number of symbols should be 2^k, where k is the number of steps after S. For k=5, it's 32, which is close to 34, but not exactly. So that makes me think the string can't be generated because the length isn't a power of two.\n\nHmm, but perhaps the structure of the grammar allows mixed production, but no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, no\u2014if a grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A->BC, but if a symbol can also produce a terminal, that's the base case. Wait, some definitions allow A->a, making it a single terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each rule is A->BC or A->a, where B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, in this grammar, each non-terminal either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, when a non-terminal expands into a terminal, it adds a single symbol. Otherwise, it adds two symbols when expanding into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S->NT3 NT77, which is two symbols. At each step, each non-terminal can either produce a terminal (adding 1) or two non-terminals (adding 2 for each expansion).\n\nTherefore, for the entire string, the total number of symbols must satisfy the condition that it's of the form 2^k - (something). Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it recursively.\n\nLet me denote the length function as f(n), where f(n) represents the total number of symbols after n steps. S is initially f(0) = 1 (since it's just S), then after the first expansion, f(1) = 2. Each step, each non-terminal can produce either 1 or 2 symbols.\n\nWait, so each non-terminal can be in a state where it's a terminal or a non-terminal node. Therefore, the total number of symbols is not straightforward because it depends on which non-terminals are expanded into terminals or further rules.\n\nBut the key point is that the entire string must result from a derivation where each step either replaces a non-terminal with a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThe problem is that each step doubles the count if a non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals. So, from S, we have 1 symbol but the first expansion gives 2. Then if each of the two NTs expands into two more, we get 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.\n\nBut the given string has 34 symbols, which is not a power of two. So unless some of the non-terms end up being terminals, perhaps leading to a different count.\n\nWait, but each expansion of a non-terminal into a terminal would stop that branch, but other branches can continue expanding.\n\nLet's consider if the string can have a mix. For example, some parts of the string are generated by expanding non-terminals all the way to terminals, while others are not.\n\nBut in CNF, each time a non-terminal is replaced by two others, so the process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that the total number of symbols must be equal to 2^k for some k, because each step after the initial S involves binary expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's length must fit that pattern, but in this case, 34 is between 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6), so it's impossible.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The initial S is 1 symbol. After first expansion: 2 symbols. Each subsequent expansion doubles the number of symbols from that point. So if all non-terminals are expanded to terminals, the count would be 2^k. However, some non-terminals might produce terminals before that, but the overall count isn't necessarily a power of two because different branches can have different depths.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The initial count after S is 2. Each expansion can either leave a non-terminal as is (keeping count same) or replace it with two, which adds one more.\n\nWait, no: replacing a non-terminal with a terminal doesn't add to the count. Replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals increases the count by one (since one non-terminal becomes two).\n\nBut wait, the initial S: count = 1. After expanding S into NT3 NT77, count = 2 symbols.\n\nEach NT if it's a terminal, contributes 1 symbol. If it's non-terminal, it can be expanded into 2 symbols (if it's replaced by two), increasing the count by 1 for each such expansion.\n\nWait, no. If NT3 is replaced by two symbols, the count increases by one. Similarly for NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps the count is more accurately modeled by considering that each non-terminal contributes a variable number of symbols.\n\nBut I think the key here is that the total number of terminals in the string must be equal to 2^n for some n. Because, starting from S, each expansion either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the total number of terminals is 2^n.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the total number of symbols in the string (including non-terminals, if any) must be odd or even? No, that may not hold.\n\nWait, actually, the string given is all terminals, as each is of the form 'tX'. So S must have been expanded all the way down to terminals. Therefore, the total number of terminals would be a power of two because each expansion doubles the number when replacing"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-590","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has specific rules where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Let me look at the grammar provided to make sure it's in CNF.\n\nLooking through the productions, they all seem to fit the form: two non-terminals on the left, except for the ones where a terminal appears. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77 is in CNF, as are all the others. Each production either splits into two non-terminals or directly ends with a terminal. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF. That's good because certain parsing methods, like the CYK algorithm, work efficiently with CNF.\n\nWait, but I think the problem is more about reducing the string step by step to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. So, the string I need to evaluate is:\n\nt17 t74 t14 t14 t71 t74 t24 t10 t78 t63 t14 t14 t46 t69 t14 t17 t88 t54 t24 t14 t18 t61 t12 t14 t14 t65 t44 t87 t8 t70 t72 t42.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation should correspond to a top-down approach, but maybe bottom-up parsing using the CYK algorithm would be better here. I need to construct a parsing table and see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me recall how the CYK algorithm works. It works by identifying which non-terminals can derive substrings of the string, starting from length 1 up to the full length. Then, it checks if the start symbol S can derive the entire string.\n\nSo, first, I need to identify the terminals in the grammar. From the grammar, terminals are all the t followed by a number. Like t17, t32, t42, etc. Each t is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given consists entirely of terminal symbols. So, every token in the string corresponds to a production that ends with a terminal. That means each token must correspond to a production in the grammar that leads to that terminal.\n\nLet me try to map each token in the string to a production.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\n\nSo, t17 is produced by NT3.\n\nSimilarly, NT74 \u2192 t74.\n\nOther productions:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t14,\n\nNT24 \u2192 t24,\n\nNT26 \u2192 t26,\n\nNT10 \u2192 t10,\n\nNT78 \u2192 t78,\n\nNT63 \u2192 t63,\n\nNT46 \u2192 t46,\n\nNT69 \u2192 t69,\n\nNT17 \u2192 t17,\n\nNT88 \u2192 t88,\n\nand so on.\n\nSo, each token can be mapped to a specific non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nNow, to apply the CYK algorithm, I need to create a table where each cell (i, j) represents the range of the string from position i to j. Then, for each position, I check if there's a production that can produce the substring.\n\nLet me begin by listing all the tokens in order:\n\n1. t17\n\n2. t74\n\n3. t14\n\n4. t14\n\n5. t71\n\n6. t74\n\n7. t24\n\n8. t10\n\n9. t78\n\n10. t63\n\n11. t14\n\n12. t14\n\n13. t46\n\n14. t69\n\n15. t14\n\n16. t17\n\n17. t88\n\n18. t54\n\n19. t24\n\n20. t14\n\n21. t18\n\n22. t61\n\n23. t12\n\n24. t14\n\n25. t14\n\n26. t65\n\n27. t44\n\n28. t87\n\n29. t8\n\n30. t70\n\n31. t72\n\n32. t42\n\nSo, the length is 32. Therefore, the CYK table will be 32x32.\n\nBut doing this manually for 32x32 is time-consuming, but maybe I can find patterns or specific steps.\n\nAlternatively, since each token is a terminal, let's see what each corresponds to.\n\nt17 \u2192 NT3\n\nt74 \u2192 NT44\n\nt14 \u2192 NT14\n\nt71 \u2192 NT71\n\nt24 \u2192 NT24\n\nt78 \u2192 NT98\n\nt63 \u2192 NT93\n\nt46 \u2192 NT26\n\nt69 \u2192 NT44\n\nt17 \u2192 NT3\n\nt88 \u2192 NT74\n\nt54 \u2192 NT54\n\nt24 \u2192 NT24\n\nt14 \u2192 NT14\n\nt18 \u2192 NT82\n\nt61 \u2192 NT15\n\nt12 \u2192 NT58\n\nt14 \u2192 NT14\n\nt14 \u2192 NT14\n\nt87 \u2192 NT82\n\nt82 \u2192 NT??\n\nWait, t87 is in the string. Let me check the grammar for t87.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I don't see any NT that produces t87. Let's check the given grammar:\n\nThe productions end with terminals like t17, t65, etc., but I don't see t87 being produced. Wait, maybe I need to check each production. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side ends with t87. The provided grammar seems to list all productions, but I don't see any that produce t87. For example:\n\nLooking at NT87 \u2192 ... I don't see NT87 in the left-hand side of any production. So, in the given grammar, there's no non-terminal NT that can directly produce t87.\n\nWait, that means t87 is a terminal, but there's no production for it. So, how is the string supposed to be generated? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, no, the grammar only has certain non-terminals, but perhaps t87 is a typo, or maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT with t87 as the output. For example, the rule NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. That doesn't produce a terminal. Similarly, check other rules: NT85 \u2192 t74, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check if t87 is present as a terminal in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, yes, t87 is present (position 13): t87 is the 13th token. Hmm. So, according to the grammar, since there's no production that ends with t87, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because the string contains a symbol that is not produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, did I miss any production? Let me check again. The grammar has:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44,\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT3 NT67,\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT23 NT16,\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, looking for any production that ends with t87:\n\nLooking at the first rule, NTS \u2192 NT3 NT77, which is two non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the other productions, I don't see any that end with t87. So t87 is a problem because it's present in the string, but the grammar can't produce it. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the string provided, the 13th token is t87. So, if the grammar cannot produce t87 as a terminal, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong because maybe t87 is generated indirectly through some productions. But wait, in CNF, each production for a non-terminal A is either A \u2192 a (terminal) or A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, you can't have a production that results in t87 unless it's directly defined.\n\nTherefore, since t87 isn't a terminal produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, the string that includes t87 cannot be generated.\n\nHmm, but the given grammar only has certain terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-592","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing a bit easier, but since we're just checking if the string is generated, maybe a top-down approach like trying to match the string starting from the start symbol S would work.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT3 NT77 according to the first rule. So, the string must start with what NT3 and NT77 produce. Let me look up what each of those produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT3 is defined as NT17 NT6.\n- Looking up NT17, it's NT8 NT58.\n- NT8 is 't35'. Oh, wait, but the string starts with 't35', so that's promising. But let me note that NT8 directly produces 't35', so that works.\n\nNow, NT6. NT6 is 't63' according to one of the rules. So, NT3 would produce t35 t63.\n\nNext, NT77. NT77 is NT68 NT44. Let's look up those.\n\n- NT68 is NT49 NT25.\n- NT49 is 't12'.\n- NT25 is NT31 NT5.\n- NT31 is 't14'.\n- NT5 is 't14'.\n\nSo, NT68 is 't12 t14 t14'.\n\nNT44. NT44 is NT22 NT18. Let's look at those.\n\n- NT22 is 't71'.\n- NT18 is NT68 NT82.\n\nWait, but NT18 needs to be handled. Let's track this because it might get nested.\n\nSo, for NT44: 't71' followed by what NT18 produces. Let's handle NT18.\n\nNT18 is NT68 NT82. So we need both NT68 and NT82.\n\nNT68 we know is 't12 t14 t14' as above.\n\nNT82 is NT79 NT16. Let's find those.\n\n- NT79 is 't72'.\n- NT16 is 't7'.\n\nSo NT82 is 't72 t7'.\n\nTherefore, NT18 is NT68 NT82 \u2192 't12 t14 t14 t72 t7'.\n\nPutting it all together, NT44 is 't71' followed by 't12 t14 t14 t72 t7' \u2192 so 't71 t12 t14 t14 t72 t7'.\n\nNow, putting it all together for NT77: NT68 NT44 \u2192 't12 t14 t14' followed by 't71 t12 t14 t14 t72 t7', making 't12 t14 t14 t71 t12 t14 t14 t72 t7'.\n\nSo putting it all together for NT3 NT77: NT3 is 't35 t63', followed by NT77 which is 't12 t14 t14 t71 t12 t14 t14 t72 t7'. Therefore, the entire S production is 't35 t63 t12 t14 t14 t71 t12 t14 t14 t72 t7'.\n\nWait, but the string given is: \n\n`t35 t14 t54 t24 t54 t63 t56 t63 t63 t24 t10 t78 t63 t14 t14 t78 t87 t61 t74 t14 t14 t72 t61 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t46 t46 t69 t54`.\n\nLet me compare. The initial part of S is t35 t63, but the string starts with t35, then t14. That's a problem because after t35, the next is t14, not t63.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. NT3 is 't35 t63'. So the string should start with 't35 t63', but the given string starts with 't35 t14 t54 ...'. So that's a mismatch. Does that mean it's not generated by the grammar? So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to parse it, but since it's a context-free grammar, I'm assuming the standard leftmost derivation. So if S can't generate t35 followed by t14, then it's not in the language.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the NT3 production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking up NT3:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58.\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'.\n- NT6 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo NT3 \u2192 't35 t63'.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, S \u2192 't35 t63 ...', but the string starts with 't35 t14 ...', which can't be produced by S.\n\nThus, the string is not generated by the grammar, so the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-615","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. This is helpful because parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm can be used, but since I'm just trying to decide manually, I'll look for ways the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to check is: `t17 t12 t14 t14 t78 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t63 t14 t14 t78 t63 t24 t10 t65 t42 t51 t9 t71 t65 t73 t54 t61 t8 t24 t10 t22 t30 t22 t70`.\n\nBreaking it down, it's a sequence of 33 tokens. Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT3 NT77. So every expansion from S starts with NT3 and NT77. Wait, no, in CFG, when S is the start, it's NT3 and NT77. But wait, in the grammar, S -> NT3 NT77, meaning S expands to two non-terminals. So each of those non-terminals will expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nEach of those NTs on the right side of productions expand similarly. So if I can match each token in the string in the order generated by this process, that would mean the string is generated.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't17'. Let's check where that appears in the grammar. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nSo to get 't17', we need to expand NT3 to NT17 NT6. Then NT17 can expand to 't70' or 't63', but the first token is t17. Wait, no, 't17' is the result of NT17 -> 't70'? Wait, in the grammar, under NT17: NT17 -> 't70'. That's right. So NT17 can produce 't70' or 't63'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, checking the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT17, I see it's defined as NT17 -> 't70'. Oh, I just saw in the grammar, under NT17: NT17 -> 't70' and another production? Wait, no, under NT17, is it only one production? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar entries, under NT17: NT17 -> 't70'. So it can only produce 't70'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t17, which is 't17' as in a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, t17 is actually 't17', right? Or maybe 't17' is a terminal symbol. So I think each terminal is a single t followed by a number.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, several entries like NT3 -> 't17' NT6, where 't17' is a terminal. So each time a non-terminal like NT3 expands to 't17' followed by another non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is 't17', but in the CFG, the start symbol S expands to NT3 and NT77. So to get 't17', we need NT3 to expand into 't17' as the first symbol. Let's see the possible expansions:\n\nNT3 can produce 't17 NT6' or other options. So to get 't17' as the first symbol, that's possible. So S starts as NT3 NT77, so the first symbol is 't17', then the rest would be the expansion of NT77.\n\nSo the string starts with 't17', so S could start that way.\n\nNow, after 't17', the next token is 't12'. Looking at the grammar, 't12' is produced by NT12, which is part of other productions, but perhaps looking for a production that eventually leads to 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the entire string as a sequence and try to parse it step by step, checking if each token can be matched by some production.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to see if each 't' part in the string corresponds to a terminal that can be derived from some non-terminal production.\n\nLet me list all the 't' tokens in the string:\n\nt17, t12, t14, t14, t78, t12, t14, t14, t79, t54, t63, t14, t14, t78, t63, t24, t10, t65, t42, t51, t9, t71, t65, t73, t54, t61, t8, t24, t10, t22, t30, t22, t70.\n\nSo 33 't's as tokens. Let me index them 0 to 32.\n\nStarting with token 0: t17. As above, NT3 can expand to 't17' followed by NT6. So the first part would be NT3 -> 't17' NT6. Then, the second part is NT77.\n\nWait, no, the start is S -> NT3 NT77. So the entire string is derived from the leftmost derivations of NT3 followed by NT77.\n\nWait, but in CFG, the string is a single chain of productions. So we can consider this as two separate expansions for NT3 and NT77, and the overall string is the concatenation of the results from NT3's expansion and NT77's expansion.\n\nBut let me check. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't17', which is the first symbol. So that's the result of NT3 -> 't17' NT6, followed by the expansion of NT6.\n\nBut wait, no, NT3 -> 't17' NT6, which would produce 't17' followed by whatever NT6 expands to. So after 't17', the next token should be whatever NT6 produces as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions. Wait, in the grammar, is there a production for NT6?\n\nLooking through the entries, I don't see NT6 directly. Wait, maybe it's part of another production. For example, NT18 -> 't8' followed by NT50. So maybe NT6 can be part of another non-terminal's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Instead, maybe each 't' corresponds to a specific non-terminal's production. So let's map each 't' to the corresponding non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLet me make a mapping of 't' numbers to the non-terminals that can produce them:\n\n- t17: Only from NT17 (NT17 -> 't70')\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT17 is 't70'. So 't17' would have to come from some other production. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for terminals, perhaps in the grammar, 't17' is the result of a production. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar entries, NT17 -> 't70', but I don't see a production for 't17' itself. Wait, except in NT17, there's no 't17' as a production. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps 't17' is a terminal and it's generated by some non-terminal. For example, NT3 -> 't17' NT6, which implies that when NT3 expands, the first symbol is 't17', and the second part is whatever NT6 expands to.\n\nSimilarly, NT77 is part of S's production. So the string is the concatenation of NT3's expansion and NT77's expansion.\n\nSo starting with S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo first symbol is 't17', which comes from NT3. So the first part of the string is 't17', and the rest comes from NT77.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is 33 symbols, so the 't17' is the first, followed by 32 more. So after 't17', the rest (32 symbols) must come from NT77's expansion.\n\nSo let me think, NT77 expands to what?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nSo NT77 becomes NT68 followed by NT44.

{"custom_id":"request-616","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which makes parsing a bit more manageable. But I'm not a parser, so maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: \"t69 t14 t35 t54 t63 t7 t54 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t72 t61 t63 t24 t10 t69 t61 t8 t29 t90 t14 t14 t50 t42 t78 t8 t63 t12 t14 t14 t60\". It's a sequence of t-strings, each likely representing a terminal symbol. The grammar's rules mostly convert non-terminals (like S, NT20, etc.) into combinations of other non-terminals until they hit terminals (like t69, t14, etc.).\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So the derivation starts from the start symbol S and splits into two parts each step. Let me see how the start symbol S is defined. Looking back, the grammar starts with S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the string starts with t69, which I'm assuming corresponds to NT3 and NT77. Let me try to map this out.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So each step, we split the non-terminal into two parts until we reach terminals.\n\nLet's break the string step by step. The first token is t69. From the grammar, I see that NT65 \u2192 t7, but I also see NT93 \u2192 t90, and NT26 \u2192 t29. Hmm, but wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have terminals as their production, like NT3 \u2192 t17, NT5 \u2192 t14, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each token as either a production rule or a variable. Let me list out the grammar rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17  \nNT5 \u2192 t14  \nNT18 \u2192 t8  \nNT20 \u2192 t65  \nNT26 \u2192 t44  \nNT27 \u2192 seems not in the rules, checking again. Wait, NT54 \u2192 t83 and so on. Hmm, maybe some are more direct.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t69. Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t69? Let's check:\n\nNT* \u2192 t69. Hmm, I don't see any production where any NT goes directly to t69. So perhaps t69 comes from a longer chain. Maybe I need to find a path where a non-terminal eventually generates t69.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the beginning. The string is a sequence of terminals. To generate this string from S, each symbol must be derived from the starting symbol through a series of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals until we reach a symbol that can generate a terminal.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Let's see:\n\n- NT3 produces t17 (from NT3 \u2192 t17). So in the string, there's a t17 somewhere? Let me check the string: ... t69 t14 t35 t54 t63 t7 t54 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t72 t61 t63 t24 t10 t69 t61 t8 t29 t90 t14 t14 t50 t42 t78 t8 t63 t12 t14 t14 t60.\n\nNo, I don't see a t17. So if S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and NT3 \u2192 t17, then we should have a t17 in the string. But I don't see that. So perhaps S does not split into NT3 and NT77 as the start, or maybe I have a mistake in mapping.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking for t69. So the string starts with t69. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t69. From the rules, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 t32  \nNT74 \u2192 t16  \nNT93 \u2192 t27  \nNT79 \u2192 t69  \nNT65 \u2192 t46  \nNT65 \u2192 t7  \nNT2 \u2192 t69  \nNT58 \u2192 NT54 \u2192 t83 and so on.\n\nWait, looking deeper, I see NT2 \u2192 t69. So how is NT2 derived? NT2 is defined as NT44 NT36, so its production. So from S \u2192 NT3 NT77, but NT3 is t17, but in the string, maybe that's not the path. Alternatively, maybe another path from S could produce t69.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the first part of the string is t69. So that could come from NT2 \u2192 t69. So let's see: if S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and if NT3 goes to t17, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT20 NT3 (as S \u2192 NT3 NT77, but I'm not sure). Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused because I'm not tracking the steps correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol t69 comes from NT2, which is NT44 NT36. Let's check NT44 \u2192 t48 (NT44 \u2192 NT18 NT93) and NT36 \u2192 t50 (NT36 \u2192 NT17 NT65). Wait, but that's for a different production. Alternatively, let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree. Let me represent the string as a list of tokens:\n\nt69, t14, t35, t54, t63, t7, t54, t27, t61, t74, t14, t14, t72, t61, t63, t24, t10, t69, t61, t8, t29, t90, t14, t14, t50, t42, t78, t8, t63, t12, t14, t14, t60.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to generate the corresponding symbols.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first symbol is t69. If NT3 \u2192 t17, that would give a t17, which isn't in the string. So perhaps NT77 is the one that contributes t69. Let me check NT77's production: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Then NT68 \u2192 NT59 NT25. So NT68 \u2192 NT59 \u2192 NT74 NT51. Then NT54 \u2192 t83 and NT51 \u2192 t27. So from NT77, you get NT68 NT44, which eventually might produce t68? Wait, no. Wait, wait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let me trace the production in reverse. Each symbol in the string is either a terminal (like t69) or a non-terminal which needs to be further expanded. So starting from the beginning, the first symbol is t69, which is not a non-terminal, so it must directly appear from a non-terminal whose production includes t69. Looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t69?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t69 (from NT2 \u2192 NT44 NT36, but that doesn't directly produce t69). Wait, no, the direct productions are, for example:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT20 \u2192 t65 (from NT20 \u2192 t65). NT26 \u2192 t29, etc.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the direct productions are all the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, I need to find any production where a non-terminal directly becomes t69.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 t56  \n- NT74 \u2192 t75  \n- NT17 \u2192 t7  \n- NT2 \u2192 t69  \n- NT26 \u2192 t44  \n- NT48 \u2192 t18  \n- NT54 \u2192 t83  \n- NT75 \u2192 t79  \n- NT78 \u2192 t74  \n- NT93 \u2192 t27  \n- NT58 \u2192 t54  \n- NT79 \u2192 t69  \nWait, here we go.

{"custom_id":"request-631","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token represents a terminal symbol. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, each starting with a non-terminal symbol on the left and consisting of two non-terminal symbols on the right except for the base cases where a terminal appears.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, but I still need to figure out how to trace back the string through the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t14 t18 t61 t12 t24 t10 t79 t54 t30 t22 t30 t22 t69 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t63 t24 t10 t60 t22 t54 t24 t54 t63 t12 t24 t10 t87 t8`.\n\nI notice that some of these tokens are terminal symbols (like t35, t14, etc.), and others might be non-terminals, but looking at the grammar rules, all the right-hand sides consist of non-terminals except for the base cases where a terminal is explicitly written. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17' and so on.\n\nMy approach will be to check each token in the string and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is CNF, I can use recursive descent or maybe even a stack-based approach, but considering time, I might try to map the string by matching the possible derivations step by step.\n\nStarting with the beginning of the string: t35. Let's see which production rule results in 't35'. Looking at the grammar, looking for rules that produce 't35'. Scanning through the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, many of the non-terminals have productions that end with certain terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT18 \u2192 't8', etc. But I don't immediately see a rule that gives 't35'. Looking back, under the grammar, NT83 is written as 't35', but no\u2014 wait, looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT83 \u2192 't54' and NT8 \u2192 't35'. Yes, so NT8 \u2192 't35'. So the first token t35 must come from NT8.\n\nNow, the initial symbol S is on the left-hand side of the start production: S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So S must be rewritten into two non-terminals: NT3 and NT77. So the string should derive from S, which is NT3 NT77, and each of these non-terminals can produce certain sequences.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t35, which is from NT8. But NT3 would produce something else. So maybe the NT3 part is not directly expanding into t35. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the expansion. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the entire derived string, so each T in the string is a terminal symbol. So the initial symbol S starts the derivation. The entire string is a sequence of terminals derived from S.\n\nBut how do I parse this? Maybe I should try to map from the end of the string backward, using a stack approach. That's the CYK algorithm, which works for CNF grammars.\n\nCYK algorithm steps:\n\n1. Preprocess the string into tokens. Here, each 'tX' is a terminal token. Let me list the tokens in order: t35, t14, t18, t61, t12, t24, t10, t79, t54, t30, t22, t30, t22, t69, t14, t29, t61, t74, t14, t14, t63, t24, t10, t60, t22, t54, t24, t54, t63, t12, t24, t10, t87, t8.\n\n2. For each position in the string, determine the non-terminals that can generate the substring starting at that position. We'll create a table where each cell P(i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring from i to j.\n\n3. Since it's a CNF grammar, each production is either a single terminal (but in CNF, productions are of the form A->BC or A->a), but in our case, the RHS has exactly two non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, actually, many rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, but others have a mix? No, all are two non-terminals except for the base cases where a non-terminal rewrites to a terminal. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and so on. So, all non-terminals are on the LHS, and RHS is two non-terminals. But some of those non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 't35', which is a terminal. So in the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that produce a terminal, others produce another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, most of the production rules in the given grammar have two non-terminals on the RHS, except for those where a production is of the form A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, some non-terminals have rules that expand into a single terminal, while others expand into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify:\n\nA context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is such that every production is either:\n\n- A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or\n\n- A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in the given grammar, it looks like many of the productions are like A \u2192 BC. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. But also, some are A \u2192 a, like NT7 \u2192 't...' ?\n\nWait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\n\nAnd so on, but for example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which is two non-terminals. But not all: for example, NT83 \u2192 't54', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't35'. So in this grammar, some non-terminals have productions that result in a terminal, and others in further non-terminals.\n\nWait no, actually, no. In the given grammar, the RHS can consist of two non-terminals or a mix? Wait, in standard CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, in the given grammar, it seems that each non-terminal on the left has a production on the right that is either a mixture of non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But that doesn't fit CNF. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 is a production with two non-terminals, which fits A\u2192BC. However, NT8 \u2192 't35' is a terminal, which fits A\u2192a.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because in the given grammar, some productions seem to have two non-terminals, others have a mix of a terminal and a non-terminal, but according to CNF, all are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, the given grammar might not be exactly in CNF because in the beginning, each rule has a non-terminal on the left and on the right either two non-terminals, or in one case, a terminal plus a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar line:\n\n\" NT25 -> NT31 NT5 \"\n\nThat's two non-terminals.\n\n\" NT83 -> 't44' NT14 \" \u2014 is that a terminal and a non-terminal? If so, that's not in CNF because CNF requires that each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, all production rules have exactly one terminal OR two non-terminals on the RHS. That is, some production rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, others have a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nNo, that's not allowed in CNF.

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a good start because it simplifies things. Each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal and the right-hand side as either two non-terminals or a terminal. That means for each step, I can split a non-terminal into two parts, which could eventually lead to terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t24 t14 t70 t63 t79 t54 t32 t22 t27 t61 t12 t24 t10 t78 t78 t61 t8 t17 t8 t54 t35 t14 t70 t63 t88 t70 t10 t90 t24 t10 t60 t63 t30`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals map directly to a single terminal. For example, NT3 is 't17', NT6 is 't63', and so on. But some have expansions, like NT44 -> NT22 NT18, which could be expanded into terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's efficient to parse using top-down methods like the CYK algorithm. But since the string is quite long, that might be cumbersome. Alternatively, I can try to work backwards, checking if each part of the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts and see if each part can match a production.\n\nThe string is: [t54, t24, t14, t70, t63, t79, t54, t32, t22, t27, t61, t12, t24, t10, t78, t78, t61, t8, t17, t8, t54, t35, t14, t70, t63, t88, t70, t10, t90, t24, t10, t60, t63, t30].\n\nFirst, I'll note each production that results in a terminal:\n\nNT3 -> t17\nNT4 -> t74\nNT5 -> t54\nNT6 -> t63\nNT7 -> t57 (Wait, checking the grammar, there's no NT7. Looking back, I see NT58 and others. Maybe I misread.) Let me check again. Oh, the given grammar has NT6 -> t63, NT59 -> t17, and so on.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n- NT6 -> t63\n- NT18 -> t8\n- NT20 -> t65 (Wait, in the given grammar, NT20 -> NT44 NT36, which then needs to be expanded further to get to terminals.)\nWait, let me list out all the terminals in the grammar to see which non-terminals map directly.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT3 -> t17\nNT5 -> t14\nNT6 -> t63\nNT8 -> t35\nNT10 -> t54\nNT12 -> t12\nNT14 -> t70\nNT18 -> t8\nNT20 -> t65 (since NT20 -> NT44 NT36 and both are terminals? Wait, no, NT44 is not a terminal. Let me check: NT44 can be a production, but in this grammar, NT44 can produce terminals like t44? Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each production on the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So whenever a non-terminal can be directly written as a terminal, that's a primary production. Others are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nLet me list which non-terminals have direct terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> t17\n- NT5 -> t14\n- NT6 -> t63\n- NT8 -> t35\n- NT10 -> t54\n- NT12 -> t12\n- NT18 -> t8\n- NT20 -> t65 (Wait, NT20 -> NT44 NT36. Wait, do NT44 and NT36 produce terminals? No, in the given grammar, NT44 can produce NT22 and NT18, which then can produce terminals. So NT20 directly produces NT44 and NT36, which are non-terminals, so NT20 itself is not directly a terminal.\n\nWait, no, let me correct. The productions given have each right-hand side as either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So any non-terminal that appears on the RHS as a terminal must be a direct production. For example, NT3 -> t17 is direct.\n\nLooking through, here's which non-terminals have direct terminals:\n\nNT3 -> t17\nNT5 -> t14\nNT6 -> t63\nNT8 -> t35\nNT10 -> t54\nNT12 -> t12\nNT18 -> t8\nNT20 -> nt44 nt36 (non-terminals, so no)\nNT24 appears to be nt x, but let's check: I don't see NT24 in the given productions, but perhaps NT20 becomes t65 when NT44 and NT36 are expanded. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, NT36 is a non-terminal that may expand into terminals. For instance, NT36 -> NT17 NT79, and NT17 -> NT8 NT58. Then, NT8 is t8, and NT58 -> NT54 NT3. But NT54 -> NT44 NT3, and so on. Hmm, this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to reconstruct possible paths.\n\nThe first token in the string is t54, which is NT10. So the beginning of the string is NT10. Now, in the grammar, NT10 -> NT44 NT0? Wait, looking at the production rules, I see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules for NT10: hmm, actually, in the given grammar, I don't see NT10 as a production. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT10 as a left-hand side. Instead, I see NT59 -> NT74 NT51, NT54 -> NT82 NT98, etc. So maybe I was wrong about NT10. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar, I see NT54 -> t83, but that can't be because production rules have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, actually, no, the productions don't directly have NT54 as a terminal; perhaps I was confusing it with NT54 -> NT68 NT33, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list out all the productions that have a terminal on the RHS:\n\nLooking at each line after the grammar header:\n\nNT3 -> t17\nNT5 -> t14\nNT6 -> t63\nNT8 -> t35\nNT12 -> t12\nNT18 -> t8\nNT36 -> t50? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, for example, NT36 is written as some production, but in the given list of productions, I don't see a terminal on NT36's RHS. Let me check the lines:\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\nFor example, NT3 -> t17 is a direct production.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 -> t14, NT6 -> t63, NT8 -> t35, NT12 -> t12, and NT18->t8.\n\nOther non-terminals have two non-terminals on their RHS.\n\nSo, the terminals in the string correspond to NT3 (t17), NT5 (t14), NT6 (t63), NT8 (t8), NT12 (t12), and NT18 (t8). Other tokens in the string, like t54, t24, etc., must come from non-terminals that are not directly mapped to terminals.\n\nNow, starting with the string: t54 t24 t14 t70 t63 t79 t54 t32 t22 t27 t61 t12 t24 t10 t78 t78 t61 t8 t17 t8 t54 t35 t14 t70 t63 t88 t70 t10 t90 t24 t10 t60 t63 t30.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string we need to check is: `t69 t14 t18 t61 t74 t24 t10 t46 t69 t54 t63 t63 t24 t10 t13 t71 t71 t61 t63 t14 t14 t72 t61 t74 t24 t10 t88 t54 t24 t54 t54 t61 t8 t24 t10`.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because each step in the derivation produces exactly one terminal symbol or splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that most of the elements are just strings of t followed by numbers. But in the grammar, some of these must be non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, the grammar's terminals are various 't' followed by numbers, like 't69', 't14', etc. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nI need to see if the leftmost derivation of the string can be formed using the given productions. Starting with the start symbol S, which seems to expand into NT3 NT77. So the initial step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which becomes the first two symbols in the string: t69 and t74. But wait, the string starts with t69 t14 t18..., which doesn't match the first two symbols of NT3 NT77.\n\nWait, the string's first symbol is t69, which corresponds to NT3 \u2192 t69, so perhaps NT3 is the first part, and NT77 is the second. But the string starts with t69, so S \u2192 NT3 NT77. The leftmost symbol is NT3, so its expansion is t69 (as per the grammar: NT3 \u2192 't17', but wait, in the grammar, NT3 is 't69', right? Let me check: looking through the productions, I see NT3 -> 't17' and another production NT3 -> t69? Wait, wait, let me double-check the grammar rules provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\n\nWait, no, that's a production from NT3. But the terminals 't69', 't14\u2019 etc., are listed as separate productions. For example, NT3 -> 't17'? Or is there a production for NT3 that ends in a terminal?\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule like NT3 -> 't17' \u2014 let me check:\n\nYes, I see lines like NT3 -> 't17'. So that would mean NT3 can directly produce 't17', but in the given grammar, there's also NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So perhaps that's a non-terminal route, which may or may not be used.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first element is 't69'. Wait, I'm looking through the grammar and don't see 't69' as a direct production from any non-terminal. Wait, the string starts with t69 t14 t18..., which would have to be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first step is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so the leftmost non-terminal is NT3. Let's check what NT3 can produce. From the grammar, NT3 has two productions: one is NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and another is NT3 \u2192 't69'.\n\nSo in the first step, we can choose to produce 't69', which would make the string start with t69. So the leftmost part would become t69, and then the next symbol would be NT77.\n\nWait, but the given string has after t69 comes t14, which is the second symbol. That suggests that the two non-terminals NT3 and NT77 must expand into t14 followed by the rest.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, each production in CNF can replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so NT3 becomes the first symbol, which would be t69 if that\u2019s the production used. Then NT77 is the next non-terminal, which we need to expand. But the next symbol after t69 is t14 in the string. So NT77 should generate something that starts with t14.\n\nLooking at NT77's productions. Let me check the grammar rules for NT77. From the given rules, NT77 can be expanded as S in some cases, but in our case, looking through the rules:\n\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44\n\nLooking for NT77's productions:\nLooking through the rules, I see NT77 -> NT68 NT44.\n\nSo NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. Now, both NT68 and NT44 are non-terminals. So the next steps would involve expanding these.\n\nNow, looking at NT68 and NT44. Let me see their productions.\n\nNT68 has productions: NT68 -> NT49 NT25 and also NT68 -> NT49 NT25 again (is that the same?), but there's another for NT68 -> NT25 NT5.\n\nSo NT68 can be split into NT49 and NT25, or NT25 and NT5.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 has multiple productions: NT44 -> NT22 NT18, NT44 -> NT22 NT18 (again?), NT44 -> NT37 NT25, etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all the productions for NT44.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18\n\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18\n\nNT44 -> NT37 NT25\n\nNT44 -> NT37 NT25\n\nNT44 -> NT44 NT44\n\nWait, that's a production where NT44 on the left is expanded into NT44 and NT44, but that would complicate things because then NT44 would produce more NT44s, leading to a chain that might not resolve. But that's probably a typo because NT44 should be on the left side, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be another non-terminal. But assuming it's correct, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check each non-terminal step by step.\n\nWait, the string starts with t69, which we derived from NT3. Now, the next step is that NT77 (from S \u2192 NT3 NT77) must produce a sequence that starts with t14. So the expansion after t69 should be followed by t14. So let's look at how NT77 can expand.\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo NT68 and NT44 become the next symbols. So after t69, we have NT68 followed by NT44. But the string after t69 is t14, which is a terminal, so one of these must expand into 't14' as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at NT68's possible productions:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25\nNT68 \u2192 NT25 NT5\n\nSo after expanding NT68, we get either NT49 and NT25, or NT25 and NT5.\n\nSimilarly, NT44's possible productions include:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\nNT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25\nNT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25\nNT44 \u2192 NT44 NT44 (but I'm not sure about this one, maybe a typo)\nOther productions: Looking again, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, looking through the provided rules, under NT44, the last one is NT44 \u2192 NT68 NT68.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a non-terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals are defined as pairs of terminals, which would directly produce those terminals. For example, S -> NT3 NT77, so to use S, both NT3 and NT77 need to produce their respective terminals.\n\nLet's start with the first token, t69. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT74 -> t60, NT93 -> t61, and so on. Wait, no, actually, I just see NT40 -> t90, but I'm looking for t69. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Hmm, maybe it's produced by a series of steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by parsing the string step by step using the grammar. Starting with S, which requires two non-terminals.

Then I need to see if NT17 and NT6 can produce the tokens.\n\nWait, let's split the string into pairs based on the initial productions that have two parts.

{"custom_id":"request-677","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal (like S, NT20, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals or directly to a terminal. The string I need to evaluate is a series of terminals: t69, t14, t70, etc.\n\nI remember that to determine if a string is generated by a grammar, especially in CNF, the string's length can give a clue. In CNF, each production leads to exactly two symbols, so the number of steps in the derivation should match half the number of symbols minus one. Let me count the number of tokens in the string.\n\nThe string has 38 tokens. So the length is 38. For a derivation starting from S, which produces two non-terminals, the number of symbols after each step doubles. The formula for the length of the string is 2^n, where n is the number of reduction steps. Let me check if 38 is one less than a power of 2. But 2^n-1 for n=6 is 63, which is way more than 38. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no, actually, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols can increase by one each time if a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals. But in CNF, it's more about the structure than directly the count. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, a valid derivation tree must be a full binary tree. The number of symbols in the string (excluding the initial non-terminals) should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of non-terminals in the starting production. But wait, the starting symbol is S, which in the grammar S -> NT3 NT77. Each of those NTs should expand further.\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which are two non-terminals. Each of these will expand into two more non-terminals, so the total depth of the tree would be determined by how many times we expand. For a string of length 38, the number of terminals would be 2^n after n expansions. Since each expansion doubles the number of symbols (plus one initially), but it's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the length of the string should be 2^k -1 for some k. Let me see: 2^6 =64, so 64-1=63. Our string is 38 tokens. Hmm, 38 is less than 63, but more than 2^5-1=31. So perhaps it's possible, but maybe I should check the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the string and try to see if it can be broken down into parts that match the grammar rules. Let's list the tokens again:\n\nt69, t14, t70, t63, t32, t69, t35, t14, t17, t79, t54, t79, t54, t88, t32, t69, t46, t54, t24, t14, t35, t14, t17, t60, t54, t24, t54, t69, t73, t60, t63, t56, t60, t60, t63, t30.\n\nLooking at the initial tokens: t69 is likely from NT22, since in the rules, NT22 \u2192 NT31 NT27, and NT31 \u2192 NT14, and so on. Wait, let me check. Let's pick the first token, t69. Looking through the rules, I don't see t69 directly as a terminal. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I don't see 't69' as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. The string starts with t69, but looking at the provided grammar, all the terminals are things like 't8', 't35', 't32', etc., but not t69. Wait, did I miss 't69'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some terminals like t22, t14, t35, but not t69 seems to be present. So maybe the string starts with NT22. Because in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and each of those is a non-terminal. So the first step would be to expand S into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the first token is t69. So perhaps t69 comes from a non-terminal. Let's check which non-terminals produce t69. Looking through the rules, NT73 \u2192 t73, but that doesn't produce t69. NT74 \u2192 t75, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, in the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t69:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT74 -> t75\nNT44 -> t68 t46\nNT77 -> t32 t73\nNT54 -> t9, etc.\nNT18 -> t8\n...\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t69. That's odd because the string starts with t69. Maybe the string is invalid because the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces t69 as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps t69 is part of a non-terminal expansion that eventually reduces to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps t69 comes from NT77, which in the rules, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, NT49 \u2192 't49' but wait, looking back, NT49 -> 't74' and t88, so in the rules, NT49 has two terminals 't74' and 't88'. Wait, perhaps in the initial expansion, one of the non-terminals leads to t69 via more steps.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT27. NT71 \u2192 NT70 NT39. NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT7. If any of these produce t69? Hmm, not seeing it.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again for every NT:\n\nLooking through, for example, NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT27.\n\nLooking further, NT27 is in the rules as NT27 \u2192 NT59 or NT50. Wait, let's check the rule for NT27: I don't see it in the provided list. Hmm, maybe the rules go beyond what is provided. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, etc. Let me try to reconstruct a possible path.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should look at the string and try to split it into parts that fit the grammar. Starting with t69, then t14, t70, t63, t32, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that t69 isn't part of any direct expansion, making the string invalid. Because in the given grammar, all the terminal symbols are 't8', 't35', 't32', 't67', etc., but not 't69'. So if the string has 't69' as the first symbol, it must come from a non-terminal that can derive to 't69'.\n\nLooking back at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't69' as a terminal. So that would mean that 't69' must come from a non-terminal that eventually reduces to a series of terminals, none of which is 't69'. But since there's no production for 't69', the string can't be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, along with the string to evaluate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. From the provided grammar, I can see that it's already in CNF since every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t69 t14 t35 t14 t18 t61 t12 t14 t14 t88 t35 t54 t63 t88 t54 t24 t54 t68 t63 t63 t14 t14 t78 t54 t79 t54 t54 t61 t8 t10 t90 t54 t46 t90 t14 t14`. \n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. \n\nTo approach this, I'll try to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the string is quite long and the grammar has many rules, I'll have to proceed step by step, building the derivation tree or checking the possible reductions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the string and trying to find the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the start is two symbols: NT3 and NT77. Therefore, the first step would be to check if the first token is NT3 and the second is NT77. But wait, the string starts with t69, which is a terminal. Looking back at the grammar, the NT3 rule is defined as NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. And NT6 is a terminal \u2192 t63. So, NT3 \u2192 NT17 t63. But that doesn't directly give t69. Looking further, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see that some of the NT symbols are terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 t35, NT23 \u2192 t29, etc. So for NT3, from the rules, it's NT17 NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT58, and NT70 \u2192 t7, NT58 \u2192 t8, so NT17 \u2192 t7 t8, which is t78. Then NT6 \u2192 t63, so NT3 \u2192 t78 t63, which is t78 t63. But in the string, the first token is t69, which is different from t78. So that suggests that the first two symbols might not be matching. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial steps involve more steps. Let me think: the start is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So in the string, the first part is t69. But I need to see if any reduction can lead to that. Since S is the start, the derivation starts with S, which splits into NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at NT77\u2019s rules: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25. Then NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, which is a terminal t49 and NT25. Wait, this might get too complicated. Maybe I should think about the given string and see if it can be derived by decomposing it into the grammar's symbols.\n\nWait, the string starts with t69, which is a terminal. Looking back, nt67 is a terminal (\u2192 t56), nt65 \u2192 t46, etc. Let me look at all the terminals:\n\nThe string has t69, t14, t35, etc. Let's see if these correspond to any non-terminals. For example, t69 is a terminal, so it must be the result of a non-terminal that directly produces t69. Looking through the grammar, I see nt79 produces t51, nt65 \u2192 t46, nt74 \u2192 t60, and others. Wait, nt20 \u2192 t65, nt85 \u2192 t23, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider parsing the string as a series of terminals and see if there's a way to break them down according to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to split the string into smaller parts and see if they match the grammar. For example, the first part is t69. Does any non-terminal produce t69? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT \u2192 t69. The only nt symbols are those that produce terminals like t14, t35, etc.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. All non-terminals in the grammar end up producing some terminal, except for the case where S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and each of those leads down to terminals. So, if S is the start, the entire string must be derived from the two symbols NT3 and NT77, each leading to sequences of terminals.\n\nSo, to check the string, I need to see if it can be split into two parts: the first part must match the expansion of NT3, and the second part must match the expansion of NT77.\n\nLet me check:\n\nString: t69 t14 t35 t14 t18 t61 t12 t14 t14 t88 t35 t54 t63 t88 t54 t24 t54 t68 t63 t63 t14 t14 t78 t54 t79 t54 t54 t61 t8 t10 t90 t54 t46 t90 t14 t14.\n\nThis is quite long, so perhaps I'll need to break it down into the top-down expansion.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the string must start with the expansion of NT3 and be followed by the expansion of NT77.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t69, which is a terminal. So according to the production rules for NT3, NT3 can expand into sequences that include t63 as part of it. Since t69 is not directly produced by any NT symbol, except maybe through a longer path, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look more carefully at the production rules for NT3 and NT77.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n- NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT58\n- NT70 \u2192 t7 or NT70 \u2192 NT95 NT18\n- NT58 \u2192 t8 or NT58 \u2192 NT22 NT1\n- NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT18 (or other rules from the grammar?)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost here. Let me try to map out all the expansions for NT3 and NT77.\n\nStarting with NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So the expansion of NT3 is whatever NT17 and NT6 produce. NT6 is a terminal \u2192 t63. So NT3 expands to the concatenation of NT17's expansion and t63.\n\nWhat's NT17? NT17 \u2192 NT70 NT58. So NT17's expansion is whatever NT70 and NT58 produce. NT70 can be either t7 or NT95 NT18. NT95 \u2192 t61, and NT18 \u2192 t8 or NT20 NT50. NT20 \u2192 t65, and NT50 \u2192 t24.\n\nSo NT70 \u2192 t7 or t61 NT18. If NT18 \u2192 t8, then NT70 \u2192 t7 or t61 t8. Then, NT58 \u2192 t8 or NT22 NT1. NT22 \u2192 t78 or NT37 NT25. NT1 \u2192 ... (I need to find what NT1 \u2192 ). Looking through, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals like NT14 \u2192 t73, etc. But for NT1, I don't see a direct production except from NT22.\n\nWait, this seems complicated, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe the string is too long and the expansion of NT3 and NT77 requires too many steps, making it impossible for the string to be entirely consumed, so I can conclude it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can identify if the string can be split into two parts: one that ends with NT3's expansion and the next part that starts with NT77's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the last few tokens: ..., t90, t54, t46, t90, t14, t14.\n\nLooking at the NT74 rule: NT74 \u2192 t60 or NT77 \u2192 ... Wait, but NT77 is part of the start symbol. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT65's rule: NT65 \u2192 t46 or NT26 NT30"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF has production rules where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in this grammar, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking through the grammar, most non-terminals do have rules that either produce two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT3 NT77) or a terminal (like NT3 \u2192 't17'). So the structure makes sense.\n\nThe provided string is a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived step by step from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals according to their production rules.\n\nFirst, I will look at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string should start with the expansions of NT3 and NT77. Let's see what the string starts with. The string begins with `t17`, which is a terminal. Looking up the CFG, NT3 \u2192 't17', so that's correct. So the first part is satisfied.\n\nSo the first word `t17` corresponds to NT3. Now, what about the second part? The next word is `t74`, which comes from NT77. Looking at NT77 \u2192 't32', so that's 32: 't32' would be 't74'. Wait, actually, NT77 \u2192 't32', so 't32' would be 32, but the string has `t74`. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT77 has two production rules: NT77 \u2192 't32' and NT77 \u2192 NT77 NT77. Wait, no, in the user's message, the grammar is a bit long. Let me scan through.\n\nWait, I see that in the user's message, for NT77, two production rules are listed: NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44 and NT77 \u2192 't32'. So actually, NT77 can either produce NT68 NT44 or 't32'. So in the string, the second word is `t74`, which isn't directly matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the string begins with `t17 t74 ...`. So after NT3 (t17), NT77 needs to expand to 't74'. But looking at the grammar, NT77 \u2192 't32' is one of its productions. So 't32' would be if NT77 \u2192 't32', but in the string it's 't74'. So that doesn't match, which would mean a conflict. Unless... perhaps the grammar has another rule I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if NT77 can produce more than just 't32' and NT77 NT77. Looking back, in the user's message, under NT77, it says: NT77 -> NT68 NT44; NT77 -> 't32'. So yes, that's it. So NT77 can only produce two options. The first is NT68 and NT44, and the second is 't32'. \n\nNow, in the string, after t17, the next is t74. That would require NT77 to produce t74. But according to the CFG, NT77 can only produce 't32' or NT68 NT44. So unless NT68 NT44 can produce t74, which would require further expansion.\n\nWait, but the string after t17 is t74, so that suggests that NT77 is directly producing t74, but according to the grammar, it's not possible because NT77's direct productions are 't32' or NT68 NT44. So that would mean the string's second token is invalid because NT77 can't directly produce t74. \n\nHmm, but I might be making a mistake. Maybe there's another rule for NT77 that I'm missing. Let me look again through the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the NT entries, except for the ones starting with NT77, I don't see any other rule for NT77. It only has two: one leading to 't32' and the other to NT68 NT44. So unless there's a different structure, this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is correct, and I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem isn't in the initial step but deeper down.\n\nWait, perhaps the string actually is generated by the grammar, and I'm just misinterpreting the productions. Let me try to represent the string as a series of steps.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17, which matches the string's first token.\n\nNow, NT77 can either be 't32' or produce NT68 NT44.\n\nLooking at the string: after t17 is t74. So the second half is 't74'. That suggests that NT77 must produce t74, but according to the grammar, that's not possible. Unless t74 is part of a further expansion of NT68 or NT44.\n\nWait, maybe the expansion requires that NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and then both NT68 and NT44 expand further. Let's see.\n\nSo NT68 has a production: NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT25 and NT68 \u2192 't77' (wait, checking the grammar: NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT25, and also looking further, I see NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT25, but in the grammar, actually, under NT68: 'NT68 -> NT77 NT25' and later in the same section, there's another rule 'NT68 -> NT77 NT25' as well? Or maybe more.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT25; also, under another entry, NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. Wait no, the grammar is a list of entries. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nHmm, looking at the grammar, some are written as A -> BC, others are A -> a.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT68 -> NT77 NT25\nNT25 -> NT31 NT5\nNT59 -> NT74 NT51\n...\nLooking over, I can see that NT68 has a production that leads to NT77 and NT25, and others have different productions.\n\nSo if NT77 expands to NT68 NT44, then NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT25.\n\nSo let's try that step by step.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 t17 NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 can expand to NT68 NT44.\n\nSo now the string is t17 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, NT68 \u2192 NT77 NT25.\n\nSo expanding that: t17 NT77 NT25.\n\nNow, NT77 can expand again, this time let's say to 't32' (using NT77 \u2192 't32'), but in the context of the string, after t17, the next is t74. Hmm, that seems problematic.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the entire string needs to be processed as a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if each non-terminal can produce the required terminal in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is t17 followed by 't74', which would require NT77 to expand into 't74', but that's not possible. So perhaps the answer is that the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut let's think again: perhaps the grammar allows for more than just direct expansions. Maybe after expanding NT77 to NT68 NT44, then NT68 can be expanded again to produce more.\n\nWait, let me map out the possible expansion steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 t17 NT77.\n\nNow, NT77 can either be 't32' or NT68 NT44.\n\nIf NT77 \u2192 't32', then we get t17 t32, which doesn't match the string.

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of production rules that replace each non-terminal symbol with a combination of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals in this grammar are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't70', 't63', etc. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, every production has either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string starts with 't70' and ends with 't30'. I need to check if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S produces NT3 NT77, right? So S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Each of these non-terminals can then produce other combinations.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual tokens: t70, t63, t63, t24, t10, t71, t63, t24, t10, t79, t54, t27, t61, t8, t44, t79, t54, t12, t14, t14, t60, t15, t27, t8, t71, t69, t14, t14, t69, t30, t22, t54, t24, t14, t70, t63, t56.\n\nI notice that this is a long string, so manually checking each step would be tedious. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if there's a possible derivation path.\n\nLet me consider the first token 't70'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT70 has a production to 't7'. So if NT70 \u2192 't7', then 't7' would be the token. But in our string, it's 't70', which is a terminal symbol. Wait, no, 't70' is a terminal because it's 't' followed by a number. So for NT70, looking at the productions, I see NT70 \u2192 't7'. But our string starts with 't70', which is different.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a non-terminal that can derive 't70'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't7' (from the list: NT70 -> 't7')\n\nBut our string starts with 't70', not 't7'. Wait, perhaps there's a typographical error, but assuming the string is correct as given, 't70' must be derived from some non-terminal. So let me check if any non-terminal can derive 't70'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\nWait, yes, NT17 \u2192 't70'. So if NT17 can derive 't70', perhaps the string starts with NT17 \u2192 't70'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't70', which can come from NT17. Now, from the start symbol S, which produces NT3 and NT77. So we have S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string is generated by NT3 and NT77. Let's see how they might produce the tokens starting with t70.\n\nWait, but NT3 \u2192 't17'. So if we have NT3 \u2192 't17', which is a terminal. But in the string, after 't70', the next token is 't63'. That suggests that after 't70', the next non-terminal in the derivation is producing another token. Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is more than just a single S derivation. Let me see. The string starts with t70, which if part of NT17 \u2192 't70', then S \u2192 NT3 NT77, so S directly produces t17 and something else. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t70, which is 't70', so that would require NT17. So perhaps we have S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and NT3 is producing t17, but the string starts with t70, which is from NT17, so perhaps the entire left part is NT3 \u2192 t17, and the NT77 is generating a longer string.\n\nBut the string starts with t70, so maybe the initial NT77 is producing t70, but looking at the productions for NT77:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44.\n\nSo NT77 can produce two non-terminals: NT68 and NT44. Let me break down NT68 and NT44.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't49' (but in the string, we don't have a 't49' until later).\n\nWait, but in the string, after t70, we have t63, t63, t24, t10, t71, etc. So perhaps NT77's first step is to produce NT68 and NT44, which can in turn produce more tokens.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should try to find a way to map the string backward using the grammar.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, we can parse the string using a recursive descent parser or look for a possible leftmost or rightmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a length that suggests the number of steps needed in the derivation. Each production in CNF either introduces a terminal or splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals. The string length is 37 tokens, which is quite long, so the derivation must be quite deep.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking through the productions, some non-terminals map directly to terminals, while others split into two non-terminals.\n\nPerhaps I can find a path through the grammar that allows the string to be produced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains terminals that don't match any production, which would immediately make it invalid.\n\nLet me check each token in the string against the productions to see if they can be derived.\n\n1. 't70' \u2192 Looking for NT that can produce 't70'. Yes, NT17 \u2192 't70'.\n2. 't63' \u2192 Looking for NT that produces 't63'. NT63 is mentioned in some productions? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT63, but perhaps it's in another rule. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for 't63': 't63' is the result of NT74 \u2192 't63' (NT74 \u2192 't60'? Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT74 \u2192 't75'. Wait, not helpful. Wait, looking back, perhaps in 't63', it's from NT54 \u2192 't63'? Let me check:\n\nYes, in the productions, there's NT54 \u2192 't63'.\n\nBut wait, checking the productions:\n\n\"NT54 -> 't9'\", wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the list, the entry is \"NT54 -> 't83'\". Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me go through the productions carefully.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The list is long, so perhaps I should look for 't63' directly. Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- \"NT44 -> 't68'\"? No, that's 't68'.\n- \"NT63 -> ?\" No, I don't see an entry for NT63 directly mapping to a terminal. Looking through, the only terminal with 't63' is:\n\n\"NT26 -> 't63'\", but that's a production that splits into NT26 \u2192 't63'.\n\nWait, so 't63' can be produced by NT26, because one of the productions is NT26 \u2192 't63'.\n\nBut wait, wait, looking back:\n\nIn the list, it's written as \"NT26 -> 't63'\". Is that correct?\n\nYes, looking at the end of the productions, I see:\n\n\"NT26 -> 't63'\". So NT26 directly produces 't63'.\n\nSo the string has 't70', which is NT17, 't63' is NT26, then another 't63' (another NT26), then 't24', which is NT24.\n\nLet me proceed step by step:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n   - So the two non-terminals NT3 and NT77 need to generate the string.\n\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-713","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to determine if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar (CFG) is. It consists of a set of production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. The string must be derived by expanding the start symbol (in this case, S) and eventually matching the input string exactly.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. So, the productions are all of length 2 (two non-terminals) or terminal followed by non-terminals? Wait, no, CNF has all productions as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this grammar, every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions seem to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, etc. However, not all are in the form A \u2192 a. For example, some have two non-terminals, some may have only one, but I think in CNF, all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nWait, let's check if any production here has only one non-terminal. Looking through the productions, I notice that all are in the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So there are no production rules where a non-terminal is directly converted to a single terminal. Instead, every non-terminal production expands into another two non-terminals, which eventually will be expanded into terminals.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the string will consist of a sequence of terminals that are leaves in the derivation tree. Since the string provided is a concatenation of t's and numbers, but looking at the grammar, many of the non-terminals are assigned specific terminal strings.\n\nWait, let me look closely. In the grammar, some of the non-terminals are assigned to specific terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT8 \u2192 't35', NT2 \u2192 't69', and so on. So, the non-terminals like NT3, NT8, etc., expand to specific terminals, and other non-terminals expand to other non-terminals. \n\nSo, the process will involve starting from S and applying production rules, replacing each non-terminal with the appropriate productions until all symbols are terminals. The question is whether the given string can be formed by such a derivation.\n\nBut manually expanding this would take a lot of steps, especially since the string is 44 characters long (counting spaces and including 't0' but excluding ' t ' for spaces). Given the complexity, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parse the string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals as per the grammar. Let's consider that each non-terminal production in CNF can be thought of as a binary expansion, so the string is a concatenation of symbols derived from a binary tree.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for possible overlaps or sequences that must correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t35 t14 t35 t14 t70 t63 t56 t63 t79 t54 t32 t69 t88 t70 t71 t63 t24 t10 t69 t61 t74 t24 t10 t88 t69 t14 t17 t56 t63 t74 t14 t14 t7 t54 t46 t90 t24 t10.\n\nFirst, I notice that t0 is present. Looking at the grammar, the only place where 't0' is mentioned is NT15 \u2192 't73', but I don't see any NT85 or others producing 't0'. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT74 NT51 (but NT51 isn't terminal, but NT51 \u2192 NT93 NT16, etc., so that might not help. Wait, no, NT51 is a non-terminal, so it's not in the terminals. So I think that the only time a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal is for some non-terminals having a rule like NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85, and other similar ones, but some have rules that end with a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce a terminal. For example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't75' (wait, no, looking at the grammar, some have 't' as part of larger production. Maybe I should make a list of all non-terminals that produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 NT26 NT44\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo that would mean NT26 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 NT44 NT33 \u2192 which then is NT44 \u2192 ... but wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to list all non-terminals that have a direct terminal assignment.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't69'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't14' (Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT5 isn't terminal, wait. Let me check each rule to see if any non-terminals directly map to terminals.\n\nWait, I'm going through each production:\n\nFind all rules where the right side has a terminal. For example, NT18 \u2192 't8', so NT18 produces 't8'. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 't73', but that's a terminal. Wait, no, NT15 is a non-terminal; in the rules, it's defined as NT15 \u2192 't73', so 't73' is a terminal. But in our string, we have several 't's with numbers, so any production that ends in a terminal can be used.\n\nSo, let me list all the non-terminals that have a terminal on their right-hand side:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't69'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't70'\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't46'\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't75'\n\n- NT88 \u2192 't24'\n\nWait, looking through:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't69'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT44 \u2192 't60'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't63'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't32'\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, no: Wait, let me go step by step.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' \u2192 yes\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35' \u2192 yes\n\nNT2 \u2192 't69' \u2192 yes\n\nNT74 \u2192 't75' \u2192 yes\n\nNT17 \u2192 't70' \u2192 yes\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT26 NT44 \u2192 but NT26 and NT44 are non-terminals, so no terminal here.\n\nNT15 \u2192 't73' \u2192 yes, 't73'\n\nBut in the string provided, I don't see 't73', so perhaps that's not a problem. So, the string has a mix of terminals, some of which are directly produced by non-terminals, and others might have to be derived from longer chains.\n\nOur string includes 't35' multiple times. Since 't35' is produced by NT8, that's a non-terminal that must split into two parts where one side is NT8.\n\nLooking at how to parse the string, perhaps each terminal can be matched to a non-terminal, but the challenge is ensuring the order and that all non-terminals eventually expand into the string without any leftover symbols.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to model this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use recursive descent or CYK parsing, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the string is provided, we can check for possible splits where each non-terminal's production can match a part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to check if each contiguous part of the string that doesn't contain 't's with numbers can be matched by a non-terminal. But that's not exactly correct, because non-terminals can expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of terminals, if the grammar can derive it, then every time we see a 't', it's directly produced by a non-terminal. So the sequence should be such that each symbol in the string is a terminal, and the derivation splits into non-terminals that can form that sequence"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since it's in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The provided grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT20, NT68, etc.) and terminals, with each rule connecting non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNow, the string we're given is a sequence of terminals. To determine if it's generated by the grammar, I'll need to check if there's a way to derive this string step by step using the productions.\n\nBut parsing this directly could be complex, so maybe a better approach is to model this as a derivation tree or use the CYK algorithm for context-free grammars. However, CYCK is a bit involved, and since I'm just thinking through it, maybe I should break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the symbols in the string and see how they might correspond to the grammar's productions.

{"custom_id":"request-736","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of productions, and I'm given a string to check.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make it somewhat structured, but I know that not all grammars in CNF need to be easy to parse.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see non-terminals like S, NT20, NT68, and so on. Some of them are linked back to terminals with 't' followed by a number, like 't54', 't24', etc. These terminals are the 'leaf' nodes of the grammar\u2014once they appear, they don't have any further productions. \n\nThe given string is:\n\nt54 t24 t14 t35 t14 t18 t61 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t63 t24 t10 t16 t27 t8 t24 t10 t50 t42 t44 t54 t24 t54 t63 t79 t54 t74 t14 t14 t60 t69 t88 t70 t60 t63 t30.\n\nI notice that many of the tokens in the string are these 't' followed by numbers, which are the terminals generated by the grammar. My goal is to trace a path through the grammar that can generate this sequence.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, perhaps the best approach is to model this as a parsing problem\u2014building a parse tree where each internal node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal. Each production can be used to split the string into parts, recursively.\n\nThe string starts with 't54'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't54'? Scanning through, I see NT54 \u2192 't9' and also 't83' via NT44 and others. Wait, no, 't54' itself is produced by NT24. Let me check. Looking at the list, NT54 \u2192 't9' is one production, but I also see NT83 \u2192 't93', which might not help. Wait, no, looking again, I see that NT74 \u2192 't75' and NT74 also \u2192 other things, but looking for 't54':\n\nOh, I see, under NT54, there are entries like NT54 \u2192 't9', and also in NT67 \u2192 't44' and others. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me go through the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT54, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't9'\n- NT54 \u2192 other non-terminals, like NT40, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the productions for NT54 might not have 't54'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT67: NT67 \u2192 't56'. Under NT54: 't9' and another line says NT54 \u2192 't83', but looking at the production list, it's:\n\nNT54: \u2192 't9' and seems not to have 't54'. Hmm, so perhaps 't54' is generated by NT24? Let me check the productions. Yes, here: NT24 \u2192 t54.\n\nYes, the production NT24 \u2192 't54' is present. So the first token in the string is 't54', which can be generated by NT24. \n\nNow, following the grammar, each production can split into two non-terminals. So for each step, I need to split the string into left and right parts based on a production.\n\nBut this can get complicated quickly. Perhaps a better approach is to model the entire process as a series of splits, building up the string from the start and seeing if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe looking for the entire derivation step by step isn't feasible manually. But perhaps the first few steps can help.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nSo the string starts with 't54 t24...', which is 't54' followed by other terms. Let's see what the first part could be.\n\nBut wait, S is the start symbol, so S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string will be built as NT3 followed by NT77.\n\nIf NT3 produces 't17' (since NT3 \u2192 't17'), but in our string, the first token is 't54', which is generated by NT24. So maybe this is a case where S is split into two parts, but perhaps S leads to different non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire string must be generated by a single production chain starting from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire string being built from S. So S must derive the entire string. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the string starts with what NT3 can generate, followed by what NT77 can generate.\n\nBut in our string, the first token is 't54', which is generated by NT24, not NT3. So perhaps this string is not generated by this grammar, because the first symbol would require NT3 to derive 't54', which it can't.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me check: in the grammar, does NT3 \u2192 't17', meaning its only production is 't17'. So NT3 can't generate any other symbols except for 't17'. Therefore, the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first token in any string derived from S must come from NT3, which is 't17', but our string starts with 't54', so that's a mismatch.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me check: the productions for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17', and that's it. So NT3 can only produce 't17'. Therefore, the first token in the string must be 't17', but the given string starts with 't54', which is a different terminal. Therefore, this suggests that the string is not possible, as it starts with a terminal that is not 't17', and hence can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the entire string is built from more complex derivations, where internal non-terminals split further, leading to 't54' being part of a larger tree.\n\nWait, no, because S starts by producing NT3 and NT77. Any string derived from S would start with what NT3 produces, which is only 't17'. So the first symbol in the string must be 't17', but it's 't54' instead. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the grammar. Let me list the productions for NT3:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT3, the production is:\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\n\nYes, that's the only production. So NT3 can't produce anything else but 't17'. Therefore, S \u2192 NT3 NT77 means the first symbol of any string derived from S must be 't17', and that's it.

The string is a sequence of t<something>, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. First, I need to understand how the grammar works and then see if each token in the string can be derived through the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in CNF, meaning each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S. Each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals except for the ones that eventually expand to terminals (like 'tX').\n\nI notice that many non-terminals directly produce terminal strings. For example, NT3 -> 't17', NT6 -> 't63', etc. So, each token in the string must be matched by one of these terminals produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string provided is: `t69 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t27 t61 t63 t14 t14 t60 t7 t10 t44 t78 t54 t27 t61 t74 t24 t10 t65 t42 t10 t90 t54 t90 t54 t70 t63 t74 t14 t14 t10 t90 t14 t14`.\n\nI'll list each token and see if it's present in the grammar as a terminal.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar has several NT (Non-Terminal) productions leading to terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t69 t14 t14 t29 t61 t8 t63 t63 t24 t10 t7 t54 t46 t90 t14 t14 t68 t30 t74 t24 t10 t10 t90 t24 t10 t27 t8 t71 t88 t35 t14 t18 t61 t8 t27 t61 t8 t71 t83 t14 t14`.\n\nHmm, let's note that each word in the string represents an 'a' in the grammar. For example, 't69' is the production for NT74 because look at the grammar: NT74 -> 't75' and maybe others? Wait, actually, I need to check the productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, some NT rules produce terminals. For example, NT74 -> 't75', NT18 -> 't8', NT54 -> 't83', etc. But wait, the string has words like 't69' which I don't see directly in the productions. Did I miss any? Let me check again.\n\nLooking carefully, for example, NT26 has a production NT26 -> 't44'. But 't69' isn't directly listed. So perhaps I need to see if NT26 can produce 't69'. But then, in the grammar, NT26 -> NT5 \u2192 perhaps after some steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree or using a top-down approach or even the CYK algorithm.

{"custom_id":"request-749","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. My string is `t35 t14 t70 t63 t68 t10 t90 t71 t9 t14 t14 t50 t73 t71 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t79 t54 t88 t54 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t70 t29 t79 t54 t30 t22 t46 t54 t24 t54 t63 t32`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a set of productions, each taking a non-terminal and expanding it into two non-terminals or a terminal. Some non-terminals expand into terminal symbols, like `NT3 -> 't17'`, and others expand into other non-terminals. My string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so each of them should correspond to a production rule step.\n\nThe string has 39 tokens, all of which are 't' followed by numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces a single terminal or splits into two. The length of the string can help determine the structure of the parse tree. A string of length n can be generated by a grammar where the leftmost derivation requires n-1 steps, and each step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, leading to a binary tree of height log2(n).\n\nWait, actually, since each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, the length of the string corresponds to the number of leaves in the parse tree. So, for a string of length m, the parse tree will have m leaves. The number of non-terminals in the derivation will be m-1, as each replacement adds one more node, leading to the number of productions being m-1. So, for a string of length 39, the number of productions is 38. That seems plausible.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step. Maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree by matching the string from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT3 NT77. So, the first two symbols should expand NT3 and NT77. Let's see what NT3 and NT77 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has a production: `NT3 -> NT17 NT6`. So, the first symbol in the string is t35. The first part of the string is t35, which corresponds to NT3 expanding into NT17 and NT6. So, the next step is to see if NT17 and NT6 can produce t35.\n\nWait, no. The production NT3 -> NT17 NT6 means that it produces two non-terminals, which then need to be expanded into terminals. But in the string, the first token is t35, so either NT17 or NT6 must directly produce t35. Let me check the rules for NT17 and NT6.\n\nLooking at NT17: `NT17 -> NT8 NT58`, which isn't a terminal. Wait, no, NT17 has another rule: `NT17 -> 't70'`. Oh, right. Also, looking at NT6: `NT6 -> 't63'`. So, NT6 can produce t63. But in our case, the first symbol is t35. So, can either NT17 or NT6 produce t35? Let me check their rules.\n\nNT17: `NT17 -> NT8 NT58` or `NT17 -> 't70'`. So, only t70. So, NT3 is producing NT17 and NT6, which together should produce t35. But that doesn't make sense because NT17 produces t70 and NT6 produces t63, which are different from t35.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me think again. The initial string starts with t35. The first step is that S expands into NT3 NT77, which then must derive into the string. So, the expansion of NT3 must lead to a series of steps that produce some combination that includes t35. But NT3's first expansion is NT17 NT6, which produce t70 and t63. But our first token is t35, which suggests that perhaps I've misaligned the production steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than it's being used correctly, and I need to consider that the non-terminal productions could result in multiple tokens. But given the structure, it's possible that each non-terminal replacement could lead to a sequence of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and trying to split it into parts that match the grammar rules. However, that might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each token in the string can be matched by a production's terminal expansion. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either results in a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step either introduces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string token by token, matching production rules.\n\nThe string is: t35 t14 t70 t63 t68 t10 t90 t71 t9 t14 t14 t50 t73 t71 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t79 t54 t88 t54 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t70 t29 t79 t54 t30 t22 t46 t54 t24 t54 t63 t32.\n\nI'll list them as positions 1 to 39.\n\nStarting with position 1: t35.\n\nLooking at the possible NTs: Are there any non-terminals that produce t35?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT26: `NT26 -> 't44'`, not t35. NT79: `NT79 -> t69`. No. NT44: `NT44 -> 't68'`. No. NT54: `NT54 -> 't83'`? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions for each non-terminal that are terminals are listed as, for example, `NT3 -> 't17'` and others. Looking through all the terminal rules, the only t35 is in `NT22 -> 't71'`, but that's t71, not t35. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking for 't35' in the grammar's terminal productions:\n\nNT8: `NT8 -> 't35'`. So, NT8 can produce t35.\n\nSo, the first token t35 comes from NT8, which is a rule of the grammar. So, to produce t35, the non-terminal must be NT8.\n\nBut in the initial expansion of S, we have S -> NT3 NT77. So, the first non-terminal is NT3. How would NT3 derive to t35?\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: It's either `NT3 -> NT17 NT6` or `NT3 -> 't17'`. But nt3 can also produce other things. Wait, no, only `NT3 -> NT17 NT6` and `NT3 -> 't17'`.\n\nWait, looking back: The provided grammar shows `NT3 -> NT17 NT6` and earlier `NT3 -> 't17'` as a rule. But in the given rules, I don't see `NT3 -> 't35'`. So, unless there's a rule I missed, NT3 cannot directly produce t35. Therefore, the first token t35 must come from a different non-terminal, but in the initial expansion, it's NT3.\n\nThis suggests that the string starts with t35, which is produced by NT8, but the production starts with NT3. This seems contradictory, so perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've got the structure wrong. Perhaps NT3 can expand into a sequence of rules that eventually lead to t35.\n\nWait, let's think. The initial expansion of S is NT3 and NT77. NT3 can be NT17 NT6, which each need to expand. So, NT17 can be 't70' or other rules, and NT6 can be 't63' or other rules.\n\nBut how would we get t35 from NT3? It seems impossible because NT3's immediate rules don't produce t35. The only direct terminal for NT3 is 't17'. So, unless NT3 can somehow expand into t35 through other steps, which seems impossible given the grammar's existing rules.\n\nTherefore, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar using the Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a sequence of tokens, each of which is either a specific string or a terminal symbol 't' followed by a number. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NTx, etc.) expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal. The grammar here seems to consist of right-hand sides that are either non-terminals or the given 'tN' strings.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t70 t63 t63 t14 t14 t78 t12 t24 t10 t72 t61 t12 t24 t10 t79 t54 t79 t54 t88 t32 t69 t27 t61 t8 t14 t74 t14 t14 t12 t24 t10 t68 t69 t54 t24 t14 t70 t63 t56 t54 t70`.\n\nI remember that when dealing with such grammars, especially with CNF, the string length should be a power of two because each step reduces the number of non-terminals by half. Wait, but  the initial string's length might not directly tell me that. Let me count the tokens. Hmm, the string has 45 tokens. Is 45 a power of two? No, because 2^5 is 32 and 2^6 is 64. So, 45 isn't a power of two, which makes me think it's invalid, but wait, the first production starts S with NT3 NT77, which would produce two non-terminals. So, each step adds two children, so the number of tokens should double each time, but wait, in this case, we're looking for a derivation sequence that ends up with the given string. Each production step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or replaces it with a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in the given grammar, the left-hand sides are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or the 'tN' strings, which are terminals.\n\nEach production rule can be used to replace a non-terminal with either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, when parsing, the string's length should be compatible with the derivation steps. For example, if the initial string starts as S\u2192NT3 NT77, that's two non-terminals, so the length starts as 2. Then each non-terminal that can be expanded into a terminal or a pair of non-terminals would either remove that node (if it's a terminal) or add two (if it's a pair). So, the length starts at 2 and grows by adding or subtracting based on expansions.\n\nBut in this problem, the string to evaluate is a list of terminals, which must be generated by the grammar. So, let's see if the number of terminals is compatible.\n\nThe given string has 45 tokens, but since each production could potentially split a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal, the length of the generated string would be 2^n, where n is the number of steps of non-terminal splits. The initial split from S to NT3 and NT77 gives length 2. If each of these can be further split, the length would grow by a factor of 2 each time a non-terminal is split into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting from 2, if we split all non-terminals once, we get 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. So, 45 is not a power of two, which is 2^k for some k. 45 is between 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). That suggests that the string length is not a power of two, so it's likely not derivable by the grammar, unless some production steps keep certain non-terminals unexpanded beyond a certain point.\n\nWait, but the grammar allows for some non-terminals to be left as terminals, but in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if a non-terminal is at the top level (like S) and is split into two non-terminals, each of those could then split again. But the key is that each step doubles the length if a non-terminal is split.\n\nSo, the initial length is 2. Then, each split increases the length by 1? No, wait: if a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, the total number of tokens increases by 1. Wait, if a non-terminal is A, and A is replaced by B and C, then the count goes from 1 (A) to 2 (B and C), increasing by 1. If both B and C are non-terminals, then each could themselves be replaced by terminals or non-terminals, each replacement step possibly increasing the count by 1 each time they're split.\n\nThis seems complicated because the total number of tokens isn't necessarily a power of two. But perhaps the issue is that the string has 45 tokens, which is an odd number, which is problematic because starting from S\u2192NT3 NT77 (2 tokens), each production step can only increase the length by an even number if splits occur, or keep it at the same length if both sides have the same number of non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, if both NT3 and NT77 are non-terminals, and each can be expanded into two non-terminals, then the total number of tokens would go from 2 to 4. Alternatively, if one is expanded and the other remains a terminal, then the total would stay at 3? No, wait, because each production for a non-terminal must result in either a terminal (so the count doesn't grow) or two non-terminals, which would increase the count by 1 (since replacing 1 non-terminal with 2).\n\nBut in our case, the initial string is 2 non-terminals. Let\u2019s think recursively. Each time a non-terminal is split into two non-terminals, the count increases by 1. If any of the new non-terminals are split, the count increases again. So, the total number of terminals depends on the number of splits. The number of terminals in the final string would be equal to the initial count plus the number of splits. But each split after expansion can produce either more splits or terminal symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Let's think about the possible structure of the string. Each production is a binary tree, so the derivation must form a full binary tree, meaning every non-terminal split has exactly two children, and the number of leaves (terminals) is 2^n where n is the number of splits from the start. But in this case, since the grammar is ambiguous, perhaps the number of possible splits isn't strictly enforced.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the given string's length is 45, which is not a power of two, meaning it cannot be derived by a grammar that always splits non-terminals into two. So this might already be a hint that the string isn't part of the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals are left unsplit, and thus, their expansion doesn't contribute to the token count. For example, if a non-terminal is part of the string, it doesn't count towards the token length. But in this problem, the string is a sequence of 'tN's which represent terminal symbols.\n\nWait, the string is given as a list of tokens. So, for example, when the grammar produces NT3, which may itself produce t17, then in the string, it's directly written as 't17'. So, each non-terminal expansion must ultimately lead to the terminals in the string. Therefore, the length of the string should be compatible with the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the number of terminals generated from the initial S is 2^(n), where n is the number of times we split non-terminals. But starting from S as a non-terminal, splitting into two terms gives 2 terminals. If both of those are split into two terms each, that's 4. Continuing, each level doubles the count, so after k splits, you have 2^k terms.\n\nSo, for 45 terms, which is not a power of two, that's impossible. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 45 is between them, so it can't be expressed as 2^k. Therefore, it's not possible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nI might be overcomplicating it, but this seems like a solid line of reasoning. The fact that 45 is not a power of two suggests that it's impossible for the string to be generated by this CNF grammar.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each time you expand a non-terminal into two, the number of tokens increases by 1 each time until both are expanded.

{"custom_id":"request-772","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t35 t14 t17 t71 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t54 t61 t8 t14 t12 t24 t10 t72 t61 t8 t54 t46 t54 t24 t54 t50 t73 t15 t74 t14 t14 t71 t8 t27 t8 t24 t10 t63 t63 t24 t10 t68`.\n\nFirst, I recall that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the productions have two non-terminals on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and so on. Some productions directly result in terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't17'.\n\nThe string starts with 't35', which I need to trace back to see if it can be produced by the grammar. Let's walk through the string step by step.\n\n1. The first token is 't35'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT49 \u2192 't74' and NT65 \u2192 't46', but that's not helpful. Wait, let me look for rules that produce 't35'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice NT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93, which can produce terminals. But 't35' is directly produced by NT8 \u2192 't35'. So, 't35' must come from NT8. So, we need to see if NT8 can be derived.\n\n2. Next, 't14'. Let's check which rule produces 't14'. In the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85, but that's non-terminal. Wait, looking again, NT22 \u2192 't71', NT23 \u2192 't29', NT22 \u2192 't87' (probably a typo, as NT22 is also \u2192 't87'). Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Oh, wait, looking for rules that directly produce 't14'. I see a rule: NT23 \u2192 't29', which is not 't14'. Let me check all the terminal rules. Oh, I see NT5 \u2192 't14'. So, 't14' can come from NT5.\n\n3. Next is 't17'. Checking for 't17', I see NT37 \u2192 't70' and 't40', and 't70' is also derived from some non-terminals. Wait, NT37 has a rule: NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54, and so on. Alternatively, looking for direct terminals, I see NT25 \u2192 't50', which is not it. Wait, looking again, I see NT31 \u2192 't14', which isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe NT17 \u2192 't70', but that's more non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a rule that produces 't17', but wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check: NT71 \u2192 't10', NT17 \u2192 't70', so that's a non-terminal. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe it's easier to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a production rule. Let's list the t's in order:\n\nt35, t14, t17, t71, t12, t14, t14, t79, t54, t54, t61, t8, t14, t12, t24, t10, etc.\n\nStarting with the first t35: that's from NT8 \u2192 't35'. So, to produce t35, we need NT8.\n\nNow, looking at the next t14: as previously, t14 comes from NT5. So after NT8, we can have NT5 and something else. Wait, perhaps it's better to see the overall structure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more efficient to construct the parse tree step by step, ensuring each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to map each 't' in the string to the corresponding rule:\n\n1. 't35' \u2192 NT8\n\n2. 't14' \u2192 NT5\n\n3. 't17' \u2192 Wait, is there a rule that directly produces 't17'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production like NTx \u2192 't17'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Wait, no, looking at the list, I see NT25 \u2192 't50', which is not helpful. Wait, maybe NT17 \u2192 't70', but that's not a terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, looking again, I see NT54 \u2192 't9', etc. Wait, maybe I should check each rule for direct terminals.\n\nLooking back, I see a few rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't50' (but that's not a terminal). Wait, no. Wait, let's check all the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' (so 't17' comes from NT3)\n\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't70' (non-terminal)\n\nSo, 't17' must come from NT3. So, after 't14' is 't17' which is NT3.\n\nWait, but let me reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nt35 t14 t17 t71 t12 t14 t14 t79 t54 t54 t61 t8 t14 t12 t24 t10 t72 t61 t8 t54 t46 t54 t24 t54 t50 t73 t15 t74 t14 t14 t71 t8 t27 t8 t24 t10 t63 t63 t24 t10 t68\n\nLet me start from the first token.\n\n1. t35: comes from NT8 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo, the current symbol is NT8.\n\n2. Next symbol is t14. Looking at production rules where the right-hand side includes a terminal 't14'. We can see NT5 \u2192 't14', so perhaps this comes from NT5. But wait, looking at the grammar, perhaps there's a rule where NT8's second symbol is NT5. Alternatively, maybe the entire NT8 can be broken down.\n\nWait, the original grammar for S is NT3 NT77. So, S produces NT3 and NT77. NT3 can produce NT17 and NT6, etc.\n\nWait, let me see each step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to check if each token can be derived by the grammar by seeing possible reductions.\n\nBut this may take time. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string is composed of only terminals derived correctly from the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is composed of several t's with numbers. I can try to see if each 't' index is valid according to the grammar's terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some terminals:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't71'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 produces non-terminal, so not useful for t17 directly; wait, no, NT3 \u2192 't17', so t17 comes from NT3.\n\nLet me go through each token:\n\n1. t35 \u2192 NT8\n\n2. t14 \u2192 NT5\n\n3. t17 \u2192 NT3\n\n4. t71 \u2192 NT22\n\n5. t12 \u2192 Wait, looking for t12. I don't see a rule that directly produces 't12', as per the grammar, unless I'm missing it. Wait, maybe NT25 \u2192 't50', which is a rule. Hmm, perhaps t12 is from NT? Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for rules that produce 't12':\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't79' (nope)\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-789","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a parsing problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S which can also produce terminals. My task is to determine whether the given string is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the grammar provided. It seems quite extensive, with multiple non-terminals each expanding into two others. I notice that several non-terminals have productions that either expand into non-terminals or end up producing terminals like 't' followed by numbers. For example, S -> NT3 NT77, where NT3 and NT77 may further expand into other non-terminals or eventually into 't35', 't74', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t14 t70 t63 t79 t54 t54 t61 t63 t24 t10 t71 t71 t61 t12 t14 t14 t87 t78 t61 t12 t14 t14 t68 t50 t73 t44 t12 t14 t14 t13 t69 t14 t14 t22 t70 t68 t63 t74 t14 t14 t68`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings. For instance, NT3 -> 't17'. So if the string contains 't17', that's a point where the parse tree could branch. Similarly, I see that NT83 -> 't44' and other terminals for non-terminals like NT58, NT79, etc.\n\nI'll start by identifying the non-terminal productions that can directly produce these 't' terms. Let's see how each 't' can be formed:\n\n- t35 comes from NT8 -> 't35' (grammar line: NT8 -> 't'35).\n- t14 comes from NT5 -> 't'14.\n- t70 comes from NT74 -> 't'70.\n- t63 comes from NT17 -> 't'63.\n- t54 comes from NT55 -> 't'54? Wait, checking the grammar, I see NT48 -> 't'18, and NT26 -> 't'44. Looking again, does any NT produce 't54'? Hmm, maybe I'm missing that. Alternatively, let me search the grammar for 't54'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT74: NT74 -> NT22 NT18. Also, NT26 -> NT44 NT18, and NT22 -> NT71 NT39. NT71 may lead to 't70', and NT79 -> 't72', etc. So perhaps 't54' comes from NT93 -> 't54' (grammar line: NT93 -> 't54').\n\nContinuing, t24 from NT74 -> 't24' (grammar line: NT74 -> 't75').\n\nLooking through the string, each 't' must correspond to a non-terminal production. So, for instance, t35 is directly from NT8, which is a terminal. Similarly, t14 is from NT5.\n\nI think the approach here is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S, ensuring that the string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, it might be tedious to build the entire tree. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to see if all the 't' steps produce the correct sequence.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that each production in CNF requires two non-terminals. So the string must have even number of tokens since each production splits into two. Let's count the number of tokens in the given string: \n\nCounting the tokens: each 't' is a separate token except when there's a number right after it, like 't14' as 't' and '14'. Wait, no\u2014the string is `t35 t14 t70 ...` which is t35, t14, t70, etc. So each is a single token (assuming the string is given correctly with spaces separating each token). Wait, but in the string provided, it's written as `t35 t14 t70 t63 t79 t54 t54 t61 t63 t24 t10 t71 t71 t61 t12 t14 t14 t87 t78 t61 t12 t14 t14 t68 t50 t73 t44 t12 t14 t14 t13 t69 t14 t14 t22 t70 t68 t63 t74 t14 t14 t68`.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each token is separated by a space, so for example, 't35' is a single token, but in the string as given, it's written as `t35 t14 t70 etc.` So the string has 40 tokens (let me count):\n\n- 1: t35\n- 2: t14\n- 3: t70\n- 4: t63\n- 5: t79\n- 6: t54\n- 7: t54\n- 8: t61\n- 9: t63\n- 10: t24\n- 11: t10\n- 12: t71\n- 13: t71\n- 14: t61\n- 15: t12\n- 16: t14\n- 17: t14\n- 18: t87\n- 19: t78\n- 20: t61\n- 21: t12\n- 22: t14\n- 23: t14\n- 24: t68\n- 25: t50\n- 26: t73\n- 27: t44\n- 28: t12\n- 29: t14\n- 30: t14\n- 31: t13\n- 32: t69\n- 33: t14\n- 34: t14\n- 35: t22\n- 36: t70\n- 37: t68\n- 38: t63\n- 39: t74\n- 40: t14\n- 41: t14\n- 42: t68\n\nWait, that's 42 tokens. Now, since each production in CNF splits the string into two, the initial string must be of length 2^k for some k, because each step doubles the number of symbols. Alternatively, each step increases the length by a factor of 2. So, starting from 1 symbol (S), after one production, you have two symbols. After two productions, four symbols, and so on. \n\nBut in this case, the string is 42 tokens, which is not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 42 is between them. So perhaps the length isn't a power of two, which would mean that the string can't be generated by this grammar. But that's not necessarily true because sometimes the grammar can have multiple ways of splitting the string. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals can produce empty strings, but wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are of the form A -> BC. So, the start symbol S must produce two non-terminals. \n\nWait, actually, the start symbol S is usually allowed to produce the empty string in Chomsky Normal Form, but in this case, S -> NT3 NT77, which are non-terminal tokens. So unless there's a production S -> something else, S must produce two non-terminals. So the start string must be of even length, as each step adds a non-terminal. Wait, but in this problem, the string is given as a sequence of terminals. So perhaps I need to model this as a parse tree, where each terminal in the string comes from a production of a non-terminal.\n\nAnother approach: The number of symbols in the string must be a power of two because each production in CNF increases the number of symbols by doubling them (each symbol is replaced by two symbols). So starting from S (1 symbol), then two, four, eight, etc.\n\nOur string has 42 symbols, which is not a power of two (2^5=32, 2^6=64).

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the grammar. Looking at the productions, there are several NT (non-terminal tokens) that map to terminals. For example, NT3 is 't17', NT67 is 't56', NT77 is 't32', etc. So, each non-terminal either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string provided consists of alternating non-terminals and terminals, but wait, the string starts with t54, which is a terminal.

Let me scan each production:\n\n- NT54 is present in several productions, but looking at the assignments:\n\nLooking for NT54: \"NT54 -> t83\" and \"NT54 -> t9\" and \"NT54 -> t83\".

{"custom_id":"request-814","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Let me look at the grammar again to understand the structure.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which expands into NT3 NT77. Each of these symbols further expands into other non-terminals, ultimately leading to terminal symbols (like 't35', 't14', etc.) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t35 t14 t70 t63 t79 t54 t79 t54 t79 t54 t88 t30 t69 t88 t12 t24 t10 t17 t8 t24 t10 t69 t69 t14 t17 t69 t61 t63 t14 t14 t46 t70 t60 t60 t27 t8 t14 t14 t63 t63 t24 t10 t68.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens. The string has 62 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation produces two symbols. Starting from S, the initial string after expansion would be two symbols, and each step increases the length by one. However, a sentence of length n tokens requires n-1 steps in a derivation. So, for a string of 62 tokens, that would be 61 steps. Wait, but in this case, each non-terminal expansion results in two terminals or non-terminals. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production produces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The start symbol S will eventually derive a string of terminals. The number of derivation steps is n-1 for a string of length n. But the key here is that each non-terminal expansion reduces the number of symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nBut since the grammar is provided with all productions, perhaps I can try to parse the string from the bottom up, using the grammar rules. But with the string length being 62, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for any non-terminal that is not represented in the string, but the string only contains terminals, so that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: check if every terminal in the string is covered by the grammar. Looking at the string: t35, t14, t70, t63, t79, t54, t88, t30, etc. The grammar has terminals like 't35', 't14', 't70', etc. So all the terminals are covered.\n\nBut that's not sufficient. The grammar must also have a way to combine these terminals in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be represented by the grammar by trying to see if each terminal sequence is generated by the non-terminals. Since each NT in the grammar eventually ends in a terminal, perhaps I can create a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar and the string length, this might take a long time. Maybe I can look for patterns or repeated nodes.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is t35, which according to the grammar is a terminal, and in the rules, t35 is produced when NT85 -> t35. So, t35 must come from NT85. Let's see in the string: the next token after t35 is t14. So, after t35, the next is t14. So, in terms of productions, we have S -> NT3 NT77. Let me see NT3's production.\n\nLooking at the NT3 -> NT17 NT6, and NT17 -> NT8 NT58, and NT8 -> NT30 NT50. Then NT50 -> NT5 NT48. Hmm, I'm going too deep. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the sequence t35 t14 appears in any production's expansion.\n\nWait, t35 is from NT85, and t14 is a terminal. Let's see what produces t14. Looking at the grammar, NT22 -> t71, but that's for t71. Wait, looking back: Oh, yes, in the rules, NT22 is a non-terminal, but the string has t14, which is a terminal. So t14 comes from which rule? Looking at the rules, I see NT8 -> t35, and there's also NT14 -> t8, but that's not relevant here. Wait, the rules have NT8 -> t35, and another rule for NT8 is some expansion. Wait, no, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nWait, let me list the rules again to see which non-terminal produces which terminal:\n\n- NT3 -> 't17' (in the rules: NT3 -> 't17')\n- NT77 -> 't32' (so 't77' comes from NT77)\n- NT36 -> 't50' (so 't36' is from NT36)\n- NT49 -> 't12' (so 't49' from NT49)\n- NT68 -> 't44' (so 't68' from NT68)\n- NT25 -> 't31' (so 't25' from NT25)\n- NT16 -> 't95' (so 't16' from NT16)\n- NT39 -> 't30' (so 't39' from NT39)\n- NT59 -> 't17' (so 't59' from NT59)\n- NT5 -> 't14' (so 't5' from NT5)\n- NT23 -> 't29' (so 't23' from NT23)\n- NT74 -> 't75' (so 't74' from NT74)\n- NT44 -> 't60' (so 't44' from NT44)\n- NT93 -> 't54' (so 't93' from NT93)\n- NT18 -> 't8' (so 't18' from NT18)\n- NT26 -> 't29' (so 't26' from NT26)\n- NT75 -> 't79' (so 't75' from NT75)\n- NT48 -> 't18' (so 't48' from NT48)\n- NT0 -> 't8' (so 't0' from NT0)\n- More rules... but this might take a while.\n\nSo, looking for t35: T35 comes from NT85 -> 't35'. So, the first token is NT85. Then next is t14, which comes from NT5 -> 't14'.\n\nSo the initial part would be NT85 and NT5. But according to the grammar, S -> NT3 NT77. So S can't derive NT85 and NT5 directly because S expands into NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, that means either the string starts with NT85, which isn't directly from S, or perhaps the derivation is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, because S is the start symbol, the first expansion must generate NT3 and NT77. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string must correspond to the productions of NT3 and NT77. But the first token is t35, which comes from NT85, not NT3 or NT77. Hence, the string cannot be generated because the first two symbols in the string don't start with the productions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nBut wait, in the derivation, after S, the first step would be S -> NT3 A and NT77. Then each of those would expand further, leading to a string that eventually, when fully expanded, would consist of all the terminals from both branches.\n\nTherefore, the first two symbols in the string must be the terminal expansion of NT3 and NT77, but if the string starts with t35 (which is NT85), that's not possible. Hence, the string can't be generated because the first symbols don't match the initial productions.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the NT3 and NT77 themselves can produce more NTs that eventually turn into t35 and t14. Let me check. Starting with S -> NT3 NT77, and NT3 eventually produces t17, which is 't17' (NT3 -> 't17'). So NT3 would produce 't17', not 't35'. Similarly, NT77... let's see NT77 -> NT68 NT44. NT68 -> NT44 NT25, and so on.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. To see if the string is in the language, each symbol must be covered by some production.

{"custom_id":"request-810","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with production rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT20, etc.) can produce other non-terminals or a terminal ('t' followed by a number). The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t69 t14 t18 t61 t74 t24 t10 t79 t54 t79 t54 t54 t61 t8 t29 t27 t61 t8 t51 t69 t54 t54 t61 t8 t14 t63 t24 t10 t69 t61 t8 t27 t54 t24 t54 t63 t63 t24 t10 t13 t69 t24 t10`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My initial thought is that to parse the string, I should try to reconstruct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT3 NT77. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the productions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nLooking at the start symbol's production: S -> NT3 NT77. So the first step is to check if the string starts with the productions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nLet's look at NT3: It can produce 't17', 't6', or 't54' are some of its productions. Wait, in the given grammar, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So it's a two-symbol production. Wait no, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols. Wait, looking at the grammar, for NT3: It's written as NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So that's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar includes productions like NT3 -> NT17 NT6, which is a production of two non-terminals. That would mean that the first step is that S -> NT3 NT77. So the first symbol comes from NT3, which is a non-terminal, so we need to replace that with its productions.\n\nWait, wait. Let me correct myself: In the grammar, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. So to parse the string, we start with S and try to expand it into the string.\n\nBut the first step is to see what S produces. S -> NT3 NT77. So that would mean the string starts with the productions of NT3 and NT77.\n\nBut the string starts with t69. So let's check what NT3 can produce. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 can be:\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT3 -> NT67 NT5\nNT3 -> NT37 NT54\nNT37 -> NT83 NT54\nNT37 -> NT59 NT0\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me map out the possible derivations step by step.\n\nFirst, S is at the top. So the first step is to have S -> NT3 NT77. So the string should start with the productions of NT3 followed by the productions of NT77.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t69. So perhaps the first symbol t69 comes from either NT3 or NT77. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nNT77: Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT77 -> NT68 NT44. So NT77 is an intermediate non-terminal that needs to be expanded.\n\nSo the initial expansion is S -> NT3 NT77. Now, let's see the productions for NT3. It can produce multiple things, but looking at the given rules, the immediate productions for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT3 -> NT67 NT5\nNT3 -> NT37 NT54\nAnd others that reduce to these, like NT37 can lead to NT83 NT54.\n\nSo let's see: to get the first symbol as t69, perhaps NT3 needs to produce t69.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, I don't see a direct terminal production. All NT3's productions are to other non-terminals, except maybe indirectly. Wait, looking back, in the grammar, there's a production for NT83 -> t54. Wait, let me check each rule.\n\nWait, no, it's looking for NT3's possible terminal productions. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nBut also NT6 for example may have a production to a terminal. Let me check NT6's productions.\n\nWait, I should check all NT's to see which can directly produce t69 or other symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, let's find any NT that directly has a production matching t69.\n\nWait, going through the list:\n\nNT17 -> t70\nNT8 -> t35\nNT65 -> t46\nNT26 -> t44\nNT5 -> t14\nNT31 -> t14\nNT36 -> t50\nNT77 -> t32\nBTW, in the grammar, there's a production NT77 -> NT68 NT44, which when expanded, eventually leads to terminals.\n\nLooking elsewhere, I see NT67 -> nt45, but in the grammar provided, I might have to check if any NT directly leads to t69.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see NT98 -> t61, NT89 -> t11 (but I don't see that). Wait, looking for NT69 in the productions.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t69 except perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, for example, NT44 -> t68. Wait, let's check:\n\nWait in the rule list, is there a NT that directly produces t69? Looking through:\n\nNT26 -> NT44, which in another rule is NT44 -> t68. So that's t68. But t69 is somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking for 't69' in the terminals of the rules provided. Hmm, does any NT directly produce t69?\n\nLooking at the end of the rules:\n\nYes, looking at NT3 -> t17 is for NT17, no, wait. Maybe checking all the rule endpoints.\n\nLooking at each rule's right-hand side, is there a 't69' production? For example:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77 (non-terminal)\nNT20 -> NT44 NT36\nNT68 -> NT49 NT25\nNT59 -> NT74 NT51\nNT85 -> NT3 NT67\nNT44 -> NT22 NT18\nNT16 -> NT95 NT18\nNT39 -> NT30 NT65\nNT14 -> NT37 NT22\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT18 -> NT68 NT82\nNT36 -> NT17 NT79\nNT44 -> NT37 NT25 (duplicate)\nNT37 -> NT83 NT54\nNT65 -> NT77 NT2\nNT85 -> NT23 NT16\nNT65 -> NT75 NT21\nNT98 -> NT93 NT16\nNT58 -> NT5 NT85\nNT36 -> NT70 NT33\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT74 -> NT74 NT77\nNT83 -> NT44 NT14\nNT8 -> NT30 NT50\nNT65 -> NT98 NT26\nNT82 -> NT20 NT15\nNT79 -> NT22 NT22\nNT71 -> NT70 NT39\nNT37 -> NT71 NT40\nNT37 -> NT59 NT0\nNT82 -> NT79 NT16\nNT21 -> NT39 NT65\nNT25 -> NT50 NT33\nNT54 -> NT82 NT98\nNT82 -> NT65 NT17\nNT67 -> NT82 NT44\nNT26 -> NT5 NT48\nNT48 -> NT18 NT93\nNT26 -> NT37 NT30\nNT15 -> 't73' \u2192 Wait, no, the last entries seem to end with NT->t...

{"custom_id":"request-834","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens, and the grammar has rules that eventually produce these tokens. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal directly. So every production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or S \u2192 w, where w is a terminal string. Wait, actually, S can produce any number of terminals directly because the grammar is defined in CNF, but since S is the start symbol, I think in this case, S would produce NT3 NT77, and then each of those non-terminals would expand based on the given rules.\n\nNow, the given string is `\"t35 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t13 t79 t54 t27 t61 t8 t14 t8 t54 t88 t70 t54 t61 t8 t24 t10 t87 t8 t7 t54 t46 t90 t78 t69 t71 t83 t24 t10 t69 t54 t69 t44 t63 t63 t14 t14 t68\"`.\n\nI notice that all these tokens are either terminal symbols or some non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. My job is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the rules step by step.\n\nI think the best approach here is to model this as a parsing problem, specifically a top-down parsing using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser is appropriate. Alternatively, since the grammar is given, maybe I can model the string as a series of leftmost or rightmost derivations, but that might get complicated with so many non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if each step in the string expansion follows the production rules. Let me outline the strategy:\n\n1. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT3 and NT77. So the string must be a series of productions starting from NT3 and NT77.\n\n2. Each NT3 and NT77 must expand according to their productions into a sequence of terminals or non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\n3. Let me try to trace back from the given string to see if the tokens match the possible expansions.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming since each expansion could have multiple possibilities. Maybe a better way is to check if each token in the string can be matched by a production rule.\n\nWait, no, because the rules define how non-terminals expand into other non-terminals. The terminals are the specific tokens, so I need to see if the string is a result of all non-terminals expanding into the given tokens in order.\n\nLet me see the rules and the terminals:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58\nNT8 \u2192 NT30 NT50\nNT30 \u2192 NT49 NT65\nNT49 \u2192 NT12 (and other rules?) Wait, looking back, the rules for NT49 in the grammar are: NT49 \u2192 NT74 NT51 and also NT74 \u2192 NT68 NT44, etc.\n\nWait, the grammar has several entries for the same non-terminal. For example, NT49 has two rules: one is NT74 NT51, and the other is NT12? No, looking back, I see:\n\nNT49's productions:\n- NT49 \u2192 NT74 NT51\n- NT49 (also) \u2192 NT12? Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nWait, I'm looking at the list and I see:\n\nNT49: \u2192 NT74 NT51 (line 12) and \u2192 NTt74?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t70 t63 t63 t14 t14 t71 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t65 t42 t44 t70 t44 t54 t24 t14 t17 t69 t61 t74 t24 t10 t69 t61 t12 t24 t10 t68 t7 t10 t73 t78 t8`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The top-level productions seem to start with S, which breaks down into NT3 and NT77. So, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) then has their own productions, eventually leading to terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI should start by trying to parse the string from the top of the grammar. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with 't70', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, 't70' is produced by NT70 \u2192 t7 as per the production NT70 \u2192 t7. So, 't70' is a terminal. But wait, the production for NT70 is actually split into multiple parts. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT70 \u2192 t7?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see NT70 being a terminal. Instead, looking further, I see:\n\nOther rules where 't70' is a terminal are:\n- NT77 \u2192 t32? No.\nWait, no: the rules for NT70 are under 'nt70', but in the rules provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a direct rule for NT70 being a terminal. Instead, some non-terminals have terminals such as 't70'. For example, looking at NT54: NT54 \u2192 NT82 NT98. But I think I'm going in circles. Let me make a list of all the terminal rules to see what terminals are present.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the terminals are the ones where the right-hand side is just a single 't' followed by a number or specific symbols like 't13', 't42', etc.\n\nHere's a list of all terminal productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT65 \u2192 't46'\n- NT26 \u2192 't29'\n- NT40 \u2192 't90'\n- NT30 \u2192 't54'\n- NT49 \u2192 't12'\n- NT75 \u2192 't79'\n- NT59 \u2192 't17'\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT49 \u2192 't63' (twice)\n- NT33 \u2192 't10'\n- NT74 \u2192 't54' (multiple times)\n- NT95 \u2192 't61'\n- NT93 \u2192 't54'\n- NT0 \u2192 't8'\n- NT54 \u2192 't83'\n- NT26 \u2192 't44' (but wait, that's a non-terminal. No, wait: looking back, NT26's production is:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48, which are non-terminals, but sometimes it might produce terminals. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48 (non-terminals)\n- Another rule: NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT74? Wait, no. Let's check each rule.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules include:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48\nNT48 \u2192 NT18 NT93\nNT26 \u2192 NT37 NT30\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me re-examine the rules provided:\n\nHere's the full list:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminal productions (where the RHS is a single terminal) are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT65 \u2192 't46'\n- NT26 \u2192 't29' (is this a terminal? Wait, NT26 can be broken down, but in some rules it's a non-terminal. Let me check.)\n\nWait, no. NT26 is on the left side in some rules:\n\nNT26 rules:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT5 NT48\n- NT26 \u2192 NT37 NT30\n\nSo in some rules, NT26 is broken down into non-terminals, but in others, maybe not. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT26 being a terminal. So probably, NT26 is a non-terminal that's split into other NTs.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't10' in the string: the string has 't10' which should come from NT33 \u2192 't10'.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string is:\nt70 t63 t63 t14 t14 t71 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t65 t42 t44 t70 t44 t54 t24 t14 t17 t69 t61 t74 t24 t10 t69 t61 t12 t24 t10 t68 t7 t10 t73 t78 t8\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't70'. Looking at the grammar, I see that:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT70, I find that it's not explicitly defined as a terminal. However, looking further, I find the production for NT54: NT54 \u2192 t82 NT65. But that includes a terminal 't82' and a non-terminal. Wait, no, in this case, it's NT54 \u2192 t82 NT65. So that's a terminal and a NT65.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine all the rules to find where the terminals are.

{"custom_id":"request-848","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's part of the language defined by this grammar. The string is quite long, and I need to figure out a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Additionally, the start symbol doesn't produce the empty string. The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because each non-terminal on the left side is being expanded into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77, NT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t17 t63 t24 t10 t87 t12 t14 t14 t54 t61 t63 t24 t10 t74 t14 t14 t68 t69 t35 t14 t29 t61 t74 t14 t14 t78 t87 t61 t63 t24 t10 t7 t54 t88 t90 t24 t10 t69 t54 t72 t44 t14 t8 t54 t70`.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that each symbol in the string after the start symbol S must correspond to a terminal in the productions. So, I need to map each 't' followed by a number to the corresponding non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several rules where non-terminals are expanded into terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't17', NT5 \u2192 't14', NT67 \u2192 't56', NT44 \u2192 't60', etc. I should create a dictionary mapping each terminal to its corresponding non-terminal(s) that produce it. This will help in tracing back from the string to find a possible derivation.\n\nWait, no, actually, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be produced by some rule. So for each terminal in the string, I need to see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nSo, let me list out the possible terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT25 \u2192 't31 ?\nWait, let's go through the grammar.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT5 \u2192 't14'\nNT6 \u2192 't63'\nWait, looking through the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT5 \u2192 't14'\nNT8 \u2192 't35'\nNT67 \u2192 't56'\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\nNT74 \u2192 't75'\nNT8 \u2192 't8' from other rules, but in the terminal list, it's also 't35'\nWait, hold on, some entries seem conflicting. For example, NT8 is defined as \u2192 NT30 NT50, but in the terminal list, NT8 is mapped to 't35', NT67 \u2192 't56', NT44 \u2192 't60', etc. I think the terminals are on the right side of some productions.\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like NT3 \u2192 't17', NT5 \u2192 't14', NT6 \u2192 't63', and so on. So each line starting with a non-terminal on the left and then a production on the right, which can be either another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nSo, for each terminal, I need to see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFor example, 't17' is produced by NT3.\n\n't14' is produced by NT5.\n\n't8' is produced by NT2 in the grammar line: NT2 \u2192 't69'? Wait, no, looking again.\n\nWait, the grammar has, for example, NT8 \u2192 't35', so 't35' is from NT8. But the string given has 't35' as a part of it.\n\nBut the string is a long list of terminals separated by spaces, so each part is a token. The string is:\n\nt17, t63, t24, t10, t87, t12, t14, t14, t54, t61, t63, t24, t10, t74, t14, t14, t68, t69, t35, t14, t29, t61, t74, t14, t14, t78, t87, t61, t63, t24, t10, t7, t54, t88, t90, t24, t10, t69, t54, t72, t44, t14, t8, t54, t70\n\nEach of these corresponds to a step in the derivation. So, for each token, I need to see what non-terminals could produce it.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, let's identify for each terminal what non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't31' (But NT31 is not a terminal, NT31 \u2192 NT37 NT5, so 't31' is not a terminal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to create a map for each terminal as per the rules. Let's go through each rule:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17' \u2192 so 't17' is produced by NT3\nNT5 \u2192 't14' \u2192 't14' is produced by NT5\nNT6 \u2192 't63' \u2192 't63' from NT6\nNT20 \u2192 NT44 NT36 \u2192 so both NT44 and NT36 will derive to this, but 't65' is in NT65 rules.

{"custom_id":"request-852","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because I remember that each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals on the right or a terminal and a single non-terminal. But in this case, it looks like some productions have terminals on the right side. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, the grammar provided does seem to fit because some of the rules have two non-terminals, which would correspond to the BC part, and some have a single terminal, like NT77 \u2192 't44' or NT36 \u2192 't50'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. My first thought is that since the grammar is in CNF, each production that starts with a non-terminal will ultimately derive a string of two non-terminals, recursively, until all the non-terminals are replaced by terminals. So, the derivation starts from the start symbol S and replaces it with a sequence of symbols, expanding until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it goes to NT3 and NT77. Each of these NTs will then expand further. So, the entire string is a combination of these expansions.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with 't54' and ends with 't44'. I should check if each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the terminal productions from the grammar to see what each 't' corresponds to:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't17'\nNT18 \u2192 't8'\nNT20 \u2192 't65'\nNT36 \u2192 't50'\nNT44 \u2192 't60'\nNT5 \u2192 't14'\nNT71 \u2192 't10'\nNT23 \u2192 't29'\nNT93 \u2192 't54'\nNT17 \u2192 't70'\nNT74 \u2192 't75' (Wait, but in the string, it's 't74', but I see NT74 \u2192 't75' and NT58 \u2192 't54'. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but let's check the actual productions.)\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't54' (so 't54' comes from NT93)\nNT58 \u2192 't54' (another 't54' from NT58)\nNT74 \u2192 't75' (so 't75' from NT74)\nNT51 \u2192 't27'\nAnd other terminals.\n\nWait, so the string has several 't54's, which can come from either NT58 or NT93.\n\nBut also, looking at the string, I see 't75' and 't74' as well. Wait, does the grammar have a NT74 \u2192 't75'? Looking at the productions:\n\nYes, there's NT74 \u2192 't75'.\n\nSo, in the string, the last symbol is 't44'\u2014looking at the grammar, does any NT produce 't44'?\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT directly producing 't44'. Let me check:\n\nNT74 \u2192 't75' (so 't75' from NT74)\nNT67 \u2192 't82' (from NT82)\nNT26 \u2192 't44' (from NT44?)\nWait, wait. Let's look for 't44':\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 't68' and NT44 \u2192 't60', so no, 't44' is not directly produced by any NT.\n\nWait, did I miss any NT that produces 't44'? Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nYes, NT22 \u2192 't78'\nNT19 \u2192 Wait, there's NT52 mentioned? No, wait, the productions don't have NT52. I'm pretty sure I've listed all the terminal options.\n\nWait, no NT directly produces 't44'. So, if the string ends with 't44', that's a problem because none of the NTs derive 't44'. Looking back at the string: the last part is 't83 t14 t14 t79 t54 t88 t32 t22 t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t65 t44 t71 t83 t14 t14'.\n\nSo, 't44' is definitely present. So if the grammar doesn't have any NT that produces 't44', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Because in the derivation, the NTs can only expand into terminals that are defined in the productions. Since 't44' isn't a terminal of any NT, the string ends with a symbol that the grammar can't derive, so the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Looking at all the terminal productions in the grammar, indeed, none list 't44' as a terminal. So yes, the string ends with 't44', which can't be derived, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-868","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, so breaking it down step by step might be the best approach.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions seem to be all the rules listed.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. From the grammar, I notice that certain non-terminals produce these 't' strings. For example, NT3 produces 't17', NT44 produces 't60', etc. So the idea is to trace the string back through the grammar to see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't35'. Looking at the grammar, I need to find which non-terminal produces 't35'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't35'. So the first part could be derived from NT8.\n\nNext, after 't35', the string is 't54'. Checking the grammar again, NT25 \u2192 't50' and NT26 \u2192 't44'? Wait, actually, looking at the rules, NT25 \u2192 't50' and NT26 has multiple productions, including NT26 \u2192 't44' and others. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me check all the rules where NT26 appears. Oh, NT26 has several productions like NT26 \u2192 't44', 't29', etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for 't54' in NT rules.\n\nWait, the string is 't35 t54 t63 t74 t14 t14 t68 t16 t27 t8 t71 t79 t54 t63 t24 t10 t60 t69 t54 t61 t63 t24 t10 t65 t42 t44 t35 t14 t54 t24 t54 t63 t65 t73 t87 t12 t24 t10 t72 t61 t8 t54 t61 t8 t24 t10'.\n\nWait, 't54' appears several times. Looking at the NT rules, I see NT47 and NT54 producing 't9' and 't9'. Wait, I don't see a production for NT54 \u2192 't54'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT67 \u2192 't56', NT54 \u2192 't82', NT49 \u2192 't12', NT75 \u2192 't79', NT82 \u2192 't65', NT54 \u2192 't83', etc. Wait, there's a rule NT54 \u2192 't9'. Hmm, that's 't9', not 't54'. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe the non-terminal for 't54' is NT33? Because in the rules, NT33 is defined as NT33 \u2192 NT6 and NT10, which eventually produce terminals. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me step back.\n\nAnother approach: since it's a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is built from the start symbol S by applying productions step by step. Each step either adds a non-terminal split into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first derivation is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Then each of these non-terminals will split into other non-terminals or terminals. But the string is a sequence of terminals, so we'll have a path where S ultimately derivaates into a sequence of terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, we can try to parse it by working backward, constructing a parse tree. Let's try to find a way to split the string into subtrees that correspond to the grammar productions.\n\nLooking at the string, 't35 t54...' Let's see where 't35' comes from. As per the rules, NT8 \u2192 't35'. So maybe 't35' comes from NT8, which is in the start production.\n\nBut the start production is NT3 NT77. So how does NT3 and NT77 contribute to the string? NT3 produces 't17', so that might not be relevant. Alternatively, looking at NT8, which is part of S's production, we have S \u2192 NT3 NT77. But wait, S's production is NT3 NT77, and the first 't35' could be coming from somewhere else perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each token and see how they can be derived. Wait, the string starts with 't35', which is produced by NT8. So to have 't35' at the beginning, we must have a path where NT8 is used in the derivation. But S's production is NT3 NT77, so how do we get NT8 into the mix?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's reconstruct the string as a sequence of non-terminals. Since each production either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, the string is a flattened version of the parse tree. So we can model the string as a tree where each node is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to represent this as a table and try to build a reduction. Let's represent the string as a list and see if we can reduce it by matching from the right.\n\nLooking at the right end of the string: the last tokens are multiple 't24', 't10', 't10', etc. Let's see if any non-terminals produce 't24' or 't10'.\n\nLooking for 't24': in the grammar, NT26 \u2192 't44' and others. Wait, NT26 has a production NT26 \u2192 't44'? No, wait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT5, NT48\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT18, NT93\n\nBut wait, is there a 't24'? Let me check. Looking through all the rules:\n\nWait, I might have missed some. For example, looking at NT77: it's NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44, and NT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25, etc. I'm not seeing a production that directly leads to 't24' except perhaps via a long chain.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the end. The last token is 't10', which could come from NT30 \u2192 't54'? Wait, no. Looking, NT30 \u2192 NT65, which produces 't78' and 't65' respectively. So 't65' comes from NT65.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's consider each 't' token and see what non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n- 't35' comes from NT8 \u2192 't35'\n- 't54' comes from NT66? Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT54 \u2192 't54'. Wait, maybe it comes from NT54 \u2192 't9'? No, that's 't9'.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT54 in the rules:\n\nLooking at the list, I see entries for NT54:\n- NT54 \u2192 NT18 NT93\n- NT54 \u2192 NT44 NT85\n- NT54 \u2192 't9'\n\nSo, NT54 can derive 't9' directly. But that's not helping me get 't54'. Hmm. How about NT71? NT71 \u2192 't70' and 't39'. So 't70' is 't70', 't39' is 't39'.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let's try to think about the entire string. Maybe it's built from something that starts with S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and then each of those splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long and doesn't fit the grammar. But I can't just say that without checking.\n\nWait, perhaps we can start from the beginning. S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Let's see what NT3 and NT77 can produce.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So S could start with NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which would contribute 't17' and 't6'. But our string starts with 't35 t54...', so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the start is S \u2192 NT3 nt77, but nt3 could be part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than what the grammar can produce.

I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-891","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the string: it's a sequence of abbreviations like 't17', 't63', up to 't44' and some other terminals. Each of these could correspond to either a non-terminal or a terminal symbol, but from the grammar, I notice that certain non-terminals expand into terminals with numbers, like 't17' and so on.\n\nLet me start by identifying the start symbol, which is 'S'. From the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, to generate the string, the derivation must start with NT3 and NT77, since S can't produce anything else right now.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't17 t63 t24 t10 t87 t63 t14 t14 t51 t78 t87 t61 t8 t27 t61 t12 t14 t14 t54 t61 t8 t14 t12 t14 t14 t69 t61 t12 t24 t10 t65 t44 t54 t54 t24 t54 t14 t14 t78 t10 t73 t17 t8 t71 t9 t14 t14'.\n\nBut I realize that this approach might take a long time, especially for such a long string. Maybe I can find a pattern or see which parts of the string can be derived from NT3 and NT77.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6. So, in the initial step, S would split into NT3 and NT77. Then, NT3 would expand into NT17 and NT6. NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 seems to expand into 't17' and NT26. NT26 has a production that eventually leads to 't65' or further expansions.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe it's better to see if each abbreviation in the string corresponds to a node in the grammar. For example, t17, t63, etc., are terminals, so each must match a terminal in the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals expand to other non-terminals, but others expand to terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, and NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. NT58 \u2192 't17', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT6 might have its own productions.\n\nWait, maybe each 't' abbreviation is a terminal, so I need to see if the string can be broken down into the rules of the grammar. Each 't' is a single terminal, meaning each token in the string must be generated by a production that produces exactly that terminal.\n\nSo, for each 't' token, I need to check if there's a rule in the grammar that can derive it. For example, 't17' must come from a non-terminal that has a production leading to 't17'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 't44', but I'm not sure if 't17' is directly a terminal from a non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, is there a NT that directly goes to 't17'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54, and NT83 \u2192 't44', but that's not 't17'. Then, looking at the bottom of the grammar, I see some rules like NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. But 't17' is a terminal. Wait, is there a rule that directly produces 't17'? For example, does any non-terminal expand directly into 't17'? Looking back, I see NT37 \u2192 't70', but that's 't70', not 't17'. Similarly, other NTs like NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 't17' and 't26' (from NT26: NT58 \u2192 't17' and NT26 has some other rules). So, does NT58 \u2192 't17' and other stuff?\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the grammar, NT58 isn't directly a separate entry. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me look through the grammar list again.\n\nI see that NT83 \u2192 't44', and NT44 \u2192 't68', 't60', etc., but looking for 't17', I think I might have missed a rule. Wait, looking for 't17' in the production results, I see that 't17' is produced by NT83: NT83 \u2192 NT44 NT14 \u2192 44 \u2192 't68', 14 \u2192 't35', so that's not it. Then, in NT65's production: NT65 \u2192 't46' or 't82'. Wait, maybe in another rule.\n\nWait, maybe 't17' is produced by NT17? Let me check: NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58. And NT58, looking at its rules: NT58 \u2192 't26' and other options. Wait, wait, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules again. Looking through each line, I can search for 't' as a terminal without any non-terminals attached.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some rules expand into terminals directly. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't69'\n- NT15 \u2192 't44'\n- NT25 \u2192 't50'\n- NT65 \u2192 't54'\n- NT22 \u2192 't71' and other 't's.\n- Others like NT26 \u2192 't65', and so on.\n\nWait, but 't17' is not among these direct terminals, except possibly in NT83: No, NT83 \u2192 't44' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps 't17' comes from NT37 \u2192 NT83 NT54, and then NT83 breaks down into 't44', but that's a terminal. Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe 't17' is produced by NT58? But I don't see a production for that.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the list, I see NT26 \u2192 't65', but I'm not seeing where 't17' is directly derived. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's look for 't17' in the productions: Hmm, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't17' from a non-terminal. So that's a red flag. If the string contains 't17', then there must be a non-terminal that produces 't17', but I can't find any in the given grammar. Maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar has:\n\nNT58 isn't directly a production; but wait, looking more carefully, I see that in the grammar, some rules produce 't' and other terminals:\n\nLooking for 't17':\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't32' or 't30' etc., not 17.\n- NT65 \u2192 't54' or 't46' etc., no 17.\n- NT59 \u2192 't74' and 't51', no 17.\n- NT36 \u2192 't50', 't33', etc., no 17.\n- NT20 \u2192 't65'; NT70 \u2192 't78'; NT44 \u2192 't68', 't60'; NT37\u2192't83', 't54'; etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't17' as a terminal. That could mean that 't17' is invalid, but the string has it. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by the grammar, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, maybe 't17' is produced indirectly. For example, in NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, but NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 could produce 't17'? Let me check NT58's rules.\n\nLooking at NT58's rules, I see that NT58 appears in NT83 \u2192 NT8 NT58, but that's not helpful.

{"custom_id":"request-895","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and a string that's supposed to be either derived from this grammar or not. My task is to determine whether the string is produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar is provided with production rules, and some of the non-terminals are mapped to terminals, specifically letters, with some mappings like 't17', 't12', etc. The string given is a sequence of these terminals: `t17 t12 t24 t10 t13 t30 t69 t54 t24 t14 t35 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t72 t61 t8 t44 t54 t24 t14 t35 t54 t63 t68 t70 t72 t44 t60 t63 t69 t61 t8 t60 t54 t61 t8 t14 t14`.\n\nWait, but the grammar given has 'S' as the start symbol, and the production rules are all in the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals except for those that directly map to terminals. So the terminals in the string must be produced by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me check each non-terminal and see what terminals they map to:\n\nLooking through the production rules, some non-terminals like NT3, NT18, NT20, NT25, NT36, NT44, NT54, NT58, NT65, etc., all have specific terminal mappings. For example, NT3 -> 't17', NT18 -> 't8', NT20 -> 't65', and so on. Some non-terminals aren't mapped; for instance, NT74 can produce t75 or t70 and t30, but wait, looking again: NT74 has two productions, including one that splits into another non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, NT74 -> NT75 is not present; actually, looking at the given productions, NT44 can go to NT68 or NT70, depending on the rule. Wait, perhaps I need to list all the production rules and their terminal mappings.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a tree rooted at S, using the productions, and see if it parses correctly without any leftover symbols.\n\nGiven that the string is 44 tokens long, each token is either a non-terminal or a terminal. The process would be to parse the string from the start symbol, S, and see if we can replace non-terminals with their right-hand sides until we're left with just terminals matching the string.\n\nSince the process could be quite involved, perhaps I can look for any non-terminals in the string that have direct productions to a single terminal. That way, I can break the string down layer by layer.\n\nLooking through the string:\n\nt17 t12 t24 t10 t13 t30 t69 t54 t24 t14 t35 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t72 t61 t8 t44 t54 t24 t14 t35 t54 t63 t68 t70 t72 t44 t60 t63 t69 t61 t8 t60 t54 t61 t8 t14 t14.\n\nWait, but the string has 44 tokens, all lowercase t followed by numbers, so each token can be mapped to specific non-terminals. For example, t17 comes from NT3, t12 from NT39, etc.\n\nPerhaps the first step is to identify which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let me list these:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17\n\nNT18 \u2192 t8\n\nNT20 \u2192 t65\n\nNT25 \u2192 t14\n\nNT36 \u2192 t50\n\nNT44 \u2192 t68 (from one rule) or t60 (from another rule?)\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has multiple NT44 productions. For example:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nand\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25.\n\nSo sometimes, NT44 can become a combination of non-terminals. But other NT44 rules\u2014wait, the user provided multiple productions. For example:\n\nWait, looking through the productions given:\n\nNT44 appears multiple times. Let me check:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT44 NT25\n\nWait, but elsewhere in the grammar, I see NT44 \u2192 NT74 NT70, which is part of NT77. Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each token is present in the mapping. For example, the first token is 't17', which maps from NT3. So if the string starts with 't17', that would imply that at the start, the S production must include NT3 on the left side. Looking at the grammar, S starts with NT3 and NT3. So S \u2192 NT3 NT377, but wait, the original grammar is S \u2192 NT3 NT377? Or is it S \u2192 NT3 NT377.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT3 NT377\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo, and should be NT3 NT77. Or maybe it's NT3 NT377? Or perhaps I misread the original. The user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT3 NT377\n\nWait, that seems off because 377 is not a standard non-terminal. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's NT3 NT77, as in NT3 and NT77? Because NT377 would be a strange non-terminal name. So I think that's probably a typo, and I'll proceed under that assumption until I find evidence to the contrary.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which is more likely given the subsequent productions.\n\nGiven that, the first step would be to replace S with NT3 and NT77. Then, each of those can be replaced according to their rules.\n\nSo, starting with the string:\n\nt17 t12 t24 t10 t13 t30 t69 t54 t24 t14 t35 t14 t29 t61 t63 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t72 t61 t8 t44 t54 t24 t14 t35 t54 t63 t68 t70 t72 t44 t60 t63 t69 t61 t8 t60 t54 t61 t8 t14 t14.\n\nFirst, breaking it down, the first token is 't17', which is the production of NT3.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT3 NT77.\n\nNow, 't17' must come from NT3, so that's the first part. So NT3 must produce 't17' followed by the rest. But wait, no\u2014when we do a parse, it's about substituting non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reconstruct the parse tree step by step, starting from the entire string and seeing if it can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the string as a list and see if each non-terminal can be replaced with non-terminals until only terminals are left.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable for a small string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check whether the string can be broken down into any sequence of non-terminals substituting according to the rules until it's just all replaced with terminals.\n\nAnother approach: let's see if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar. If any token is not a terminal produced by any non-terminal, then the string can't be generated.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals and their terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t17\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t8\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t65\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t14\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t50\n\n- NT44 \u2192 t68 or t60\n\nWait, but looking at the NT44 rules, sometimes it's followed by other non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18\n\nBut NT22 can be broken down. NT22 \u2192 NT71 NT5, and NT71 \u2192 NT70 NT39, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's possible that the string can be broken down in multiple ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the length of the string. The string has 44 tokens.\n\nEach production in the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-908","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string I have to check is `t69 t14 t14 t83 t24 t10 t13 t83 t24 t10 t54 t24 t54 t72 t44 t60 t63 t30 t69 t70 t68 t63 t63 t24 t10 t87 t74 t14 t14 t51 t65 t73 t54 t61 t12 t14 t14 t88 t70 t24 t10 t78 t10 t73`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and see if there's a way to derive this string step by step. The grammar is given with a series of productions, each non-terminal producing exactly two other non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which is helpful.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it's a sequence of t-commands. Each t seems to correspond to a terminal symbol, which are the ones ending with a number, like t69, t14, etc. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I can try to reverse-engineer the derivation. I'll start from the highest-level non-terminal, which is S, and see if I can break down the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nStarting with S -> NT3 NT77. So the string should start with the expansion of NT3 and followed by NT77. Let's check the string:\n\n- The string starts with t69 t14. \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 is a non-terminal. From the productions, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So, the first part of the string should break down into NT17 and NT6.\n\nNT17 is \"t70\", which corresponds to the first t70. So the first part would be t70 t6. But wait, the string starts with t69 t14. That's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me re-examine. Wait, the string starts with t69, but according to NT3, it's NT17 followed by NT6, which are t70 and t6. So the first part should start with t70 followed by t6. But the string starts with t69. That means the initial assumption might be incorrect, or perhaps there's another way to derive this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S produces NT3 NT77, but perhaps the first part is t69, which could be from another non-terminal. Let me check if any non-terminals produce t69.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT44 -> t68, which is t68. Wait, no NT produces t69. Wait, let me scan the productions again.\n\nAh, looking at the NT productions, for NT2, it's t69: NT2 -> t69. So, NT2 produces t69. So perhaps the initial part of the string is t69, which is NT2, but S produces NT3 NT77, so that's not directly possible. Unless there's a way to combine NT3 and NT77 into something that starts with t69.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string backward, using the reverse approach. Alternatively, I could try to find if the string can be split into the required non-terminals.\n\nLet me list out the string again: t69, t14, t35, t14, t17, t69, t61, t63, t24, t10, t13, t83, t24, t10, t54, t24, t54, t72, t44, t60, t63, t30, t69, t70, t68, t63, t63, t24, t10, t87, t74, t14, t14, t51, t65, t73, t54, t61, t12, t14, t14, t88, t70, t24, t10, t78, t10, t73.\n\nI need to match this string to the productions. Let's see: the first symbol is t69, which is produced by NT2. So perhaps the first part is NT2, which is t69. But S produces NT3 NT77, so unless NT3 or NT77 can produce multiple terminals, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps NT3 expands into something that starts with t69, but looking at NT3's productions, NT3 -> NT17 NT6. So NT17 is t70, NT6 is t6. So that would be t70 followed by t6. But the string starts with t69, which is different. Therefore, the initial part of the string does not match NT3's expansion. This suggests that the string may not be derivable from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is longer than what S can produce, but I need to see if all symbols are covered.\n\nLooking deeper, the string is quite long, but perhaps I can find a way to split it. Let's try to consider the end of the string. The last symbol is t73, which is produced by NT73, which comes from NT49 and NT26: NT49 -> t74, NT26 -> t44. Wait, looking at the productions, NT73 -> NT65 NT74 or something else? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar details, under NT15, there's t73. NT15 -> 't73'. But in the grammar provided, I don't see NT15 directly. Alternatively, maybe the string ends with t73 because NT73 produces it. Let me check: looking for NT73, but in the productions, I don't see any NT with a production to t73 except NT73 itself. Wait, no, in the list under NT37, there's a production to t50, but elsewhere, NT73 is not shown except under NT65 and other places.\n\nWait, perhaps a mistake here. Let me check the grammar. I see NT73 under which productions?\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT71 -> 't70', NT70 -> 't7', etc. Wait, no NT73 directly. Hmm, perhaps NT73 is derived from NT65: NT65 -> t46, t70 or t75, etc. Or perhaps I missed a part. Wait, looking more carefully, I think I might have made a mistake in the productions listed. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT73, in the given productions, under NT22: NT22 -> ... I don't see NT73, but looking through, under NT18, NT20, etc., maybe I missed.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string ends with t73, which is either a terminal or from a non-terminal that ends in t73. Looking at the grammar, the only way to get t73 is if there's a production for a non-terminal A -> t73. Looking through the productions, I don't see any such production. All the t73 seems to be in NT73 which isn't present except possibly through other productions. Wait, maybe I missed.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, under NT26, there's a production: NT26 -> 't44', but in the list, NT26 also has NT44 -> t68, etc. Alternatively, maybe t73 comes from a different production.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT73, perhaps it's produced by NT49. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for t73: in the list, under NT28: wait, no, let's see.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, instead of trying to find where t73 comes from, perhaps the string doesn't end correctly because the last non-terminal doesn't produce t73, making the string ungrammatical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is constructed correctly, but I need to track through the derivations.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering the initial production S -> NT3 NT77.\n\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6.

{"custom_id":"request-912","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols ending with 't's and some numbers. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Wait, actually, no\u2014CNF requires that each production have at most two non-terminals, correct? The start symbol can have two non-terminals, and all other productions have either a single non-terminal or two.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production seems to be of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except for the start symbol S, which breaks into NT3 and NT77. So, S is NT3 NT77. Then, each NT has a production into two others, except for some NTs that directly translate to terminals or other terminals.\n\nBut wait, not all NTs are non-terminals anymore\u2014some, like NT3, NT8, NT20, etc., directly produce terminals such as 't' followed by a number. So, in this grammar, the process is to start with S and expand it step by step, replacing non-terminals with their productions until you get a string of terminals.\n\nThe given string is: t54 t24 t14 t17 t79 t54 t32 t69 t46 t54 t24 t14 t29 t61 t63 t24 t10 t78 t71 t61 t8 t68 t63 t63 t24 t10 t87 t12 t24 t10 t87 t71 t61 t74 t14 t14 t69 t61 t12 t14 t14 t72 t61 t63 t14 t14 t65 t73.\n\nThat's a long string, but I notice that each part corresponds to a non-terminal expansion. Each step is a pair of non-terminals, so the string should consist of a series of concatenated productions.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I should parse the string from left to right, matching each production step by step. But since the string is quite long, I might need to see if the overall structure aligns with the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the grammar's productions can be seen as transitions between states, perhaps constructing a parse tree. But that might be complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for a way to derive the entire string by expanding from S step by step, ensuring at each step that the string matches some possible expansion.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that the grammar is in CNF, which is useful for certain parsing algorithms, but I'm more interested in whether the string can be derived. Since the string is a series of terminals, each derived from a production, maybe I can consider the tree structure and see if each production step is covered in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the grammar as a series of transitions and see if the sequence corresponds to the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t54. From the grammar, I see that NT54 has a production to t9. So, one of the symbols must expand to t54, which is t68 t46, but wait\u2014no, wait. Let me check:\n\nLooking up NT54 in the grammar: I see NT54 -> t9. So, to get t54, we perhaps have a non-terminal that produces t9. Wait no, maybe I'm mixing up NTs and terminals. Wait, the productions for NT54 include nt54 -> t9 and others like nt12, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because of the different NTs.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step. The string starts with t54. So, probably, it's derived from an NT that produces t54. Let's look at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t54. I see NT54 -> t9. So, to get t54, we need a production that ends with t54. Alternatively, I might have mixed up the NTs, but perhaps the first step is to see if the productions chain up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial symbol is S, which is NT3 NT77. So, let me think of the string as a sequence where the first two symbols (t54 and t24) are connected by some NT productions.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54 t24 t14 ...', but S is NT3 NT77. Let me see what NT3 and NT77 produce.\n\nLooking into the grammar: NT3 -> NT17 NT6.\n\nWait, so NT3 expands to NT17 NT6, and NT77 expands to NT68 NT44.\n\nSo, S = NT3 NT77 becomes NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, each of these NTs must expand into other NTs or terminals. Let's try expanding each step.\n\nStarting with NT17: NT17 -> NT8 NT58.\n\nThen, NT8: NT8 -> NT30 NT50.\n\nNT30: NT30 -> t54.\n\nWait, but NT30 in the grammar is written as NT30 -> NT49 NT65, but that can't be\u2014no, I think I'm getting mixed up because the grammar lists all the rules. Looking up NT30: Wait, in the grammar, NT30 appears in several places\u2014looking for NT30, I see: There's NT30 -> NT49 NT65, but that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, each production is in the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except when it's a terminal. So, for example, NT54 -> t9. Similarly, NT58 -> t8. Let me find the rules for NT30, NT68, etc.\n\nLooking up NT30: The grammar has NT30 -> NT65 NT24, but wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar's NT30 is written as NT30 -> NT65 NT24? Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT30 -> NT49 NT65. Also, NT30 -> t54. Wait, no\u2014looking through the list, I see NT30 -> t54 and others.\n\nWait, looking for NT30 in the grammar: The entries show NT30 has several rules, but t54 is one of them. So, NT30 can either expand into NT49 NT65 or directly into t54.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nYes, for example, NT30 -> NT49 NT65,\nNT30 -> t54.\n\nSimilarly, NT49 is another NT, which can produce, say, NT74 NT12.\n\nWait, so perhaps t54 is from NT30's production rule.\n\nSo, going back to expanding S as NT3 NT77:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\nNT3 -> NT17 NT6\nNT77 -> NT68 NT44\nSo, S becomes NT17 NT6 NT68 NT44.\n\nNow, expanding each of these:\n\nNT17 -> NT8 NT58\nNT6. Wait, what's NT6? Looking through the grammar, I see NT6 -> t63.\n\nYes, looking for NT6: it's written as NT6 -> t63. So, NT6 becomes 't63'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 is NT8 -> t30 NT50, but looking for the direct terminals, I see NT8 has NT8 -> t35.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, I need to find Ntx -> t? For example, NT8 -> t8? Hmm.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT8:\n\nLooking through the list: I see NT8 -> NT20 NT67, and others like NT8 -> t35, right?\n\nYes, in the grammar, there's NT8 -> t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me list all NTs and their direct productions into terminals.\n\nLooking for every NT that directly produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> t17 (directly)\n- NT8 -> t8 (looking for that)\nWait, no. Let me search for t followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> t65\n- NT4 -> t14\n- NT5 -> t14\n- NT7 -> t7\n- NT8 -> t8 (is there such a rule?)\nWait, no. Because in the given grammar, for NT8, I see NT8 -> NT20 NT67 and other rules, but no direct t8.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, looking for rules where NTx is followed by t:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT7 -> t7\n- NT49 -> t14\n- NT58 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-934","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. The task is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The rules are given as S -> NT3 NT77, and so on. Each of these rules starts with NTx, which probably refers to some non-terminal symbol that eventually ends up producing a string of terminals (t) or other NT symbols. The grammar is in CNF, meaning each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This is useful because it simplifies parsing and allows for the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just manually checking, I'll proceed carefully.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived by the grammar starting from S. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that all the left-hand sides are NT followed by a number. So, NT1 would be a rule, NT2, and so on, up to NT94 or something like that. Each of these NT symbols can produce two other NT symbols or, in some cases, a terminal symbol (like 't' with a number after it). For example, I see NT3 -> NT17 NT6 and NT3 -> 't17', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to see if it can be built up from the bottom up or top down. Since parsing a string that's over 100 characters long might be tedious, perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to break the string into parts that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: \n\nt35 t14 t70 t63 t72 t61 t63 t24 t10 t79 t54 t54 t61 t74 t24 t10 t69 t61 t12 t14 t14 t65 t42 t44 t88 t69 t14 t54 t24 t14 t69 t54 t63 t65 t44 t71 t74 t24 t10 t65 t42 t63 t56 t68 t63 t63 t14 t14 t60\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals (like t35, t14, etc.), and some might be starting points for NT rules. For example, NT8 -> 't35'. So, t35 corresponds to NT8 -> 't35'. Similarly, t67 -> 't56', which is another terminal.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if the entire string can be split into the productions. The start symbol is S, which produces two NT symbols: NT3 and NT77. So, the first step is to have NT3 and NT77 produce subparts of the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol:\n\nS -> NT3 NT77\n\nSo, the string must be split into two parts: one from NT3 and another from NT77. Let me check if the string can be divided such that the first part matches what NT3 can produce and the second part matches NT77.\n\nBut splitting the string into two parts, each being the result of NT3 and NT77, might not be straightforward. I need to see what each NT symbol can generate in terms of strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each NTx rule has two options: either produce two other NT symbols or a terminal (t followed by a number). So, each 't' plus a number at the end of the string could be a terminal symbol that is the product of an NT rule.\n\nSo, looking at each terminal (like t35, t14, etc.), I can see which NT rule produces it. For instance, t35 is produced by NT8 -> 't35'. Similarly, t14 is produced by NT23 -> 't29' wait, no, let me check. Wait, the rules don't show t14 as a terminal, but looking back, I see in the rules:\n\nLooking through the 'T' rules (the ones ending with 't'), I see:\n\n- NT8 -> 't35'\n- NT23 -> 't29' (from NT23 rules: NT23->'t29' maybe, or looking back, in the user's input, under NT23: it says NT23 -> 't29')\nWait, the user's input has under NT23: NT23 -> 't29' which would mean NT23 produces 't29'. Similarly, other 't's correspond to specific NT rules.\n\nSo, the string has several terminals, each of which must match an NT rule. My task is to verify if each terminal in the string can be produced by some NT rule, and that the non-terminals can be expanded correctly.\n\nBut I might be overcomplicating. Maybe the approach is to check whether each sequence of non-terminal symbols can derive into the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parse tree, starting from S and expanding the NT symbols until I reach the terminals.\n\nGiven the length of the string, it's going to be a bit involved, but perhaps I can break it down into smaller segments, each corresponding to a production rule.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is NT3 NT77. So, I need to split the string into two parts: the first part must result from NT3, and the second from NT77.\n\nLooking at the string, let me see:\n\nThe string is 27 terminals long. Wait, count again:\n\nLet me count the number of 't's:\n\nt35, t14, t70, t63, t72, t61, t63, t24, t10, t79, t54, t54, t61, t74, t24, t10, t69, t61, t12, t14, t14, t65, t42, t44, t88, t69, t14, t54, t24, t14, t69, t54, t63, t65, t44, t71, t74, t24, t10, t65, t42, t63, t56, t68, t63, t63, t14, t14, t60\n\nWait, that's 55 terminals. So the entire string is 55 terminals. How can that be, because the start symbol S produces two NT symbols, each of which would have to produce sequences of terminals and non-terminals. But the number of terminals must correspond to the number of leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the 55 terminals must be generated by one of the NT rules, and the non-terminals must expand into sequences of terminals and NTs.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for patterns in the grammar to see if the string can be built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar recognizes a specific structure, like numbers corresponding to ASCII codes or something else.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check if all the terminals in the string correspond to possible NT rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see:\n\nFor example, NT3 -> 't17' and 't6', etc. So each 't' in the string has a specific NT rule producing it.\n\nWait, but the string has multiple 't's, so each 't' must be matched by an NT rule. So let me check each 't' in the string to see if it's covered by any rule.\n\nFor example:\n\nt35: looking through the rules, I see NT8 -> 't35'\n\nt14: Let me see. Looking at the rules, does any NT rule produce 't14'? Scanning through, I see NT22 -> 't78' and others, but maybe NT14 is defined. Looking in the user's input, under NT14: NT14 -> 't70' and 't54' and 't44'...

{"custom_id":"request-936","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing manageable with either a recursive descent parser or perhaps even a CYK algorithm, but maybe a simpler approach would work here.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. For example, it starts with `t17 t63 t24 ...` and ends with `t61 t63 t24...`. Each t followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol, with the number representing the value.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, I need to see how these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar seems to build numbers using other non-terminals, and the right-hand sides often consist of two non-terminals. The leaves of this tree would eventually correspond to the t-values in the string.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. If the parser can reduce the entire string to the start symbol S, then it's generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to identify possible ways the string can be split according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string begins with `t17`. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce `t17`? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides:\n\nNT3 -> 't17' (line 39)\nNT15 -> 't73' (line 48)\nNT27 -> 't69' (line 67)\nNT23 -> 't29' (line 94)\nNT71 -> 't10' (line 95)\nNT37 -> 't90' (line 90)\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, line 39 is `NT3 -> 't17'`, so that's an NT3 producing t17 directly. Similarly, NT15 is 't73', and others produce various t's.\n\nSo, t17 is directly produced by NT3. So the first token could be handled by NT3, which is 't17'. Next, the second token is t63.\n\nLooking for NT that produce t63: line 15: NT74 -> 't74'? No. Wait, let me look. Line 44: NT54 -> 't83' (no). Wait, looking through all the rules, seems like some lines produce t63:\n\nWait line 44: NT74 -> 't74'? Hmm, not t63. Let's see other NTs.\n\nLooking for `t63`:\n\nLine 15: NT83 -> 't27' (nope)\nLine 40: NT75 -> 't79' (nope)\nLine 44: NT33 -> 't10' (nope)\nLine 27: NT51 -> 't27' (no)\nWait, line 64: NT49 -> 't12' (no)\nWait, line 67: NT54 -> 't83' (no)\nWait, line 7: NT26 -> 't44' (no)\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe t63 is produced by NT82? Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT82: line 19: NT82 -> NT79 NT16. Then NT79 is production NT79 -> 't72' (looking back, line 72: NT79 -> 't72'). Wait, NT79's rule is `t72`? But NT79 also has another production: line 70: NT79 -> 't69' (but t69 is a value). So maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, some rules might produce t-values directly. Like line 22: NT58 -> 't54' (so t54 is 't58'), line 36: NT22 has production NT22 -> NT87 NT8 (line 76) and also NT73 (line 90: NT22 -> 't73').\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all NTs and their direct productions:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, for each NT, check if it can produce a terminal of the form 'tX'.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT3 -> 't17' (line 39)\nNT75 -> 't79' (line 50)\nNT65 -> 't46' (line 65)\nNT85 -> 't24' (line 69)\nNT17 -> 't70' (line 71)\nNT37 -> 't59' (line 73: no, let me check: line 37 is NT37->NT83 NT54 (line 53: NT83->t27; line 54: NT54->t83. Wait, NT37 is in multiple rules. Wait line 73: NT37->NT59 NT0, and NT59->'t17'. So actually, NT37 can produce 't17' via NT59 and NT0.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to list all NTs that can directly produce 'tn' terminals.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\nNT3 -> 't17'\nNT75 -> 't79'\nNT65 -> 't46'\nNT85 -> 't24'\nNT17 -> 't70'\nNT37 -> 't17'\nWait, no, line 37 is NT37-> NT83 NT54, so that's two non-terminals. But looking through all the rules, no NT directly produces, say, t63. So perhaps I'm wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps no NT directly produces t63, so the parser would have to derive it through multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe the given string cannot be formed because some t-values are missing or the correct sequence is not possible.\n\nWait, another approach: the given string is long, but maybe it's constructed by repeatedly applying the grammar rules, replacing non-terminals with other non-terminals until all are terminals of the form 'tn'.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long list of t's followed by numbers. For example, the sequence starts with t17 t63 t24 t10 t13 t71 t12 t24 t10 and so on.\n\nI think it's challenging to manually construct a parse tree for this long string, but perhaps there's a pattern or a way to split it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar is such that certain numbers can only be produced through specific sequences, and if the string doesn't follow those, it's invalid.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NTs only produce other NTs, so you have to combine them in specific ways. For example, S -> NT3 NT67 (line 1: S->NT3 NT67). So the string must start as t17 (from NT3) followed by whatever NT67 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT67's rule: line 75: NT67 -> NT82 NT44 (line 82: NT82-> NT79 NT16 (line 79: t72, line 16: t68). Wait, but NT82 has another production: NT82 -> NT65 NT17 (line 82a: NT82->t65 NT17), which is t65 and t17 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT67 needs to produce t17 followed by another NT.\n\nBut let's see, the string starts with t17 t63. So after t17 (from NT3), the NT67 must produce t63. But looking at NT67's rules, none of them produce t63 directly. So NT67 is either NT82 NT44 or NT85 NT30. Wait, line 75 is NT67 -> NT82 NT44, line 78: NT85 -> NT3 NT67 (but that's a production of NT85, not NT67).\n\nWait, actually, the production for NT67 is line 75: NT67 -> NT82 NT44. So NT67 must be replaced by t82 plus t44. So if the current string is t17 followed by t63, then NT67 must produce t63, but t63 would have to be a sequence of t82 t44.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t17 is t63. So the string so far is 't17 t63'. If NT67 is replaced by NT82 NT44, which are t82 and t44. So that would require t82 followed by t44. But the next part is t10, which doesn't fit.

{"custom_id":"request-953","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, where each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal (like S, NT20, NT3, etc.) production rule splits into two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by writing down the grammar rules for reference, focusing only on the non-terminals that appear in the string. The string is:\n\nt69 t14 t18 t61 t74 t14 t14 t46 t54 t24 t14 t17 t72 t61 t74 t24 t10 t87 t12 t14 t14 t27 t61 t74 t14 t14 t65 t44 t17 t8 t54 t35 t14 t70 t63 t46 t70 t10 t90 t14 t14 t7 t10 t73 t68 t63 t63 t24 t10 t68\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that many non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals. For example:\n\n- S -> NT3 NT77\n- NT3 -> t17\n- NT77 -> t32\n- So S \u2192 t17 t32\n\nBut the string starts with t69, which isn't directly any of the initial S rules. So, perhaps I need to find a way to derive these terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In the string, each token is a terminal symbol. The grammar's NT symbols are all non-terminals except for the ones that have terminal productions. For example, NT3 is replaced by 't17', so in the string, 't17' comes from NT3.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to parse the string from the end using reverse engineering or using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm less experienced, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down step by step according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step. The string is quite long, so I'll break it down into manageable parts.\n\nLooking at the start, the longest production from S is S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So, the string should start with the concatenation of what NT3 and NT77 derive to.\n\nNT3 \u2192 t17 (since in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't17')\n\nNT77 \u2192 What does NT77 derive to? Looking at the rules, NT77 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So NT77 is two non-terminals. Each of those needs to be expanded.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT49 NT25. NT49 \u2192 't74', and NT25 \u2192 NT31 NT5.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT14, and NT5 \u2192 't14'. So NT31 \u2192 t14, thus NT31 NT5 \u2192 t14 t14.\n\nWait, but NT25 is NT31 NT5, so NT25 \u2192 t14 t14.\n\nThen NT49 \u2192 t74, so NT49 NT25 \u2192 t74 t14 t14.\n\nGoing back to NT77: NT68 is NT49 NT25, which we've broken down to t74 t14 t14.\n\nSo NT77 \u2192 t74 t14 t14 t14.\n\nSo putting it all together, S \u2192 t17 (from NT3) followed by NT77 which is t74 t14 t14 t14.\n\nWait, let me make sure. S \u2192 NT3 NT77 \u2192 t17 (from NT3) followed by the expansion of NT77, which is NT68 NT44. NT68 is NT49 NT25 \u2192 t74 and NT25 is NT31 NT5 \u2192 t14 and 't14', so NT68 \u2192 t74 t14 t14. Then NT44 is NT22 NT18. NT22 is NT71 NT22? Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me look up the grammar rules for each non-terminal involved.\n\nLooking at NT44: NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT18. So NT44's expansion is two non-terminals: NT22 and NT18.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT71 NT22? No, looking back, I think I misread. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT44 is defined as NT22 NT18 and also NT44 \u2192 NT37 NT25. Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in expanding NT77.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string backward to see if it's a leftmost derivation or something else.\n\nThe string starts with t69. Let's see what t69 could come from. Looking through the terminal rules, t69 comes from wherever a non-terminal expands to t69.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to t69. So maybe t69 isn't directly from a non-terminal. Wait, that's a problem because the only terminals are either the specific strings like 't85', 't77', etc. So perhaps the string must be entirely derived from S, which starts with two non-terminals S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Therefore, the string must be the concatenation of what NT3 and NT77 derive.\n\nBut in the string, it starts with t69. So perhaps my assumption is wrong because NT3 and NT77 cannot directly produce t69.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me look again.

{"custom_id":"request-956","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure simplifies parsing because it eliminates the need for more complex production rules, making it easier to track the derivation of strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit this form. Each production starts with a single non-terminal on the left and is followed by either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT3 NT77 is in CNF because it's A \u2192 BC. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6 is another example. So the grammar is set up correctly.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the string: \n\n`t35 t14 t70 t63 t72 t61 t12 t14 t14 t78 t54 t27 t61 t8 t51 t17 t8 t14 t14 t69 t14 t29 t61 t8 t63 t32`\n\nEach token in the string represents a terminal symbol, and the task is to see if there's a derivation sequence in the grammar that can produce this string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal. This means that the length of the string should match the number of non-terminals in the initial derivation plus the number of terminals. For a given start symbol S, the number of symbols in the string plus the number of non-terminals minus one should be the number of steps in the derivation.\n\nWait, I think I might be confusing something here. Let me clarify: In a CNF grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each step increases the number of symbols by one. For example, if you start with S and it produces two non-terminals, each of those can eventually produce terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nThe string given has 35 tokens. Let's count the number of non-terminals that S starts with. In the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT3 NT77, which produces two non-terminals. So initially, it's two non-terminals. Each production of a non-terminal in CNF either adds another non-terminal or replaces it with a terminal.\n\nThe length of the string must be equal to the number of non-terminals starting from S plus the number of terminals minus one. Since the string has 35 terminals, the number of non-terminals added during the derivation would be 35 - 1 = 34. But since S starts with two non-terminals, the total number of non-terminals in the derivation is S + 34 = 36 non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The formula is that the number of symbols in the resulting string (n) is equal to the number of non-terminals (m) plus the number of terminals minus 1, because each non-terminal production either adds a terminal or another non-terminal, and each non-terminal derivation reduces the count by one. So actually, n = m + k - 1, where k is the number of terminals.\n\nIn this case, n = 35, k = 35 (since all tokens are terminals). So 35 = m + 35 - 1 \u2192 m = 1. That can't be right because S must start with two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIn CNF, each production step increases the number of symbols by one. Starting from S (1 symbol), each step adds one symbol. So to get a string of length n, the number of steps is n -1, and the number of non-terminals in the derivation path would be n.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not accurate. Each production replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of non-terminals increases by one each time. Starting with S (1 non-terminal), after one step, you have 2, then 3, etc. If the final string has n terminals, the number of non-terminals in the derivation would be equal to the number of non-terminal symbols in the initial productions that get expanded into terminals.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to look for the start symbol's expansion and see if the sequence of terminals makes sense.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't35'. Let's check what NT35 is. Wait, the grammar doesn't have a production for NT35. Hmm, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT3, NT44, etc., but I don't see NT35. The string starts with 't35', which is a terminal. So according to the grammar, if there's a production that results in 't35', that non-terminal must have a rule A \u2192 a where a is 't35'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that results in 't35'.\n\nWait, let me check. The rules have NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which then eventually must derive to 't35'. Similarly, other non-terminals point to terminals. But if there's no production that results in 't35' directly, then that would be a problem because to have 't35' in the string, there must be a derivation where some non-terminal eventually produces 't35'.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S \u2192 NT3 NT77. Let's break that down.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\nNT6 \u2192 t63\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 t63. So NT6 is a production that goes to terminal 't63'. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT5 NT85, etc. But wait, in this case, NT3 is decomposed into NT17 and NT6, which in turn may derive into terms.\n\nBut in the string, the second token is 't14'. Let's see if any non-terminal produces 't14'. Looking at the rules, I do see NT22 \u2192 t78, but that's not 't14'. Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules that produce specific terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 t35. So, if there's a 't35' in the string, that must come from NT8 \u2192 t35.\n\nBut the string starts with 't35 t14 t70...' So first 't35' would require that the first non-terminal is NT8, which is producing 't35'. But S starts with NT3 and NT77, which don't produce 't35'.\n\nSo that would mean that the first production from S would be NT3 \u2192 ... which may produce something else. Wait, in the start symbol, S \u2192 NT3 NT77. So the first two symbols of the string are 't35 t14', so maybe NT3 produces 't35'? But NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, so it can't directly produce 't35'. Unless NT17 somehow can produce 't35', which I don't think is the case.\n\nLooking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let's see: the rules like S \u2192 NT3 NT77, then NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, which eventually becomes 't35' via NT44 \u2192 t68, but no, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe it's better to approach this by trying to match the string step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with 't35'. So the first symbol must come from a non-terminal that has a production to 't35'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't35' except for NT8 \u2192 t35.\n\nBut S starts with NT3 and NT77. So the initial expansion is NT3 and NT77.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6\n\nSo the first expansion is ['t35', 't63']? Wait, no, because NT6 \u2192 t63. So if NT3 \u2192 NT17 NT6, then NT17 is NT17, and NT6 is t63.\n\nBut our string starts with 't35 t14 t70...', which would require that after S \u2192 NT3 NT77, NT3 must produce 't35' and then the next steps. But NT3 can't produce 't35' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe S's production is NT3 NT77, which could be replacing S with two non-terminals, but the start symbol is the entire S. So the entire derivation starts from S \u2192 NT3 NT77, and the terminal tokens in the string must come from these non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first token"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
