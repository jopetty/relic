{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t4\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLet me first look at the grammar provided. It's a bit extensive, so I'll try to map out the possible ways \"t4\" might be derived.\n\nThe string we need to check is \"t4\". Since it's a single terminal symbol, I'm thinking that it might be produced directly by a production. Let me scan the productions to see if any nt -> \"t4\" exists.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see several terminal productions. Let me list them:\n\n- NT17 -> t4\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT55 -> t8\n- NT0 -> t6\n- NT12 -> t11\n- NT16 -> t5\n- NT59 -> t18, t57, t59\n- NT13 -> t2, t3\n- NT25 -> t7, t2\n- NT44 -> t0, t2, t4\n- NT43 -> t10\n- NT59 -> t12, t16\n- NT37 -> t9, t54\n- NT36 -> t0, t2, t6\n- NT55 -> t25 (not a terminal)\n- NT2 -> t0, t4, t6\n- NT24 -> t0, t5, t10\n- NT49 -> t3, t7, t9\n- NT59 -> t12, t16 as well as another rule (duplicate NT59?)\n\nWait, looking again, I see that there are duplicate definitions for some non-terminals. For example, NT59 has two rules: NT59 -> NT12 NT16 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Similarly, I see some duplications elsewhere but focusing on NT59.\n\nBut the key is, does any non-terminal directly produce \"t4\"? From the list, I see NT24 \u2192 t0, t5, t10. NT44 \u2192 t0, t2, t4. NT2 \u2192 t0, t4, t6. So, yes, a few non-terminals directly produce \"t4\".\n\nSo let's see which non-terminals can produce \"t4\":\n\n- NT2 directly\u2192 t4\n- NT44 \u2192 t4\n- NT24 \u2192 t4\n\nSo the string \"t4\" can be generated directly if there's a production that allows any of these to be a root.\n\nWait, but the grammar starts with S, which is S->NT17 NT59. So the root is a combination of two non-terminals, NT17 and NT59.\n\nSo to generate \"t4\", the derivation must start at S, then split into NT17 NT59. Then, each of these must be expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, let's see what possible productions NT17 and NT59 have.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 or NT17 \u2192 t4.\n\nWait, NT17 can directly produce t4, but that's only if it's allowed to terminate. Alternatively, it can produce two non-terminals which need to be expanded further.\n\nBut since \"t4\" is in the string, perhaps we can have a direct production.\n\nBut wait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nCase 1: NT17 \u2192 t4 directly.\n\nIf that's the case, then NT17 can produce t4, so then the S \u2192 NT17 NT59 would produce t4 NT59. Then, the string would be t4 followed by whatever NT59 generates. But our target is just \"t4\", so unless NT59 produces the empty string, which it can't because all productions are to two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because in the initial step, S is NT17 NT59. So the entire string would be the concatenation of what NT17 and NT59 produce. So if NT17 produces t4, then the string would be t4 followed by whatever NT59 produces, which would make the length longer than 1. But the target is just \"t4\".\n\nHence, perhaps we need to have NT17 produce t4 directly, and then NT59 produce the empty string, but since we don't have an empty production, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, maybe we cannot have a direct t4 from S because S is two non-terminals, and unless one of them can derive nothing, which they can't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT17 can be expanded via other rules that eventually lead to t4 combined with other terminal symbols, but that would mean the overall string is longer than \"t4\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT59 can produce t4 somewhere in the expansion, but let me check NT59's productions.\n\nLooking at NT59: Its rules are:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nand also possibly other rules (I need to double-check) but from the given list, NT59's rules are:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nWait, looking back, the provided grammar list for NT59 is:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nWait, no, wait I think I misread. The original grammar provided is:\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nWait, I think I got confused earlier. Let me restate the productions for NT59.\n\nLooking back correctly, for NT59, the rules are:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nWait, that's one rule, but what about in the given context, is there another rule for NT59? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the given grammar list, each production is separated. So I see:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nIs that all? Or are there others? Let me recheck.\n\nAh, yes, I see:\n\nThe user listed several entries. For NT59, there are two rules:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\"\n\nWait, no. Wait, the user actually wrote:\n\nWait let me parse the given grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar given by the user has the following lines:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT17 NT59\n\nThen a series of lines for other non-terminals, each line either defining a non-terminal's productions or a terminal.\n\nLooking carefully, here are the NT59 productions as per the user's input:\n\nNT59:\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, two rules for NT59.\n\nNow, for producing \"t4\", I need to see if, after expanding S, some of the non-terminals can produce \"t4\" as a terminal.\n\nSo let's try to see the path from S.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, we can consider each possibility of expanding NT17 and NT59.\n\nCase 1: If both NT17 and NT59 can produce strings that, when concatenated, give \"t4\".\n\nBut since \"t4\" is only one character, that seems difficult because S is two non-terminals, so unless one of them produces nothing, which they can't, the resulting string would have at least one terminal, but perhaps more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT17 can produce \"t4\" and NT59 can produce the empty string, but since that's impossible, that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe we can consider each non-terminal and see if, through some expansion, \"t4\" appears as a terminal in the string.\n\nSo:\n\nFor NT17:\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nWhat are NT17's rules? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the lines for NT17 are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nand also:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t4.\n\nSo, NT17 can directly produce \"t4\" or expand into two non-terminals.\n\nIf we take the direct production, then in S \u2192 NT17 NT59, if NT17\u2192t4, then the string would be t4 followed by whatever NT59 produces. But we need to have the entire string be just t4, so unless NT59 produces nothing, which it can't, that's not possible.\n\nWait, but maybe NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-0","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string 't10' to check if it's in the language generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring CFGs where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. The grammar given should follow this structure.\n\nThe string I'm given is just a single terminal symbol, 't10'. I need to see if this symbol appears in the language of the grammar. To do that, I'll have to trace back from the start symbol 'S' and see if I can derive 't10' through a series of substitutions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So S is a non-terminal that must produce two other non-terminals, NT17 and NT59. For the string 't10' to be derived, either NT17 or NT59 (or both, but in this case, since 't10' has to come from a single production, maybe NT17 or NT59 needs to generate it).\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Okay, so NT17 must produce NT37 and NT54. Neither of these seem to directly produce a terminal, but let's check their productions.\n\nNT37 has a production: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So NT37 needs two non-terminals, NT49 and NT18. Checking NT49: NT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11' from two of its productions. So NT49 can produce 't3' or 't11'. If NT49 is 't3' or 't11', then NT37 would produce a string of those plus NT18. Hmm.\n\nNT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 't0', 't2', or 't5'. So NT18 can generate one of those terminals. Let's see if any sequence can combine to produce 't10'.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's take the start symbol S and see what possible ways it can generate 't10'. But S produces two non-terminals, so each must derive into at least one symbol each. But in order for the entire string to be 't10', each of them must result in some terminals that combine to form 't10'. But 't10' is a single terminal, so that would require that either NT17 or NT59 derive into 't10', but looking at NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT59: NT59 has two productions: one is NT12 NT16 and another is NT57 NT24. So for NT59 to produce 't10', one path is through NT12 and NT16 or through NT57 and NT24.\n\nLooking at the first path: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. Then NT12 and NT16 must produce 't10'. But let's see what they can derive. NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43 or NT13 NT43. Then, looking at NT5: NT5 \u2192 't5' or 't9' or 't3' or 't10'. So if NT5 is 't10', that's one possibility.\n\nWait, so let me try to see if NT12 can produce 't10'. Let's take NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43. Then NT5 could be 't10'. So if NT5 \u2192 't10', then NT12 would produce 't10' followed by whatever NT43 produces. But 't10' alone would require that NT43 also produces nothing, which it can't because it's in CNF and must produce terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if any of the productions directly result in 't10'. Looking through all the non-terminals' productions, I see NT5 has a production to 't10', which is good because that's a direct way. So if a non-terminal can produce 't10', then perhaps it's possible.\n\nWait, but 't10' is a terminal, so if any non-terminal can produce 't10' directly, then that's the end of the string. So let's look at which non-terminals have 't10' as a production.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT5: NT5 \u2192 't10' \u2192 Yes, so NT5 can produce 't10'.\n- NT24: NT24 \u2192 't10' (actually, looking back, wait, I see NT24's productions: NT24 \u2192 't0' , 't5', 't10'. No, wait, looking at the provided grammar, under NT24:\n\nNT24: -> 't10'\n\nYes, NT24 can produce 't10'.\n\nAlso, looking at NT17: it's production is NT37 NT54. Then maybe NT37 produces something that can lead to 't10'. Let me check NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. NT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11', and NT18 can produce 't10'. Oh! Wait, so NT18 can produce 't10', which is great.\n\nSo putting that together: Let's see if there's a way that S can derive 't10' through the right substitutions.\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 \u2192 NT49 NT18 NT54\n\nWait, but NT54's production is NT17 \u2192 NT49 NT18 NT54?

{"custom_id":"request-19","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t2 t3\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string. \n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 aB or A \u2192 Ba, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see it's in CNF because every production has either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right side. But wait, some productions have two terminals on the right, like NT59 \u2192 NT0 and NT59 \u2192 NT18, but I think in CNF it should be either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check an example: NT59 has productions to 't9', which are terminals. Oh, sorry, the terminals here are 't0', 't1', etc. So each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Since the string is made up of two terminals, 't2' and 't3', I need to see if they can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string \"t2 t3\" must be generated by expanding S into something that can produce two terminals. Let's see how S expands: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. To get 't2' and 't3', NT17 and NT59 need to derive into 't2' and 't3' respectively.\n\nSo, let's first look at NT17. The productions for NT17 are: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 and NT17 \u2192 't4'. So NT17 can directly produce 't4' if that's the case, but we need it to produce 't2'. Wait, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe NT17 can be expanded further. Let's see.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT17 is only defined as NT37 NT54 or 't4'. So to produce 't2', we need another path. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again. The user provided the grammar, let me parse it correctly.\n\nLooking back: \nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT17 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, so NT17 can produce 't4' directly. But the string has 't2', so that's not helpful. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check all the NT17 productions again. Is there any other way?\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper into the grammar tree. Let me see if 't2' can be produced by any non-terminal. Looking through all the non-terminals:\n\nFor example, NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, and NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44, etc. Let's see if 't2' is anywhere. Looking at non-terminals:\n\nLooking through all the NT definitions, I notice NT55 \u2192 't8' (from NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0 \u2192 NT13 NT44 \u2192 NT13 is 't3', and NT44 \u2192 't0'. Wait, that's 't3 t0' from 't25'? Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me track specific non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string has 't2 t3', so let's consider each part.\n\nFirst, 't2' must come from some non-terminal. Let me find all the NTs that can derive to 't2'. Looking at the grammar, where is 't2' defined? Let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the NT definitions, I see NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15 \u2192 NT5 (which is 't5') NT15, which is 't0'. So NT43 \u2192 't5 t0' \u2192 but that's 't5' and 't0'. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for terminals in the non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-18","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string \"t5 t0\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right. Looking at the start symbol \"S\", I see it goes directly to NT17 NT59. \n\nFirst, let's see how \"t5 t0\" can be derived from this. The string has two tokens: \"t5\" and \"t0\". Since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, I need to explore possible paths.\n\nStarting with S -> NT17 NT59. So, we need to derive \"t5\" from NT17 and \"t0\" from NT59, or vice versa. Let's check what NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17:\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nThen, NT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT49 can produce 't3' or 't11' via the rules under NTT49. Let's see:\nNTT49 has two rules: one to 't3' and another to 't11'. Similarly, NT18 has some rules, like -> NT24, which can produce 't0' or other symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t5 t0\". Let's think step by step. Starting with S, we have NT17 NT59.\n\nLet's explore NT17 first. NT17 can go to NT37 NT54. Then, NT37 is NT49 NT18. So:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nThen, NT49 can be 't3' or 't11', and NT18 can produce 't0' (via\u89c4\u5219NTT18->'t0').\n\nSo, combining these: NT17 can derive something that produces 't0' on the right side. Similarly, looking at NT59: NT59 can go to NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24. Let's see:\n\nIf NT59 -> NT12 NT16:\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT5 can produce 't5'. So, NT5 in NT59 would produce 't5', and NT16 can produce 't6'.\n\nWait, but our string is \"t5 t0\", so maybe we need \"t5\" from NT17 and \"t0\" from NT59, or the other way around. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nFirst path:\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT49 -> 't3' (so NT17 would produce something with 't3')\nBut our string has 't5' and 't0'. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, looking for paths that produce 't5' and 't0'.\n\nLooking for NT17: Let's see the path for NT17. It can go to NT37 NT54. Let's see what NT37 and NT54 can do.\n\nNT37: NT49 NT18. So, NT49 can produce 't3' or 't11', and NT18 can produce 't0' (as per rule). So, possible to get 't0' from NT18.\n\nWait, but NT17's production is NT37 NT54, which themselves can produce non-terminals that eventually produce terminal symbols.\n\nLet me try mapping this out:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nThen, NT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT49 -> 't3' (since one of its rules is 't3')\nNT18 -> 't0'\n\nNow, check what NT57 and NT24 produce.\n\nWait, the string is \"t5 t0\", so perhaps we can trace back where 't5' comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT5 can produce 't5' because one of its rules is NT5 -> 't5'. So, let's see if there's a path where one of the NT17 or NT59 branches leads to 't5'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the string can be derived by different paths. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the string \"t5 t0\". Each token must come from a production that eventually ends in that token. So, 't5' is in the first position, and 't0' in the second.\n\nStarting with S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, NT17 must produce 't5' and NT59 must produce 't0', or vice versa.\n\nLet me check if NT17 can produce 't5'. Looking at the productions for NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nLooking at NT37:\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18.\n\nLooking at NT37's descendants, I don't see any production that directly leads to 't5'. The only 't5's come from NT5.\n\nLooking at NT59: NT59 can produce 't0' in some cases, like through NT59 -> NT12 NT16, and then NT12 can produce 't5' because NT12 can go to NT5 NT43, and NT5 can be 't5' via NT5's production.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step.\n\nSuppose S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nIf NT17 -> NT37 NT54, and NT37 -> NT49 NT18, and NT49 -> 't3' or 't11', which we don't have in the string, this path might not be useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT17 can produce 't5' via some other path. Looking at NT17's production rules, it only goes to NT37 NT54, which don't directly produce 't5's. So NT17 seems to produce 't3' or 't11' or other things, but not 't5'.\n\nNow, looking at NT59: NT59 can go to NT57 NT24 or NT12 NT16.\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16.\n\nNT12 can go to NT5 NT43, and NT5 can produce 't5'. So, in this case, maybe:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT5 -> 't5'\nAnd NT16 can produce 't0', perhaps?\n\nWait, NT16: Looking at its production, NT16 -> NT55 NT32.\n\nNT55 can go to NT25 NT0, and NT0 can produce 't6', 't0', etc.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe NT16 can directly produce 't0'? Looking at the rules, NT59 -> NT16 can produce 't6' when NT0 is 't6' or something else.\n\nWait, let me track it properly.\n\nIf NT59 -> NT12 NT16.\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43.\n\nNT5 -> 't5'.\n\nThen, NT16: Let's see NT16's rules.\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32.\n\nThen NT55 -> NT25 NT0.\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44.\n\nNT13 can produce 't2' via NT13 -> 't2' (looking at production rules).\n\nWait, that's getting convoluted. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT59 can produce 't0' via another path. Let's check NT59's rules again.\n\nNT59 can also go to NT57 NT24.\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41.\n\nNT8 -> 't10'.\n\nHmm, not 't0'.\n\nWait, NT24 has a production NT24 -> 't10'.\n\nSo, if NT59 -> NT57 NT24, then NT24 would give 't10', but the string is 't5 t0'.\n\nAlternatively, NT59 -> NT57 and NT41. Let's see: NT57 can produce 't3' or 't11', and NT41 can go to NT16 NT17.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the string can't be generated because 't5' and 't0' can't both be produced from the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps 't5' is produced by NT5, which is directly a terminal. So, maybe a subtree in the grammar is NT5 -> 't5'.\n\nWhere can that happen? Looking for a production that includes NT5.\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes, NT5 can be 't5'.\n\nSo, to produce 't5', the production must have NT5.\n\nBut looking at the rules, only"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal is defined by productions, and the terminals are the strings made up of 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with t6.\n\nLooking at NT17, its only production is NT37 NT54. So, the leftmost symbol becomes NT37 NT54. Now, we need to see if both parts can derive t6 and t5 t11. Wait, no, the string is t6 t5 t11, so after the first split, we have two parts: t6 has to come from NT37, and the rest has to come from NT54.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the productions again. S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So each step is about expanding the leftmost non-terminal. So, starting with S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So now we have NT37 NT54 NT59.\n\nNext, what do NT37 and NT54 produce? Looking at all productions, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So, NT37 becomes NT49 NT18.\n\nThen, NT49 can produce 't3' or 't11', or in other cases. Wait, looking at the productions, NT49's rules are NT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't11'. Oh, wait, looking back, the user provided the grammar as a list of productions, and I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\nNT49 \u2192 't11'\nAnd same with NT8: NT8 \u2192 't10', but that's not directly needed here.\n\nSo, NT49 can produce either 't3' or 't11'. Let's say we choose 't11' from NT49. So, our string so far is 't11'.\n\nNow, going back to NT18. NT18 \u2192 NT44 NT54. So, NT18 becomes NT44 NT54. Now, let's see what NT44 does. NT44 \u2192 't0' or maybe other rules? Looking through the productions, NT44's rule is NT44 \u2192 't2'? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't0', NT25 \u2192 't7', NT24 \u2192 't5', etc. Let me check. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which then becomes NT37 NT54 NT59.\n\nThen NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nSo now, NT49 is 't11', so we have 't11' and then NT18 \u2192 NT44 NT54.\n\nNow, looking at NT44, does it have a production? Looking through the grammar, I see NT44's rules. Let me look at the productions again:\n\nLooking for NT44, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT44 might not have a production, but wait, let me scan through the list. Oh, I see NT44 appears in the production for NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44. So, NT44 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So, I need to see how NT44 expands.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I see NT44's definition. Let me re-examine each production line:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT44 is never directly on the left side as a non-terminal except in NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44.\n\nSo, if NT44 is a non-terminal, it must have a production, but I don't see it in the list. That might be an issue because in Chomsky Normal Form, all non-terminals must have productions that produce two non-terminals or terminals. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-31","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine whether the string \"t6 t3 t5\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which can have zero symbols (but here, the start is S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which is two symbols, so that's fine). The non-terminals are all the NT followed by a number, like NT17, NT59, etc., and some of them are terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't6', 't3', etc.\n\nThe string to check is \"t6 t3 t5\". So, this is a sequence of three tokens. My job is to see if there's a way for the grammar to produce this sequence.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string has three tokens, but the grammar's start rule S \u2192 NT17 NT59 will produce two non-terminals. So, each of these non-terminals will likely derive into sequences of terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT17 can derive into something, as per the productions. Let me look at NT17's productions. Looking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, each step, each non-terminal can be expanded into two other non-terminals, unless it's a terminal directly.\n\nLooking again, are there any NT that directly produce a terminal? For example, I see NT36 \u2192 't6', yes. So, NT36 can derive directly into 't6'. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't5' and NT5 \u2192 't3', NT17 can produce 't4', etc.\n\nSo, the string has three 't's: t6, t3, t5. So, I need to see if the derivation can lead to an expansion that results in exactly these three, in order.\n\nSince the string is \"t6 t3 t5\", that's three tokens. Let's think about how that could happen. The start symbol S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the derivation starts with NT17 and NT59. Each of these must expand into a sequence of terminals, and their concatenation should be exactly \"t6 t3 t5\".\n\nSo, perhaps NT17 expands to 't6' and NT59 expands to 't3 t5' or vice versa. Let me check the possible expansions.\n\nFirst, let's see NT17: according to the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, to get 't6', we need to see if either NT37 or NT54 derive into 't6'. Looking at NT37, its productions: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Hmm, so it's two non-terminals. NT49 can be 't3' or 't11' (from NT49 \u2192 't3' or NT49 \u2192 't11'). Similarly, NT18 can be 't0', 't10', 't11', etc., but let's see:\n\nNT49 can be 't3' (directly) if it has a production for that. Wait, in the given grammar, NT49 has two rules: NT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't11'. So, yes, NT49 can produce 't3' when it's used as a terminal. Similarly, NT18 has some rules, like NT18 \u2192 NT44 NT18 or other paths, but let's focus on NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. If both NT49 and NT18 can be terminals, what do they expand into?\n\nIf NT49 is 't3', then NT18 needs to be 't something'. Wait, NT18 can produce 't0', but we need a 't5'. Let me check if NT18 can go further. NT18's productions: looking through the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't0', NT18 \u2192 't2', NT18 \u2192 't4', etc. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see NT18 having a production directly to 't5' or 't11'. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT44 NT18 (as per NT18: 'NT18 \u2192 NT44', no, wait. Let me list all NT18's productions. Wait, in the list:\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT18, here's what I see:\n\n- NT18 -> t0? No, wait. Let me scan through line by line.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, I see NT19 is not defined here. Wait, the provided grammar seems to have some lines:\n\nWait, let me re-express this correctly. The grammar is a series of rules for each non-terminal.\n\nHere's a clearer list:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nNT41 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, no, wait. Looking more carefully:\n\nWait, the grammar is provided as a series of lines, each line starting with \"NTx \u2192 ...\".\n\nFor example:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nSo, it's possible that some non-terminals have productions that are direct terminals. For example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT49 appears as:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't11'\n\nSo, yes, NT49 can produce 't3' or 't11'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 has some rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo, NT5 can produce 't3', 't5', or 't10'.\n\nWait, that's useful.\n\nSo, going back to NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nAnd NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nSo, to get 't6', perhaps NT37 can produce 't3' (from NT49 \u2192 't3') and then NT18 can produce 't6'? Or wait, is there a way for NT18 to produce 't6'? Looking through NT18's rules, I don't see a direct production for 't6'. Wait, NT18 is defined as:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT18 \u2192 't6' as a direct production. So, perhaps NT18 can't directly produce 't6', meaning that if NT17 is to produce 't6', that path wouldn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT17 can derive into 't6' through another route. Let me see.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this more systematically.\n\nThe string is \"t6 t3 t5\". So, it's three tokens. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, the derivation process would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nThen, both NT17 and NT59 expand into some terminals and non-terminals. Their concatenation must result in exactly \"t6 t3 t5\".\n\nSo, one possibility is that NT17 expands into 't6' and NT59 expands into 't3 t5', but let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, to get 't6', perhaps NT37 produces a terminal, and NT54 produces a terminal. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So, NT37 expands into two non-terminals. For 't6' to come out of this, one of these must produce 't6'.\n\nNT49 can produce 't3' or 't11'. Neither is 't6'. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT37 doesn't expand into a terminal but further into more non-terminals, but if that's the case, the concatenated result could include more than the required 't6'. So, maybe I'm on the wrong path.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if NT59 can produce 't3' and then something else"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string `t10 t7 t11 t5` is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Chomsky normal form is where each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. Let me list out the production rules to make sure I understand them all.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first production is S -> NT17 NT59. So, S can produce two non-terminals: NT17 and NT59.\n\nThen, NT0 can produce NT55 NT12, NT41 NT17, NT15 NT16, NT59 (with multiple options including terminals and other non-terminals), and so on. It seems like there are many NTs, each pointing to combinations of other NTs and sometimes terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t10 t7 t11 t5`. Each of these is a terminal. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through some sequence of productions ending in these terminals.\n\nSince each production has at most one terminal, the length of the string should match the number of steps derived from S. For a string of length 4, we'll need 3 derivations (since each step reduces a non-terminal into terminals, but I think actually the number of operations is equal to the length minus one).\n\nWait, no, let me think about that again. In a CFG, the number of productions needed to derive a string of m terminals is m-1. So, for 4 terminals, we need 3 productions. So S (1 symbol) becomes NT17 NT59. Each of those could split into more symbols until we have four terminals.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to construct the parse tree or see which non-terminals can directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several non-terminals that can directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6', 't2', 't0' (since I see entries like NT36 -> 't6', 't2', etc.)\nWait, looking again: in the grammar, NT57 -> NT8 NT41. Then NT8 can produce t10. Also, NT36 has several production options: in the initial list, NT57 -> NT8 NT41, but looking through the list, I see NT36 -> 't6', 't2', etc. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, each line is a production for a non-terminal. So for example, for NT36, there are two entries: one is NT57 -> NT8 NT41, and another is, for example, NT36 -> t6. Wait, looking again, perhaps I should re-examine the list.\n\nWait, the grammar is presented with each production starting with \"NT\" followed by a number, and then the production. For example:\n\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT41 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't10'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT16 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n- NT57 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT32 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT43 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT37 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't9'\n- NT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, I see now.

The Chomsky Normal Form means that every production rule is either a single non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe given grammar has both types of productions. For example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 is a production where the non-terminal S is replaced by two other non-terminals. Then there are productions where non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT44 \u2192 't0'.\n\nThe string to analyze is `t8 t6 t6 t11`. Each of these \"t\" terms is a terminal symbol. So, to see if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to find a derivation starting from the start symbol S that results in this string.\n\nWait, let's clarify the start symbol. I assume that the start symbol is S because it's the top-level production. The production for S is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the first step would be to replace S with NT17 and NT59. From there, each of these non-terminals will either produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string starts with NT17 and ends with NT59.

So, NT59 splits into NT12 and NT16.\n\nSo after the first expansion, S becomes NT17 NT59 \u2192 (NT37 NT54) (NT12 NT16) \u2192 NT37 NT54 NT12 NT16. Now, we have four non-terminals.\n\nEach of these non-terminals needs to be further expanded.\n\nStarting with NT37: Looking at the productions, I see NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So NT37 expands into NT49 and NT18.\n\nNext is NT54: NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT56. So NT54 becomes NT13 and NT56.\n\nThen, NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43. So, NT12 becomes NT5 and NT43.\n\nLastly, NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32. So, NT16 becomes NT55 and NT32.\n\nPutting all this together, the string now is NT49 NT18 NT5 NT43 NT55 NT32.\n\nSo after two steps, we've expanded from S to six non-terminals. Now, each of these needs further expansion.\n\nLet's go through each non-terminal:\n\n1. NT49: Looking at productions, NT49 \u2192 't3' or NT36. So NT49 can produce a terminal 't3' or continue expanding as NT36. However, in our target string, we have 't8' as the first symbol and 't6' as the second, so 't3' doesn't fit. But wait, perhaps I should track which path leads to the desired t symbols.\n\nWait, my target string is t8 t6 t6 t11. So the initial expansion gave us NT49, which needs to be 't3'. But that's not part of the target. Hmm, maybe I'm taking the wrong path here. Alternatively, perhaps I should see if there's another production for NT49 that can lead to the desired symbols.\n\nWait, checking the productions, I think I see that NT49 has multiple productions: NT49 \u2192 't3', 't10', and 't11'. Let me check: Looking back, yes, I see NT49 \u2192 't10', NT49 \u2192 't11', and previously, NT43 \u2192 't10' and 't4' based on other rules.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar provided, under NT49, the productions are:\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't11'\nAdditionally, in the grammar, there's a production for NT36 that sometimes produces 't6', but in this case, we're looking at NT49. So, from NT49, possible terminals are 't3', 't10', 't11'. Wait, no, checking again, the productions under NT49 are 't3' and 't11':\n\nWait, under NT49, I think there might be more. Let me look again. Oh wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\nNT49 \u2192 't11'\n\nSo only two options. So, NT49 can become 't3' or 't11'. Since the initial symbol starts with 't8', which isn't 't3' or 't11'. Hmm, that suggests that maybe this path is incorrect, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the initial steps.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different way. Let me see: The string is t8 t6 t6 t11. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then NT17 \u2192 something that produces t8, and NT59 \u2192 something that produces t6, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by considering that the initial expansion of S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then, for NT17, perhaps it has a production that directly leads to 't8'. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and I don't see any terminal 't8' directly from NT17. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider other expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each step again.\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nStep 2: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So now, NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT49 can either be 't3', 't11', etc.\n\nWait, but the target string starts with 't8', so 't3' isn't matching. Maybe I'm on the wrong path. Perhaps I need to find a way for NT17 to produce 't8' directly, but I don't see that in the grammar. Looking through NT17's productions, none of them directly lead to 't8'. So that suggests that the first expansion after S must lead to NT17 and NT59, both of which don't directly produce 't8' or 't6's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm getting the initial production wrong. Let me check again.\n\nThe given grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n- ...\n\nRight. So, S expands into NT17 and NT59. Then, each of these needs to be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the next step is to see how NT17 and NT59 expand.\n\nNT17: production is NT37 NT54.\n\nNT59: production is NT12 NT16.\n\nTherefore, the string becomes NT37 NT54 NT12 NT16.\n\nEach of these further expands:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT13 NT56.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nNow, the string is NT49 NT18 NT5 NT43 NT55 NT32.\n\nEach of these needs to terminate or expand further.\n\nNT49: can be 't3' or 't11'. The first symbol of the target is 't8', so 't3' is not it. Hmm, this path doesn't fit. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps NT18 can expand into something that starts with 't6'? Let me check NT18's productions. Looking through the grammar, under NT18, there's NT18 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't11', 't7', etc. So, 't10' is an option. But in the target, the second symbol is 't6'. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm getting the expansions wrong. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps the initial expansion of S is correct, but maybe there's an alternative production that I missed. Wait, in the grammar, under NT55 we have NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, etc. Maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that NT37 might have another production besides NT49 NT18. Let me check the grammar again.

{"custom_id":"request-71","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t3 t9 t11 t0 t2\", and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol can also produce \u03b5, but in this case, looking at the start symbol S, it seems it only produces non-terminals, so the empty string might not be relevant here.\n\nThe string I'm given is a sequence of terminals: t3, t9, t11, t0, t2. I need to check if this sequence can be derived from S by applying a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll list out the relevant production rules that directly produce terminal symbols, as those are the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLet me go through each production that ends with a terminal (since those are the only ones that can directly contribute to the string). I think it's easiest to work backwards from the string to see if it can be derived.\n\nStarting from the end, maybe I can see which rules can produce these t's. Let's see:\n\n- t3: Looking at the rules, NT0 \u2192 't6', NT15 \u2192 't0', NT55 \u2192 't8', NT25 \u2192 't7', NT5 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't10', etc. Wait, but I need to find a way to produce t3. Hmm, looking through the rules, I see NT59 can produce t24, but t24 might not be helpful. Or maybe some other rule.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, NT37 \u2192 't9' is one rule, right? Yes, because in the grammar, NT37 is defined as NT49 NT18, and then another production of NT37 is 't9'. So if any non-terminal can produce NT37, then t9 can be produced.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't6' is a rule. So if NT0 is in the derivation, that can produce t6.\n\nWait, let me list all the production rules that directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't9'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT12 \u2192 't11' [Wait, no, looking back, NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43. Hmm, but I don't see a direct production of t11. Wait, in the rules, NT15 \u2192 't0', NT5 \u2192 't5','t10', etc. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, I just realized that some of the NT rules produce other NT's, but only certain ones produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT37: only NT49 NT18, and then another rule says NT37 \u2192 't9'\n- NT9: I don't see any. Wait, perhaps I should make a list of all the NT's that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 't9'\n- NT59 \u2192 but it has two rules: NT18 NT36 and another NT12 NT16, but neither t12 nor t16 are terminals.

Wait, in the grammar, NT12 has two rules:\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nand another production:\n\nNT12 -> 't11'\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, starting from the top:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait, that can't be right.

{"custom_id":"request-79","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t3 t4 t9 t4 t10` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided looks to be in CNF because each rule on the left side (like S, NT0, NT17, etc.) either has exactly two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. That's a good start.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t3 t4 t9 t4 t10`. Each of these is a terminal symbol, so my task is to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar starting with the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S expands to NT17 NT59. So the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Now, we have to handle both NT17 and NT59, each on their own paths.\n\nLet's look at NT17 first. The production for NT17 is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, replacing NT17, the string becomes NT37 NT54 NT59. Now, we have to expand NT37, NT54, and NT59.\n\nStarting with NT37: It's in the production NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So replacing NT37 gives NT49 NT18 NT54 NT59. Next, NT49: It can expand to 't3' or 't7'. But in our target string, we need 't3' first. So let's take NT49 \u2192 't3'. So now we have t3 NT18 NT54 NT59.\n\nNow NT18: The production is NT18 \u2192 NT54. So replacing NT18 with NT54, the string becomes t3 NT54 NT54 NT59.\n\nMoving on to NT54: The production is NT54 \u2192 t9 or t6. Since we need t9 next, let's choose t9. So replacing NT54 gives t3 t9 NT54 NT59.\n\nNow looking at the second NT54: It can produce t6 or t9. Here, we've already used t9, and the next needed is t4. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I should backtrack. Maybe instead of taking t3 first, I should check if I can get t4 at some point. But let's see.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me retrace:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT54\n\nNT54 \u2192 t9\n\nSo the first part gives 't3 t9'.\n\nNow, the second part is NT59: Let's expand NT59. Looking at the grammar, NT59 has two rules: one is NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, and the other is NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Also, wait, earlier I thought the string was derived as S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which after some steps led to t3 t9, but maybe I should also expand the second NT59 path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also track the other NT59 path. So, perhaps it would have been better to handle the NT59 differently, but let me continue as is.\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT17 NT59, we have to handle both NT17 (now t3 t9) and NT59.\n\nWait, I think I confused the expansion earlier. Actually, when you have two symbols like NT17 and NT59, each is an independent path. So when expanding NT17, we have to expand each non-terminal one by one, and similarly for NT59.\n\nWait, no, it's more accurate to say that in a derivation, each symbol is replaced by its productions until terminals are reached. So S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which then both need to be expanded. Let me consider NT17 and NT59 separately.\n\nSo, let's handle NT17 first:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' or 't7'\n\nLet's take NT49 \u2192 't3' as before. So now we have t3 NT18 NT54.\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT54\n\nNT54 \u2192 't9' or 't6'\n\nWe need to see if after 't3', we can have t4 next. But 't9' is a result of one expansion from NT54, so perhaps taking 't9' here. Then, the first part is 't3 t9', and the second NT59 needs to generate 't4 t4 t10'.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. Because the string is t3 t4 t9 t4 t10, so after t3 t9, we need t4, t4, t10. So perhaps I should consider the second path of NT59.\n\nSo, let me go back. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Let's take NT17 and expand it as before to get t3 and NT54. Then, handling NT59.\n\nNT59 has two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, perhaps taking NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16.\n\nNow, NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5' or 't3' or 't10'\n\nWe need to reach 't4' next, but NT5 can't produce t4 directly. Alternatively, perhaps taking another path.\n\nWait, let's list all possible terminals in the grammar. The terminals are 't0' to 't11'. So, looking at the productions, the terminals include 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', 't10', 't11'. So all t0 through t11.\n\nNow, the string is t3, t4, t9, t4, t10.\n\nHmm. Let's see:\n\nLooking back, when expanding NT17, I got t3 and then need to expand more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically, using a parse tree or considering possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a parse table approach, but that might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation.\n\nLet me try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNow, expand NT17 until all non-terminals are processed.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 t3 or t7\n\nLet's take t3 first.\n\nSo, S becomes t3 NT18 NT54\n\nNext, NT18 \u2192 NT54\n\nNow, S is t3 NT54 NT54\n\nNow, expand the first NT54: NT54 \u2192 't9' or 't6'\n\nIf we take 't9', then S is t3 t9 NT54.\n\nBut the string starts with t3 t4, so we need 't4' next. So 't9' is not suitable here, so perhaps we should backtrack and take another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choosing 't6' at NT54. NT54 \u2192 t6. So S becomes t3 t6 NT54.\n\nBut in the string, after t3 comes t4, not t6, so t6 is not helpful.

Wait, but NT54's rules are to produce t9 or t6.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Let's see, maybe NT54 can produce t4, but looking at the productions, NT54 \u2192 t9 or t6. So it can't produce t4 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see the productions:\n\nLooking back, NT54 \u2192 t9 or t6.\n\nAh, so no, NT54 can't produce 't4'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is `S \u2192 NT17 NT59`. So, the entire string must derive from NT17 and NT59. \n\nLet's break this down. The string is six tokens long: t8, t0, t9, t7, t8, t10. So, each NT symbol will produce two tokens each, meaning each NT should resolve into one token each step, but wait, that depends on how they split. Wait, no\u2014each production in CNF is two non-terminals or terminals. Since all the NT rules eventually resolve to terminals, each NT production will produce one or more terminals. \n\nBut to make sense of it, maybe I should see which NTs can directly produce the first token, t8.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, the ones that start with 't' are the terminals. Let's list all the NTs and their corresponding terminals:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17, and also directly to 't6' (from NT41 \u2192 't6')\nWait, no. Looking back, some NTs have a mix of both non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT17 has a production `NT17 -> NT37 NT54`, but in other cases, like NT57, I see `NT57 -> NT8 NT41` and also `NT59 -> NT12 NT57` which eventually leads to NT59's symbol.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a grammar where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This helps in constructing parsers, but here I just need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe given grammar has a start symbol S, and the string starts with \"t4\", so I need to find a production that starts with a non-terminal that can derive to \"t4\".\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT17 NT59: so S starts with NT17. The target string starts with t4, so I need to see how NT17 can produce t4. \n\nLooking into NT17's productions: from the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So now I have to see if NT37 can produce tsomething that leads to t4.\n\nWait, but the target string starts with t4, so maybe I should check if any non-terminals directly have a production to t4. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT5 \u2192 t5, NT55 \u2192 t8, NT44 \u2192 t0, NT49 \u2192 t11, etc. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up through multiple steps. Let me try to parse the string to see if it can fit the productions.\n\nThe string is t4 t1 t6 t9 t8 t0. I'll index them as positions 0 to 5.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT17 NT59. So S can't directly produce the string because S is split into two parts. So perhaps each part will generate a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the first part: NT17. From the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 can be split into NT37 and NT54. Now, I need to see how these can produce parts of the string.\n\nSimilarly, the second part is NT59, which has some productions. Looking at NT59, it's appearing in multiple rules: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36; NT59 was also listed twice, but perhaps one of them is a terminal. Wait, in the given grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, but also another production: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16? Or was that a typo? Wait, in the grammar provided, under NT59, there's \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\" and then \"NT59 -> NT57 NT24\". So NT59 can produce either NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24 or also NT18 NT36? Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNo, the initial grammar part was:\nN T59 -> NT18 NT36\nBut then it's also written again: NT59 -> NT25 NT0? Wait, perhaps I should list out all the productions for each non-terminal to avoid confusion.\n\nBut that's a lot. Maybe I can look for terminals in the string and see if any non-terminals directly produce them.\n\nLooking at the string t4 t1 t6 t9 t8 t0.\n\n terminals are t4, t1, t6, t9, t8, t0.\n\nFrom the grammar, each non-terminal can produce certain terminals. For example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t5\nNT36 \u2192 t6\nNT0 \u2192 t0 or other\nNT4 \u2192 some rules?\n\nWait, let's list the productions that directly map to terminals:\n\nNT0: NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\nAnd some of its productions eventually may lead to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look up for each position.\n\nBut maybe it's better to see if the string can be parsed backwards. Let's look for the last part, t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 can produce t0? Let me check. NT0\u2192 NT55 NT0, which leads to possibly a derivation, but also look for NT0's direct productions. In the grammar, NT0\u2192 NT55 NT12. None directly to t0. But in other productions, like NT44 \u2192 t0, NT36\u2192t6, etc.\n\nWait, maybe NT57\u2192 NT37 NT54. NT37\u2192 t9 or something? Let me see:\n\nLooking for terminals in the string, the sequence is t4, t1, t6, t9, t8, t0.\n\nt4 appears early, so perhaps at position 0: t4 comes from NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT37 must produce t4. Looking at NT37's productions: NT37\u2192 NT49 NT18, and perhaps others. Wait, in the grammar: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, so NT37 can't directly produce t4, but maybe through some steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me try another approach: parse the string step by step, trying to split it into chunks that match the productions.\n\nThe string is t4 t1 t6 t9 t8 t0.\n\nLet me think of the string as a sequence of non-terminals that produce the terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nt4: where does t4 come from? Looking at all productions, I notice NT36 \u2192 t6, NT44 \u2192 t0, NT59\u2192 t1 (wait, does any non-terminal directly produce t4)?\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT17\u2192t4? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce a terminal that matches the string's first element, t4.\n\nIn the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t4. All terminals are t0, t1, t3, t4, t5, t6, t8, t9, t10, t11 (wait, let me check all productions):\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t4. So maybe t4 has to come from a combination of multiple steps.\n\nBut wait, what about NT16? Let's see. NT16\u2192t5? Wait, no, I think earlier I saw NT16 producing t5, but in the given grammar, looking:\n\nNT16 rules: NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32, NT16\u2192t5, and perhaps others. Wait, looking back:\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT16 \u2192 t5. So maybe t5 is possible. But in our string, t5 isn't present; instead, we have t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the initial grammar again.\n\nYes, at some point, the production rules for NT17 are as follows: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. And earlier, NT55 \u2192 t8, and NT37\u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a way to get t4 from NT37\u2192 NT49 NT18. But NT49\u2192t7, etc., but that might not lead to t4.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT36: NT36\u2192t6, and NT36 also appears in NT25\u2192NT13 NT44 and so on. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution starts by breaking down the string into components that can be produced by the CFG. Since the starting symbol is S, which splits into two parts, maybe we need to see how each part contributes to the string.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the string can be split into a sequence of non-terminals.\n\nThe string is t4 t1 t6 t9 t8 t0.\n\nSo, the first terminal is t4. Since there's no direct production of t4, we need a non-terminal that can produce t4 in combination with other non-terminals through a production.\n\nWait, perhaps the first non-terminal (for t4) is NT16, which can produce t5, but that's t5. Or maybe NT17, which could produce NT37 and something else.\n\nWait, NT17\u2192NT37 NT54. So NT17 is used to generate two parts. Let's say the first part is t4, so perhaps NT37 produces t4, then NT54 produces the remaining part.\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT37 can't produce t4 directly, but perhaps via a longer production.\n\nWait, let me look at NT37. In the grammar, NT37\u2192NT49 NT18. Then, NT49\u2192t7 or t11. Wait, that's not t4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT37 produces something else that leads to t4 indirectly.\n\nWait, maybe the problem requires using the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing in CNF.

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t6 t9 t3 t5 t10 t7 t10`. Let me break down how I would approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and how the non-terminals expand. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which has two symbols. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT17 and NT59.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: `t6, t9, t3, t5, t10, t7, t10`. Each of these corresponds directly to a production at some point in the derivation. So, I need to see if starting from S, I can derive this sequence by breaking it down step by step according to the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if the leaves of the tree can produce this string. \n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNow, each of these NT17 and NT59 needs to expand into terminals or further non-terminals. Let's take NT17 first. Looking at the production rules for NT17:\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nThen, I need to see what NT37 and NT54 produce.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\nNT49 \u2192 't3' (terminal)\nNT18 \u2192 't0' (terminal)\n\nWait, but NT18 is 't0', which isn't in our string. Wait, the string starts with t6, t9, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT18's productions. Looking back at the rules, NT18 has two options: \u2192 't10' and \u2192 't0'. Since the string uses t10 and t9, maybe I should choose 't10' for NT18. Alternatively, maybe that's incorrect. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, when generating the string, each step should consume a part of the string. Let me try another approach. Maybe it's better to model this as an expansion step, processing the string character by character.\n\nLet's think of the parser as processing the string from left to right, replacing non-terminals with their expansions until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's NT17 NT59. The string starts with t6, so I have to derive t6 first. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t6.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4' (wait, looking through the rules, I see NT2 has `t0`, `t6`, `t4`\u2014so NT2 can produce t6. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 `t0`, `t5`, `t10`. NT59 \u2192 `t18`, `t12`, `t57`, etc. Wait, in the initial rule, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Let me try to see how NT17 and NT59 can produce the needed t6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's list the productions for each NT and see which ones can generate t6.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT2: t0, t6, t4\n- NT17: NT37 NT54 \u2192 t3 t10? Wait, but earlier when I looked at NT17\u2192 NT37 NT54, I got NT37\u2192 NT49 NT18 \u2192 t3 t0, but in the string, we have t10 before t7. Hmm, maybe I need to find a path where t6 is a resulting terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nI need the first terminal to be t6, so let's see where t6 can come from. Possible options are:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT59 has options: NT57, NT24, NT... Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t6:\n\nNT2 produces t6, t0, t4.\n\nNT24 produces t0, t5, t10.\n\nWait, looking again, the rules:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44 \u2192 t3 t2 (from NT13\u2192t3 and NT44\u2192t2)\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT0, NT25, NT5\n\nWait, but looking at the production for NT24: NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10'.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, let's see which NTs can produce t6.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 not present.\n- NT2 \u2192 t0, t6, t4 \u2192 yes, NT2 can produce t6.\n- NT4 \u2192 t5.\n- NT5 \u2192 t5, t3, t10, etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 \u2192 which we saw earlier leads to t3 and t10.\n\nSo, to get t6 as the first symbol, we need either NT2 or perhaps another NT that eventually expands to t6. Wait, but from S, we get NT17 and NT59. Let me see where t6 comes from.\n\nSo, starting with NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18 \u2192 which are both non-terminals until further expansion.\n\nWait, but this seems to be leading to t3 and t10, which may not be what we want. Alternatively, maybe there's a longer path. Let me check if there's another path for NT17 or NT59 that could lead to t6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT59 can produce t6 via some expansion. Let's see NT59's rules:\n\nLooking for NT59's productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT59 appears multiple times:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- Wait, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT59:\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nWait, that depends on what NT12 and NT16 produce.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nWe need the first terminal to be t6, so the leftmost symbol in the target string is t6. So, either NT17 or NT59 must expand to produce t6 at the top level. Since S is divided into NT17 and NT59, I think the leftmost non-terminal (NT17) will generate the leftmost part of the string, which is t6, and then NT59 will generate the rest starting from t9.\n\nSo let's focus on NT17 first.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNow, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT49 can produce 't3' or 't7' or 't9'? Let's check:\n\nLooking for NT49:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'?\n\nWait, the grammar rules for NT49:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' (Yes, as per line: NT49 -> 't3').\n- NT49 \u2192 't7' (Another rule: NT49 -> 't7').\n- Also, NT49 \u2192 't9'? No, I don't see that. Wait, the rule is NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT1, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't6'\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT54 \u2192 't5' (from line: NT54 -> 't2'?

Hmm, Chomsky normal form is a specific way that the grammar is structured, right? Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are a bunch of non-terminals (like NT0, NT12, etc.) and some terminals like t0, t1, etc. The string given consists of these terminals: t1, t7, t3, t0, t7, t11, t0.\n\nFirst, I should see how the string breaks down. It's a sequence of separate terminals, each probably corresponding to a single step in the derivation. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a single terminal. So, each terminal in the string must be the result of a production that directly outputs it, and the non-terminals must combine step by step.\n\nI need to find a way to break down the string into the grammar's productions. Let's list the terminals:\n\nt1, t7, t3, t0, t7, t11, t0.\n\nWait, the order is important. So the string is a sequence of t1, then t7, then t3, and so on.\n\nFirst, I think about the start symbol S. The start production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So S first produces NT17 and NT59. So the string must start with NT17 and NT59, each producing some terminal sequence. Let's see.\n\nLet's process NT17 first. Looking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, which then can be broken down further.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, which can be further broken down.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' and 't11' because there are two productions: NT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't11'. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, there are duplicate productions. For example, NT49 has two productions: one to 't3' and another to 't11'. So NT49 can be either 't3' or 't11'. Similarly, for other non-terminals.\n\nSo for NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10'? Wait, looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT18? Let me check: NT18 \u2192 't0' is one production, but also NT18 \u2192 't0'? Wait, in the given grammar, under NT18, there's \"NT18 -> 't0'\", so that's a terminal. So NT18 can only produce 't0'.\n\nWait, but wait, in the grammar, NT18 is only producing 't0' once, no? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT18 -> 't0'\n\nAnd are there any other productions for NT18? It seems there is only one, so NT18 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo going back, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, which is 't0' because NT18 is 't0'.\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 NT49 't0'.\n\nNT49 has two options: either 't3' or 't11'.\n\nSo from NT17, we get:\n\nIf NT49 \u2192 't3', then the sequence for NT17 would be 't3' followed by NT54's sequence.\n\nIf NT49 \u2192 't11', then it's 't11' followed by NT54's sequence.\n\nSo let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, assuming NT49 \u2192 't3':\nThen NT17 becomes 't3' followed by NT54.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT15 NT56.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56.\n\nWait: Wait, looking at NT15, is it correct?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56.\n\nAnd NT56 \u2192 NT5.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, under NT55, it's NT25 NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the productions for each non-terminal step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing all the productions for each non-terminal to clarify.\n\nLooking at the grammar, here's a summary:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12 | 't6' | 't0' | 't5' (Wait, actually, the productions for each NT0 are more than two, but I need to look again.)\n\nWait, no. The grammar isn't written with multiple entries for each non-terminal. Let me list each non-terminal's productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n- NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 | 't3' | 't11' (Wait, no; looking again, for NT59, the productions are: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 is listed, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, actually, the grammar is a list of lines, each starting with a non-terminal, followed by its productions. So for each line:\n\nLooking again, each line is a production.

So the string length is 8, which means we'll be considering all possible pairs (i,j) where i and j range from 0 to 7 (since string indices start at 0). \n\nI'll start by initializing the table. Each token is checked against the right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions to see if the current token (which is a terminal) is part of any production. If a production has a RHS that contains a single terminal matching the token, then the corresponding non-terminal can be placed in the table for that position.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- t9 appears in NT37 \u2192 t9 followed by other symbols?\nWait, in the grammar, NT37 has a production NT37 \u2192 t9 t10, but I need to check if any production directly has t9. Let me look through the rules:\n\nLooking at the production NT37 \u2192 t9 t10. So the RHS is two terminals. Similarly, t6 appears in NT59 \u2192 t6 (from NT59 -> NT18 NT36, and NT59 \u2192 t6). Or wait, no: in the rules, NT59 has two productions: one is NT59 -> NT12 NT16, and another is NT59 -> t6. So that means NT59 can produce t6 directly. Similarly, t3 is in NT49 \u2192 t3, and others like t11 is in NT24 \u2192 t10, wait no, looking again:\n\nWait, let me list the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t6\n- NT37 \u2192 t9 t10\n- NT57 \u2192 t7 t14? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the rules where the RHS includes a terminal:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT59 -> t6 (since it has NT59 -> NT18 NT36, but another production is NT59 \u2192 t6)\nWait, no: in the grammar, the rule for NT59 is:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the rules as:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT59 \u2192 t6? Or another production?\n\nWait, no, I think I may have misread. Let me re-express the rules clearly:\n\nThe user provided the rules as:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 \u2192 't6'  [Wait, does this rule have a single terminal? Wait, no: it's written as NT59 \u2192 t6, I think. Wait no: looking at the provided rules:\n\nWait, in the user's input, the rules are written with the right-hand sides, sometimes including 'a' or combinations.\n\nLooking more carefully, for NT59 there are two productions:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nand\n\nNT59 -> t6\n\nSimilarly, NT37 is defined as:\n\nNT37 -> t9 t10\n\nWait, no, in the rules provided:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't6' ?\n\nWait, the user wrote the rules as:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nNT59 -> t6\n\nWait, no, in the provided list, the user wrote the rules as:\n\nNT55 -> t8\n\nNT44 -> t0\n\n...\n\nWait, the rules are as follows:\n\nLooking back, the user's grammar points:\n\nThe grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36 ?

{"custom_id":"request-138","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I need to determine if the string `t9 t9 t7 t9 t4 t4 t7 t11` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, I'll start by understanding the grammar and the string properly.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t followed by numbers). Since it's in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This simplifies things because each step in the derivation only replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, so I need to see if S can derive the given string. Let's look at the start symbol: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string must start with the symbols derived from NT17 and NT59. The given string starts with `t9 t9 ...`, so let's see what NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 and NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. So, S becomes NT37 NT54 NT12 NT16. Now, let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So replacing NT37 gives NT49 NT18. NT18 \u2192 t0. So NT37 becomes t0.\n\nNext, NT54 \u2192 NT17 NT0. But NT17 is the same as before. Wait, so this could create a loop, but maybe there's another way. Let's check other productions for NT54.\n\nLooking at NT54, in the grammar, do we have any other productions? Oh, I see NT54 \u2192 NT44 NT54. Wait, that's a repeating cycle. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree starting from the string and seeing if I can match it to the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t9 t9 t7 t9 t4 t4 t7 t11`. Let's list them as positions 0 to 7.\n\nLet me think about how the string can be broken down. Since the grammar uses only binary productions (each step replaces a non-terminal with two), the string length must be a power of 2. Here, the string has 8 tokens, which is 2^3, so it's possible. Each level of the parse tree splits into two, so starting from 8, we have 4, then 2, then 1 symbol.\n\nBut let's consider the possible trees step by step.\n\nStarting from the top (S), the first split is into NT17 and NT59. Let's handle each part separately.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Then NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. So S \u2192 NT37 NT54 NT12 NT16.\n\nNow, let's process these four non-terminals. Let's see if we can split them further.\n\nFirst, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So NT37 \u2192 NT49 (which could be further split) and NT18 \u2192 t0. So the first two parts, NT37 and NT54, can split further.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of that, let me try to build the parse tree in reverse. Let's see if the string can be generated starting from the root.\n\nLet me consider each production involving NT59, as the string starts with `t9 t9` which could come from NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, but NT12 and NT16 both can produce t11 and t5, but in the string, it's `t9 t9`, so perhaps not directly.\n\nAlternatively, NT59 has other productions. Looking at the grammar, NT59 can also go to NT24 NT10. Wait, no, looking back, the user provided the grammar, and in the initial list, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, and later I see NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 again, but wait maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, there are multiple entries for some non-terminals. For example, NT59 appears twice: once as \u2192 NT12 NT16 and once as \u2192 NT57 NT24. Wait, let me verify the grammar entries provided.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59  \nNT0 -> NT55 NT12  \nNT41 -> NT16 NT17  \nNT55 -> NT25 NT0  \nNT12 -> NT5 NT43  \nNT16 -> NT55 NT32  \nNT57 -> NT8 NT41  \nNT59 -> NT18 NT36  \nWait, no, wait the initial lists were all jumbled. Wait, in the initial grammar, perhaps it's better to list all the productions.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59  \nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12  \nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17  \nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0  \nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43  \nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32  \nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41  \nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36  \nWait, but no, actually in the user's message, the grammar lines are like:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59  \nNT0 -> NT55 NT12  \nNT41 -> NT16 NT17  \nNT55 -> NT25 NT0  \nNT12 -> NT5 NT43  \nNT16 -> NT55 NT32  \nNT57 -> NT8 NT41  \nNT59 -> NT18 NT36  \nNT25 -> NT13 NT44  \nNT32 -> NT2 NT36  \nNT37 -> NT49 NT18  \nNT15 -> NT16 NT56  \nNT17 -> NT37 NT54  \nNT43 -> NT5 NT15  \nNT59 -> NT12 NT16  \nNT59 -> NT57 NT24  \nNT41 -> 't6'  \nNT49 -> 't3'  \nNT24 -> 't10'  \nNT49 -> 't11'  \nNT8 -> 't10'  \nNT36 -> 't2'  \nNT15 -> 't0'  \nNT16 -> 't5'  \nNT2 -> 't0'  \nNT2 -> 't6'  \nNT2 -> 't4'  \nNT24 -> 't0'  \nNT18 -> 't0'  \nNT24 -> 't5'  \nNT17 -> 't4'  \nNT12 -> 't11'  \nNT0 -> 't6'  \nNT5 -> 't5'  \nNT25 -> 't7'  \nNT5 -> 't3'  \nNT5 -> 't10'  \nNT36 -> 't6'  \nNT55 -> 't8'  \nNT44 -> 't0'  \nNT25 -> 't2'  \nNT57 -> 't7'  \nNT0 \u2192 't1'  \nWait, actually, the grammar includes some terminals, which are the 't' with numbers, like 't6', 't0', etc.\n\nSo, in total, some of the non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54  \nNT54 \u2192 NT44 NT54 \u2192 but wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT54 is not directly defined. Wait, looking for NT54, in the grammar, perhaps I missed that. Wait, the initial list says:\n\nNT17: NT37 NT54  \nNT59: NT18 NT36  \nNT41: NT16 NT17  \nNT55: NT25 NT0  \nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the productions properly.\n\nBut in any case, given that some non-terminals directly produce terminals (e.g., NT55 \u2192 t8, NT17 \u2192 t4), I can use these as leaves in the parse tree.\n\nBut first, I'll try to see the structure of the string. The string is 8 tokens. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce four tokens by splitting into two parts, each of which can produce two tokens.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down step by step through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal and another non-terminal, e.g., NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32, but those produce more non-terminals. So, the string has to come from the combination of these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has some pattern that can be traced back through the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t9 t9 t7 t9 t4 t4 t7 t11.\n\nLet's consider the first two tokens, t9 t9.

{"custom_id":"request-153","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t4 t8 t2 t4 t0 t11 t4 t10 t7`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S step by step until I get all terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT17 NT59. So, the string starts with `t4 t8...`, which must correspond to the first two symbols derived from NT17 and NT59.\n\nI think I should approach this by starting from the start symbol and trying to match the string step by step. Let's see:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the first step is to expand NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, the first symbol would be derived from NT37, which then must produce t7 (since NT37 \u2192 t7), and NT54 must produce t6 (since NT54 \u2192 t6). Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t4. That doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the first step is wrong. Let me check the start symbol again. S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then NT17's expansion. So, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, the left part is NT37 and the right is NT54.\n\nLet me check NT37: NT37 \u2192 t9. But our string starts with t4, which is different. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe S's first production isn't the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in NT17's production. Let me check the grammar again. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and NT37 \u2192 t9, which doesn't match t4. So, maybe the initial expansion is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than expected. Let me count the tokens: `t4 t8 t2 t4 t0 t11 t4 t10 t7` is 9 tokens. Each step should produce a number of symbols equal to the depth. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step can produce either two symbols (if it's a non-terminal) or stop if it's a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, and terminals are the base case. So starting from S, we have two symbols: NT17 and NT59. Each non-terminal may produce two non-terminals, so the number of tokens grows exponentially.\n\nBut in our case, the string is only 9 tokens. That's a bit confusing because 2^n where n is the number of steps might not match 9. Hmm, maybe it's possible to have some levels of expansion deeper than others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by a series of expansions that interleave the productions.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe each production step adds a symbol. Wait, but in CNF, each production step can only add one symbol at a time, either by splitting a non-terminal into two or stopping. Hmm, maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built by a bottom-up approach, starting from the terminals and working back to S. That might be more manageable.\n\nLooking at the string `t4 t8 t2 t4 t0 t11 t4 t10 t7`, each token must correspond to a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet me see if I can match the string by working backwards. The last token is t7.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to comply with CNF because all the rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, so I need to see if I can derive the string starting from S.

So the initial step is to have NT17 and NT59. The string starts with t8, which suggests that NT59 might generate t8 somewhere. Looking at the productions for NT59: there are two options. One is NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, so if NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, since one of the options is NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, but wait, looking back, I see that NT59 has two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. So when expanding S, we pick one of the NT59 productions. Let's pick NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSo from S, we have NT17 and NT59. Let's focus on NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Now, NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41. So NT57 can produce 't8' and NT41. Therefore, the string starts with 't8', which matches the first t8. Now, the remaining part of NT59 is NT24, which can produce 't10' or 't11' or if it's another non-terminal? Looking back, NT24's productions are NT24 \u2192 't0' or 't5' or 't10' or 't11' or 't6'. Wait, actually, earlier I might have misread. Let me look again: NT24 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't11', or 't6'? Wait, the grammar has NT24 \u2192 't0' (twice), 't5', 't10', 't11', and also NT24 \u2192 't0' again? Maybe it's different.

Let me try to see if there are any obvious paths to the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a lot of 't's with numbers. The terminals include 't10', 't2', 't11', 't8', 't1', 't4', 't5'. I need to trace these back to the start symbol, which is S.\n\nStarting with S, the production is S -> NT17 NT59. So S is split into NT17 and NT59. Both of these are non-terminals, so I need to find their productions.\n\nNT17: Looking at the rules, NT17 can go to NT37 NT54 or NT55 or NT44 or others that don't seem relevant.

For example, 't10' seems to be a terminal. Let me check where it appears in the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT36 can produce 't10' via NT36 -> 't10' and NT55 -> 't8' via NT55->'t8' (No, wait, NT55 is a non-terminal.

Because in the list, other lines don't show more NT59 rules. So NT59 can only produce NT12 and NT16?\n\nWait, no. Let me look more carefully.

{"custom_id":"request-179","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t2 t4 t7 t0 t10 t5 t7 t5 t4 t9`, and the grammar is a bunch of production rules. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule on the left side generating exactly two non-terminals on the right side, or a single terminal. Given that, the grammar is structured such that each non-terminal (NT) produces two non-terminals except for the terminals directly. The string to evaluate consists entirely of terminals, which suggests that the derivation would involve expanding the start symbol (S) all the way down to these terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S -> NT17 NT59. So the string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT17 and NT59. Since the string has 10 terms, we can check if the total number of symbols matches. Each initial production splits into two, so for a string of length n, the number of steps would be log2(n+1). Wait, but in this case, starting from S which is two symbols, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the number of symbols increases by one each step. So for the string length to be 10, the number of steps would be 9. Let me count:\n\nStarting with S (2 symbols). Each production step replaces a non-terminal with two, so each step increases the count by 1. Wait, no, each production of a non-terminal replaces one symbol with two, so the total count goes up by one each time a production is applied. So the number of symbols in the string can be seen as the number of leaves in the parse tree. So a string of length n would require a parse tree with height log2(n + 1), assuming S is the root.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, since each step can involve any non-terminal, the number of ways to derive a string of length 10 could be complex, but perhaps it's manageable manually.\n\nThe given string is t2 t4 t7 t0 t10 t5 t7 t5 t4 t9. Let's note that the string is 10 elements long. So the derivation from S (which is two symbols) would need to produce 10, meaning we have a binary tree with 10 leaves. Let's see if the structure of the grammar allows for such a string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (NT) either splits into two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is made up entirely of terminals, so every step in the derivation must involve splitting non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nThe approach is to see if the string can be obtained by starting from S and performing productions that expand into the given terminals in order.\n\nLet's start by considering the start symbol S, which is NT17 NT59. So the string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59. Since the string is 10 elements, and S is split into two parts, we can think that the first part (NT17) contributes some part of the string, and the second part (NT59) contributes the other.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT59:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\n...\nWait, but in the given grammar, looking at NT59: in the provided rules, I see multiple NT59 entries, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nOh, I realize the grammar is listed with multiple entries for some non-terminals, like NT59 appears more than once, which suggests that the rules might be overlapping. So I need to correctly parse each production.\n\nLet me structure the grammar correctly by lines:\n\n1. S -> NT17 NT59\n2. NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n3. NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n4. NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n5.

NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n15. NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n16. NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n17. NT41 -> 't6' (Wait, is this correct? NT41 is a non-terminal on the left, but rule 17 says NT41 -> 't6'? That can't be right because in CNF, left side is a single non-terminal, right side must be two symbols. So maybe this is a typo, perhaps it's NT24 or another NT. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be NT24 or another NT.)\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the user provided a list of lines that may be part of the grammar. Let me parse them correctly, but the way it's written is a bit unclear. It seems like the user tried to format the grammar but may have messed up the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single list of production rules where each line is an NT on the left and the right side is other symbols.\n\nBut the way it's presented is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each line is a production rule, with the left side being a single NT followed by its productions.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the user wrote:\n\nHere is the context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.\n\nGrammar: ```S -> NT17 NT59\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't11'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't0'\nNT37 -> 't9'\nNT36 -> 't0'\nNT44 -> 't2'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't3'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT43 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't9'\nNT37 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't9'\nNT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, this seems messy.

{"custom_id":"request-193","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t0 to t59 and other symbols). The string to evaluate is \"t8 t4 t10 t9 t3 t2 t8 t9 t3 t0 t4\". I need to figure out step by step whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar provided follows this structure, so it's in CNF.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is given as S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, for S to produce the string, it must expand into NT17 and NT59, each of which will then expand further until only terminals are left.\n\nI'll start by looking at the production rules for the non-terminals involved in the string. Let's parse the string token by token and see if each step can be obtained from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's write down the string again for clarity: t8 t4 t10 t9 t3 t2 t8 t9 t3 t0 t4.\n\nI'll consider each word in the string and see how it could be derived from the grammar.\n\n1. The first symbol is t8. Looking at the production rules, NT59 can produce t8. Specifically, NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, and NT36 \u2192 t2, and NT18 \u2192 t8. So, NT59 can be used to generate t8.\n\nSo, NT59 \u2192 t8: This becomes the first step.\n\n2. Next, t4. Let's see where t4 comes from. Looking at the productions for t4, I don't see any NT non-terminals that directly produce t4. Wait, perhaps I need to combine the earlier steps with later ones.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider that each symbol in the string must come from some production, and each production should only generate one symbol at a time, since it's CNF. So each step in the parsing would involve breaking down a non-terminal into two symbols (non-terminals or terminals), and so on until all are terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree bottom-up, starting from the string and seeing if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a more manageable approach is to perform a recursive descent parsing, building the derivation step by step. Let's consider:\n\nThe entire string is a single S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, that means the string must be a concatenation of the leftmost symbol from NT17 and the leftmost symbol from NT59. Wait, but actually, in a standard top-down parser, the entire string must be a single left derivation.\n\nWait, no, because CNF allows for productions to be applied in any order, so the string is just the concatenation of the results of each non-terminal's expansion.\n\nSo, the entire string is [NT17's expansion] followed by [NT59's expansion]. Let's first look at NT59, since the first t8 comes from NT59.\n\nLooking at NT59's production: From the rules, NT59 can produce NT18 NT36, NT57 NT24, or NT59 can also produce t0 to t3? Wait, checking the rules: No, looking back, the NT59 production is:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, no, in the user's initial prompt, I might have misread. Let me check again:\n\nThe productions are as written by the user, so let's list them correctly:\n\nFrom the user's grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n       NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n       Because in the initial description, the user wrote:\n\n\"Here is the string you need to evaluate:\n\nString: `t8 t4 t10 t9 t3 t2 t8 t9 t3 t0 t4`.\n\n... The grammar lines include:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\"\n\nWait, yes, the user's grammar has:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, NT59 can produce two possible sequences: [NT18, NT36] or [NT57, NT24].\n\nFrom the string, the first symbol is t8, which comes from NT18 \u2192 t8. So, if NT59 chooses NT18\u2192t8 and NT36\u2192..., then let's see.\n\nWait, no. If NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, then the first part would be NT18's expansion and the second part NT36's.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t8, which is produced by NT18, which then requires the next symbol(s) to be the expansion of NT36. But wait, NT36 is a production that may have to be broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this step by step.\n\nLet's start with NT59 producing t8 followed by whatever NT36 produces.\n\nWait, but wait: NT59 can expand to NT18 NT36. Then, each of these would be expanded as per their own productions.\n\nSo, NT18 \u2192 t8 (since NT18 \u2192 t8), and NT36 \u2192 t2.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t8, and the next is t4, which doesn't match t2.\n\nWait, this suggests that the first option for NT59 (i.e., NT18 NT36) would produce t8 followed by t2, but the next symbol in the string is t4, which doesn't fit. So this path is invalid.\n\nThus, we need to consider the other option for NT59, which is NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Then, NT57 and NT24 would produce their expansions, each of which may consist of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet's explore NT57 first.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41.\n\nSo, NT57 expands into NT8 followed by NT41.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t8 (from NT8 \u2192 t8). So, the first symbol is t8, which matches.\n\nNow, the next symbol in the string is t4. So let's look at NT41.\n\nNT41's production is NT16 NT17. So, NT41 expands to NT16 and NT17, which each need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT16: NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nWait, let me list the rules again for clarity.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17.\n\nSo, for NT41, expanding to NT16 and NT17, each of these then needs to expand.\n\nLet's take NT16 first.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT0 NT2.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me try to find possible terminals and see if they match the string.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to work backwards from the string, ensuring that each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the entire expansion step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for any possible way to split the string into parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string's length can give an indication. The string has 11 symbols, and each non-terminal in the grammar can expand into two symbols, so with S being the start symbol, which expands into NT17 and NT59, each of which would then expand into their own terms. The total number of terminal symbols generated is 11, so the number of non-terminal nodes must have expanded in such a way that they have split enough times to reach 11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more methodical approach is needed.\n\nWait, let's first understand each non-terminal's possible expansions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nTherefore, the string must be equal to the concatenation of the expansion of NT17 and the expansion of NT59.\n\nSo, we can split the given string into two parts, each part corresponding to the expansions of NT17 and NT59, respectively.\n\nWe can attempt to partition the string into two substrings such that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar starts with a start symbol, which I think is S here. So S is the root of the derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, S is defined as NT17 NT59, which are both non-terminals. So the start point is S, which transitions into NT17 and NT59. Both of these are non-terminals, so we'll need to expand each of them step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t3, t2, t6, t2, t9, t6, t7, t1, t10, t9, t6. So, the goal is to see if there's a derivation starting from S that can produce this exact sequence of terminals without any non-terminals left.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, specifically something like the CYK algorithm, because it's efficient for context-free grammars and can determine whether a string is in the language. However, I'm not too familiar with the inner workings of CYK, so maybe a better approach is to manually try to expand the grammar step by step and see if I can get the given string.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the leaves can produce the given string. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So we have to expand NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT17 can be derived from NT37 NT54 or directly to t4. Wait, no, looking back: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and NT54 \u2192 t9 or NT54 \u2192 t6? Wait, actually, checking the productions:\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, NT17 is a non-terminal that can only be split into NT37 and NT54. So the immediate children of NT17 are these two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 has multiple productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36. But looking closer, I think in the provided grammar, NT59 can be directly converted into t3 and t6 based on the productions.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT59:\n\nIt has three productions:\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nBut none of these directly produce terminals, except perhaps looking more carefully.\n\nWait, I might be missing something. Let me check the productions again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nAnd the productions for NT18 is NT44 NT18, which seems off because it's a loop. Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait, actually, the productions for NT18 are:\n\nLooking up the given grammar:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT44 NT18? Or maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nNo, the grammar provided lists each production for each node.

Let me check again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, looking for NT18:\n\nAh, here it is: NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT18? Wait, no, in the list, I saw:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nWait, the grammar as given is a list.

But I'll take it step by step. Let me see... I need to determine if the given string is generated by the grammar provided. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has rules where each production is non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are the leaves. So, each production is simple, making it easier to apply certain parsing techniques, like CYK parsing. But since this is just a single string, maybe a top-down approach or recursive descent could work. \n\nThe string to check is `t2 t2 t10 t9 t8 t7 t2 t9 t6 t0 t2 t9`. That's a sequence of 12 tokens. I'll list them out: [t2, t2, t10, t9, t8, t7, t2, t9, t6, t0, t2, t9].\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So the first step is to see how S can generate the string. Let's see if the first two tokens can be matched from NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17: the rules for NT17 are `NT17 -> NT37 NT54`. So after S, it branches into NT37 and NT54. So the string starts with `t2 t2`, but the first part is NT17, which is broken down into NT37 and NT54. Let me see what each of those produce.\n\nNT37: The production for NT37 is `NT37 -> NT49 NT18`. So NT37 splits into NT49 and NT18. NT49 has two productions: `NT49 -> 't3'` and `NT49 -> 't11'` and `NT49 -> 't10'` (wait, looking back, I see NT49 has `NT49 -> 't3'`, `NT49 -> 't11'`, and `NT49 -> 't10'`). Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT49 is `NT49 -> 't3'`, and maybe I'm missing others. Wait no, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT49: I see `NT49 -> 't7'`, `NT49 -> 't10'`, but actually, looking at the user's message, the production for NT49 is:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nWait, under NT49, the production is given as NT49 -> 't7', and another rule? No, wait, in the user's message, the production for NT49 is `NT49 -> 't7'` and `NT49 -> 't10'`. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT49 -> 't10'\nWait, is that correct? Hmm, maybe I'm misreading. Wait, under NT49: \n\nThe user wrote:\n\"NT49 -> 't3'\"\n\"NT49 -> 't7'\"\n\"NT49 -> 't10'\"\n\nWait, no, in the user's data, it's:\n\nIn the input, the grammar has under NT49:\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT49 -> 't10'\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't11'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\n\nWait, that's from the user's input. So for NT49, the rules are:\n\nNT49 -> 't7' (literal)\nNT49 -> 't10' (literal)\nWait, but in the initial list, is there a rule where NT49 splits into NT7 and NT10? No, I think the user only provided the rules and the terminal replacements. So in the grammar, each terminal is assigned to a production, so NT49 can produce 't7' or 't10'.\n\nWait, but looking back:\n\nIn the given grammar, for NT49, the productions are:\n\nNT49 -> 't3' (from NT37's production)\nWait, no, let me clarify. The user's grammar is:\n\nLooking at each line, the non-terminals on the left, and their productions on the right. So for example:\n\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT49 -> 't10'\nAnd others.\n\nWait, so NT49 can produce 't7', 't10', and perhaps others if they are mentioned, but in this case, NT49 has two productions: NT49 -> 't7' and NT49 -> 't10'. Wait no, in the user's data, under NT49, the productions are just 't7' and 't10'. So when NT49 is a non-terminal, it can only produce one of those two literals. So, for example, if I have to produce a string that includes 't10', I can use NT49 -> 't10'.\n\nBut looking back at the string: the first part is t2, t2, t10, etc. So when I start parsing, the first rule is S -> NT17 NT59. So each of these, NT17 and NT59, must produce parts of the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\n1. S must produce NT17 and NT59. So the first two symbols in the string must be the outputs of NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 -> NT37 NT54. So NT17 splits into NT37 and NT54.\n\n2. So the first token must be from NT37, followed by the output of NT54.\n\nLooking at the string: first token is t2. So t2 must come from NT37.\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18. So NT37 splits into NT49 and NT18.\n\n3. The next token is t2. Let's see, the output of NT49 is either 't7' or 't10' as per the grammar. So wait, in the string, the first token is t2, but NT49 can produce t7 or t10. That doesn't match t2. That's a problem because we can't get t2 from NT49.\n\nWait, so this suggests that the initial assumption might be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back: Did I misread the grammar? Let me check NT49's productions. From the user's input, the NT49 productions are:\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT49 -> 't10'\n\nSo yes, only 't7' or 't10'. The string's first token is t2, which isn't produced by NT49.\n\nThis indicates that either the string cannot be generated by this grammar, or perhaps I made a wrong step in the parsing. Alternatively, maybe the first step is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe the string is too short. Wait, no, the string is 12 tokens long.

Looking at the given grammar, it all seems to fit into CNF since each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string has 12 tokens, so the derivation must result in exactly these 12 symbols. Since the grammar uses two non-terminals per production, the derivation depth would be log2(12) \u2245 3.58, but I'll need to trace each step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first production is NT17 NT59. So S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step would split S into NT17 and NT59. Now, in the string, the first token is t6.

{"custom_id":"request-238","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string provided is `t0 t3 t7 t5 t6 t8 t3 t4 t6 t3 t9 t4 t11`, and the grammar is a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all productions should fit that. Looking at the given grammar, most are two non-terminals except for a few that have a terminal, like NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, which is fine because that's A \u2192 BC. However, I need to ensure that all the non-terminals eventually derive terminals, and the starting symbol is S, which in this case seems to be S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, there are productions for NT41 where it's split into NT16 NT17, and another where it's just NT41 \u2192 't4'. Wait, no, looking back, I see that for NT41, one of the productions is NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17, and another where it's NT41 \u2192 't4'? Or did I miss something? Wait, in the grammar, it's written as NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17 and another line says NT41 -> 't4'. Hmm, that's conflicting because if NT41 can produce a terminal, that's fine, but if we have both NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17 and NT41 \u2192 't4', that's allowed because it's two different production rules. So as long as it's in CNF, it's okay.\n\nWait, but looking at other non-terminals, some have multiple terminal options. For example, NT59 appears in two places: once as NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 and another as NT59 -> 't16'. So that's okay because NT59 can produce either a two-part non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is `t0 t3 t7 t5 t6 t8 t3 t4 t6 t3 t9 t4 t11`. So let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the starting symbol is S, which is NT17 NT59. So S is a production of two parts: NT17 and NT59. Let's see where NT17 and NT59 can derive to.\n\nLooking at NT17: its production is NT37 NT54. So it's splitting into two non-terminals. NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, and NT54 \u2192 NT54? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT54 has production NT54 \u2192 NT17 NT6, but I think I'm mixing things up. Let me find NT54. Wait, in the grammar, I see lines like NT54 -> 't6', but also NT54 \u2192 NT54? No, no, looking again, I see NT5 -> 't5', NT25 -> 't7', etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to build a tree from the string and see if it can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, building a parse tree.\n\nSo the string is t0 t3 t7 t5 t6 t8 t3 t4 t6 t3 t9 t4 t11.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t0, which is a terminal. Let's look at the grammar to find which non-terminals can derive to t0.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't0', NT2 \u2192 't0', NT12 \u2192 't0', NT17 \u2192 't0' (I think?), wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at NT17: its production is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. And NT37's production is NT49 NT18. NT49 has production 't3' and 't11' (from the grammar: NT49 -> 't3', NT49 -> 't11'). And NT18's production is NT44 NT6. NT44 is a terminal 't2' and 't4', according to NT44 \u2192 't2', NT44 \u2192 't4'. Wait, no, looking at NT44, it's \"NT44->'t2' NT0\", wait no, wait:\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT44 I see: NT44 -> 't4' (line says NT44 -> 't4'). Wait, no, let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT45 is not present, but looking for NT44: NT44 -> 't4'\n- There's NT18 \u2192 NT44 NT6, but NT18 has production NT18 -> 't0'? Or wait, no. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list some NT productions:\n\nNT5: 't5' (line: NT5 -> 't5')\nNT25 -> 't7' (line: NT25 -> 't7')\nNT24 -> 't0' (line: NT24 -> 't0')\nNT18 -> 't0' (line: NT18 -> 't0')\nNT54 -> 't6' (line: NT54 -> 't6')\nNT5 -> 't9' (line: NT5 -> 't9')\nNT56->'t5' (line: NT56 -> 't5')\n\nWait, I think I might have a list of each NT and their productions, but perhaps I should create a mapping of non-terminals to their productions.\n\nBut perhaps an easier approach is to work backwards from the terminals in the string and see if they can be derived from non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nSo starting with t0:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can produce 't0'.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, NT17 is only ever broken into NT37 NT54, so it can't produce 't0'. So in the starting symbol S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the first symbol is NT17, which must derive into a string that can start with ... Hmm, but the input starts with t0, which must come from either NT15, NT2, NT12, NT17?\n\nWait, but looking at NT2: in the grammar, NT2 is defined as NT2 \u2192 't0', NT2 \u2192 't6', and NT2 \u2192 't4'. So NT2 can produce t0, t6, or t4.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 has a production \u2192 't0' because looking back: NT12 has production \u2192 't11'? Wait, no, in the grammar, I think NT12 is defined as NT12 \u2192 't1' (maybe?), no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT12: it's written as NT12 -> NT5 NT43, NT12 -> 't11'. So NT12 can produce 't11', but where does t1 come into play? Wait, no, looking at the production: NT12's production is split into NT5 and NT43, and also directly into 't11'. So it can produce t11.\n\nBut in our case, the starting string starts with t0, which would have to come from a production that produces t0.\n\nSo perhaps looking for NTs that can produce t0.\n\nChecking NT15: NT15 only has production NT15 \u2192 't0' (so yes, can produce t0)\n\nNT2: as above, can produce t0\n\nWait, perhaps the starting non-terms produce t0 first.\n\nBut in the starting S, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string starts with t0, but NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So t0 is part of the string, but the start S is about NT17 and NT59, which derive later.\n\nSo perhaps the string is a result of the derivations from S into a sequence of terminals, so the first 't0' could come from a non-terminal that can produce 't0'.\n\nBut wait, the S symbol is split into two non-terminals, NT17 and NT59.

All production rules in CNF are binary, so each non-terminal should expand to two symbols. I notice that some rules have terminals on the right-hand side, which is fine since in CNF, the right-hand side can be either a terminal or a non-terminal, as long as there's only two symbols total.\n\nThe target string is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if there's a way to derive this string from the start symbol S using the productions given.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t8`. Let me check where `t8` comes from. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT57 has a production `NT57 -> NT8 NT41`. Wait, but in the right-hand side, NT8 is a non-terminal, and NT41 is another non-terminal. Then, NT8 has a production that directly goes to `t10` and NT41 is another non-terminal. Hmm, but in the string, the second symbol is `t7`, so maybe I need a different production for t7.\n\nWait, let me find all the productions that produce `t8` or other terminal symbols. Let's look at the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 also has another rule: NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT59 also has NT57 and NT24 producing 't's.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree or apply some reduction strategy like Earley's algorithm, but that might be too complex. Alternatively, I can attempt to see if each step of the string can be matched according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is t8 t7 t9 t0 t6 t4 t0 t4 t9 t6 t4 t5 t3 t1.\n\nLet me break it down step by step:\n\n1. t8: Looking at NT57's production, `NT57 -> NT8 NT41`. So NT57 can produce 't8' and NT41.\n\nBut NT57 is a non-terminal, so let's see where NT8 is defined. NT8 -> 't10' or 't3' or another NT? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n\nSo NT8 directly produces t10. But the string starts with t8, so that can't be NT8. Unless there's another rule where NT5 produces t8. Wait, wait. I should check all the rules for t8.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 also has NT57 NT24.\nBut in the list, NT57's production is NT8 NT41, which is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking for t8, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT5 appears in some rules, but specifically, NT25 -> NT13 NT44, NT55->NT25 NT0, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT25 -> 't7' and also NT25 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the rules:\n\nNT25's rules are:\n\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- Also, looking at later entries, I see:\n\nNT25 has two rules: one that produces NT13, then NT44, and another NT25 -> 't8'? Wait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as a list of lines. Let me count each production.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT25's production is:\n\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- Also, is there another rule? Let me scan the list again.\n\nYes, under NT25:\n\n- `NT25 -> NT13 NT44`\n- `NT25 -> 't8'`\n- `NT25 -> 't7'`\n\nWait, actually, I see that NT25 has two productions with terminals: it can go to 't8' and 't7'. No, wait, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nStarting from:\n- `NT25 -> NT13 NT44`\n- Then later:\n- `NT25 -> 't8'`\n- `NT25 -> 't7'`\n\nWait, that can't be right because a single non-terminal can't have multiple terminal productions in a single rule. Each production is a separate alternative.

It appears that NT25 can produce 't8' and 't7'. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the lines after `NT25 -> NT13 NT44`, the next NT25 rule is:\n\n- NT25 -> 't8' (Wait, yes, that's in the list)\n- And then another line:\n\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n\nSo, NT25 can produce either 't7' or 't8', based on the given grammar. That's crucial.\n\nSo, starting from S:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nFirst, let's decompose S into NT17 and NT59. So we need to generate t8, which is the first symbol in the string, which is 't8'. Since the string starts with 't8', let's see if either NT17 or NT59 can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT17 has two production rules:\n\n1. NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n2. NT17 -> 't4'\n\nSo NT17 can produce 't4' or two non-terminals, which would then need to expand.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't8', so NT17 can't directly produce that. So wait, perhaps the first part is 't8' comes from NT59, but I'm confused because earlier I thought S is NT17 and NT59. So perhaps the first symbol is NT59?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the production S:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nSo S is splitting into NT17 and NT59.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I know means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol maybe, which could produce a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it starts with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string must start with whatever NT17 and NT59 produce. Both NT17 and NT59 are non-terminals, so I'll need their productions.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, NT17 can produce t4 or t7, whereas NT59 can produce t9 or t... Wait, let me check NT59's rules. I see NT59 has two productions: one to t12 and 16, another to NT57 NT18. Also, there's another NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24? No, no, looking again, it's written as NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Let's see the string: t0 t4 t7 t11 t3 t2 t3 t9 t9 t11 t7 t6 t4 t2.\n\nSo the first symbol is t0. Wait, the start is S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the string must be a sequence starting with what NT17 and NT59 produce. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the string to see if it can be derived from the grammar. Parsing context-free grammars is often done with the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to build a parse tree or see if each terminal can be reached from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but parsing a string in CNF is easier because each production has exactly two symbols, which could either be terminals or non-terminals. So the string must have a length that is 2^n where n is the depth. Let's check the length of the string.\n\nThe string is: t0 t4 t7 t11 t3 t2 t3 t9 t9 t11 t7 t6 t4 t2. That's 14 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string length should be a power of two. 14 is not a power of two, so that's a hint that it might not be in the language. But wait, let me double-check: the start symbol S is producing two non-terminals, so each application of a production adds exactly one symbol, but actually, in CNF, each production in the parse tree splits into two, so the total number of symbols should be 2^n. However, in this case, the string is 14 symbols, which is not a power of two, so that suggests that it's not in the language.\n\nBut wait, when you derive a string from S using productions, the number of symbols can vary. Let me think again. For example, S can produce two non-terminals, each of which can produce two more, leading to a growth where the number of symbols could be up to 2^n, but it can also be less if some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nHmm, but in CNF, each production is exactly two symbols, so the total number of symbols in the string should be a power of two. Since 14 is not a power of two (the closest are 8 and 16), that's a big red flag. So that suggests the answer is No.\n\nBut before jumping to conclusions, let me make sure I'm interpreting the grammar correctly. Each production in the grammar after the start uses terminals and non-terminals in a way that makes it CNF. So when we evaluate the string, if the length isn't a power of two, it's not in the language.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Each of NT17 and NT59 can produce terminals or more non-terminals. So the possible lengths would be:\n\n- If both NT17 and NT59 produce terminals: 2 symbols, which is 2^1.\n- If one produces a terminal and the other produces a non-terminal which produces a terminal: that would depend, but wait no, if one is a terminal and the other produces a non-terminal, that would lead to a longer string.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of symbols in the string must be a power of two because every step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols if all non-terminals are expanded. However, if a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal, it doesn't increase the count. So if the number of terminals is less, it's possible, but for the problem, we can see that 14 is not a power of two, which implies that it's not possible to derive it with this grammar.\n\nSo even without looking deeper, the string length suggests it's not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 14 symbols, which is not a power of two.

I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes it easier to parse and generate strings.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a set of non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and terminals. The grammar starts with S, which is the start symbol. The string I need to evaluate is `t9 t11 t6 t3 t0 t2 t9 t7 t3 t1 t5 t9 t8 t9 t1`. \n\nI think I should try to derive the string from the grammar step by step. Starting with S, I see that S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step would be to split the string into two parts corresponding to NT17 and NT59. Let me split the given string at t11, because looking at the grammar, NT17 can produce t11 eventually.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, I need to check how each non-terminal can derive into the parts of the string. Let me list out all the non-terminals and their productions to get a clearer picture.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the generated string should start with NT17 and end with NT59. The entire string is: t9 t11 t6 t3 t0 t2 t9 t7 t3 t1 t5 t9 t8 t9 t1.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts: the left part (NT17) and the right part (NT59). The string starts with t9, so that must be the first symbol of the left part, NT17. Now, the left part of the string is t9, t11, t6, t3, t0, t2, t9, t7, t3, t1. The right part is t5, t9, t8, t9, t1.\n\nNow, looking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT17 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nNT17 \u2192 NT44 NT59\nWait, the actual productions are listed as:\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT17 are in the grammar provided.

NT... or NT... -> terminal.\n\nLooking carefully, the relevant ones for NT17 are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT17 \u2192 NT0 NT5\n\nSo, NT17 can be split into two parts: either NT37 and NT54, or NT0 and NT5.\n\nIn the string, the left part is t9 t11 t6 t3 t0 t2 t9 t7 t3 t1. The first symbol is t9, so I need to see how t9 can be derived from NT17.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, which would mean the left part starts with NT37 and ends with NT54. Alternatively, NT17 \u2192 NT0 NT5, so the left part starts with NT0 and ends with NT5.\n\nWait, but t9 isn't a terminal that directly appears in the grammar. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, perhaps I need to see how each non-terminal can produce a sequence that starts with certain terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. Since the string starts with t9, I should look for a production rule for some non-terminal that can start with t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT25 \u2192 t7. Let me check the rules for each NT to see which can produce t9.\n\nWait, t9 is somewhere in the right part after a split. The right part is t5, t9, t8, t9, t1. Wait, no, the right part is from NT59, as S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the right part is the second part, which is t5, t9, t8, t9, t1.

Wait, but in the grammar, are there any non-terminals that produce 't6'?\n\nLooking through, I see NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT6, but NT6 itself isn't a production; perhaps it's a terminal. Or maybe there are other rules. Wait, let me check all the production rules.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nI see lines like NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT6, which implies that NT6 is a terminal. So, from the production NT6 as a terminal, perhaps it produces 't6'. So, in the string, 't6' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 't5', NT3 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps I can build a tree starting with S.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step, trying to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string starts with NT17 and ends with NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17, it can split into two options: NT37 NT54 or NT0 NT5.\n\nThe first part of the string is t9, so let's consider which option produces t9.\n\nOption 1: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nSo, the first symbol of NT37 must be t9. Let's see if NT37 can derive t9.\n\nLooking at NT37's productions:\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n- NT37 \u2192 NT54 NT6\n- NT37 \u2192 NT54 NT1\n\nFrom these, NT37's first symbol would come from the first non-terminal in its production.\n\nLooking at NT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'. So, if NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, the first part is 't3' or 't11'. Neither is 't9', so this split doesn't help.\n\nOption 2: NT17 \u2192 NT0 NT5. So, the first part starts with NT0, which can produce t5 (from NT0 \u2192 't6'), but wait, let me see.\n\nWait, NT0 has several productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't6'\nNT0 \u2192 't0'\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I think I may have made a mistake. Let me list out all NT0's productions correctly.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n- NT0 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, no.

The string is `t9 t7 t11 t0 t1 t7 t11 t10 t10 t4 t10 t3 t7 t1 t3`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar is structured with these rules. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's quite extensive with various non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, and several non-terminals (like NT0, NT41, NT55, etc.) produce other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe string to analyze consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I can try to parse the string using the given grammar rules, or I can construct a parse tree from the string to see if it matches any derivation from S.\n\nParsing the string step by step might be complex because the grammar is large, but I can approach it by checking if each terminal in the string can correspond to a production in the grammar, considering the non-terminals' possible expansions.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens to make it clearer: `t9, t7, t11, t0, t1, t7, t11, t10, t10, t4, t10, t3, t7, t1, t3`. \n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar rules to find where any of these terminals appear. I'll scan through the productions to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT5 -> t5, t3, t10. So NT5 can produce any of these.\n- NT4 -> t4 (but wait, looking back, I don't see an NT4 production. Maybe that's incorrect. Let me check the grammar again.\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see some terminals like NT0 -> 't6', NT5 -> 't5', etc. Wait, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT0 \u2192 t6 as per the grammar: NT0->'t6'. Similarly, NT5\u2192't5', 't3', 't10' might be from NT5 productions. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, some lines have NTx -> 'ty', meaning the non-terminal NTx produces the terminal 'ty'. For example, NT55 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nSo, each time I see a terminal like 't9', I need to check if any non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce various 't's.

Chomsky normal form (CNF) has all productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

The grammar provided seems to follow this structure. So, the string should be split into symbols where each symbol is a result of applying one of these productions. \n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t2, t10, t4, t9, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production either has two non-terminals or a terminal. That means the string must be reducible from the start symbol S by applying these productions.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the string and see if it can be broken down into the parts defined by the grammar. That is, starting from the rightmost symbols and working backward to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the string:\n\nt2 t10 t4 t9 t7 t5 t10 t8 t8 t4 t11 t7 t6 t3 t11 t7\n\nThat's 15 symbols. Let me list them with indices for clarity:\n\n0: t2  \n1: t10  \n2: t4  \n3: t9  \n4: t7  \n5: t5  \n6: t10  \n7: t8  \n8: t8  \n9: t4  \n10: t11  \n11: t7  \n12: t6  \n13: t3  \n14: t11  \n15: t7  \n\nWait, actually, indexes go from 0 to 15, making it 16 symbols. Maybe I should check the length. The string has 16 symbols.\n\nNow, starting from the beginning, can I match the start symbol S?\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT17 and NT59, according to the production S -> NT17 NT59. So S is broken down into two non-terminals: NT17 and NT59. That means the string starts with these non-terminals, but wait, the grammar is S -> NT17 NT59, so the entire string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nWait, no, the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of the two non-terminals produced by S. So the string must be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT17 and the second by NT59.\n\nLet me check if the string can be split into two parts that correspond to NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet's first look at the productions for NT17 and NT59.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54  \nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nSo NT17 expands to NT37 NT54, and NT59 expands to NT18 NT36.\n\nNow, the entire string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59, which means the string is (expansion of NT17) followed by (expansion of NT59). So the entire string is split into two parts: the first part from NT17's expansion, the second from NT59's.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the productions for these:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18  \nNT54 -> NT17 NT56  \nNT18 -> 't0'  \nNT36 -> 't2'\n\nWait, wait, so NT37 is NT49 NT18, which can be further broken down.

Looking again:\n\nThe productions for NT49 are:\n\nNT49 -> 't3'  \nNT49 -> 't11'  \n\nSo NT49 can produce t3 or t11.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 has a production to t0, but wait, looking at the grammar for NT18:\n\nWait, earlier lines:\n\nNT18 -> 't0'  \nNT18 -> 't2'  \nNT18 -> 't0'\n\nWait, is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-316","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring the productions of a grammar. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the given grammar fits that because all the rules either have two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: `t2 t10 t6 t3 t5 t3 t6 t5 t9 t4 t7 t11 t4 t0 t8 t11 t2`. Let me count the elements\u2014there are 17 tokens here. Now, in a CNF grammar, the left-hand side (LHS) of each production is a single non-terminal, and each production expands to two non-terminals. So the structure of the derivation tree would be a binary tree, and the number of terminal symbols in the generated string should be one less than a power of two. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct. The maximum number of steps needed to derive a string of length n from the start symbol is log(n), but the exact structure depends on how the non-terminals expand into terminals. So I can't directly apply that rule here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother thought: Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait, no\u2014in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols, which could be two terminals, one terminal and one non-terminal, or two non-terminals. But in any case, the length of the string increases by one each time because one symbol is replaced by two.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again: Each production in CNF is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So when you replace A with BC, you went from one symbol to two, increasing the length by one. But if you have a symbol that's a terminal, then it's already finished. So the maximum possible length of the string after k derivations starting from S is 2^k. So for a string of length n, the number of steps to reach it is log2(n). But that's a starting point.\n\nWait, the given string is of length 17. So 2^4 = 16, 2^5 =32. So 17 isn't a power of two. Hmm, maybe that suggests that it's not possible because the grammar in CNF can only generate strings where the length is a power of two plus one? Or perhaps not. Maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, let's clarify. In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string after derivation can vary, but each time you expand, the number of symbols can increase by one. For example, S initially is one symbol. If S \u2192 A B, then you have two symbols. Each of those could be expanded further. But since the end goal is to have all symbols be terminals, the total length would be 2^k where k is the number of non-terminals in the derivation. Wait, that's not precise. The initial string length is 1, after one expansion, it's 2, then 3, 4, etc. Wait, no, each expansion of a non-terminal increases the count by one because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, so net change is +1.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe a better approach is to reconstruct the parse tree for the given string and see if it's possible based on the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t2 t10 t6 t3 t5 t3 t6 t5 t9 t4 t7 t11 t4 t0 t8 t11 t2`. Let me note that each token is a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of 17 terminals.\n\nNow, to parse it, the process should start from the start symbol S and see if it can derive this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo S is NT17 and NT59. Each of these must be expanded down until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to see what NT17 and NT59 can expand into.\n\nFirst, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nThen NT37 \u2192 NT44 NT10 (Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar given, NT37 has a production: NT37 -> NT44 NT18. Wait, checking the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT37 \u2192 NT10 NT18? Wait, no.

Let me parse it step by step.\n\nLooking for productions involving NT37: Checking through all lines, I see \"NT37 -> t9\" as well as other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all productions for each non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can traverse the string and see if it fits any possible derivation.\n\nLet me note that the string is `t2 t10 t6 t3 t5 t3 t6 t5 t9 t4 t7 t11 t4 t0 t8 t11 t2`.\n\nThe start is t2, so perhaps we can see which non-terminals produce t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules for t2: I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0'\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT2 \u2192 't4'\n\nAlso, other productions for terminals:\n\nLooking at NT5: NT5 \u2192 't5' and NT5 \u2192 't3' and NT5 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\nNT5 \u2192 't3'\nNT5 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo NT5 can produce t5, t3, or t10.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals:\n\nLooking for t10: I see NT8 \u2192 't10', and NT43 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions to see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nTerminal productions:\n\n- t0: NT0, NT49, NT15\n- t1: NT17?

Hmm, where do I even start?\n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar here looks CNF since all the non-terminals on the left produce two non-terminals on the right, except when they produce a terminal like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string to check is `t5 t9 t6 t0 t6 t4 t4 t9 t6 t9 t0 t3 t9`. So, I'm going to parse this string step by step using the grammar's productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 NT59. So the initial string should be split into the concatenation of the strings generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5, which is a terminal. So I need to see how t5 gets generated. Scanning through the productions for NT5 (since 't5' is a terminal for NT5), NT5 has the production NT5 -> 't5', so that's direct. So the first segment is 't5'.\n\nNext, after 't5', the string has 't9', which comes from NT9. Looking at NT9's productions, there's NT9 -> 't9' so that's another direct production. So the next part is 't9'.\n\nThen comes 't6'. Looking at NT6, it has NT6 -> 't6', which is a direct production. So that's 't6' next.\n\nAfter that, the string continues with 't0' followed by 't6', 't4', 't4', etc. Wait, let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe initial split is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So I need to parse the string as the concatenation of the strings generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me tackle NT17 first. NT17's production is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So I'll need to parse the first part up to the concatenated string here.\n\nIn the initial string, after 't5 t9 t6', the next part is 't0 t6 t4 t4 t9 t6 t9 t0 t3 t9'. Wait, maybe I should handle this more systematically.\n\nLet me note down the entire string and try to match it against the grammar step by step.\n\nThe string is: [t5, t9, t6, t0, t6, t4, t4, t9, t6, t9, t0, t3, t9]\n\nWait, that's 13 tokens, but the initial S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the string should split into two parts: one generated by NT17 and the other by NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, the first part parsed by NT17 leads up to NT37 NT54, which would split the string accordingly.\n\nBut how? Maybe it's better to simulate the parsing process.\n\nStarting with NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, I need to parse NT37 and NT54 separately.\n\nNT37's production is NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So, after NT37, I'll have these parts.\n\nNT49's production is NT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'. But looking at the string, after the initial parts, we have 't4' and 't4' which might not match t3 or t11.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see what each symbol in the string can result from.\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t9, t6, t0, t6, t4, t4, t9, t6, t9, t0, t3, t9.\n\nThe first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, the parse of the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings produced by NT17 and NT59.\n\nTherefore, the first part parsed by NT17 should generate a substring, and the second part parsed by NT59 should generate the remaining substring.\n\nNow, let's find out what the first part by NT17 could be. Each step can only produce non-terminals or terminals. So, starting with NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nSo, the string starts with the parts generated by NT37 and NT54.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nSo, the next step is to parse NT49 and NT18.\n\nNT49 has productions: NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', 't7', etc. Looking at the string, after 't9', the next symbol is 't6', then 't0', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all the NT productions and their corresponding terminals.\n\nLet me make a list of all NT \u2192 productions:\n\n1.

The string is `t6 t8 t8 t7 t8 t5 t1 t7 t3 t1 t9 t7 t9 t0 t1 t10 t5 t3`, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the grammar to understand what non-terminals and productions it has. The start symbol is S. S -> NT17 NT59. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT17 and NT59.\n\nI'll break down each non-terminal step by step, trying to find a path from S down to the terminals that form the string.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nLooking at NT59: It has two productions:\n1. NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n2. NT59 -> NT57 NT24\nSo, we'll choose one of these. Let's see which one could fit the beginning of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t6. Let's look at NT59's possible expansions. If we take the first option, NT59 -> NT18 NT36. Let's check NT18 and NT36:\nNT18 -> 't6' (terminal). So the first part could be t6. Then NT36 -> the next tokens.\n\nLooking at NT36 in the grammar: NT36 has two productions:\n1. NT36 -> 't2' (terminal)\n2. NT36 -> 't0' (terminal)\nBut the string after t6 is t8, t8, etc., so this path might not work immediately. Let's check the second option for NT59: NT59 -> NT57 NT24. NT24 is a terminal since it's listed as 't10'. So that would give us t10. But the string starts with t6, which doesn't match. So maybe the first production for NT59 is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check NT59 again. NT59 can be either NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24. If NT24 is 't10', and the string starts with t6, then NT59's second option would give t10, which doesn't match. But the string begins with t6, so the first option for NT59 gives t6. So, it's possible.\n\nSo, let's go with NT59 -> NT18 NT36. Now, NT18 is 't6' (terminal). So the first token is t6. Then, NT36 needs to expand to the next part of the string, which is t8.\n\nLooking at NT36's productions:\n1. NT36 -> 't2'\n2. NT36 -> 't0'\n\nBut neither of these are t8. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I took the wrong path for NT59. Let me backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the other option for NT59: NT59 -> NT57 NT24. NT24 is 't10', so that would give t10 as the first token. But the string starts with t6, so this doesn't work. So maybe the first production is correct, and something else is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the NT36 step. Let me look again. NT36 can expand to 't2' or 't0'. But the string after t6 is t8. Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT17 needs to be considered differently. Let's go back to S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n1. NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n2. NT17 -> NT54\n\nSo, maybe NT17 can expand directly to NT54. Let's try that.\n\nIf NT17 -> NT54, then NT54 has two productions:\n1. NT54 -> NT5 NT17 (left recursion)\n2. NT54 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT54 can become 't3'. Looking at the string, the third token after t6 is t8. So after t6 (from NT59), the next part would be t8. But in this path, NT54 gives t3, which is the third token. But the string has t8 as the next token. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider NT54 -> NT5 NT17. NT5 has productions:\n1. NT5 -> NT5\n2. NT5 -> 't5'\n3. NT5 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT5 can become t5 or t3. If NT5 is 't5', then the next token would be t5, but the string has t8. If it's 't3', the next token is t3, but the string has t8. So that path doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe NT17 expands to NT37 NT54, and then NT37 has a production. Let me check NT37's productions:\n1. NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n2. NT37 -> NT18 NT0\nSo NT37 can expand into two sub-productions.\n\nTaking the first option: NT37 -> NT49 NT18. Then NT49 has productions:\n1. NT49 -> 't3'\n2. NT49 -> 't8'\n\nSo maybe NT49 -> 't8'. Then NT18 is 't6'. So this would give us t8 followed by t6. But the string has t8 after t6, so perhaps that could work.\n\nWait, let me outline this:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT49 -> 't8'\nNT18 -> 't6'\n\nSo that would produce t8 t6. Then, after that, we have more tokens.\n\nBut before that, let me check the previous steps. After S->NT17 NT59, we chose NT17->NT37 NT54, which leads to NT49 NT18. Then NT49 is t8, and NT18 is t6. So the first two tokens after the initial 't6' (from NT59's production) would be t8 t6. But the string after the first t6 is t8, then t8, etc. So perhaps this is the right path.\n\nWait, the string is t6 t8 t8 t7 t8 t5 t1 t7 t3 t1 t9 t7 t9 t0 t1 t10 t5 t3.\n\nWait, let me correct my earlier analysis. The string starts with t6 t8 t8 t7 t8 t5 t1 t7 t3 t1 t9 t7 t9 t0 t1 t10 t5 t3.\n\nSo, after the initial t6 (from NT59's NT18), the next token is t8. Let's see if that can happen.\n\nBut in the NT59's first expansion (NT18 NT36), NT18 is 't6', and NT36 is either 't2' or 't0', which are both terminals but not t8. So that can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the initial approach is incorrect, or perhaps I misread the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the string. Let me re-examine the string: it's `t6 t8 t8 t7 t8 t5 t1 t7 t3 t1 t9 t7 t9 t0 t1 t10 t5 t3`.\n\nSo the first token is t6. Then the second is t8, third t8, etc.\n\nSo, in the initial expansion S->NT17 NT59, if NT59 is 't6' and NT17 leads to what?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the initial NT59 wrong. Let me double-check:\n\nEarlier, I considered NT59 -> NT18 NT36. But NT18 is 't6', so that would produce t6 followed by whatever NT36 produces, which is 't2' or 't0', neither of which are t8. So that can't explain the second token being t8.\n\nAlternatively, if NT59 -> NT57 NT24, NT24 is 't10', so that would produce t10 at the beginning, but the string starts with t6, so this path is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial approach might not be working. Maybe I need to consider alternative paths.\n\nLet me try again. S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nWe need the string to start with t6. So NT59 must somehow produce t6 as the first symbol. Let's see NT59's options:\n\nOption1: NT59 -> NT18 NT36. NT18 is 't6', so that would give t6, then NT36.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all either two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is in CNF, which means two symbols on the right-hand side, either both non-terminals or both terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. Oh, wait, no, no\u2014wait, no, CNF is each production has exactly two symbols, which are either terminals or non-terminals. So the right-hand side is either two terminals or two non-terminals. Some of the productions might have terminals, but not terms like A\u2192aB or anything like that. Let's check that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see productions like S -> NT17 NT59, NT41 -> NT16 NT17, etc. Some productions have terminals, like NT18 -> 't0', NT36 -> 't6', and so on. So the grammar has a mix where some non-terminals produce terminals, others produce non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t3 t3 t9 t0 t6 t6 t1 t11 t8 t6 t5 t11 t7 t4 t0 t10 t6 t1`. So, it's a series of terminals. My job is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the derivation would involve replacing non-terminals step by step until we reach the string of terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the bottom up, seeing if it can be built by the grammar. Let's see. In parsing, each step would involve substituting a non-terminal with a pair of symbols that can then be expanded further until we get the entire string.\n\nLooking at the structure of the string: it's a series of t's and numbers. The first two letters are t3 t3. Let's think about how that could be derived. Let's look for non-terminals that produce 't3' in two steps. \n\nWait, but in the grammar, 't's are terminals, and the non-terminals produce either terminals or non-terminals. Looking at the productions, I see NT5 -> 't5', NT15 -> 't0', NT17 -> 't4', NT12 -> 't11', etc. So some non-terminals produce a single terminal, which can be matched in the string.\n\nBut our string has 't3 t3', so maybe the first symbol is derived from a non-terminal that expands to 't3's. Let's see what non-terminals produce 't3'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5' (so 't5', not 't3')\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- Let me check all non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> Wait, I'm not seeing any NT producing 't3'. Hmm, perhaps I missed some. Let me check again.\n\nWait, checking the productions:\n\nLooking for NTs ending with 't3':\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5' \u2192 No\n- NT15 -> 't0' \u2192 No\n- NT17 -> 't4' \u2192 No\n- Let's check if any other non-terminals produce 't3' or 't3's.\n\nWait, perhaps in the process of expanding non-terminals, we can get 't3's. Maybe NT5 is part of a chain. Let me look for any non-terminals that produce 't3's in their production.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't3' as a terminal. The terminals in the grammar are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t8, t9, t10, etc. But all non-terminals have their expansions as combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, so that's a problem because if none of the non-terminals produce 't3' directly, the only way to get a 't3' is through a chain where two non-terminals produce it, but none of them do that. Hmm, that might mean the string cannot be generated because 't3' doesn't appear in any of the direct terminals of the grammar. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Let's go through each production where a non-terminal is immediately followed by a terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT24 -> 't0', 't5', 't10', etc.\n- NT36 -> 't6', 't0', etc.\n- NT25 -> 't7', 't2', etc.\n- NT37 -> 't9', 't10', 't6', 't5', etc.\n- NT44 -> 't2', 't4', etc.\n- NT49 -> 't7', 't11', etc.\n- NT2 -> 't0', 't6', 't4', 't0'\u2192 wait, look again.\n\nWait, some of the non-terminals replace into multiple things, perhaps leading to 't3'. For example, NT55 -> NT25 NT0, which might eventually expand into a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see if 't3' can be generated. I think I might have missed some non-terminal that directly produces 't3'. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at each production ending with 't':\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT24 -> 't0', 't5', 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6', 't0', etc.\n- NT49 -> 't7', 't11'\n- NT2 -> 't0', 't6', 't4'\n- Wait, any others? Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\n1. S -> NT17 NT59\n2. NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n3. NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n4. NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n5. NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n6. NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n7.

NT59 -> NT12 NT16 \u2192 Wait, another production for NT59\n16. NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n17. NT41 -> 't6' \u2192 Oh, here's one! NT41 is terminal 't6'? Wait, no, is it?\n\nWait, looking at line 9: NT57 -> NT8 NT41, line 10: NT59 -> NT12 NT16, line 16: NT59 -> NT57 NT24, line 17: NT41 -> 't6' \u2192 So NT41 is 't6'. So NT41 is a terminal 't6'.\n\nWait, but in line 3: NT41's production is NT16 NT17, and also in line 17, another production as 't6'. So NT41 can expand to 't6' directly, or to NT16 NT17. So NT41 can become 't6' in one step.\n\nSimilarly, maybe other NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, but earlier, looking at NT40 (not sure there is such a thing), looking again at the productions:\n\nLooking for any NTs that directly produce 't3'. Hmm, let's check:\n\nLooking at each production's RHS if it's terminals:\n\n- NT5 produces 't5', so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps through a chain. Let's see.\n\nFor example, NT41 can produce 't6', which is a terminal. So in the string, there's a 't6' at position 5: let's count the string...

{"custom_id":"request-359","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t6 t11 t10 t9 t2 t2 t8 t9 t10 t11 t6 t3 t6 t10 t1 t0 t11 t1`, and the grammar is a set of production rules. All right, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has a specific structure. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit that structure. For example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 and NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17. So that's good; it's in the right form.\n\nNext, I need to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol here is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 NT59. So the string should start with derivations of NT17 and NT59. Let me check the string: it starts with t5, t6, etc. The first part is t5, which likely corresponds to NT5. Wait, looking at the rules, NT5 can go to 't5', so that's fine. But NT17 needs to be broken down further. Looking at NT17's production, it's NT37 NT54, according to the rules. So the string needs to have a t4 or t7 following, but in the given string, the first part is t5 t6. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with T5 T6. Looking at the grammar, I see NT5 can go to 't5' and NT0 goes to 't6' via NT5, I think. Wait, let me check: NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12, and NT55 can go to NT25 NT0, which might loop. Maybe it's better to approach this differently.\n\nMaybe I should try to parse the string from left to right using a top-down approach, trying to match the symbols using the grammar. Start with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first symbols must be the results of NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't5', which could come from NT5 \u2192 't5'. Then, according to the production for NT5, it can go directly to 't5' or via NT10 maybe. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT10. Let me check again. Wait, actually, looking at NT5's productions, I see NT5 -> 't5' and others like NT5 -> 't3' and so on. So NT5 can directly produce 't5', so the substring starts with 't5' and then another symbol. Wait, the string is a sequence, but in parsing, each step would consume a part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals at each step, which would split the string accordingly. So the string length should be compatible. Let me count the tokens in the string: t5 t6 t11 t10 t9 t2 t2 t8 t9 t10 t11 t6 t3 t6 t10 t1 t0 t11 t1. That's 20 tokens. Each production step in CNF splits into two, so starting from S \u2192 NT17 NT59, each non-terminal might split further until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me try to represent the string as a parse tree. The string is 20 symbols, which is 2^4 steps since each production branches into two and each step reduces the number by half. So 2^4=16, but here we have 20 which is beyond that. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so the number of symbols should be a power of 2? Or maybe not exactly, but the way the grammar splits it might require that certain parts split into two steps each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet's see: S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the string starts with the left part from NT17 and the right part from NT59. Let's focus on NT17 first.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo the first token t5 should be from NT5? Wait, NT5 can produce t5 directly, so t5 is part of NT5. Then, after t5, we have t6 t11 t10 t9 t2 t2 t8 t9 t10 t11 t6 t3 t6 t10 t1 t0 t11 t1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string by looking for possible derivations. Maybe I can approach it recursively, considering NT17 and NT59 and seeing if the string can match.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the string as a list and try to consume symbols step by step. Let's start:\n\n1. String: [t5, t6, t11, t10, t9, t2, t2, t8, t9, t10, t11, t6, t3, t6, t10, t1, t0, t11, t1]\n\n2. Starting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first symbol should come from NT17, and the second from NT59.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of t's, so each production step would split the current symbol into two branches. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar expects certain combinations. For example, looking at NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and so on. Maybe certain t's have linked.\n\nBut this could get complex. Alternatively, perhaps I should check which non-terminals can produce which terminal strings.\n\nFor example, NT5 can produce t5 or via other rules, but it seems that NT5 can directly produce t5, t3, t10, etc. Similarly, NT17 can produce t4, t7, t1, etc., through its productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5, which could come from NT5. Then the next is t6, which is from NT0 which can be split into NT55 NT12, and so on.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to write down the possible steps. Let's see:\n\nString is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 can produce NT37 NT54.\n\nSo, from the start, we have two branches: NT17 and NT59.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which is from NT5. So perhaps NT5 comes from NT17's RHS. Wait, NT59 is on the RHS of S, so the first part of the string should start with NT59's symbols.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to parse the entire string instead of looking at the individual symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the derivation steps. Let's try:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, NT17 needs to be processed. Let's see the possible productions for NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo now, we have S \u2192 NT37 NT54 NT59.\n\nNow, NT54 is part of the production. Hmm, wait, maybe I should process each non-terminal in the order they appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the string as a series of symbols and try to match them using the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to use the recursive nature of the grammar to see if the string can be built up.\n\nBut this might take a while, and I'm concerned about time. Maybe I can look for any obvious discrepancies.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice 't11' appears multiple times. Checking the grammar, some non-terminals can produce 't11'?\n\nLooking:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, and NT57 can go to t7? Wait, no, NT57 \u2192 t7, perhaps.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some terminals have multiple rules. Wait, for example, NT41 can produce 't11' via NT12? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT41 -> 't16' via somewhere? Wait, no. Looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let me list out the production rules for terminals to see which t's are directly generated:\n\nLooking through all the rules, some non-terminals directly produce t's:\n\nLooking for NT -> 't'\n\n- NT5: yes, NT5 can produce t5, t3, t10.\n- NT15: yes, NT15 \u2192 t0.\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in a CNF format, which I know means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This makes parsing a bit systematic, but it's a bit abstract. The string I need to check is `t1 t2 t6 t10 t2 t0 t8 t9 t8 t0 t1 t3 t2 t7 t0 t2 t6 t4 t7`.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. Parsing context-free grammars can often be done using a recursive descent approach, where each production corresponds to a function that tries to parse a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT17 NT59. So, the first two symbols generated should be whatever comes from NT17 and NT59. Let's see what NT17 and NT59 produce.\n\nNT17 produces either 't4', 't5', or 't7'. Wait, looking at the rules, NT17 has two options: 't4', 't5', 't7', or other combinations. Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait, the NT17 production is NT17 -> NT37 NT54 or other? No, let me check the grammar. Oh, looking at the grammar, NT17's rules are:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54 and NT0 -> NT17 NT54. Hmm, maybe I need to see all the productions for each NT. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the NTs that ultimately produce t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the grammar as a tree where each production leads to non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, I can model the parsing with a shift-reduce parser, which is common for CNF grammars.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n1. The input string is processed from left to right.\n2. Non-terminals are popped from the operator stack, and their left-hand side (LHS) production is used.\n3. When an entire production's symbols match the stack's top, they are popped, and the LHS is pushed.\n4. The process continues until the stack is empty (success) or the end of input is reached with non-terminals left (failure).\n\nLet me set up the initial state of the shift-reduce parser:\n\n- State: shift (waiting to shift tokens into the stack)\n- Stack: empty\n- Input: the string `t1 t2 t6 t10 t2 t0 t8 t9 t8 t0 t1 t3 t2 t7 t0 t2 t6 t4 t7`\n\nFirst, tokens are the 't's with numbers. Wait, but the string is a sequence of 't's and numbers like t1, t2, etc. So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, right?\n\nWait, the grammar's non-terminals seem to be like NT0, NT1, etc. So each of those is a non-terminal. The right-hand sides of the productions are pairs of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the input string, we have 't1', 't2', etc., which are terminals. So the parser is supposed to match terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the grammar's terminals are the 't' labels followed by numbers, like NT5, but wait, NT5 is a non-terminal? Or is 't5' a terminal symbol?\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, the productions end with 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nSo each of these 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, for example, 't10' is a terminal, which is part of the language.\n\nSo when parsing, whenever I see a 't' followed by a number, it's a terminal to be matched.\n\nSo, the initial step is to process the string: t1, t2, t6, etc.\n\nSo, for the shift-reduce parser, each token is either a non-terminal (like NT17) or a terminal (like t10).\n\nWait, but in the input, the string is a flat list: t1 t2 t6 ... So, in the parser, each token is either a non-terminal (which is a placeholder) or a terminal (a 't' with a number). So, in the input, any occurrence of NT17 is a non-terminal, but the string only has 't's with numbers, which are terminals.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the input string is built by the grammar's rules. So, for the parser, each token in the input string is a terminal, which would mean that when the parser tries to consume 't's as terminals, any time a production expects a non-terminal, it would have to look ahead for another non-terminal, but in this case, the input only has 't's. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nBut eventually, NT55 becomes 't8' and NT25 is 't7', etc.\n\nSo, each non-terminal eventually produces some 't's. So when the parser processes the input, each 't1', 't2', etc., are terminals. So the parser's job is to match the 't's according to the grammar.\n\nBut since the input only has 't's, that means that each part of the input must correspond to a derivation path that leads directly from the non-terminals to those 't's.\n\nBut in the input string, it's a sequence of 't's. So, for example, the first part is t1, t2, t6,...\n\nSo, the parser starts with stack empty, and then shifts tokens one by one.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift-reduce approach is the way to go. Let me see.\n\nStarting with stack: empty\n\nRead 't1' (shift)\nStack: [t1]\n\nNext token: 't2' (shift)\nStack: [t1, t2]\n\nNext: 't6' (shift)\nStack: [t1, t2, t6]\n\nNext: 't10' (shift)\nStack: [t1, t2, t6, t10]\n\nNext: 't2' (shift)\nStack: [t1, t2, t6, t10, t2]\n\nNext: 't0' (shift)\nStack: [t1, t2, t6, t10, t2, t0]\n\nWait, but 't0' is a terminal, right? So stack has t0 on top. Now, what production could match t0 as a terminal?\n\nLooking at the parse rules, perhaps 't0' is a terminal, so how can the parser process it?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Wait, perhaps in this grammar, the 't's are terminals, and the non-terminals expand into sequences of these 't's. So, when the parser is in a state and the top of the stack has a non-terminal, it replaces it with the right-hand side of the production.\n\nBut in this case, the input is all terminals, so when the parser has a non-terminal on the stack, it can't proceed.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar. It's a bit complicated with many non-terminals and productions. I'll list out all the production rules to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59.

For example, NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, and also NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. So the string must go through either of these paths.\n\nThe string given is: t0 t6 t5 t9 t8 t8 t6 t4 t7 t5 t8 t5 t11 t1 t2 t6 t2 t2 t8 t2. Let's count the tokens: that's 20 tokens. So the string has length 20.\n\nSince our grammar produces strings by expanding S into a sequence of non-terminals which eventually become terminals. The process starts with S and replaces each non-terminal step by step until all are terminals.\n\nLet me see the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step is that S produces two non-terminals: NT17 and NT59. Each of these needs to expand until they produce terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with S's expansion: the first symbol must be the expansion of NT17, and the second symbol must be the expansion of NT59.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t0. So either NT17 \u2192 t0 or NT59 \u2192 t0.\n\nLet's check NT17's productions. From the rules, NT17 has two possible expansions:\n\n1. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT44 (Wait, but looking back, no\u2014that's not correct. I think I might have misread. Let me double-check: NT44 is generated by NT25. Wait, in the list of rules, there's a production NT17 \u2192 t4, right? Let me check:\n\nYes, under NT17: NT17 \u2192 't4' is present.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT59, which has two productions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't6' (from NT36 \u2192 NT59 \u2192 't6'), or wait, no, wait. Let me check NT59's rules:\n\nFrom NT59: NT59 can produce NT18NT36 or NT57NT24. But looking for terminals, let's go further.\n\nLooking at NT59\u2019s direct terminals in its productions\u2014no, NT59 doesn't produce terminals directly. So NT59 must expand into either NT18 and NT36, which themselves have productions.\n\nNT18 has a production: NT18 \u2192 't0', right? Because under NT18, one of the productions is 't0'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT36: looking at the rules, NT36 \u2192 't2' directly. So NT36 is replaced by t2. But wait, NT36 can also go to NT15 and more. But that's a path, so maybe we should trace the possible terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider possible expansions step by step. Let me try to parse the string.\n\nThe first two symbols are t0 t6 t5 ... Wait, no, the string starts with t0, which is produced by NT17. Because S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the first symbol must be the terminal produced by NT17.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: \n\n- One possibility is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, expanding further.\n\n- Another possibility is NT17 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo if the first token is 't0', which comes from NT17, but NT17 does not produce 't0'\u2014that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check NT17's productions again. From the rules:\n\nThe rules say:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n- NT54 \u2192 't9'\n- NT54 \u2192 't6'\n- NT54 \u2192 't5' (Wait, looking at NT54, there are three productions: NT54 \u2192 't9', 't6', 't5'?\n\nWait no, let's look again. From NT54, the rules are:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2', 't5', 't9'. No, that's in NT54?\n\nWait, looking back, under NT54, the rules are:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT54's productions are:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't2', 't5', 't9'\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the given rules:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't2'\n- NT54 \u2192 't5'\n- NT54 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in a typical CFG, a non-terminal can have one production. So perhaps I'm misreading it. Let me re-express:\n\nLooking for any line starting with NT54:\n\nYes, the rules include:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2'\nNT54 \u2192 't5'\nNT54 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in a CFG, a non-terminal can have only one production. So perhaps I was missing some rules.\n\nWait no, wait: Let me check line by line through all the rules again to see.\n\nLooking for all NT54:\n\n- Line 40: NT25 \u2192 't7'\nWait, what about NT54?

Let me see.\n\nFirst, NT17's first step can be to produce t4, t7, or split into NT37 and NT54. Similarly, NT59 can produce t6 in one of its rules (rule 8: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36; rule 16: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16; rule 17: NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24). Wait, but looking at rule 8: NT59 is 't18' and 't36'? No, wait, rules like NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36: NT18 and NT36.\n\nLooking back, rule 8 is NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, not 't18' and 't36'. So NT59 has multiple productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the entire string step by step, applying the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse from the string upwards using the grammar.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the string must be the concatenation of what NT17 produces and what NT59 produces.\n\nLooking at the first part, it starts with t6. So whichever production NT17 uses that generates t6.

The string is \"t10 t0 t0 t11 t5 t3 t8 t4 t6 t3 t10 t1 t4 t3 t4 t7 t11 t5 t1 t1 t8 t7\". \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are used to generate strings based on production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or exactly two non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two other symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production for S is NT17 NT59. That means the string starts with whatever NT17 and NT59 produce. My next step is to find what NT17 and NT59 generate.\n\nNT59 has multiple productions. I see it can be NT12 NT16, which might lead to more substitutions. Let me check NT12 and NT16. NT12's production is NT5 NT43, and NT16 is NT55 NT32. Hmm. \n\nNT5 is a terminal, so it becomes 't5'. NT43 is NT5 NT15, and NT5 is 't5', NT15 is NT16 NT56. Wait, that seems recursive. Let me break it down:\n\nNT5 -> 't5' directly.\nNT43 -> NT5 (t5) + NT15\nNT15 -> NT16 + NT56\nNT16 -> NT55 + NT32\nHmm, NT55 is NT25 NT0.\n\nThis seems to be getting complex. Maybe I should try to parse the string from the end. Parsing with a top-down approach by trying to match the grammar rules from the string.\n\nI'll list the string: t10 t0 t0 t11 t5 t3 t8 t4 t6 t3 t10 t1 t4 t3 t4 t7 t11 t5 t1 t1 t8 t7.\n\nI need to see if this can be built from S using the given productions. Let me attempt to step through.\n\nStarting with S: S -> NT17 NT59. So the string must be NT17 NT59. Let's see if the string starts with NT17 producing some sequence and NT59 another.\n\nLooking at NT17, the production is NT37 NT54. So NT17 is NT37 NT54.\n\nLooking at NT54, it's NT54 -> NT57 NT24. So NT54 becomes NT57 NT24.\n\nNT57 has two productions: one is NT59 NT18, the other is NT58 NT24. Wait, in the grammar, NT59 has a production to NT12 NT16, but also other options. Hmm, no, NT59 -> NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, from the grammar, NT59 can be replaced as 't6' by a specific production, but in the substitution, we should only take those that are applicable.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT59 has a production to NT12 NT16 and also to NT57 NT24. Or does it have another production that makes it a terminal?\n\nLooking back: Oh, I think I might have misread NT59. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the given grammar, NT59's productions are:\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, NT59 is a binary non-terminal that can produce these two combinations.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the first part is t10 t0..., so perhaps NT59 produces something ending with certain terms. Alternatively, maybe NT17 produces more terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can consider using CYK parsing. Let me list the tokens in the string:\n\nt10, t0, t0, t11, t5, t3, t8, t4, t6, t3, t10, t1, t4, t3, t4, t7, t11, t5, t1, t1, t8, t7.\n\nThat's 22 tokens. So, the string has length 22. Let's index them from 0 to 21.\n\nTo apply CYK, I can create a table where cells (i,j) represent the range from index i to j. The goal is to check which non-terminals can derive the substring s[i..j].\n\nBut given the time, maybe I should instead check if each part of the string can lead to the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe starting from S and seeing if I can get to the string.\n\nS -> NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, the string must be NT17's production followed by NT59's.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSo, after S, we get NT37 NT54 NT59.\n\nBut wait, S's first production is NT17 NT59, and NT17 breaks into NT37 NT54, so the string starts with NT37 NT54 followed by NT59's expansion.\n\nWait, but the given string is a concatenation of terminals. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two terminals. Wait no, because in CNF, each production is either terminal (for single terminals) or two non-terminals. Wait, no: in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals if it's a binary production, or a single terminal if it's unary.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, actually, all non-terminals are binary. Because in the grammar, every production either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A and B and C are non-terminals, except for a few that directly produce a terminal. Like NT5 -> 't5' etc.\n\nSo actually, in this specific grammar, all productions except a few are binary. So, it's in CNF except for the single-terminals, but that's allowed in CNF; CNF allows productions with two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut more accurately, in CNF, every production is either of the form A \u2192 a terminal or A \u2192 B C where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nSo yes, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nGiven that, the string should be a series of terminals, each step expanding non-terminals into more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with t10, which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar for terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking at terminal symbols:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t10, t11, t15, t17, t18, t24, t25, t32, t36, t37, t41, t43, t44, t49, t54, etc. But in the string, we have t0, t1, t5, t6, etc.\n\nWait, wait, in the string, the first token is t10, then t0. So, does any non-terminal produce t10 or t0 as terminals?\n\nLooking at the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\nWe have NT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT25 -> 't7'\n\nWait, no. Let me list all terminal productions:\n\nNT2 -> 't0', 't4', 't6'\n\nNT3 -> 't0'\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT8 -> 't10'\n\nNT10 is not a terminal, but looking: no, in the grammar, 't's are terminals, so any NT that directly maps to 't' are the terminals.\n\nSo, looking through the grammar, NT2 produces t0, t4, t6.\n\nNT5 -> t5.\n\nNT8 -> t10.\n\nNT15 -> t1, because NT15 -> 't0' or 't1'?\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the grammar, for the non-terminals pointing directly to terminals:\n\nNT25 -> 't7'\n\nWait, no, let's check each:\n\nLooking at all NT productions and see which have a terminal as the right-hand side.\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0', 't4', 't6'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nWait, for every NT, check if any production ends in a terminal directly.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT2 -> 't0', 't4', 't6'\n\nNT3 -> 't0'?\n\nWait, looking at NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alright, let's break this down step by step because it seems a bit complex with all these production rules. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Context-free grammars have a start symbol and production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into other symbols. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires each production to have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the given grammar seems to fit that since all productions are either terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nThe start symbol here is S. Looking at the first production: S -> NT17 NT59. So, from S, it expands into two non-terminals, NT17 and NT59. My string to check starts with t2, so I need to see how S can derive a string starting with t2. Let's parse the entire string step by step. \n\nThe string is: t2 t2 t11 t0 t10 t7 t2 t5 t10 t6 t5 t3 t4 t2 t0 t1 t7 t3 t0 t9 t8.\n\nI notice that each 't' represents a terminal symbol, and the numbers between them represent non-terminals. So, the first step is to check from the start symbol S whether the entire string can be derived.\n\nLet's start with S. The first production is S -> NT17 NT59. So, each of these non-terminals needs to derive some strings. Let's look at NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: NT17 -> NT37 NT54, and that's it. So, NT17 must be broken down into NT37 and NT54. Let's check NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 has two productions: NT37 -> NT49 NT18 and NT37 -> NT10 NT18. Wait, looking back, the NT37 entries are: NT37 -> NT49 NT18 and NT37 -> NT10 (but wait, no, looking again, let's correct this. In the given grammar, NT37 is defined as NT49 NT18, and another one?

Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the user's message, the NT59 has:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- Also, another entry: NT59 -> NT57 NT24?\n\nWait, that seems too many. But the initial message says:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT41 -> 't6'\" ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake, but assuming that NT59 has two productions: NT18 NT36 and NT12 NT16. But perhaps the user didn't write all correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and NT59 has two productions, and the 'NT59 -> NT57 NT24' is another rule for NT59. Hmm, I think maybe I need to clarify that. \n\nWait, perhaps that was a mistake and NT59 only has two productions, but in the given data, it's written as 'NT59 -> NT18 NT36' and 'NT59 -> NT12 NT16', and 'NT59 -> NT57 NT24'. So, actually, NT59 has three productions? Or maybe it's a typo, but the user's message contains three lines for NT59.

Alternatively, probably, the user made a mistake in formatting, perhaps the NT59 has two productions: NT18 NT36 and NT12 NT16, with the third line being another production for NT41. Hmm, this is a bit unclear, but perhaps in the actual problem, NT59 has only two productions: NT18 NT36 and NT12 NT16. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps that was a confusion. Let me assume that for now and proceed.\n\nSo, going back to S -> NT17 NT59, which we'll need to derive the entire string. NT17 expands to NT37 NT54, so now we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59 \u2192 (NT37 NT54) NT59\n\nSo the string now needs to derive t2 t2 t11 t0 t10 t7 t2 t5 t10 t6 t5 t3 t4 t2 t0 t1 t7 t3 t0 t9 t8 from NT37 NT54 NT59.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can approach it by attempting to parse the string from left to right using a top-down approach with dynamic programming or recursive descent. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols, so the number of steps should be manageable.\n\nLet me list the string again for clarity: t2 t2 t11 t0 t10 t7 t2 t5 t10 t6 t5 t3 t4 t2 t0 t1 t7 t3 t0 t9 t8.\n\nEach symbol is a terminal, and numbers are non-terminals. \n\nStarting with the entire string, let's see what can produce it.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59.

Looking through the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 't0' and NT18 \u2192 't1', as per the given rules. So NT18 can be 't0' or 't1'.\n\nWait, more carefully: looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't0' (from NT8 -> 't10' and others, but in the specific productions for NT18, I think it's NT18 \u2192 't0' and also NT18 \u2192 't1'. Because in the given grammar, under NT18, there are productions NT18 -> 't0' and NT18 -> 't1'. So NT18 can produce either 't0' or 't1'.\n\nSo going back to NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Since NT49 can be 't3' or 't11', and NT18 can be 't0' or 't1', the possible sequences from NT37 are:\n\n- 't3' followed by 't0'\n- 't3' followed by 't1'\n- 't11' followed by 't0'\n- 't11' followed by 't1'\n\nSo NT37 can generate t3 t0, t3 t1, t11 t0, or t11 t1.\n\nNow, going up to NT54, which is part of NT17's production. The NT54 production is NT57 and NT24. So NT54 \u2192 NT57 NT24. \n\nLooking at NT57, its production is NT0 and NT18. So NT57 \u2192 NT0 NT18. Now, NT0 has a production NT16 and NT56. So NT0 \u2192 NT16 NT56. \n\nBreaking this down, NT16 \u2192 NT55 and NT32. So NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32. NT32 \u2192 NT2 and NT36. NT2 can produce 't0', 't4', or 't6' (looking at the NT2 rules: NT2\u2192't0', 't4', 't6'). So NT32 can be combinations of NT2 and NT36.\n\nNT36 can produce 't6' or 't2' (because NT36 -> 't3'? Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the NT36 productions. From the given table:\n\nNT36 has this: NT36 -> NT15, NT15, then maybe others? Wait no, looking again, I see:\n\nIn the given grammar, under NT36: NT36 -> 't6'? No, let's look:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT36: NT36 -> 't6' (is that correct?) Wait, in the grammar, looking through the NT36 entries: \n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT36, the rules are:\n\n- NT36 -> 't6' ?\n\nNo, wait: in the grammar, perhaps it's:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT36 -> 't6' ?\n\nWait, no, looking at the list again:\n\nIt's given as:\n\nNT36 -> 't2', 't5', 't4'?\n\nWait, perhaps the actual NT36 productions are:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT36, the rules are:\n\nNT36 -> 't6', 't3', 't2', 't4'? Or is that a different NT?\n\nWait, for NT36, the relevant productions are:\n\nNT36 -> 't2' (from where?), wait no. Let me look carefully:\n\nAh, here's the grammar:\n\nNT36 -> 't3'? Or maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all NT36's rules:\n\nFrom the given:\n\n- NT36 -> 't3'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT36 -> 't0'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n\nYes, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nNT36 has four productions:\n\nNT36 -> 't6'\n\nNT36 -> 't3'\n\nNT36 -> 't2'\n\nNT36 -> 't4'?\n\nWait, let's check each line:\n\nNT36: the rules are:\n\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n\n- NT36 -> 't3'\n\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n\nYes, four productions for NT36, each producing one of these terminals: 't2', 't3', 't4', 't6'.\n\nSo, in the case of NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36, and NT2 can produce 't0', 't4', or 't6', and NT36 can produce any of 't2', 't3', 't4', 't6'.\n\nSo the possibilities for NT32 are all combinations of NT2 and NT36.\n\nFor example, if NT2 is 't0' and NT36 is 't2', then the string is 't0 t2'.\n\nIf NT2 is 't4' and NT36 is 't6', then 't4 t6', etc.\n\nBut wait, let me see that. Since NT32 breaks down to NT2 and NT36.\n\nSo the possible strings from NT32 are combinations of NT2's productions and NT36's.\n\nSince NT2 can produce three terminals, and NT36 can produce four, NT32 can generate 3*4=12 combinations.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nNT55 can produce 't8' or 't5' because looking at the grammar, under NT55:\n\nNT55 -> 't8' and NT55 -> 't5'.\n\nSo NT55 produces 't5' or 't8'.\n\nSo NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32 can generate four possible combinations from NT32 multiplied by two from NT55: leading to 12*2=24 combinations for NT16.\n\nBut wait, not exactly, because each production is a tree, so perhaps more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the given string step by step. The string is: t0 t10 t2 t1 t4 t1 t7 t10 t6 t11 t6 t5 t5 t10 t4 t2 t8 t0 t6 t1 t6 t0.\n\nThat's quite a long string, 21 tokens.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production step adds exactly two symbols (for the two non-terminals, which may produce terminals or non-terminals). Therefore, the derivation length is exponential, but perhaps here we can track the possible sequences.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is to two symbols, each step of the derivation appends two symbols (either two terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two non-terminals). But since non-terminals can only produce terminals eventually, the entire string must be a sequence of terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the steps I can take to parse the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps because it simplifies parsing since each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.

S = NT17 NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 must produce t4, which it does because NT17 \u2192 't4'.\n\nNext, NT59 can produce either NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24 or NT57 NT24 again? Wait:\n\nLooking at NT59: it's defined as NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36. But in the productions, under NT59, there are three options but in the code, it's written as:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36  \nNT59 -> NT57 NT24  \nNT59 -> NT57 NT24  \n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's written as NT59 -> NT57 NT24 twice? Or is that a typo? Because in the provided grammar, NT59 has three entries:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nSo perhaps it's a mistake, but regardless, for NT59, the options are NT12 NT16, NT57 NT24, and then another duplicate for NT57 NT24. So the two non-terminal options are NT12 NT16 and NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem states:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16  \nNT59 -> NT57 NT24  \nNT59 -> NT57 NT24  \n\nSo perhaps the last one is just a redundant entry, but it's still two non-terminal options.\n\nSo for NT59, the first production is NT12 NT16, which is N terminals. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT12, NT16 are non-terminals because they have more productions.\n\nWait no: looking at the grammar:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43  \nSo NT12 is a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 is a non-terminal.\n\nSo when S starts with NT17 NT59, each part is NT, so the first step is to parse the string into its initial components. Wait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step involves expanding non-terminals into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree or try to see the sequence step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt4 t7 t9 t3 t10 t9 t10 t10 t3 t9 t5 t9 t7 t6 t4 t3 t5 t6 t11 t4 t9 t9\n\nStart with S = NT17 NT59.\n\nAs per the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo NT17 expands to NT37 NT54. Now, the string starts with t4, which is what NT17's production gives. So the next symbols are t7, which is part of NT59.\n\nNT59 can be NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nLooking at NT59's first option: NT12 NT16. NT12 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be expanded as well. NT12's production is NT5 NT43. So NT12 expands into NT5 NT43.\n\nLooking at the next symbols after t7: the third symbol is t9, which should come from NT59's expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, step by step:\n\n1. The start is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\n2. So the first non-terminal is NT17, which needs to produce the next symbols.\n\n3. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So the symbols we expect next are from NT37 and NT54.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t4 (NT17's production), so after that, NT37 and NT54. Let me see what NT37 and NT54 expand into.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT9 NT6? Wait, looking at NT54's productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT2 NT5?

Oh, wait, NT54 is listed as:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT13 NT54  \nWait, that can't be right, because if NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT54, that's a left recursion, but that's not possible here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in copying the grammar.

Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the base case when a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the structure of the grammar to see the possible production paths. Each rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals, which are the leaves in the parse tree. The string has 23 tokens, each prefixed by a space, but I think the spaces are just for readability, so the actual tokens are separated by spaces. So the string is a sequence of these terminal tokens: t10, t3, t1, t1, t8, t1, t10, t8, t2, t8, t6, t4, t3, t1, t2, t10, t0, t11, t6, t9, t11, t8, t3.\n\nNext, I notice that the grammar's rules connect a bunch of non-terminals to different terminal symbols. Each rule in the grammar connects two non-terminals except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59, and NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, but then some NT rules produce a single terminal like NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, but wait, that's still two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking again, some of the rules appear to have more than two non-terminals? Let me check the given grammar rules:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, every production is a combination of two non-terminals except for some cases where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. For example, NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41. Hmm, no, even if a non-terminal produces two terminals, it's not directly part of the given grammar since each production has non-terminals. So, when a non-terminal is connected to terminals, it's via two non-terminals in a way, because each rule has two non-terminals on the right. So each terminal in the string must be generated by a non-terminal that has a production rule leading directly to that terminal, or via some chain.\n\nBut wait, look at some rules: for example, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, which are both non-terminals. Similarly, NT59 has rules like NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, but also NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. So each application reduces the number of non-terminals, moving closer to terminals. The process is to start from S and generate strings by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nSince the length of the string is 23 tokens, the parse tree must have a certain structure. The maximum possible height of the parse tree will depend on the number of variables and terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation must consist of steps that replace a single non-terminal (the left-hand side of the production) with two non-terminals each time.\n\nBut in this case, the given grammar only has rules that produce two non-terminals each. So each step in the derivation replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals, increasing the count by one. So, starting from S, which is one non-terminal, each replacement increases the number of symbols (both non-terminals and terminals) by one. The initial count is 1 (S). After each step, it increments by one. To reach 23 symbols, how many steps are needed? Let's see: the formula is number of steps = (final length - initial length) - 1. Wait, starting at 1, each step adds 1. So after n steps, number of symbols is 1 + n. For 23, n = 22 steps. So the parse tree depth is 22, but that seems high. But regardless, the key is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by a unique path from the root to a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nHowever, another approach is to work backwards. Starting from the string, try to split it into two parts that each correspond to the left-hand sides of some production rules. For example, does the string start with two symbols that can be generated by any NT? Let's see the first symbol is 't10'. We need to find an NT that can produce 't10' as the start of a production. Looking at the grammar rules, 't10' appears as the terminal for:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t6, but no, NT36 is followed by t2 in its rule.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for each NT: For example, many of the NTs have rules that produce two terms. But perhaps I can find which NTs can directly produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, we have several NTs that have terminals in their rules:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t10\nNT36 \u2192 t6, but also appears in other rules\nNT15 \u2192 t0\nNT16 \u2192 t5\nNT24 \u2192 t10\nNT49 \u2192 t3 or t11\nNT55 \u2192 t8\nAnd others.\n\nSo, 't10' can be produced by NT8, NT24, or perhaps another NT. So, the first step is to split the string into three possible options: the first two symbols could be any combination that can be generated by a production of a specific NT.\n\nWait, since each production produces two non-terminals, but a terminal is only produced when a non-terminal derives to that terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a tree. Let me try to structure the string as a possible parse tree.\n\nBut to get more organized, maybe I can think of the string as a sequence and try to find possible splits that correspond to the productions.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\nThe first two symbols: 't10' 't3'\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there an NT that produces 't10' followed by 't3'? So, is there a production of the form NT x,y such that one of x and y is 't10' and the other is 't3'. Or perhaps 't10' is the first symbol, which requires the NT to have 't10' as the first part of its production.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to create a reduction table, mapping each terminal to its possible NT productions.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the rule NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, but each NT's terminal productions are:\n\nLooking for NTs that derive to 't10':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't10' (from a production: NT24 \u2192 't10')\n- Also, NT49 \u2192 't10' (wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I see lines like NT49 \u2192 't7' or 't10'? Let me check.\n\nActually, in the given grammar, there are multiple lines with 't' as terminal:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't6', but there's another production for NT36: NT36 \u2192 't2'\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11'\n- NT25 \u2192 't7'\n- NT57 \u2192 't7'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5', 't3', 't10'\n- NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'\n- NT59 \u2192 't12', 't16', but also NT59 \u2192 't12' or other combinations\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look at each NT rule and note which terminals they produce.\n\nHere is a comprehensive list of each NT's productions:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12, NT55 NT43, NT16 NT17, NT17 NT54, NT12 NT54.\n   Wait, the actual rules are:\n\nNT0:\n- \u2192 NT55 NT12\n- \u2192 NT55 NT43\n- \u2192 NT16 NT17\n- \u2192 NT17 NT54\n- \u2192 NT43 NT25\n- \u2192 NT49 NT18\n- \u2192 NT59 NT12\n- \u2192 NT59 NT16\nEtc.

{"custom_id":"request-437","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t11 t9 t7 t5 t4 t8 t9 t2 t1 t8 t6 t0 t10 t11 t1 t2 t4 t3 t2 t4 t2 t0 t0`. Hmm, that's quite a long string with a bunch of t's and numbers. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the rules here are in that form or leading directly to terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which directly goes to NT17 NT59. So to get any string from S, we'll need to expand these non-terminals until we reach terminals. \n\nI need to see if the string provided can be built up by expanding the non-terminals. Since the string consists only of terminals, I have to make sure that each part of the string can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me break the string into parts to see if each segment can be matched to the production rules. The string is split as t11 t9 t7 t5 t4 t8 t9 t2 t1 t8 t6 t0 t10 t11 t1 t2 t4 t3 t2 t4 t2 t0 t0.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some rules might be leading to multiple non-terminals that can be further expanded. So perhaps the string is built by a series of these productions.\n\nI think I should try to parse the string from the end or use some kind of top-down approach. Alternatively, maybe building a parse tree would help, but since I'm dealing with a written string, it's a bit tricky. \n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the given grammar. Let's consider the grammar rules and see how they can be applied step by step.\n\nLooking at S -> NT17 NT59. So the string starts with NT17 and NT59. I need to check the productions for NT17 and NT59.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT17 -> NT37 NT54, and NT59 -> either NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24. But looking at the string, the first part is t11, which is a terminal. So I need to see if one of these non-terminals can derive to t11.\n\nLooking at NT17, it's NT37 NT54. Now, NT37 -> NT49 NT18, etc., but not sure if that leads to t11. NT54 -> NT55 NT0, which seems longer. Maybe that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, NT59 has two options: NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24. Let's check NT18: NT18 -> 't10', which is a terminal. Hmm. So if NT59 uses NT18 NT36, then the t10 would come from NT18. But the first t is t11, which isn't t10. So maybe the other rule: NT59 -> NT57 NT24. But then, NT57 -> NT8 NT41, etc. Wait, NT24 has productions: NT24 -> 't10', 't5', etc. So NT24 can produce t10, t5, etc., but the first is t11, which isn't matched by either. Hmm, so maybe the first part of the string is not generated by S directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that perhaps the grammar requires multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with some derivations that I need to follow. Maybe it's better to approach this systematically.\n\nLet me try building the string step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I reach the string.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, the first two non-terminals are NT17 and NT59. Let's see their possible expansions.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT59 \u2192 either NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, the start becomes NT37 NT54 NT18 NT36 or NT37 NT54 NT57 NT24.\n\nBut let's see the string starts with t11, so I need a production that leads to t11. Looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce t11. Wait, did I miss that?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce t11. That\u2019s a red flag. Because if none of the non-terminals produce t11 directly, then the string starting with t11 shouldn't be possible because the only way to get terminals is through non-terminals that expand into them, but if the grammar doesn't have any production that directly leads to t11, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some terminals might be derived indirectly through multiple steps. So perhaps through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, looking again, the terminals are things like t0, t1, etc. The non-terminals are all the NTs (NT0, NT1, etc.), but from the given rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce t11. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the terminals are only t0, t1, t2, etc., but checking each production:\n\n- NT0 has rules leading to t6, t1, etc.\n\n- NT15 leads to 't0'.\n\n- NT43 leads to NT5 NT15, which ultimately might lead to 't5' and 't0' or other terminals.\n\nWait, but does any non-terminal derive to t11?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces t11. Let me check.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions, let's see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't10', 't5', etc.\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11'\n\nAh, here we go. NT49 can derive to 't3' or 't11'. So 't11' is a terminal derived from NT49.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with t11, which must come from NT49.\n\nSo, if the first part of the expansion is NT49, but wait, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT17 NT59. So how do we get to NT49?\n\nLet me think: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the two parts are NT17 and NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, but if NT57 is NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, and NT24 \u2192 't10', 't5', etc., but in the initial expansion from S, the first part is NT17 and NT59, which then expand to NT37 and NT54 for NT17, and NT57 and NT24 for NT59.\n\nBut none of these directly produce t11. So perhaps the string starts with t11, which comes from a different non-terminal, but that would require that NT17 or NT59 somehow derive to a series that includes t11, which doesn't seem possible based on the given rules.\n\nWait, but perhaps the parsing is more intricate. Maybe the string isn't directly the result of S's expansion, but rather a string that's a combination of different derivations. Alternatively, maybe the entire string isn't just a single derivation path from S, but perhaps it's a concatenation of multiple derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t11, but in the grammar, the only way to get t11 is via NT49, so perhaps that NT49 is part of the expansion downstream.\n\nWait, but NT49 is derived from NT59, as per the rules. Let me check NT59's rules. NT59 has two options: NT57 NT24 or NT59 NT12.\n\nWait, sorry, looking back: NT59 \u2192 either NT57 NT24 or NT12 NT16.\n\nHmm, so S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then NT59 can be either NT57 NT24 or NT12 NT16. So the overall expansion from S would be:\n\nIf NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24:\n\nThen S \u2192 NT17 (NT37 NT54) NT57 (NT8 NT41) NT24 (could be 't10' or 't5' etc.)\n\nAlternatively, if NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, then S \u2192 NT17 (NT37 NT54) NT12 (NT5 NT43) NT16 (NT55 NT32), which could be more complicated.\n\nBut nowhere in these do I see an immediate path to t11"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.

Let's list the terminals in the string:\n\nt10, t10, t7, t1, t2, t1, t9, t4, t9, t5, t8, t5, t6, t9, t11, t10, t4, t8, t5, t4, t3, t9, t3, t3.\n\nI notice that some of these are directly produced by non-terminals:\n\n- t0: NT15, NT18, NT2, NT43, NT5, NT25 (multiple rules)\n- t1: NT0\n- t2: NT5, NT25, NT57\n- t3: NT8, NT49, NT5, NT56\n- t4: NT17, NT36, NT44\n- t5: NT16, NT24, NT25, NT54, NT59\n- t6: NT43, NT16, NT59\n- t7: NT49, NT57, NT59\n- t8: NT55, NT59, NT49\n- t9: NT54, NT37\n- t10: NT2, NT15, NT17, NT24, NT43, NT57\n- t11: NT24\n\nSo, the string has all of these, but some terminals may not directly correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. Alternatively, maybe some of the terminals can be built from non-terminals, but in this case, the grammar seems to have direct productions for each terminal, except for the non-terminals that can produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial string uses only t11, which is only produced by NT24.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal can generate two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 and NT59. So S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is: `t11 t2 t4 t6 t4 t11 t10 t1 t5 t8 t6 t9 t9 t1 t8 t0 t2 t7 t7 t6 t6 t5 t2 t7`.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar. Each terminal corresponds to a production step where that terminal is produced. So each time I see a terminal like 't4', it's a leaf in the parse tree, which must come from a production rule that directly produces it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce terminals, like NT49 \u2192 't3', NT25 \u2192 't7', NT36 \u2192 't6', etc. But others, like NT17, produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo the plan is to split the string into tokens (each t...) and see if there's a way to parse them step by step using the grammar. Maybe building a parse tree or using dynamic programming for CYK, but since the grammar is small, perhaps I can do it manually.\n\nLet me write down the string as a list: t11, t2, t4, t6, t4, t11, t10, t1, t5, t8, t6, t9, t9, t1, t8, t0, t2, t7, t7, t6, t6, t5, t2, t7.\n\nI need to check if each terminal can be generated from the symbols in the grammar, starting from S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first symbol must be produced by NT17 or NT59.\n\nBut the first terminal is 't11'. Looking at NT59's productions: I see NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and perhaps more, but let me check.\n\nWait, the NT59 productions are:\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and perhaps others, but the main point is that NT59 can produce 't6' because one of its paths eventually leads to 't6'. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT59 productions given:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24 \u2192 hmm, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look carefully.\n\nIn the grammar, the NT59 productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nAdditionally, there might be more, but perhaps those are the ones provided. So NT59 can go to these two options.\n\nSo, can NT59 derive 't6'? Let's see. From NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36: both of these are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT18: NT18 \u2192 NT99? No, in the grammar, it's NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, right?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me check all the NT59 productions.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, both of these are the only productions for NT59.\n\nNow, looking at NT18, do we have any productions?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't0', yes.\n\nSo if NT59 produces NT18 \u2192 't0', but the string starts with 't11', which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me check the NT17 production.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So to generate the string, the first symbol comes from either NT17 or NT59.\n\nSince the string starts with 't11', which is a terminal. Let me check what nt17 and nt59 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17's production:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nSo NT17 is broken down into NT37 and NT54. Each of these is a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is that S produces NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo the string's first symbol (t11) must be generated by NT37 or NT54.\n\nLooking at NT54's productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT13 NT2\nNT54 \u2192 NT54 NT5 \u2192 Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2', but also some other productions.\n\nWait, let me list all NT54's productions:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2' (I see it's provided as 't0' earlier, but perhaps I'm missing something).\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT54: I think it's NT54 \u2192 't2'? Let me double-check.\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2' \u2192 No, wait, looking again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT54: I don't see it, but let me check. Wait, under NT56: NT56 \u2192 't5'. But looking for NT54, I think the production is:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2' ?\n\nWait, no, looking back, I think I might have misread.\n\nLet me look again at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT54, I see that NT54 \u2192 't2' is not directly listed. Let's see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused because the grammar has a lot of NTs, so perhaps I missed this. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the NT54 \u2192 't2' is not present. Instead, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2' is not a given production; instead, perhaps I'm looking at another NT.

{"custom_id":"request-476","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string in question is a sequence of t's with numbers. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. So every step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two other symbols. That means the string should have a length that's one more than the number of non-terminals in the derivation, right?\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT17 NT59. So the process starts with S, which immediately splits into NT17 and NT59.\n\nThe target string is `t6 t3 t0 t5 t1 t0 t4 t1 t0 t7 t4 t3 t8 t11 t4 t2 t7 t1 t8 t9 t4 t9 t1 t7 t0`. Let me count the number of tokens here. Let's see: 24 tokens. So, starting from S, each rule application replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So the number of symbols (including non-terminals and terminals) at each step will be 2, 4, 6, etc., each time increasing by 1 (but actually, increasing by 1 for each replacement). Hmm, actually, the length after each step is 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Wait, no, because each non-terminal can be replaced two at a time. So the length is calculated as L = 2^k, where k is the number of times non-terminals are replaced. But let's think differently: to get a string of length 24, starting from S which can generate two symbols, each replacement of a non-terminal could contribute a terminal. So the total number of terminals is 24, and the number of non-terminals in the derivation could be 23 (since each replacement splits one into two). But maybe that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, since the initial symbol S produces two non-terminals, each of those could then produce more non-terminals, and each terminal is a t followed by a number. So to get 24 terminals, the derivation path would have to have 24 - 1 = 23 steps (since each step increases the count by 1, starting from 1 at S). Wait, no, each S->NT17 NT59 increases the length from 1 to 2. Then each replacement also increases the count. But this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string bottom-up or top-down to see if it can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to look for a parsing strategy. Let me try to find if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's list the productions again briefly to see possible matches:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT57 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT57 -> NT57 NT24 (Wait, I think in the given grammar, it's \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\" and \"NT59 -> NT57 NT24\", not NT57 twice. Wait, I need to check: the user input was \"NT59 -> NT57 NT24\". Yes, that's correct. So NT59 produces NT57 and NT24, but NT24 is a terminal? Let me check the terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules, many end with 't' followed by a number. For example, `NT59 -> 't6'` which I think is a terminal. Similarly:\n\nLooking for production rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. Let's list them:\n\n- NT59 -> 't6' (wait, the user input was \"NT59 -> 't6'\", so NT59 can produce 't6'.\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6' (duplicate)\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6', 't1', etc.\nWait, the user wrote the grammar with multiple entries for some non-terminals. For instance, NT2 has three productions leading to 't0', 't6', 't4'. Similarly, NT5 has a bunch.\n\nWait, the way the grammar is written is a bit confusing. Each rule is in the form NTx -> something. But the 'something' can be either a terminal or another production. For example, NT59 -> NT18 NT36, or NT59 could produce a terminal directly like 't6'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's input, the grammar has rules ending with 't'... So for example, 'NT59 -> 't6'' means that NT59 can derive t6 directly. Similarly, 'NT59 -> 't3'' would be another terminal. But wait, looking back, in the provided grammar, I don't see any explicit 't's except for specific ones. For example, NT59 -> NT18 NT36 or NT59 -> 't6'. So yes, some NT symbols derive directly to terminals, and others split into more NTs.\n\nSo in our string, the tokens are terminals like t6, t3, etc., so each of these must correspond to either a direct production from a NT symbol or via a chain of productions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the way to approach this is to try to parse the string by matching the longest possible productions first, then work our way down.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can model this as a top-down parsing problem, considering that each step reduces the non-terminals by one and introduces terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is given, perhaps a better approach is to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that the grammar can produce, matching the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree bottom-up.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is `t6 t3 t0 t5 t1 t0 t4 t1 t0 t7 t4 t3 t8 t11 t4 t2 t7 t1 t8 t9 t4 t9 t1 t7 t0`.\n\nThat's 24 tokens, which is even, so perhaps it's feasible.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which must produce two NTs: NT17 and NT59.\n\nSo the first split of S is into NT17 and NT59.\n\nEach of those will produce two symbols, so the entire string must be produced by a combination of these rules.\n\nSo, for NT17, according to the grammar, NT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 can produce 't6' directly or split into more NTs. Since in the string, the first token is t6, perhaps NT59 can directly produce t6.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT59 has two productions that lead directly to terminals: \"NT59 -> 't6'\" is one, but wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided grammar lines for NT59: \n\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT59 -> 't18 NT36'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Looking again, the user input was:\n\nFor NT59:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT59 -> 't57' NT57 ...\"\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\nWait, perhaps the user wrote it as multiple lines, so each line is a separate production. So in the user's grammar, lines like \"NT59 -> 't6'\" would mean that NT59 can produce the terminal t6.

So NT17 can be split into NT37 and NT54.\n\nNow, I need to check how the string starts with 't10 t11 t11 t0 ...'. Let's see what NT37 can produce. Looking at NT37's productions, one is NT37 -> NT49 NT18. Another is NT37 -> NT44 NT9. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT37 -> NT49 NT18, and NT37 -> NT44 NT9? Wait, no, let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT37 -> NT49 NT18 and NT54 -> NT55 NT5, but for NT37, it's only NT49 NT18. Wait, let me check again. The grammar provided includes:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nSo for NT17, we have to split it into NT37 and NT54. Let me take the string: it starts with t10, t11, t11, t0, etc.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Each non-terminal should be expanded until we get a terminal. Since the string is long, maybe we can construct the parse tree from the start.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT17 NT59. So the first two symbols should be a production from NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSo NT17 is NT37 NT54. Now, NT37 -> NT49 NT18.\n\nSo the first part would be NT49 and NT18. Let's see what NT49 does: NT49 -> 't3' and NT49 -> 't7'. So maybe the first token is t3 or t7, but in the string, the first token is t10. Hmm, that's a problem. That suggests that NT17's expansion doesn't match the start of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see NT37 -> NT49 NT18. But is there another rule for NT37? Looking back: No, I think only one rule. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I think I might have misread it. Let me re-express the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n- NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n- NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n- NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT41 \u2192 't6' (Wait, is there a rule where NT41 -> 't6'? Because in the initial list, the user wrote: NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT56, and then below, 't6'. Wait, maybe the user made a typo, because NT41 can't be a terminal if it's written as NT41 \u2192 't6'; that would be a production to a terminal. So perhaps the rule is ND41 \u2192 t6. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, after the initial production list, there are lines that start with identifiers, which might indicate the actual productions to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar was written with two parts: production rules and terminal symbols.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember has certain rules, like each production being either a terminal or two non-terminals. The string provided is a series of 't' tokens with numbers attached, which probably represent terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar to understand how it can generate strings. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which means any string generated by this grammar must start with two non-terminals, NT17 and NT59. So the string should begin with the sequences that NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nThe given string is `t5 t10 t1 t10 t5 t5 t4 t0 t6 t3 t2 t4 t2 t6 t1 t11 t4 t9 t3 t11 t4 t5 t6 t3 t6 t0`. I need to see if this can be broken down into the symbols allowed by the grammar. \n\nI notice that NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, so NT17 splits into NT37 and NT54. Let's see what those can do.

Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT54: Does it have that? Let me check.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t0 t11 t9 t3 t6 t1 t8 t10 t4 t4 t11 t3 t0 t4 t1 t3 t7 t3 t2 t9 t7 t9 t6 t1 t6 t10`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF grammars have productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, it fits the CNF criteria. That\u2019s a good start.\n\nNow, the main goal is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm is efficient for parsing context-free grammars, especially when the grammar is in CNF, as it simplifies the lookups.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell represents whether a non-terminal can derive a certain substring. For each position in the string, it checks which productions can generate the substring and updates the table accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the steps for using the CYK algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create a table with rows representing the length of the substring and columns for each position in the string. The first row (length 1) marks the terminals directly produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\n2. **Filling the Table**: For each row (increasing length of substrings) and column (each position), determine if any non-terminal can derive the substring starting at that position. This involves checking all possible productions that match the current substring.\n\n3. **Checking for Start Symbol**: After filling the table, check if the start symbol S can derive the entire string (i.e., the entire input). If yes, the string is accepted; otherwise, it's rejected.\n\nBut since the string is quite long (34 tokens), doing this manually would be very time-consuming. Instead, I can look for a smarter approach by trying to match the string step by step through possible productions, especially focusing on the transitions that could lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the provided string, it starts with `t0 t11 t9 t3...`. I should see if these terminals can be derived by any non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look for non-terminals that can produce `t0`, `t11`, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, I can collect the productions for each non-terminal:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36 (and another NT59 but that might be a typo or another production, but looking back, I see the next line has NT59 -> NT12 NT16)\n\nWait, actually, looking again, in the grammar list, after NT59 -> NT18 NT36, there's another line: NT59 -> NT12 NT16. So, NT59 has two productions: NT18 NT36 and NT12 NT16.\n\nSimilarly, NT41 has NT16 NT56 and NT43 NT5?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLet me try to list all non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT56 (Wait, checking the lines: Yes, I see NT43 -> NT5 NT15 and others, but in the given grammar, I need to list each production correctly.\n\nWait, I think it's better to go through each production line:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or a non-terminal expanding into two other non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string and break it down. The string is: `t7 t0 t4 t6 t6 t5 t10 t1 t0 t7 t10 t5 t2 t0 t7 t3 t3 t8 t10 t5 t4 t6 t9 t0 t5 t6 t10`.\n\nI notice it's a sequence of `t` tokens. The grammar has several productions that expand non-terminals into these `t` tokens. My goal is to parse this string step by step using the grammar.\n\nI'll start by examining the start symbol `S`. The production for `S` is `NT17 NT59`, so `S` expands to NT17 followed by NT59. \n\nLooking at NT59, it can produce either `t7`, or `t18`, or `t59`. Wait, the grammar for NT59 has two options: `t7`, `t18`, or `t59`. Wait, no\u2014let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking more carefully, the grammar shows NT59 as having the production: NT59 -> NT18 NT36, and also NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and another option where it's `t7` but wait, looking back: \n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the lines for NT59 are:\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- Also, there's NT57 -> NT8 NT41, etc., but I think I might be missing some. Wait, no\u2014the user only provided certain lines, so the NT59 productions are likely the two: NT59 -> NT18 NT36 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24, plus perhaps another from earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back, the user provided lines for NT59: there's \"NT59 -> NT18 NT36\" and \"NT59 -> NT57 NT24\". So, NT59 can expand to these non-terminals. So I might have to see how the string can be broken down into these non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a 't7'. Hmm, in the grammar, the only `t` terminal symbols are in the productions like NT49 -> 't3', NT36 -> 't6', etc. So perhaps I need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT37 -> 't9', NT36 -> 't6' etc. Wait, maybe I should list the options step by step.\n\nWait, let's start with the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo first, NT17 and NT59 both need to derive sequences that, when combined, form the start string.\n\nLooking at NT17: The production is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 can go to NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24.\n\nSo the string starts with t7. Let's see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT17: It becomes NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 is NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nAnd NT54 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the lines for NT54 include NT54 -> 't7', and also NT54 -> NT17 NT54 (but that might be a recursive production). Alternatively, perhaps in the grammar provided, let me make a list of all possible `t` productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines provided by the user, the only `t` terminals are:\n\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't0' (Wait, is that in the grammar? Let me check: yes, line says NT36 -> 't6' and 't0' and 't4'? Wait, no: looking back, the user's grammar has:\n\n- NT36 -> 't2'?

For example, NT41 -> 't6', NT49 -> 't3', NT24 -> 't10', etc.\n\nSo to parse the string, the first step is to see how it can be broken down.\n\nThe string starts with `t7 t0 t4 t6 t6 t5 t10 t1 t0 t7 t10 t5 t2 t0 t7 t3 t3 t8 t10 t5 t4 t6 t9 t0 t5 t6 t10`.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to try to match the string against the grammar by starting from the start symbol and expanding non-terminals, ensuring that each production matches a part of the string.\n\nLet me try to write down the entire string as a list of tokens for easier manipulation:\n\nstring = [\n't7',\n't0',\n't4',\n't6',\n't6',\n't5',\n't10',\n't1',\n't0',\n't7',\n't10',\n't5',\n't2',\n't0',\n't7',\n't3',\n't3',\n't8',\n't10',\n't5',\n't4',\n't6',\n't9',\n't0',\n't5',\n't6',\n't10'\n]\n\nThis is a list of 26 tokens.\n\nThe start is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So we need the first part of NT17 and NT59 to match the first part of the string.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo after S, we expand to NT37 NT54. Now, the string starts with 't7', so let's see if NT37 can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking up NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nThen, NT49 can produce 't3', 't5', or 't11'. Wait, no\u2014looking through the grammar rules, NT49 can produce:\n\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. If NT49 is 't3', then NT18 would produce the next token. But the first token in the string is 't7', not 't3', so that's a problem. Alternatively, if NT49 is 't11', that's still not 't7'.

{"custom_id":"request-508","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string is quite long, so I need to approach this methodically. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and 'a' is a terminal. This is important because it simplifies the parsing process, but for this problem, I just need to use it to parse the string.\n\nThe grammar provided has a start symbol S, which is \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the start string is S, and the first step is to split the string into these two parts: NT17 and NT59. Each of these NTs needs to produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT17 can go to NT37 NT54 or be t4 or t5 or t7 in some cases based on other rules. Wait, actually, in the start symbol, NT17 is followed by NT59, so each of these must derive to the corresponding terminal sequences.\n\nLet me focus on the string: `t1 t10 t3 t11 t7 t7 t3 t5 t2 t11 t11 t8 t6 t7 t4 t5 t2 t9 t1 t4 t6 t11 t1 t2 t4 t3 t1`.\n\nI think the first step is to parse the string starting with NT17 and NT59. So the string should be divided into two parts, each corresponding to NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's production, it can go to NT37 NT54 or other things. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- Alternatively, in other productions, NT17 can go to t7 from NT54?

The string is `t11 t11 t9 t6 t9 t1 t8 t8 t5 t2 t5 t7 t7 t6 t8 t7 t1 t4 t2 t2 t3 t1 t5 t2 t4 t9 t8 t5`. \n\nHmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Since this can get complex, maybe I can approach it using memoization and dynamic programming. \n\nFirst, I should look for the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is NT17 NT59. So the string should start with a derivation of NT17 NT59. Let me see, the given string starts with t11 t11, so maybe one of these non-terminals produces two t11s.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT11 isn't directly present, but maybe through other productions. Wait, in the productions, I see NT11 isn't listed, but perhaps it's a terminal. No, according to the grammar, NT11 isn't listed as a terminal. Wait, let's check the non-terminals.\n\nIn the productions, I see NT57 and NT59. Hmm, looking at NT59, there are two rules: NT59 -> NT18 NT36, and also NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Similarly, NT24 has a few rules. Let me check if I can get t11 from any of these.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the non-terminals, I don't see any of them directly producing t11, except possibly through some steps. Maybe t11 is a terminal. Let me look for rules ending with 't11'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any directly. But maybe some non-terminals can derive into t11. Wait, 't11' is produced by NT55, maybe? No, looking through:\n\nLet me see, the rules that produce t's are:\n\n- NT44 -> t0\n- NT54 -> t2\n- NT57 -> t7\n- NT49 -> t7, t9, etc.\n- NT37 -> t9, t10\n- NT36 -> t6, t0, t4\n- NT43 -> t10, t5\n- NT17 -> t4, t7, t5\n- NT59 -> t6\n- NT24 -> t0, t5, t10\n- And others like NT2, NT18, etc.\n\nWait, but none of these directly produce 't11'. So maybe 't11' must be a terminal. So perhaps in the derivation, one of the non-terminals must derive straight to 't11'.\n\nWait, looking again, in the productions, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't11'. So each occurrence of t11 in the string must come from a leaf node. So that might mean that in the parse tree, at some point, we have to have a non-terminal that directly produces 't11', which doesn't exist here. So that becomes a problem.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm. Let me look at all the productions to see if any are producing 't11'. \n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT44 -> t0\n- NT54 -> t2\n- NT57 -> t7\n- NT49 -> t7, t9, etc.\n- NT37 -> t9, t10\n- NT36 -> t6, t0, t4\n- NT43 -> t10, t5\n- NT17 -> t4, t7, t5\n- NT59 -> t6\n- NT24 -> t0, t5, t10\n- NT25 -> t7, t2, t7\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT2 -> t0, t6, t4\n- NT18 -> t0\n- NT15 -> t0\n- NT16 -> t5\n- NT32 -> t6\n- NT49 -> t7, t11, t12?\nWait, let me check: Hmm, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nand \n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo no, none of these produce 't11' directly.\n\nLooking for any non-terminal (like NT25, NT37, NT55) that might produce 't11':\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\n\nNT13 -> NT3 NT1\n\nWait, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps 't11' is a terminal, but since it's not defined in any production as a result of a transformation, it must be a terminal in the grammar but not derived from any non-terminals. So, it's possible that in the grammar, 't11' is a terminal symbol, and thus, any occurrence of 't11' in the string must come directly from the start symbol, or through a non-derivation.\n\nWait, but that makes it impossible because S is NT17 NT59, neither of which produce 't11'. So if any 't11' occurs, that would mean that S can't derive into that string. So the conclusion would be No.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me confirm the grammar again:\n\nLooking through all production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't11'. So that would mean that any occurrence of 't11' in the string must be a direct terminal, but as it's not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, the grammar cannot generate a string containing 't11' at all. Hence, the string contains 't11', which cannot be derived from any productions, so the string is not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the production rules, I notice that all non-terminals (like S, NT17, NT59, etc.) expand into pairs of other non-terminals or sometimes into terminals ('t' followed by numbers). In CNF, every production rule must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nI'll list out the production rules to get a clearer picture:\n\n1.

Therefore, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, which can eventually result in terminals.\n\nThe first step is to look at the start symbol S, which according to rule 1 is NT17 NT59.

Hmm, let's start by looking at the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That might help because when parsing, each step can only generate one token at a time, maybe?\n\nThe string I need to check is `t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t8 t7 t2 t1 t6 t5 t1 t4 t4 t0 t0 t0 t8 t5 t4 t2 t9 t10 t9 t6 t8 t7 t2 t2`. That's a lot of t's with numbers attached. I wonder how many tokens there are. Let me count: each space separates tokens, so counting the commas in the string, wait no, the string is split into parts by spaces, so each \"t0\", \"t1\", etc., is a token. Let me count how many tokens there are.\n\nLet's see:  t0, t0, t1, t3, t4, t8, t7, t2, t1, t6, t5, t1, t4, t4, t0, t0, t0, t8, t5, t4, t2, t9, t10, t9, t6, t8, t7, t2, t2. That's 29 tokens. Okay, so the string has 29 tokens.\n\nFirst, I think we need to parse this string step by step according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might work, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can try to see if the string can be generated by the given rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S -> NT17 NT59. So S must expand into NT17 and NT59. Each of these must then be further expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT17 and NT59. So first, I'll split the string into two parts: one part that should be generated by NT17 and another by NT59, and then check if each of those parts can be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, but how long is each part? It depends on how the expansions go. It's a bit tricky because NT rules can expand into different numbers of steps, so the lengths of the two parts could vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can follow the derivation step by step. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with S -> NT17 NT59. So S = NT17 NT59.\n\nEach of these non-terminals must be expanded into a string of terminals. Let's see.\n\nFirst, NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking up the productions for NT17 and NT59.\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nWait, NT17 is part of the start symbol S which is NT17 NT59. So starting with NT17, which splits into NT37 and NT54. Then each of those should be expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 has multiple productions. Looking back, I see NT59 -> NT12 NT16, NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and NT59 -> 't6'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT59 can be:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nBut also, looking back, I think I might have mistyped that. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait, the original grammar has:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16 (line 8?)\n\nWait, in the original grammar, the line given was \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\" and \"NT59 -> NT57 NT24\" are both productions.\n\nSo NT59 can be split into NT12 NT16, or NT57 NT24. But also, looking at the end of the grammar, I see NT59 -> 't6'? Or did I miss that?

{"custom_id":"request-526","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. Okay, first things first, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, but the grammar provided has only two non-terminals on the right except for when a single terminal like 'tN' is produced. So that should be okay.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t5 t9 t1 t5 t2 t9 t3 t9 t9 t6 t4 t10 t10 t0 t10 t1 t3 t7 t7 t6 t7 t8 t1 t7 t9 t11 t2 t5 t0`. That's a lot of tokens separated by spaces. I think the approach here is to simulate a leftmost derivation or maybe some kind of parsing from the top-down starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which produces NT17 and NT59. So the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then, I need to see how NT17 and NT59 can be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT17, I see that it can be rewritten as NT44 NT32. Wait, the grammar has multiple productions for each non-terminal, so I have to choose one at each step. But since it's a parse tree, only one branch at a time is considered.\n\nAlternatively, working backwards, maybe trying to match the string to the grammar. Let me see: the string starts with t5, then t9, t1, etc. So looking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce 'tX's.\n\nFor example, 't5' is produced by NT5 \u2192 t5, NT5\u2192t9, NT56\u2192t5, NT5\u2192t10, and some others. Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT5 can produce t5 (from NT5 \u2192 t5) or t9 (from NT5 \u2192 t9). Similarly, other non-terminals produce various 'tX's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the grammar as a set of rules for clarity. Let me list all the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT57 NT24  Wait, no: looking back, NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41 and another rule? Wait, no, from the initial list, the last few lines:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nNT41 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, no. Let me look again:\n\nThe user provided the grammar, which is a series of lines:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n\n- NT57 -> NT57 NT24  Wait, no\u2014is there a typo? Let me check: in the initial list, the user wrote:\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nYes, so NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, but in the initial list, under NT59, it's:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nand then another line:\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo for NT59, the options are \u2192 NT18 NT36 or \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT5:\n\nWait, in the grammar, let me check if there's a NT5 or similar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT43 -> NT5 NT15. So NT5 is used here, but is NT5 a non-terminal? No, in the context, NT5 would be a non-terminal because it's on the left-hand side of a production.\n\nWait, but looking back, the initial grammar uses only NT0 to NT59 as non-terminals, but the right-hand side of each production is either NT or terminals. Wait, no: in the grammar, when something is written as NT5, it's actually a single terminal because NT5 is in quotes. Wait, wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12, which are non-terminals. Then, for example, NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, so 8 and 41, but wait, the '8' is in quotes, which would mean it's a terminal. Similarly, any NTx where x is a number and in quotes is a terminal.\n\nSo in the grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, meaning NT59, NT57, and NT24 are non-terminals. Each of them breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the string to evaluate, the tokens are t5, t9, etc., which are terminals. So, the question is: does the grammar, starting from S, produce a parse tree where each step produces the string in order, ending up with all non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the best way is to try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to model the grammar as a parse tree and see if each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simulate the derivation.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, this would take a while, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nThe string is: t5 t9 t1 t5 t2 t9 t3 t9 t9 t6 t4 t10 t10 t0 t10 t1 t3 t7 t7 t6 t7 t8 t1 t7 t9 t11 t2 t5 t0.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't5', which must come from some production. Looking at the grammar:\n\nWhich non-terminals produce 't5'? Let's check each production:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0' (does this exist? Wait, in the grammar, NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44, but looking for terminals, do any non-terminals produce 't5'?\n\nWait, let's look at each production:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t5, t9\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t5, t9\n\n- NT56 \u2192 t5 (assuming NT56's production is \u2192 't5').\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT5 produces 't5' and 't9'\n\nWait, in the first line after S, I see NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17. NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56, so NT16 is NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32, etc.\n\nWait, let me restructure the grammar:\n\nEach non-terminal can either produce two non-terminals (as per Chomsky normal form) or terminals.\n\nLet me note which non-terminals have terminal productions:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59 (non-terminals, so no terminal)\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\n- NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nWait, NT57 and NT59 have 't's, but in this case, are the 't's considered terminals?

{"custom_id":"request-543","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make things a bit easier because it limits the possible derivations, and I can probably use some kind of parsing method or recursive approach to check.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t6 t6 t5 t11 t6 t10 t6 t9 t8 t4 t0 t9 t3 t8 t9 t7 t10 t11 t2 t11 t8 t4 t5 t6 t1 t5 t2 t9 t8` \n\nLet me first look at the grammar rules and see the possible derivations. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string should be of length 2n-1 if it's generated by a string of n terminals. The given string has 36 tokens, so 2n-1 = 36 \u2192 n = 18.5, which is not an integer. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I got that wrong. Or perhaps the grammar allows for other structures, like maybe the initial non-terminals can derive into something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each step in the derivation increases the length by one. So the total number of terminal symbols should be 2^k where k is the number of steps, minus something. Or more accurately, each application of a rule that produces two non-terminals adds one to the length. So the total number of terminals in the string should be one less than the number of non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the length of the string. The string has 36 tokens, which are all terminals. So the number of terminals T is 36. The structure must have T = 2n -1, but 2n-1=36 \u2192 n=18.5, which isn't an integer. That suggests that the string is not possible under this grammar because the number of terminals can't be an even number? Or wait, maybe I'm calculating it wrong.\n\nWait, each application of a production that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals increases the number of symbols by one. Starting from S -> NT17 NT59, which is two symbols. Each step where a non-terminal is replaced by two others increases the total symbols by one. So the total number of symbols is 2 + k, where k is the number of productions used. So the total would be 2 + k. So if the string has 36 tokens, then 2 + k = 36 \u2192 k=34. So the number of productions is 34, which is possible. So maybe it's possible.\n\nBut let me think about the structure. The starting symbol is S, which expands to NT17 and NT59. Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually expands into a sequence of terminals. So the entire string should consist of the expansions of these two branches. Maybe I can try to split the string into two parts, corresponding to the two branches from S.\n\nIn the example, the string is long, so maybe it's better to build a parse tree or use dynamic programming for CYK like parsing.\n\nBut since I'm just doing this manually, maybe I can look for possible matches step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can track possible expansions.\n\nLet me try to see if the first few symbols fit.\n\nThe first token is t6. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t6?\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT17 can produce t6 or be broken down further.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT10\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\ngrammar rules:\n\nNT17: S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT17: NT37 NT54 \u2192 but looking at the list, it also says NT17 \u2192 NT4 and NT56.\n\nWait, let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT4 NT56\n\nWait, no, actually, in the provided grammar, NT17 is defined as:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNo, wait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nLines with NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nSo yes, NT17 can produce NT37 and NT54.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right. The string given is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me write that out to have it clear: `t9 t4 t11 t7 t6 t7 t2 t3 t11 t9 t11 t3 t3 t2 t8 t10 t3 t4 t3 t10 t6 t9 t6 t5 t11 t5 t2 t3 t9 t10`.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar and see how it can generate the string. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have three terminal symbols and all non-terminals appear on the right-hand side of production rules. Let me look through the grammar to identify the start symbol and the terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions, the start symbol is S. The right-hand side of S is NT17 NT59. So everything starts from S. Now, I need to see if S can derive the given string.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t1, t2, etc., which are terminals. So I need to see if the derivations can lead to exactly this sequence.\n\nLet me think about the process of parsing. I can start with S -> NT17 NT59. Then, each of NT17 and NT59 can produce further non-terminals or terminals. This seems like a top-down parsing scenario, where each step expands non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nI think it might be helpful to represent the derivation steps. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT17 NT59\nNow, let me see where NT17 and NT59 lead.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nSo, NT17 expands into NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\nSo NT37 becomes NT49 and NT18.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11' (from the grammar rules: NT49 -> 't3', NT49 -> 't11')\nLooking at the string, after s, the first t is t9, so let's see where t9 could come from.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the root of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t9. Let me see if any rule ends with t9. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, which doesn't produce t9.\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18; NT49 can be 't3' or 't11'; NT18 \u2192 't9'.\nSo, if NT37 becomes 't11' (from NT49->t11) and NT18 becomes 't9', then I can get t11 t9 in the string, which doesn't match the starting t9.\n\nAlternatively, if NT49 is 't3', then NT18 must produce t9.

The string I need to evaluate is: \n\n`t7 t1 t7 t1 t8 t1 t8 t10 t9 t7 t9 t11 t3 t11 t7 t0 t10 t7 t11 t0 t3 t6 t0 t8 t10 t6 t0 t7 t2 t7 t3`\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF has no productions with more than two non-terminals on the right, and all non-terminals have at least two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either produces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT17 and NT59. So, the first step is to see how the string can be broken down starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with t7. Looking at the grammar, I notice several NT productions that can produce t's. For example, NT59 -> t12 t16, but wait, that's not directly a t.

So this would produce t10 and NTs. Maybe not useful for t7.\n\n- NT59: It has two versions. One is NT59 -> NT12 NT16. NT12 -> NT5 NT43. NT43 -> NT5 NT15. NT5 -> t5. NT15 -> NT16 NT56. NT16 -> NT55 NT32. NT55 -> NT25 NT0. This seems like a long chain. Maybe there's another NT59 production.\n\nAnother NT59 production is NT59 -> NT57 NT24. NT57 -> NT8 NT41. NT8 -> t10. NT24 -> t10 or t0. Hmm, but I'm looking for t7, so maybe that's not where it starts.\n\nWait, actually, looking for NTs that directly produce t's:\n\n- NT25 -> NT2... Wait, let me recheck all NT rules.\n\nGoing through each NT:\n\n- NT57: NT57 -> NT8 NT41. NT8 is a terminal t10. So NT57 is t10 and NT41.\n\n- NT59: as above.\n\n- NT0: in some production, like NT59 -> NT0, or NT0 -> 't6'\n\nLooking through each NT production, the ones that produce terminal strings are:\n\n- NT57 -> t7 t9 (Yes, wait, does NT57 produce t7 t9? Let me check: The line says NT57 -> NT8 NT41. NT8 is t10, and NT41 is NT16 NT56, which don't produce t's? So NT57 in that case produces t10 and maybe other NTs, not t7. So maybe not contributing to the t7 in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look carefully.\n\nEach line:\n\n- NT57: NT57 -> NT8 NT41.\n\nNT8 is a terminal 't10', right? Because NT8's rule is NT8 -> 't10'.\n\nSo NT57 can produce t10 and NT41. NT41's rule: NT41 -> NT16 NT56, and then those are non-terminals unless they produce terminals.\n\nLet's see NT56: The line says NT56 -> 't6'. So NT41 will produce NT16 and t6.\n\nBut NT16: NT16 -> NT55 NT32. NT55 is a non-terminal, and NT32 is a non-terminal. So NT16 doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nWait, NT59's rule: NT59 -> NT57 NT24.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\n- NT59 can produce NT57 and NT24.\n\nAs before, NT57 produces t10 and NT41, which produces t6 and NT32, which is... Hmm.\n\nWait, this is getting too complex. Maybe I should look for NTs that directly produce t's from the beginning.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT25 -> NT2... Looking at NT24's production: NT24 can be 't10' or 't0'. So if I have a t10 or t0, that could contribute.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t7, so I must find an NT that can produce t7.\n\nLooking through the NT production rules, does any NT directly produce t7?\n\nLooking at NT44: Maybe not. Let me check each NT.\n\nNT25's production is NT25 -> NT13 NT44. NT13 is NT13 -> 't3' or 't2'. NT13 -> 't3', so NT25 would produce 't3' and NT44.\n\nNT44's production: NT44 -> NT5 NT15. NT5 -> 't5'; NT15 -> NT16 NT56, which don't produce terminals.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nWait, looking at the NT57's production: NT57 -> NT8 NT41. NT8 is 't10' and NT41 is NT16 NT56, which are both non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps NT41 can produce t6. Because NT56's rule is 't6'.\n\nSo NT41: NT16 NT56. NT56 produces 't6'. So NT41 produces 't6' and NT16.\n\nNT16: NT55 NT32. NT55 is NT25 NT0, which are non-terminals. NT32 is NT2 NT36. NT2 is 't0', 't6', or 't4'. NT36 is 't2'.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.

{"custom_id":"request-556","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I need to understand how the grammar works and how to apply it to the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the rules, I can see that S \u2192 NT17 NT59 is the first production. So, the top-level parse will have to produce NT17 and NT59.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t3 t11 t6 t9 t11 t1 t10 t8 t10 t11 t8 t9 t6 t5 t2 t1 t5 t3 t11 t1 t2 t9 t9 t9 t3 t10 t7 t5 t1 t0 t8`.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the string into its components: it's a sequence of t3, t11, t6, t9, etc., all separated by spaces. Each of these is a terminal symbol, I believe. So, the task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nSince the grammar uses non-terminals like NT0, NT1, NT4, and so on, I'll need to track how these non-terminals are being used and whether they can be reduced to the terminals in the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the initial step would be to produce two non-terminals: NT17 and NT59. These must each eventually produce sequences of terminals that match the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at NT17 and NT59, let's see their productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT17 can produce NT37 NT54. NT59 has several productions, including NT12 NT16, NT57 NT24, and others. Wait, the string starts with t3, so maybe NT59 produces t3 somewhere?\n\nWait, looking at NT59's productions: I see NT59 -> NT12 NT16 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Are there other NT59 productions? Let me check: Yes, there's also NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and possibly others? Wait, in the initial part, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nBut looking again, the NT59 productions given are: NT59 -> NT12 NT16, NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and perhaps some others? Wait, in the initial grammar, the user listed:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait, no, looking again, the user wrote:\n\n\"Here's the grammar...\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nNT24 -> NT5 NT15\n\nWait, so NT59 has three productions:\n\n1) NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\n2) NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait, but in the initial message, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nOther entries continue...\"\n\nSo, NT59 has two main productions: production 1 is NT12 NT16, production 2 is NT57 NT24. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t3, which might come from NT59 if it can derive t3. But let me check NT59's productions again.\n\nLooking at NT59's productions:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, NT59 can produce two non-terminals. So when S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the NT17 must generate a part and NT59 must generate another part, and the combination should match the string.\n\nBut the string starts with t3. Let's see if any of NT17 or NT59 can directly produce t3, or if they can produce a sequence that starts with t3.\n\nLooking at NT59's productions:\n\nNone of the non-terminals produced directly by NT59 are terminals; NT59 can only produce combinations of non-terminals. So perhaps the first t3 must come from NT57 or NT12 or some other non-terminal that has a production leading to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's look at NT57: NT57 -> NT8 NT41. So NT57 produces two non-terminals, neither of which are terminals, so that won't directly give t3.\n\nWait, looking for non-terminals that can produce t3 through their productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNo t3.\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nNo t3.\n\nNT5 -> t5, but that's a terminal, but is NT5 reachable?\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps to model this as a derivation tree, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, each production is applied by replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until terminals are reached. So, the length of the string may help determine the number of steps.\n\nWait, the provided string has 31 tokens, separated by spaces. Since each production in the grammar replaces one non-terminal with two, the number of symbols can increase exponentially. But without knowing the exact derivation, it's tricky.\n\nAnother idea: let's try to see if the first few symbols can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the first token is t3, perhaps it can come from a non-terminal that can produce t3. Looking through the grammar, which non-terminals have t3 in their productions.\n\nLooking at NT25 -> NT13 NT44, and NT25 production: NT25 -> NT13 NT44, and NT25 also has another production: NT25 -> NT2 NT36.\n\nWait, is there any non-terminal that directly produces t3? Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking for any non-terminals that have a production to a t3 terminal.\n\nI see:\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0, NT25 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nBut looking at the specific productions:\n\nLooking at NT8 -> 't10' (wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the NT definitions.\n\nWait, wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nIt says, for example, NT8 -> 't10'; but that's a terminal production, so NT8 can directly produce t10.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 -> 't2', so NT36 can produce t2.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for non-terminals that can produce t3. Wait, perhaps there's a NT55 -> NT25 NT0, and NT0 has a production. Wait, let's check if any NT can derive t3.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT with a production that directly produce 't3' except perhaps for NT57, NT37, etc., but let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps NT57 can derive a t3. Let's see: NT57 -> NT8 NT41. So NT8 is another non-terminal, and NT41 is another. So if either of those produce t3, but are any of them producing t3?\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 -> 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT41: NT41 -> NT16 NT17.\n\nThen, NT16 -> NT55 NT32.\n\nSo unless NT55 or NT32 can produce t3, which they don't directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, what about NT59's productions: NT59 -> NT12 NT16 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, let's see NT12: NT12 -> NT5 NT43.\n\nNT5->'t5', NT43->NT5 NT15.\n\nSo NT43 is NT5 NT15, and NT5 is t5, NT15 is NT16 NT56.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the non-terminals directly produce t3. Maybe the string contains a t3 that's part of a larger derivation, but it's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That simplifies things because I can parse the string using a method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm, but manually here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the top-level structure should produce two parts that concatenate to form the whole string. Each of these parts is generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me break down the string into two parts: one generated by NT17 and the other by NT59.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, the string is the concatenation of the right-hand sides of the productions for S. So the entire string should be a sequence where the first part is generated by NT17 and the second by NT59. But I need to split the string into two parts such that each part is compatible with the derivations from NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string: `t8 t7 t0 t10 t6 t1 t2 t1 t3 t4 t7 t5 t7 t2 t4 t9 t4 t3 t9 t3 t10 t8 t9 t7 t8 t6 t2 t5 t6 t9 t1 t2`\n\nLet me split it into two parts, say A and B, where A is generated by NT17 and B by NT59.\n\nBut how do I know where to split?

So the first part A could end with t4. Let me see if the first 11 tokens (from t8 to t4) can be generated by NT17.\n\nBut wait, NT17 can only directly produce t4. If it needs to produce more symbols, it has to have non-terminals leading to t4.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly two symbols on the right. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string must start with the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nThe string given is: t4 t5 t7 t4 t7 t4 t5 t6 t6 t9 t1 t10 t10 t8 t2 t6 t4 t10 t8 t4 t2 t5 t0 t6 t10 t2 t4 t9 t6 t0 t0 t9.\n\nI'll try to parse this string using the grammar. Parsing in CNF typically uses something like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do it manually here.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals involved and their possible expansions. Each non-terminal can only produce specific terminals or other non-terminals, so I need to check each part of the string to see if it matches.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the entire string should be a concatenation of the derivations of NT17 and NT59. Let me split the string into two parts: the first part from NT17 and the second from NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, maybe the first part starts with t4. Let's see if NT17 can generate t4.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT17:\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo to get t4, I need to see if either NT37 or NT54 can produce t4.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. NT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'. NT18 \u2192 't0' or 't5' or 't9'. None of these directly produce t4. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any production for a non-terminal directly includes t4. Checking the productions:\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: there's NT5 \u2192 't5', 't3', 't10'. NT10: I don't see it, maybe it's in another non-terminal. Wait, maybe I need to go deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree. Let me try to see if the entire string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string should be NT17's expansion followed by NT59's expansion.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t4 t5 t7 t4 t7 t4 t5 t6 t6 t9 t1 t10 t10 t8 t2 t6 ... So let's see if NT17 can produce a sequence starting with t4.\n\nFrom NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Then NT49 can be 't3' or 't11' or 't9' (wait, looking back, NT49 has two options: 't9' and 't7'?), but I think NT49 can produce 't3', 't7', 't11' based on earlier productions.\n\nWait, the productions for NT49 are:\nNT49 \u2192 't3', 't7', 't11'? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see NT49 \u2192 't9'? Wait no, looking here:\n\nLooking at the initial productions, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' and 't7'? Or wait, there's a list of rules. Let me list all NT49's rules:\n\nWait, the grammar goes like this. Let me see the rules for NT49:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 -> 't3'\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\n\nNT49 -> 't11'\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the list, NT49 has these three productions:\n\nWait looking back:\n\nStarting from the top, the rules are:\n\nI think I missed some. Let me scan all rules for NT49:\n\nLooking for NT49:\n\nNT49 -> 't3'\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\n\nNT49 -> 't11'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through all the productions, it's only two rules for NT49:\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\n\nNT49 -> 't11'\n\nWait no, looking back, I see:\n\nLines like NT49 -> 't0', NT49 -> 't7', and NT49 -> 't11'? Let me scan through all the grammar rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT49, I see:\n\nNT49 -> 't3'\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\n\nNT49 -> 't11'\n\nIs that accurate? Wait, the user wrote multiple rules. Let me look carefully:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nLooking at the grammar list, here are the rules for NT49:\n\nNT49 -> 't3'\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\n\nNT49 -> 't11'\n\nYes, so NT49 can produce 't3', 't7', or 't11'. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals have a mix of terminals and other non-terminals. So back to NT17.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nSo NT37's expansion requires NT49 and NT18.\n\nNT49 can produce 't3', 't7', 't11'. NT18 can produce 't0', 't5', or 't9'.\n\nLooking at the start of the string, the first token is t4. Hmm, that's a problem because NT37's expansion starts with NT49, which can't produce t4. So maybe the first token t4 is part of another non-terminal's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the split. Maybe the string isn't split into two parts but is a single sequence of symbols, and I need to parse it as a whole, possibly using a bottom-up or top-down approach.\n\nAlternative approach: try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with t4. So perhaps the first symbol is produced by a non-terminal that can emit t4.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, which non-terminals have rules that include t4? Let's see.\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for each production the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or something else.\n\nWait, let's look through all the rules to find any that have a terminal t4.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT16 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'\n- NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't6', 't2'\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n- NT44 \u2192 't0', 't2', 't4'\n- NT49 \u2192 't7', 't11', 't3' (I think)\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT57 \u2192 't7', NT18\n- NT59 \u2192 't7', 't24' (Wait, two options: NT59 \u2192 't7' or 't24'. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't7', NT24? Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT59->'t7'\n\nand earlier, it also says: NT59 -> NT18 NT36.\n\nWait, perhaps multiple options for NT59.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if it can be broken down into the non-terminals according to the grammar. I think the best way is to look for sequences that match the right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions. The string has spaces separating the tokens, so each token is a separate element.\n\nThe grammar has various non-terminals like S, NT0, NT41, etc., and terminals like t0, t1, t2, etc. Looking at the start symbol S, its production is S -> NT17 NT59. So, the string must start with the productions for NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me check the string. The first token is t4. But according to the grammar, NT17 produces t4 directly? Wait, looking at the productions: NT17 -> t4. Yes, so NT17 can directly produce t4. That seems correct so far.\n\nNext, the second part is t1. Let's see what NT59 can produce. Looking through the productions, I see NT59's RHS can be multiple things. One of them is NT18 NT36. Let me check if there's a way NT36 can lead to t9 and something else. Wait, NT36 can be 't6', 't0', or 't2'. Hmm, maybe not directly t1. Alternatively, NT59 can also be NT12 NT16. Let's see: NT12 -> t11, and NT16 -> t5. So, combining these, NT59 would produce t11 t5. But the second token is t1, not t11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the grammar uses non-terminals and terminals, maybe I need to look for the non-terminals that can produce the t's. Each time a non-terminal appears, I can expand it step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree from the string. Let me list the tokens: t4, t1, t10, t7, t3, t4, t8, t0, t10, t10, t8, t3, t10, t10, t9, t9, t10, t9, t10, t10, t11, t5, t1, t1, t5, t2, t8, t1, t3, t0, t1, t0, t11.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT17 NT59. So the first expansion is S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nThe string starts with t4, which is from NT17 -> t4. So NT17 is consumed as t4. The remaining string is t1 t10 t7 t3 t4 t8 t0 ... etc.\n\nNow, NT59 can produce several things: one of which is NT18 NT36. Let's see: if NT59 is NT18 NT36, then we need to see what NT18 and NT36 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions: I see NT18 can be 't0', or maybe a combination? Let me check: the productions for NT18 are not listed here, so perhaps it's terminal? Wait, looking through the grammar, NT18 is in the production for NT59 as one option, and also possibly in others. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT18 explicitly except in NT59. Hmm, maybe I need to look for any terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT18 can produce 't0'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me list all the productions that have terminals:\n\nNT0 -> t6\nNT5 -> t5, t3, t10\nNT43 -> t10, t5\nNT8 -> t10\nNT59 -> t12, t57? Wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT59 has two productions: one is NT12 NT16, and the other is NT57 NT24. Wait, actually, from the given grammar:\n\nWait, I see in the rules:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nand \n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait no, looking back: \n\nThe grammar says:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nand\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nAdditionally, in the list, another production is NT59 -> NT57 NT24 and also NT59 -> NT12 NT16. So that's two ways for NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, after t4, the next token is t1, but NT59 needs to produce t1? I don't see an NT59 producing t1 directly. Maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the NT59 production options and see which could lead to the next tokens.\n\nWait, let's see: after t4, we have t1. So after S -> NT17 NT59, NT17 is t4, so the remaining part starts with NT59: t1 t10 t7 t3 t4 ... etc.\n\nSo NT59 needs to generate the rest, which is t1 t10 t7 t3 t4... etc.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT59, it can be:\n\n1. NT18 NT36\n2. NT12 NT16\n3. NT57 NT24\n\nSo, let's check each option.\n\nOption 1: NT59 = NT18 NT36.\n\nNT18's productions? In the given grammar, I don't see NT18 having a production except as part of NT59 (line 5: NT59 -> NT18 NT36). So perhaps NT18 is a non-terminal. Maybe NT18 can be expanded into something else, but according to the given rules, I don't see NT18 being defined elsewhere. Wait, no, looking again, lines 5-6: \n\nNT59 can produce NT18 NT36, and NT5 has 't5', NT9, etc., but not NT18.\n\nSo if NT18 is a non-terminal, perhaps it can only produce terminals. Or maybe not. Wait, maybe NT18 can produce something like 't0' or other terminals. Let me check the productions. \n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT18 having any terminals except as part of NT59. So perhaps I need to look if NT18 has any production to terminals.\n\nWait, in the list provided, I see lines:\n\nNT5 -> t5 (so yes, some NT's produce terminals.\n\nLooking for NT18: nowhere in the provided grammar is NT18 listed with any production except as part of NT59. So maybe NT18 can produce some terminal tokens or other non-terminals. Since it's not further defined, perhaps I should assume that it can't be split further and must produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. If NT18 has a production that leads to terminals, but in the given grammar, it's not listed. So unless I see a production for NT18, perhaps I should ignore it, but that might not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: after S, the first part is t4 (NT17), and the remaining is 't1 t10 t7 t3 t4 ...' which is the output of NT59. So maybe NT59 can be split into two parts: one generating 't1 t10 t7 t3' and the other generating 't4 ...', but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps NT59 needs to generate 't1 t10 t7 t3 t4 ...'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try each option for NT59 and see if any of them can generate the remaining tokens.\n\nOption 1: NT59 = NT18 NT36. So I need to generate 't1 t10 t7 t3 t4 ...' as NT18 followed by NT36.\n\nBut since NT18 isn't defined, perhaps we can't proceed this way.\n\nOption 2: NT59 = NT12 NT16. So that's 't12 t16' as the output of NT59. But the first token after S is t1, not t12, so this option doesn't seem right.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that the right-hand side of each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, which fits the CNF requirement.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately expands to NT17 NT59. Each of these is also non-terminals, so I'll need to follow their expansion rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t9 t10 t9 t1 t9 t8 t4 t6 t7 t6 t3 t1 t7 t11 t5 t8 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t9 t6 t6 t7 t3 t7 t1 t7 t0 t5 t10 t5`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from S by applying the productions in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the parsing process, similar to how a top-down parser (like Recursive Descent or LL(1)) would work. Since each production only has two non-terminals or a terminal on the RHS, this could be efficient.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string step by step, keeping track of the current position and the current non-terminal. Since S starts as NT17 NT59, I need to parse the string such that it starts with the symbols derived from NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me create two separate parsers for NT17 and NT59 because they can be processed independently, I think. Wait, but NT17 and NT59 are both non-terminals; the entire string must be the result of expanding both. So perhaps I need to check if the first part of the string comes from NT17 and the second part from NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll start by assigning the entire string to a buffer. Then, starting with S: NT17 NT59, so my first goal is to parse the string into two parts: one for NT17 and the other for NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nSo, the first part of the string must be derived from NT37 and then NT54.\n\nWait, let me list all the production rules to have them clear:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nNT41 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT44 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT54 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT56 \u2192 't5'\n\nAlright, starting the parse:\n\n1. The string is: t9 t10 t9 t1 t9 t8 t4 t6 t7 t6 t3 t1 t7 t11 t5 t8 t3 t0 t1 t4 t3 t9 t6 t6 t7 t3 t7 t1 t7 t0 t5 t10 t5\n\n2. Starting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the entire string must be split into two parts: one derived from NT17 and the other from NT59.\n\nWait, no. Because S expands to NT17 NT59, each of these would generate parts of the string, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nSo, I'll assign a pointer to the start of the string for NT17 (pos=0) and the end for NT59 (pos=30, since the string length is 31 tokens). So, the first part is from 0 to pos1, and the second from pos1+1 to 30. Wait, but how do I split it? Because NT17 and NT59 could each generate any number of tokens, so I need to find where the split is.\n\nMaybe I'll process NT17 first, trying to parse as much as possible from the start, and whatever remains should be parsed by NT59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this with recursive parsing, where each non-terminal is processed in a function that returns when it's fully parsed.\n\nBut given that this is a manual process, perhaps I can attempt to parse step by step.\n\nLet's start with NT17.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nSo, to parse the first part, I need NT37 and NT54.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t9 t10 t9 ...\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nAnd according to the rules, NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT37: it says NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So, NT49 and NT18 are non-terminals, each of which have productions to terminals.\n\nSo, NT37 needs NT49 and NT18 to parse. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', or 't10'\n\nWait, from the grammar, NT49's productions are:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't11'\n\nSo, that's a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, each production for a non-terminal must be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, NT49 \u2192 't3' is a terminal production, but that's only a terminal. Wait, but according to CNF, every production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for terminals. So, perhaps I misread. Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT49's productions:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, that's a single terminal. But in CNF, each production can have zero, one, or two non-terminals, but in this case, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for NT49 \u2192 't3', that's valid because it's a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT49 \u2192 't11' is also a terminal.\n\nSo, when NT49 is processed, it can directly produce 't3' or 't11'.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 \u2192 NT54, and NT54 is terminal? Wait, checking NT54: according to the grammar, NT54 \u2192 't9', but wait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT54: I see NT59 \u2192 NT18, but what about NT54? Wait, checking:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't9' (from the last entry: NT54 \u2192 't9')?\n\nWait, looking back: The last entries are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-586","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what the grammar does. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bunch of non-terminals (NT0, NT15, etc.) that eventually expand into terminal symbols like 't0', 't1', up to 't59'. Each production rule seems to break down a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or terminals until we reach the base cases. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So any string generated must start with NT17 and NT59 expanding into terminals. I'll need to see if the provided string starts with these.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \nt10 t11 t2 t2 t0 t1 t7 t11 t10 t7 t5 t5 t2 t3 t1 t7 t1 t8 t9 t8 t7 t2 t3 t5 t9 t2 t5 t9 t2 t7 t11 t4 t9 t8 \n\nThat's quite long, 39 tokens. Let me check if S correctly starts with NT17 and NT59. \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 has two rules:\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT17 -> t4\n\nSo NT17 can either produce t4 or NT37 NT54. Similarly, NT59 has two rules:\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo NT59 can produce NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t11. Since NT17 can't produce t11 directly (since it's a terminal and NT17 can produce a terminal only via NT17 -> t4, which is t4, but the first token is t11. So wait, no\u2014the string starts with t10 t11... but hold on, the string starts with t10, then t11. Wait, no, the string is separated by spaces, so each token is a separate element.\n\nWait, the string is: t10 t11 t2 t2 t0 t1 t7 t11 t10 t7 t5 t5 t2 t3 t1 t7 t1 t8 t9 t8 t7 t2 t3 t5 t9 t2 t5 t9 t2 t7 t11 t4 t9 t8\n\nSo the first token is t10. But according to the grammar, the start symbols NT17 and NT59 only produce certain terminals. Let's see what NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nWait, NT17's options are:\n- NT37 NT54\n- t4\n\nSo NT17 can produce t4 or the combination of NT37 and NT54. But in the string, the first token is t10. That's a problem because t10 isn't produced by NT17's rules. Because NT17's only direct terminal production is t4, and the others go into non-terminals.\n\nHmm, this seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the S rule is S -> NT17 NT59. So S is the start symbol and will expand into NT17 and NT59. NT17 can be either NT37 NT54 or t4. If it's t4, the string's first token should be t4, but it starts with t10. Alternatively, if it's NT37 and NT54, then we need to see what each produces.\n\nWait, but both NT37 and NT54 have their own rules.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT49 -> 't3' (Wait, no, looking back: NT49 is in the formNT49 -> 't3' etc. Wait, actually, some of these rule strings show a mix of non-terminals and terminals? Wait no, in the grammar provided, it's in CNF, which only allows A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals? Or wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals except for the terminal productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar given, some rules are like NT59 -> NT12 NT16 (this is okay, both non-terminals), one rule is NT59 -> NT57 NT24, another is NT59 -> 't' something. Wait, looking at the grammar, for NT59, we have:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait, looking back at the initial grammar input:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nOh wait, no, looking at the actual input, it's:\n\ngrammar lines include lines like:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nand\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nand\n\nNT0 -> 't6'\nand so on.\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm misunderstanding CNF. CNF requires that each production is either A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So, for example, NT59 -> NT12 NT16 is okay because both are non-terminals. Similarly, NT57 -> NT8 NT41 is two non-terminals. But in the grammar, some of the lines have 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT24 -> 't10'\n\nWait, that's a terminal production, right? Because 't10' is a terminal. So, for example, NT24 can be replaced with the terminal 't10'. Similarly, NT55 -> 't8'.\n\nSo, looking back at the grammar, many of the rules end with a terminal, meaning that those non-terminals expand into that terminal. For example, NT24 has three rules:\n\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT24 can produce t10, t0, or t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 has multiple rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT0 -> NT57 NT24  \n\nBut also, other rules lead to terminals:\n\nLooking again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see how they can reach terminals.\n\nFor example, NT59 has:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nBut both of these are non-terminals, so NT59 doesn't have a direct terminal production. Similarly, NT57 is:\n\nNT57 -> NT49 NT18\n\nAnd NT49 has NT49 -> 't3' \u2014 wait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, lines are like:\n\nNT49 -> 't3'\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list of grammar rules:\n\nNT49 -> 't3' \nNT59 -> NT12 NT16 \nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait, no, looking again, the initial input shows lines like:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 is also defined as NT59-> NT57 NT24\n\nBut also, other lines like:\n\nNT49 -> 't3' \nNT36 -> 't6' \netc.\n\nSo, some non-terminals have direct terminal production, while others don't.\n\nNow, let's step back. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, to generate a string starting with t10, what does that mean? For example, maybe one of NT17 or NT59 produces a terminal.\n\nBut looking at NT17's rules:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54 \nNT17 -> t4\n\nSo, NT17 has a terminal production of t4. So if S expands to NT17 NT59, then the first symbol would be t4 if NT17 becomes t4, but the string starts with t10. Alternatively, NT17 could go to NT37 NT54, which then expand further into terminals.\n\nWait, but NT17 is S's production: S -> NT17 NT59. So the generated string has two components: the expansion of NT17 and NT59. Maybe the first symbols come from the expansion of NT17 and then NT59. But in this case, the string provided starts with t10. So, is it possible that the expansion of NT17 and\/or NT59 could produce t10 as the first token?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. Maybe the entire string comes out of the leftmost derivation, so S expands"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-579","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems that most of the rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That checks out with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t6 t11 t10 t2 t3 t9 t4 t11 t1 t2 t1 t9 t9 t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t7 t9 t10 t0 t5 t1 t3 t6 t5 t0 t2 t8 t7 t4 t0`. \n\nMy task is to parse this string using the provided grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or any other method suitable for such structures. However, manually parsing such a long string might be error-prone, so I'll need to approach this systematically.\n\nI should start by listing out all the non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are straightforward: any token that isn't a non-terminal. Non-terminals are variables like S, NT0, NT1, etc., up to NT59. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Each production rule for S is a combination of non-terminals. The primary rule is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, to derive the string, S must expand into NT17 and NT59. These non-terminals will then each expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, I can start breaking down the string step by step. Each production rule either reduces a non-terminal or consumes a terminal. Since this is a top-down approach, I'll start from the start symbol S and see how it can lead to the string.\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the string starts with NT17 followed by NT59.\n2. Therefore, the string should start with whatever NT17 produces and then NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n   - So, NT17 is replaced by NT37 and NT54.\n- NT54 \u2192 NT54 NT3 \u2192 but NT54 appears on both sides, which might be an error. Wait, looking back, NT54 is a non-terminal, so NT54 \u2192 NT57 NT24, but wait, the grammar given doesn't list NT54. Let me check again: yes, in the given grammar, NT54 doesn't have a production. Wait, looking back, the user provided a series of NTx \u2192 ... lines. Checking the provided grammar, I see NT43 and NT55, but not NT54. Oh, maybe I misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT54 \u2192 t4? Or another production? Wait, in the given grammar, under NT17, the production is NT37 NT54. For NT54, looking through the list, I don't see any production. Wait, in the provided grammar, each line is a production. Let me list them again:\n\nLooking for NT54: scanning through, I don't see NT54 on either side. So perhaps NT54 is not defined, but in the grammar, every non-terminal must have a production. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Oh, in the user-provided grammar, under NT17, the production is NT37 NT54, implying that NT54 is a non-terminal with a production. So I must have missed it.

{"custom_id":"request-589","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t2 t4 t9 t4 t5 t11 t5 t4 t8 t1 t3 t5 t4 t7 t8 t9 t2 t3 t5 t1 t3 t10 t2 t8 t6 t9 t11 t7 t11 t6 t1 t0 t0 t4 t4`. That's a pretty long string with 39 tokens. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided uses 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals, and other symbols like S, NT0, NT1, etc., which are non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that S is the start symbol and it produces NT17 and NT59. So any valid derivation must start with these two. Each NT has its own productions. My approach is to see how the string can be broken down into these productions.\n\nI'll start by seeing if the first token 't2' can be generated by any production. Looking through the non-terminals, I see NT25 \u2192 t7, but that's not useful. NT5 \u2192 t5, which is another option. Wait, let me check each production for the terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t5 or t3 or t10\n- NT2 \u2192 t0, t6, or t4\n- So, the first token is 't2', which can come from NT2, specifically NT2 \u2192 t4 (from the given productions: NT24 \u2192 t4). But wait, NT24 is also used in other places, like NT24 \u2192 t0, t5, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT2, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t4. But NT24 is a separate non-terminal. So to get 't2', I need to find if any production leads directly or indirectly to 't2'.\n\nLooking again, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't2'; instead, I see NT25 \u2192 t7 (nope), NT24 \u2192 t4, NT54 \u2192 t2? Let's check the given productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT54 \u2192 't9', 't2', 't6', and 't4'. So NT54 can produce 't2'. So 't2' can come from NT54. \n\nBut how do I get to NT54? Looking at the productions for NT54:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT54 \u2192 't9', 't2', 't6', 't5', etc. So yes, NT54 can produce 't2'. So to get 't2' at the beginning, we must have a production that leads to NT54.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT55, NT15, etc., I see:\n\nWait, looking for NT54's parent. In the grammar, is there any NT that produces NT54? Let me look through the productions:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces NT54 from another non-terminal. The productions for NT54 are the terminals or other non-terminals, like NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, etc. So perhaps I'm mistaken, and NT54 is a non-terminal that can only produce terminals, not other non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, a production can have other non-terminals on the right side. So perhaps one of the productions for NT54 is something like NT54 \u2192 NTsomething NTanother.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see in the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 can produce NT37 and NT54. Since NT54 can produce 't2' from the terminal symbols, then from NT17 we can get 't2' via NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 \u2192 ... t2.\n\nWait, but the initial S is NT17 and NT59. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which would then be expanded.\n\nSo let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't2', which must come from a production that eventually leads to 't2'. Looking at the grammar, 't2' can come from NT54 \u2192 't2' via NT54's production. So to get 't2', we need a production where a non-terminal eventually produces 't2'. So let's find a non-terminal that can produce 't2'.\n\nLooking at NT54's productions: NT54 \u2192 't9', 't2', 't6', 't5', etc. So NT54 can produce 't2' directly. So if somewhere in the derivation, we have NT54, it can emit 't2'.\n\nSo, for the first token 't2', maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Now, perhaps NT17 can produce something that eventually leads to 't2', and NT59 can produce something else.\n\nWait, looking at NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So to get 't2', perhaps NT17 eventually produces a sequence that includes 't2'. So let's see what NT37 and NT54 can produce.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. NT49 can produce 't3', 't7', etc., but does it produce 't9'? Let me check NT49's productions: NT49 \u2192 't7', 't11', 't1'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the given productions for NT49 say:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3', 't7', 't11', 't5', etc. Wait, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT54? No, wait, checking the grammar:\n\nFor NT49: I see NT49 \u2192 't7', 't11', etc. Looking at all, NT49 has:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' (no, wait: the productions are:\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nWait, this is getting confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-595","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on my grammar rules, but I'll try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF since all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t3 t9 t4 t5 t1 t8 t1 t9 t7 t8 t8 t2 t6 t1 t1 t0 t4 t4 t9 t4 t0 t2 t3 t10 t4 t8 t7 t1 t8 t1 t1 t9 t6 t10`.\n\nMy approach will be to use a parsing technique suitable for CNF grammars, like the CYK algorithm. However, I remember that the standard CYK algorithm might not directly apply here because the grammar seems more complicated, with many non-terminals and terminals, so I might need to adjust my strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree manually or use a top-down approach with memoization. Since the string is pretty long, maybe around 35 tokens, that might be manageable.\n\nLet me first look for the start symbol. The start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So the first step in any derivation would be S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Therefore, the first two symbols of the string must be the leftmost symbols derived from NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t6 and t3. I need to see if NT17 can derive t6 and NT59 can derive t3, or vice versa, depending on their productions. Wait, no\u2014the production is NT17 NT59, so it's either NT17 producing the first part and NT59 the second, or vice versa? No, in a two-symbol production like A \u2192 BC, B is the first and C is the second, but in our case, each production is a single rule, so I think when S \u2192 NT17 NT59, it's that NT17 generates the first sequence, and NT59 generates the next. So for the string, the first two tokens should be generated by NT17 and NT59 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 t4\nWait, looking back at the grammar, in the second section, the rules for NT17 are: \n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT17 -> NT54\nNT17 -> t4\nAlso, checking the original grammar, yes, so three productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 produces t3 (from the last rules given: NT59 -> 't3'), and also has other productions, but t3 is terminal.\n\nSo, the first two tokens should be generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nGiven the string starts with t6, then t3, perhaps NT17 must produce t6 as a terminal directly. Let's see NT17's productions:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT17:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 t4\n\nSo the only terminal production for NT17 is t4. But the first token is t6, so NT17 must not produce t4 in this case, so this path is invalid. Therefore, the string cannot start with t6 if NT17 can only produce t4 directly.\n\nWait, but that's a problem because the first token is t6. So S \u2192 NT17 NT59 would require that NT17 generates t6 as part of its derivation. But from the grammar, NT17 doesn't have a production that directly produces t6. Its only terminal production is t4.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the production rules for NT17. From the beginning, I see:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\nNT44 \u2192 NT2 NT36\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT17 \u2192 NT54\nNT17 \u2192 t4\n\nSo yes, NT17 only has t4 as a terminal. So if the string starts with t6, that's a problem because S's first step is NT17 generating something, and that something can't be t6 unless NT17 has a more complex derivation.\n\nWait, but in CNF, if NT17 can derive a string starting with t6, but the only terminal it can derive is t4, unless it can reach t6 through other means. But looking at the grammar, perhaps I missed a rule.\n\nWait, looking again, is there any rule where NT17 produces something that leads to t6?

That must come from either S's NT17 or NT59. But as established, NT17 can't derive t6 because its only terminal is t4. So perhaps Nt59 must derive t6?\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string must be something like (derivation of NT17) (derivation of NT59). But if NT17 can't derive t6, then the entire string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not properly constructed because the first symbols can't be derived from the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-598","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar provides production rules for various non-terminal symbols, and the string to check consists of a sequence of terminals.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, my goal is to parse the given string using this grammar to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, whatever string we're checking must start with the strings derived from NT17 and NT59. The given string starts with t8, but NT17's productions might produce something else. Wait, actually, no, let me double-check the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production for a non-terminal has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the initial step is to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me look at each non-terminal's productions. Starting with NT17, I see NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Breaking this down further: NT49 can be 't3' or 't11' because in the grammar NT49 has two productions: NT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't11'. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 't0'. So, following NT17's production, the string must be a combination of the two parts from NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT54 has two productions: NT54 \u2192 't9' and NT54 \u2192 't6'. Also, NT37's parts: NT49 is either 't3' or 't11', and NT18 is always 't0'. So, from NT17, the left part would be something like t3 or t11 followed by t0. Therefore, the initial part of the string should match this pattern.\n\nLooking at the given string: it starts with t8 t6 t9 t4 t0... Wait, the first symbol is t8. But the initial production from NT17 is something like (from NT37: t3 or t11) followed by NT18: t0. So, the first two symbols should be a combination of t3 or t11 followed by t0. But the string starts with t8 t6, which doesn't fit this pattern. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should approach this as a recursive descent parsing problem. Each non-terminal can produce a part of the string, and I can break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\nt8 t6 t9 t4 t0 t10 t1 t8 t0 t5 t0 t11 t10 t2 t6 t6 t3 t10 t8 t5 t4 t10 t6 t3 t2 t11 t9 t8 t10 t6 t6 t7 t4 t10 t1 t4\n\nSince S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the entire string must be split into two parts: one derived from NT17 and the other from NT59.\n\nSo, let's find where the split between NT17 and NT59 occurs. For that, I'll look for a production that starts with NT17 and has a terminal in the given string.\n\nWait, but NT17's productions are all in terms of non-terminals. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, the substring generated by NT17 will be a sequence of symbols starting with the first symbol of NT37, which is NT49, leading to a terminal. Then, followed by NT54, which is a terminal as well.\n\nLooking at the starting symbols: the first symbol is t8. But NT49 can be t3 or t11. So, t8 isn't an option. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps NT17's production isn't leading with t8. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong thing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is fully terminal, I have to find a path from S to the entire string through these productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t8 t6 t9 t4 t0 t10 t1 t8 t0 t5 t0 t11 t10 t2 t6 t6 t3 t10 t8 t5 t4 t10 t6 t3 t2 t11 t9 t8 t10 t6 t6 t7 t4 t10 t1 t4\n\nGiven that S produces NT17 NT59, I need the string to be the concatenation of two parts: one from NT17 and the other from NT59.\n\nSo, let me split the string into two possible parts.\n\nThe first part (from NT17) must start with something that can be derived from NT17, and the second part (from NT59) must correspond accordingly.\n\nLooking at NT59's productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and NT59 also has a terminal production in some cases? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59: -> NT12 NT16, NT59: -> NT57 NT24\n\nBut in the provided grammar, I don't see NT59 directly producing a terminal. Wait, looking again: Oh, I see that in the grammar, there are \"NT59 -> ...\" lines, but no direct production for NT59 \u2192 t. Wait, no, in the grammar:\n\nThe last lines are:\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT37 -> 't9'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce a terminal? Let me scan the productions:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nYes, for example:\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nBut no direct production of NT59 \u2192 t. Hmm, that's a problem because the given string starts with t8, so unless one of the non-terminals on the left side can produce t8, but since S starts with NT17 and NT59, one of these must produce a 't8'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, looking for terminals, I see:\n\n- NT25: 't7'\n- NT5: 't5'\n- NT2: 't0'\n- NT6: 't5'\n- NT4: 't0'\n- NT3: 't3'\n- NT0: 't0' in two cases?\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar as given has several NTs:\n\nLooking back, for example:\nNT0: S has NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12, and also NT0's production elsewhere, but more importantly, in NT0's productions, I see:\n\nND0 productions:\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\nNT0 \u2192 NT16 NT56\nLooking for where NT0 gives a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, NT0's productions include:\n\nNT0 -> NT16 NT56\nand\nLooking elsewhere, in the grammar, I think I missed some. Wait, looking through all the lines:\n\n- NT0 has two productions: NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12 and NT0 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n- NT55 is a terminal t8 (because NT55 \u2192 't8')\nNo, actually, NT55 is a non-terminal because in the grammar, NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, which are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-599","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string is a sequence of t's with numbers, which I believe are terminals, so each token like t10 is a single terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Let's list out the productions to see how the non-terminals break down. For example, S -> NT17 NT59, so the start symbol S produces two non-terminals NT17 and NT59. Each of these non-terminals in turn breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll go through each production step by step:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT54 -> t9 (terminal)\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT49 -> t3 or t11\n- NT18 -> t10\n- So NT37 can produce t3 t10 or t11 t10\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT50 (Wait, no, NT55 in the grammar is NT55 -> NT25 NT0)\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT13 -> t3 or t2\n- NT44 -> t0\n- So NT25 -> t3 t0 or t2 t0\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT53 (Wait, looking back: NT53 isn't present. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again. Oh, in the grammar, NT55 is NT25 -> NT13 NT44. Wait, in the grammar, there's NT25 -> NT13 NT44. Then NT13 is either t3 or t2, NT44 -> t0. So NT25 produces t3 t0 or t2 t0.\n\nWait, but looking through the list again, I see NT25 has a production to itself, which might be a typo, but I think I see that NT25 is defined as NT13 NT44, which breaks down into t3 t0 or t2 t0.\n\nContinuing with the other productions:\n\n- NT59 is appearing in multiple places. The initial S production uses NT59, and there's NT59 -> NT12 NT16. Also, some NT25 produce t5.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, seeing if I can match the start symbol S and derive the string.\n\nThe string is: `t10 t4 t6 t7 t6 t9 t6 t10 t5 t7 t0 t10 t1 t1 t9 t4 t6 t9 t5 t11 t6 t0 t7 t7 t1 t6 t0 t4 t8 t2 t7 t0 t10 t5 t2 t10`.\n\nThat's 39 tokens, quite long. Parsing such a long string manually would be time-consuming, but let's see if I can break it down.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT17 and NT59. So the entire string should be a sequence of derivations starting from S, which results in all t's.\n\nLet's see what each production for S leads to:\n\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT54 -> t9\n- So the first part after S is NT37 which must become t9 something.\n\nWait, the string starts with t10. Let me check the productions for NT37:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT49 can be either t3 or t11\nNT18 -> t10\n\nSo NT37 can produce t3 t10 or t11 t10.\n\nBut the string starts with t10, which could be part of NT18. So let me think: if NT49 is t11, then NT37 would be t11 t10.\n\nBut the string starts with t10, so that could be the t10 from NT18. So maybe the first part is t11 t10. So after S, we have NT37 (t11 t10), then NT54 is t9, but wait, S's first production is NT17 NT59, and NT17 is NT37 NT54, so S -> NT37 NT54 NT59? Wait no, S is NT17 NT59, and NT17 is NT37 NT54. Wait, actually, S is NT17 NT59, where NT17 is NT37 NT54 and NT59 is some other symbol.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, is NT59 present in multiple places? Let's check: There's a production NT37 -> NT49 NT18, which can be t3 t10 or t11 t10.\n\nBut I think I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to try to build a parse tree for the string. Alternatively, check if the string's length and the rules make sense.\n\nFirst, the length of the string is 39 tokens. Let's consider how many steps each rule takes. Since all productions are two symbols, except for terminals, the string length should be equal to the number of rules applied plus one.\n\nWait, the initial string would start with a non-terminal at the top level. So, for example, S can produce two non-terminals, each of which can produce more non-terminals or terminals. Each production step increases the number of symbols by one (since a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, the total count increases by one each time we apply a production).\n\nWait, actually, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So starting from S (1 symbol), then it would split into two symbols (2), each splitting again, leading to more symbols. The total number of symbols in the derived string will be 2^(n) - 1, where n is the number of splits. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each step produces two symbols, so the length is a power of two minus one. Wait, but that's not quite right because each application can add more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps an example: Suppose S -> A B. Then A and B can produce terminals or non-terminals. Each non-terminal adds one more step. So if A is a terminal, then A is one symbol. If A is a non-terminal A1 A2, then A1 and A2 are added, and so on.\n\nLet me think differently. The start symbol S initially has two non-terminals: NT17 and NT59. Each of these can themselves produce two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals.\n\nSo the total number of symbols in the expansion depends on how each non-terminal resolves.\n\nBut the given string has 39 symbols. Let's check: Is 39 a possible length after expanding from S?\n\nSince each production after the first can either contribute a terminal or cause the count to increase, it's not straightforward, but perhaps the length is 2^k - 1. 2^6=64, 64-1=63. 2^5=32-1=31, which is close to 39 but not exact. So 39 may not be a possible length, but perhaps that's a red herring because sometimes the production order can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string length is 39 tokens, which could be (2n -1) where n is the number of productions applied from the start symbol. But perhaps I should check the counts more carefully.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting stuck on the length, I can try to break down the string step by step, trying to see if each part can be derived from the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT17 NT59. Let's see what NT17 can produce:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSo after S, the string begins with the symbols derived from NT17 and NT59.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit lost; maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t10. Let's see if t10 is produced by any of the productions. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT59 -> 't3 t10' as per some productions. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, there's NT37 -> NT49 NT18. NT49 can be t3 or t11. NT18 is always t10.\n\nSo, NT37 -> t3 t10 or t11 t10.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT24 -> t0, or other options, but maybe it's not directly relevant here.\n\nThe string's first token is t10. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's NT24 -> t10, for example.\n\nSo, perhaps the string's first token comes from NT24.\n\nBut how would that happen?

Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is a sequence of terminals generated by expanding according to these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Our string starts with t2, t6, so I need to see how these are generated.\n\nI should probably draw a derivation tree or some kind of parse tree to see if I can reach the string step by step. Alternatively, since the grammar is small, maybe I can look for the sequence of productions that would generate the given string.\n\nLet me first go through the string and note the order and frequency of each 't' symbol. The string is:\n\nt2 t6 t10 t9 t11 t11 t1 t8 t6 t3 t9 t4 t9 t9 t7 t8 t9 t11 t2 t5 t0 t11 t1 t10 t11 t5 t0 t6 t4 t8 t8 t2 t5 t0 t7 t5 t8.\n\nThat's a lot of symbols, 43 in total. The first thing is that S starts with NT17 and NT59. So let's look at what NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT59 has two productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. So the first step after S is to generate NT17 and NT59, which can be NT17 as NT37 NT54 and NT59 can be either of two options.\n\nLet's pick one production path. Let's try the first one, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16:\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT59 \u2192 NT37 NT54 NT12 NT16.\n\nWait, but let's check the first few symbols in the string. The first three are t2, t6, t10. I need to see how these can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't' symbols because those are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals and their productions, many have terminal symbols as their right-hand sides. Let's list the possible non-terminals that can directly produce 't' symbols:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3' (wait, that's same as before)\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5' (so NT5 can produce t5)\nNT2 \u2192 't0' (but 't0' isn't in the string, so maybe not needed)\nNT8 \u2192 't8' (t8 appears a few times)\nNT44 \u2192 't4'\nNT43 \u2192 't10' (so NT43 can produce t10)\nNT25 \u2192 't7' and 't2' (from NT25 production)\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal's productions are as follows:\n\nLet me list the terminals that each non-terminal can produce:\n\nNT0: can produce 't0' via several productions, or others like NT44 (t4), NT2 (t0?), etc. Need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each non-terminal and the terminals they can produce:\n\nLooking at each rule, and looking for where the right side is a terminal:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't0' (three times)\n- NT3 \u2192 't3' (multiple times)\n- NT4 \u2192 does it produce anything? I don't see NT4 as a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the rules again. Wait, actually, the initial rules might have a mistake in enumeration. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\n\nNT54 -> NT9 NT... Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me list each non-terminal and see which have terminal symbols in their productions.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT0: Only produces non-terminals, no terminals except possibly others. Wait, NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12, which are both non-terminals. So NT0 doesn't produce any terminals directly.\n\n- NT41: Non-terminals.\n\n- NT55: \u2192 NT25 NT0. NT25 is non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the non-terminals that have at least one terminal in their productions.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (from two rules)\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n- NT43 \u2192 't10' (because NT43 is \u2192 NT5 NT15, and NT15 is NT16 NT56, which are non-terminals, but wait, NT5 \u2192 't5', and if NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15, and NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56, which may continue down, but perhaps there's a path where NT43 can produce t10.\n\nWait, more systematically, perhaps I should list each non-terminal that can directly produce terminals and what they produce:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n3. NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 (first option) or NT57 NT24 (second option)\n4. NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n5. NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n6. NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n7.

NT54 \u2192 NT9 NT...\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, for NT43, the only production is NT54 NT15, right? So if NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15, but NT15 is itself a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me take each non-terminal and list any direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (two productions)\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n- NT43 \u2192 eventually can it reach 't10'? Let's see: NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15. NT5 \u2192 't5', NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56 (non-terminals). So no direct t10, but perhaps through NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15 \u2192 't5' and then NT15 \u2192 ... which could lead to t10. Hmm, but the first terminal we have is t10, which is at position 3.\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't7' (from NT25's production NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44, which don't produce terminals) Wait, looking back: NT25's production is NT13 NT44. NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT2 (and NT2 can produce 't0's, but not t7). Wait, no, wait:\n\nLooking at NT25's production: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44. NT13's productions are NT3 NT2 (twice). NT2 can produce 't0's or... Hmm, wait, does any non-terminal produce t7? Yes, NT43 can reach t7 if it produces t5 (from NT5) and then something leading to 't7' perhaps.

The terminals are lowercase t followed by numbers, like 't3', 't10', etc.\n\nThe given string is quite long, so I need an efficient way to parse it. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser, but perhaps a more manual approach is better here.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that each production in CNF leads to an expansion that strictly follows a binary tree structure with each node having either zero or two children, and leaves are terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best way is to try to find a path from S to the string, expanding all non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet's start with the start symbol S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, the string must start with NT17 and NT59. Checking the first part of the given string, the first two tokens are 't3' and 't10'. Let's verify if NT17 and NT59 can produce 't3' and 't10', respectively, or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\n- NT17 can produce either 't7' or t4 or 't1' based on some productions, but wait, looking at NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and NT37 is 't9', NT54 can be 't2' or 't9' or 't6'. So NT17 can't directly produce 't3', but let's see.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again:\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT17: The available ones from the initial glance. Looking back:\n\nThe list had:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54,\n\nNT17 \u2192 't4',\n\nWait, looking carefully through the grammar rules. Let me double-check each line to see which non-terminals lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5', 't3', 't10'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't2', for NT36.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me scan all the rules again:\n\nLooking for rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side (RHS) is a single terminal.\n\nAh, here are some:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't0' (is this a typo since NT2 is usually a non-terminal and shouldn't produce 't0' without further derivation)\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals have terminals as possible productions. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't10'\n\nSimilarly, NT0 can produce terminals like 't6', 't3', etc.\n\nSo some non-terminals have direct terminal productions.\n\nBack to NT17: The productions are:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo NT17 can produce the terminal 't4' directly. Therefore, in the string, when we have a 't4', it must come from NT17.\n\nSimilarly, NT59: let's check its productions.\n\nLooking at NT59:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nSo NT59 is a binary non-terminal, can't produce a terminal directly; must be expanded into two non-terminals.\n\nIn the string, the first two tokens are 't3' (NT59's first production leads to 't18' and 't36'; wait, NT18 and NT36 are non-terminals. But 't3' is a terminal. Let's see where 't3' comes from.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, for example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't5', 't3', 't10'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't2' (no, wait NT36 \u2192 't2' is not correct.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. The starting symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT17 NT59. So the string must be the leftmost derivation of this starting symbol. The string to evaluate is a sequence of t-something, each corresponding to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t11 t5 t10 t7 t9 t6 t11 t2 t7 t1 t1 t9 t0 t5 t6 t7 t2 t10 t5 t6 t4 t6 t9 t6 t0 t2 t10 t7 t4 t8 t7 t1 t6 t9 t3 t4 t7 t10`\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the entire string is made up of these terminals. My task is to see if this can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. So every step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nLooking at S -> NT17 NT59, so the first two symbols after S in the string must come from NT17 and NT59. Let's check:\n\nThe string starts with t11, t5. Wait, but NT17 and NT59 are non-terminals. So the first step must expand S to NT17 NT59, and then each of these must be expanded further until they become terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT17 is a non-terminal. Let me check what NT17 produces.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT17 -> NT37 NT54. Hmm, so NT17 is replaced by two non-terminals. So in the string, the first part after S is t11 t5 t10..., wait, no, the string is after S. Let me rephrase.\n\nWait, the string is S-> NT17 NT59. So the string is derived from NT17 and NT59. So the string starts with t11 t5...\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the string, the first symbol is t11. So NT17 must expand to a sequence that starts with t11 or involves t11 in some way.\n\nWait, no. S starts by expanding into NT17 NT59. Then each of those non-terminals must be expanded further. So the string will be the concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t11, which suggests that either NT17 or NT59 expands to include t11. Wait, but looking at the productions, let's see what each non-terminal expands to.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 -> 't3' or 't11'\n\nWait, so NT49 can go to t3 or t11. Similarly, NT18 -> t10 or 't9'? Wait, looking back, let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT18: Let's see, I see NT18 -> 't0' or 't9' perhaps?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT18: Looking up, NT18 -> 't10' or 't0', but no, wait the grammar provided has:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT59 -> 't5', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each non-terminal to see where they end up.\n\nLet's list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nS: S-> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0: NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT4: NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to write all the NTs and their productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-617","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a specific string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The goal is to determine whether the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing and makes certain analyses easier.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can see that each production on the left side (e.g., S, NT59, etc.) is either producing two non-terminals or a terminal. This fits the CNF structure. \n\nNext, I need to parse the given string using this grammar. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t4 t0 t2 t8 t7 t10 t8 t10 t0 t4 t2 t0 t0 t10 t6 t2 t3 t10 t4 t11 t6 t7 t3 t2 t10 t1 t6 t9 t6 t6 t11 t5 t7 t2 t1 t8 t0 t8`. \n\nMy approach will be to try to derive the string using the grammar, ensuring that each step follows the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, it might be possible to use a recursive descent parser or similar methods. Alternatively, we can work backwards by attempting to find a derivation path from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string must start with the leftmost symbols that can derive to NT17 and NT59. \n\nSo, the first step is to find if the string can be split into two parts: the first part must derive to NT17, and the second part must derive to NT59. If that's the case, we can proceed; otherwise, the string is not in the language.\n\nLooking at the string, let's denote it as T: \n\nT = [t4, t0, t2, t8, t7, t10, t8, t10, t0, t4, t2, t0, t0, t10, t6, t2, t3, t10, t4, t11, t6, t7, t3, t2, t10, t1, t6, t9, t6, t6, t11, t5, t7, t2, t1, t8, t0, t8]\n\nI need to check if T can be split into two sub-strings, T1 and T2, such that T1 \u2192 NT17 and T2 \u2192 NT59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work from the root S and see if the entire string can be built by applying the productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the string must decompose into the concatenation of NT17 and NT59. \n\nI think the most straightforward way is to attempt to parse the string using the given grammar, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work backwards. Let's parse the string into a parse tree, ensuring that each terminal can be derived from the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking for the possible splits. Since S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the entire string must be split into two parts: left part is NT17 and the right part is NT59.\n\nWait, before proceeding, perhaps I should write down the productions again and see the dependencies:\n\nThe productions are:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6' (Wait, one production for NT41 is 't6' and another is NT16 NT56)\n\nWait, hold on. There seems to be a potential conflict here. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT59, there are two productions: one is NT12 NT16, and another is NT57 NT24. In the context of Chomsky Normal Form, each production should have non-terminals only on the right side. Wait, but in the given grammar, some productions have terminals, like NT41 \u2192 't6', etc. But wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. Wait, that's conflicting with the given grammar because NT59 has two productions: one with terminals, which is allowed? No, wait: in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right, or a single terminal. So, for example, the production A \u2192 a is allowed, and A \u2192 BC is also allowed. So, in that case, NT59 has three productions: NT12 NT16, NT57 NT24, and NT59 \u2192 't8' and NT59 \u2192 't10'? Wait, no, let me double-check the given grammar.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT17 NT59\n\nThen:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nAh, so I see: NT59 has two productions: NT12 NT16 and NT57 NT24, but also NT59 \u2192 something else?\n\nWait, in the given list, after NT59 comes NT57.

{"custom_id":"request-635","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and I have to check if the string `t1 t2 t6 t7 t11 t5 t2 t0 t7 t9 t9 t9 t0 t10 t0 t8 t3 t0 t7 t2 t10 t1 t11 t8 t8 t8 t1 t7 t3 t6 t0 t11 t5 t6 t3 t7 t3 t3 t6` is derivable from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let me recall Chomsky Normal Form. It's a form where all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all the productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S. So the string must be generated by expanding S and then replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals until all that's left are terminals, which form the string.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t15, t24, t36, etc., but in the string, I see t0 to t11, t15, t24. Wait, no, the string doesn't include t15 or t24 except at the end, but let me check the string again. Oh, actually, in the string, the highest number is t11, but wait, looking again: the string goes up to t11 in t13 and t24, but the string given is `... t11 t5 t6 ...` so no, the string only goes up to t11. Wait, the string as written is: t1, t2, t6, t7, t11, t5, t2, t0, t7, t9, t9, t9, t0, t10, t0, t8, t3, t0, t7, t2, t10, t1, t11, t8, t8, t8, t1, t7, t3, t6, t0, t11, t5, t6, t3, t7, t3, t3, t6. So the highest t is t11, which is in t0, t1, t2, t3, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11.\n\nNow, the approach I should take is to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step's productions produce two symbols, so the length of any string derived from S will be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Let's check the length of the string given. Let's count the tokens: t1, t2, t6, t7, t11, t5, t2, t0, t7, t9, t9, t9, t0, t10, t0, t8, t3, t0, t7, t2, t10, t1, t11, t8, t8, t8, t1, t7, t3, t6, t0, t11, t5, t6, t3, t7, t3, t3, t6. That's 38 tokens. Now, 38 is not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 38 is in between, which suggests that it's not a valid derivation, because each production step adds exactly one symbol, but wait, no, actually, since in each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, the total number of symbols increases by one each time. So starting from one symbol (S), each step adds one, so after n steps, the length is 1 + n. But in this case, the string is 38 symbols, which would require 37 steps. However, let me think: actually, in CNF, each production is binary, so the number of symbols doubles each time, but wait, no. Let's think recursively.\n\nWait, actually, no. For a context-free grammar in CNF, the maximum number of symbols in a string is 2^n where n is the number of productions applied. But wait, no, let me clarify. Let's say the start symbol S is transformed into two symbols, which could be either terminals or non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals will then be replaced by two symbols, etc. So the total number of symbols is derived from the number of leaves in the parse tree. So the string length L must satisfy L = 2^{k} where k is the number of productions applied to the initial S, as each production adds one more level of symbol generation. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Actually, starting with S, which is 1 symbol. Each application of a production rule increases the number of symbols by 1. For example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 (length 2). Then each non-terminal may be replaced by two, so the length increases by 1 each time. But that's simplistic.\n\nWait, more accurately, in each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. So each step can be considered as expanding a single non-terminal into two, which could be either terminals or non-terminals. So the number of symbols can increase by zero (if both are terminals) or by one (if at least one is a non-terminal). Therefore, the number of symbols can vary.\n\nWait, no. Each production in CNF either replaces a non-terminal with two terminals or two non-terminals. So each step can double the number of non-terminals, but if a non-terminal is replaced by terminals, it no longer branches. So the total number of symbols depends on how many non-terminals are replaced by terminals. \n\nBut in this case, the string given is 38 symbols. Since 38 is even, maybe it's possible. Let me think about the start symbol S, which is transformed into NT17 NT59 (so 2 symbols). Then NT17 and NT59 each need to be expanded. Each of these could be either terminals or non-terminals. For example, if NT17 is a terminal, then it would contribute one symbol. If not, it would be replaced by two, leading to 3 symbols. So the number of symbols depends on how many non-terminals are replaced by terminals at each step.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to attempt a top-down parsing using the given grammar. Since the string starts with t1, t2, t6, etc., I need to see if the start symbol can produce this sequence.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So after the first step, we have two symbols: NT17 and NT59. Both could be non-terminals or one could be a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT59, in the grammar, I see NT59 can go to 't18' or 't36' (from the given rules). So if NT59 is a terminal, it can be t18 or t36. In the string, the first symbol is t1, which doesn't match t18 or t36. So perhaps NT59 is not a terminal but a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT17: the grammar has NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 or NT17 \u2192 't4'. So if NT17 is a terminal, it can be t4. But the string starts with t1, which is not t4, so NT17 must be a non-terminal and will be replaced with two non-terminals: NT37 and NT54.\n\nSo now, the string is t1, and we have two symbols to generate: NT37 and NT54.\n\nWait, no, after the first step, the string is split into two parts: the first symbol must come from NT17, the second from NT59.\n\nSo the entire string is built by expanding NT17 and NT59. So the entire string must be built as (expansion of NT17) (expansion of NT59).\n\nSo the first symbol is t1, which must come from NT17. So let's see what NT17 can produce.\n\nNT17 can be 't4' or NT37 NT54.\n\nIf NT17 is 't4', then the first symbol would be t4, but the string starts with t1, so that's impossible. Therefore, NT17 must be NT37 NT54.\n\nSo now, the first symbol comes from the first part of NT37's expansion, and the second symbol comes from NT54's expansion. So the string's first symbol is t1, so we have to see how NT37 can produce t1.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT37 \u2192 NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string must start with whatever NT17 and NT59 produce. \n\nI need to check if the entire string can be derived starting from S. But since the string is quite long, it's impractical to go through every possible derivation. Instead, I should look for how the string ends and work backward, a common technique in parsing using CYK algorithm or by checking possible parse trees.\n\nThe string ends with 't1'. Looking at the grammar, the production rules for terminals are given, so any terminal symbol that's not covered needs to be matched directly. For example, NT44 \u2192 't0', NT57 \u2192 't7', etc.\n\nSo, let's break down the string into tokens: I see many 't's with numbers. I need to check how each token can be generated from the non-terminals.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string must be the concatenation of what NT17 and NT59 produce. \n\nWait, but the string starts with 't1' 't5' etc. Let me see for each production rule if the starting symbols can match the string.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Then NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT10. NT9 is 't9' according to the rules. NT10 is from NT36 \u2192 t6, or wait, looking at the rules, I need to check each rule.\n\nWait, I might be mixing up the NT numbers and rules. Let me list all the terminal productions first to see the order.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'\nNT2 \u2192 't0'\nNT6 \u2192 't5' (wait, NT6 is 't5' according to the rules. Wait, but in the initial list, I see NT5 \u2192 't5'? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6' (so NT2 can produce both 't0' and 't6'? Or maybe NT2 is redundant or an error, but in any case, each non-terminal has specific rules.\n\nBut in any case, the string consists of a series of 't's.\n\nI think working backward from the string would help. The last symbol is 't1'. So the last production must be a rule that ends in 't1'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals can produce 't1'. For example, NT17 \u2192 NT17 produces 't4', which doesn't help. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, from the rules:\n\nNT44 \u2192 't0'\nNT25 \u2192 't7' and 't2' and 't5'?\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nThe string ends with 't1'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT59 \u2192 't6', but also NT59 \u2192 't57' and 't24', which themselves produce other terminals or non-terminals. Similarly, NT59 can produce NT12 and NT16, which I think produce 't11' and 't5', respectively.\n\nWait, let me see NT59's production rules: the grammar says NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. And looking up NT12 and NT16.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43, and NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nSo NT12 would produce NT5 (which is 't5') and NT43 (which is 't10', as per the rules), so NT12 \u2192 t5 t10.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 \u2192 NT55 (which is 't8') and NT32 (which is 't6'), so NT16 \u2192 t8 t6.\n\nSo NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 \u2192 (t5 t10) (t8 t6). So that's t5 t10 t8 t6. But the string ends with 't1', so that seems conflicting. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me correct. NT59 has multiple production rules:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, NT59 appears multiple times:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nAnd I see NT59 -> NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I think NT59 has the following:\n\nLine 16: NT59 -> NT12 NT16\nLine 24: NT59 -> NT57 NT24\nWait, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the lines are a bit jumbled. Let me reconstruct the grammar for easier reading.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nOther rules (with their left-hand side and right-hand sides):\n\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24 (Wait, this must be an error since NT59 is listed multiple times with different RHS.)\n\nWait, this seems like there are duplicate entries. Probably, each non-terminal has only one production where the LHS is listed as the key, but in the list above, it seems to have multiple rules. So perhaps NT59 has two right-hand sides: one is NT12 NT16, and another is NT57 NT24.\n\nSo NT59 can produce either t57 and t24, but wait, no: NT57 and NT24 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but according to the given grammar, NT59's production includes:\n\nLine 16: NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nLine 21: NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nAnd line 24: It repeats NT59 -> something.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nHere's the correct structure of the grammar as presented:\n\nIt's a list of rules starting from 'S -> NT17 NT59' and then other rules.

So S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, the leftmost symbol is NT17. Let's expand NT17: according to the rules, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo now we have NT37 nt54 followed by NT59. Let's look at the next symbols in the string after the first part.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the first part is NT17 producing NT37 NT54.

Let's be precise.\n\nWait, when S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nThen, the leftmost non-terminal is NT17, so we expand it to NT37 NT54.\n\nSo now, the string starts as NT37 NT54 NT59.\n\nWait, but in the actual string, the first part is t0. So I need to check what NT37 produces.\n\nLooking at NT37's rules: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Now, NT49's production: NT49 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo NT49 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo NT37 expands to 't3' followed by NT18.\n\nBut the very first symbol in the string is 't0', not 't3'. That's a problem. Maybe I miscounted or misapplied the steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, and then each of those may expand into terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t0.

{"custom_id":"request-637","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is provided with various production rules, and I'm given a specific string to evaluate. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step to understand how the string relates to the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule either produces two terminals or a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal and another non-terminal. That should help because the parsing process for such grammars is more straightforward.\n\nLet me list out the production rules to get a clearer picture:\n\n1. S -> NT17 NT59\n2. NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n3.

The string is: `t4 t2 t10 t10 t6 t11 t0 t0 t6 t0 t0 t9 t0 t3 t7 t11 t1 t2 t0 t8 t3 t5 t4 t1 t11 t3 t9 t8 t0 t7 t3 t0 t5 t5 t8 t3 t9 t6 t7 t11`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't4' and ends with 't11', which suggests that the string can't be longer than the possible derivations from S. The grammar starts with S -> NT17 NT59, so the first two symbols should be derived from NT17 and NT59. Let me check the options for NT59.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT59 has two possibilities: NT59 -> NT18 NT36 and another option is NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Also, there's another production: from line 16, NT59 was listed as NT12 NT16, but that seems conflicting. Wait, line 16 says NT59 -> NT12 NT16, but in line 18, NT59 is also 't6', but let me check the original list again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, line 8 is NT59 -> NT18 NT36, line 16 is NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and line 15 is NT59 -> NT12 NT16. Also, line 17 showed NT59 as NT12 NT16, but I think that was a formatting error. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the initial grammar given, lines 8, 15, and 16 all define NT59's productions. So NT59 can be either:\n\n- NT18 NT36\n\n- NT57 NT24\n\n- NT12 NT16\n\nHmm, okay. So in the initial string, after S, which is NT17 NT59, the NT59 can branch into these three possibilities.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't4 t2 t10 t10...' So maybe we can follow one path.\n\nGiven that S starts with NT17 and NT59, let's denote them as tokens starting the derivation.\n\nFirst symbol is 't4', which I assume comes from the terminal symbols. So let me see what rules produce 't4'. Looking through the production rules, NT17 can produce 't4', according to line 17: NT17 -> 't4'. Also, NT24 can produce 't4' (line 54: NT54 -> 't4'), but in the string, the first token is 't4'. So perhaps the 't4' comes from NT17's production.\n\nSo from NT17, the production is 't4', meaning the first part of the string is matched by NT17.\n\nThen the next symbols after 't4' are 't2 t10 t10...'. So after NT17 (which is 't4'), the next symbol is 't2', which should come from NT59. Let's look at NT59's productions again: NT59 can be NT18 NT36, NT57 NT24, or NT12 NT16. So when expanding NT59, it should produce a sequence of two symbols. The second token is 't2', so we need NT59 to produce 't2' as its second symbol.\n\nLet's check what's after 't2'. The third token is 't10'. So after 't2', the next token is 't10'. That suggests that NT59's second production branch is 't2' followed somehow by 't10'. Wait, but NT59 is a non-terminal that must expand into two non-terminals, but each of those can further expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo let's consider the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: NT59 -> NT18 NT36. Then we look at NT18 and NT36.\n\nLooking at the production for NT18: line 11: NT18 -> 't0'\n\nAnd NT36: several productions, including line 37: NT36 -> 't6', line 34: NT36 -> 't2', line 44: NT36 -> 't4', line 57: NT36 -> 't10', and line 58: NT36 is also used in NT43, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, line 37 says NT36 is NT5 NT15, and line 37: NT36 is also 't10'. Wait, that can\u2019t be right because each production rule should be unique. So line 37 is NT36 -> 't10', and in line 44, NT36 is also 't4'? No, wait, line 37 says NT36 is NT5 NT15, and that line 37 also says NT36 -> 't10'. Maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar again:\n\nLine 37: NT36 -> 't2'\n\nLine 34: NT36 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar given seems to be in CNF because all non-terminals on the left side produce two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nThe starting symbol is S, which immediately goes to NT17 NT59. So, the production starts with NT17 followed by NT59. Each of these needs to be expanded until we get all terminals. \n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals to see if it can generate the string. Alternatively, I can construct a parse tree or use a recursive descent approach, but given the size of the string, that might be tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or see which non-terminals correspond to the t tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar's terminal productions:\n\n- NT2, NT5, NT6, NT7, etc., are terminals. Wait, actually, the grammar's terminals are the elements after the arrows where a non-terminal is followed by an equals sign and a single character. For example, NT2 -> t0, etc. So, in the string, when I see t0, t1, etc., each corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me list all the terminals from the grammar:\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT2 -> t0\nNT5 -> t5\nNT6 -> t6\nNT7 -> t7\n...\nWait, let me make a list:\n\n- NT2 -> t0\n- NT4 -> t4\n- NT5 -> t5\n- NT7 -> t7\n- NT8 -> t8\n- NT9 -> Not in the grammar, maybe t9 comes from NT9 or another non-terminal?\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> t4\nNT12 -> t11\nNT0 -> t6 (multiple times)\nNT5 -> t5\nNT3 -> Not in terminal, perhaps?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminal productions:\n\nNT2 -> t0\nNT5 -> t3\nNT5 -> t10\nNT36 -> t6\nNT36 -> t0\nNT44 -> t2\nNT43 -> t10\nNT57 -> t7\nNT59 -> t18 (from the first production, NT59 is NT12 NT16, but in the given grammar, I see two lines for NT59: one as NT12 NT16 and another as NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has some non-terminals that are the same, like multiple rules for the same non-terminal.\n\nActually, the grammar is a bit complex with many rules, but each production is A->BC or A->a. So, to parse the string, we can look for the starting symbol S and then expand each part step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated by starting from S and expanding each part to match the string.\n\nThe string has 41 tokens. Since S produces two parts, it's likely the string is built by combining two parts, as per S -> NT17 NT59. So the first part is generated by NT17 and the second by NT59.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts? Or wait, no, because each part is a separate expansion. So, perhaps the entire string is a concatenation of two expansions: the expansion from NT17 and NT59. So, the first part would be the expansion of NT17, and the second part of NT59. \n\nBut let me check the string: It starts with t2, which is a terminal, so it's possible that each part is a sequence of terminals. But wait, in the grammar, most non-terminals produce two non-terminals, so each non-terminal requires two steps. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal in the string to the non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nFor example, let's take the first token: t2.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal (NT) on the left side expands into exactly two non-terminals on the right side, or a terminal. Terminals are represented by lowercase 't' followed by numbers, like 't6', 't8', etc. The start symbol is 'S'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is 'S', and the initial production is S -> NT17 NT59. So, to derive the string, we start by expanding S into NT17 and NT59. Each of these will need to be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t6 t8 t9 t8 t1 t10 t5 t10 t2 t11 t4 t3 t5 t6 t10 t1 t7 t10 t9 t10 t11 t6 t10 t11 t0 t3 t2 t8 t7 t7 t4 t9 t10 t7 t1 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t9`.\n\nThat's a pretty long string, but I notice that it ends with a bunch of 't9's and 't10's at the end, so I'll need to see if the grammar can generate that.\n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules for the NTs to see which can lead to 't' symbols. For each NT, I'll list their productions:\n\n- NT17: NT37 NT54 or 't4'\n- NT59: NT12 NT16 or 't16' or 't6' or 't11'\n\nWait, no, let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has each NT with specific productions. Let me list them properly:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12 OR 't0', 't5', etc.\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17 OR 't1' (Wait, no, looking again: NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17; NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43; NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32; NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41; NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 OR other options. Wait, let me get this right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a chart of all NTs and their possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the possible chain of derivations. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of expansion doubles the number of symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nBut parsing such a long string may take time. Alternatively, maybe the string can be checked step by step by seeing if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the string and see if it follows the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since this could be time-consuming, perhaps I can find a pattern or see if the string can be split into parts that align with the grammar production rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the grammar as a set of possible terminals at each step, but that might be complex.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent each part of the string and apply reduction to see if they match any productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can look for the root 'S' and see what the starting symbols generate.\n\nWait, step by step. Let me start with the root symbol S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nSo, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. This gives two NTs: NT17 and NT59. Each of these will produce their own expansions.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 or 't4'.\n\nAnd NT59's productions: Looking at the rules, NT59 has multiple options. Wait, let me list all NT59's productions.\n\nWait, the productions for NT59 are:\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\nNT59 \u2192 NT59 NT24\nWait, wait, in the given grammar, it's NT59: Let's check line by line.\n\nLooking through the productions provided:\n\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24 (again)\n- Also, in the initial lines, it's S \u2192 NT17 NT59, but other lines:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- Wait, perhaps it's better to list all NTs and their possible productions:\n\nNT0: NT55 NT12\nNT41: NT16 NT17\nNT55: NT25 NT0\nNT12: NT5 NT43\nNT16: NT55 NT32\nNT24: NT5 NT15\nNT41: ... etc.\n\nBut perhaps focusing on NT59: looking through the list, NT59 is produced by NT12 NT16, NT57 NT24, and NT59? Wait, it's written as 'NT59 -> NT12 NT16' which matches because line by line:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nI see:\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- Also, earlier:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't16'\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking again, NT59 does not have a direct production to t16. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at each NT's possible productions:\n\nUpon reviewing the grammar, it's evident that for NT59, the direct productions are:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- Also, wait, is there another production? Let me go through the provided productions line by line.\n\nLines starting with NT59:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- Then, later, another line: \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\" (which is redundant)\n- Also, earlier line: \"NT59 -> NT18 NT36\"\n\nWait, no, looking carefully: \"NT59 -> NT18 NT36\" is for NT59's production? Wait, wait, the line says:\n\n- NT59: 't18 NT36'? Let me check:\n\nWait the provided lines are:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT18 NT36\"\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-657","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I need to check is: t4 t1 t9 t4 t8 t3 t11 t3 t3 t10 t9 t9 t9 t1 t2 t4 t7 t1 t7 t9 t2 t5 t7 t8 t7 t2 t5 t8 t0 t10 t9 t9 t6 t9 t2 t8 t8 t5 t10 t5 t11 t4.\n\nFirst, I'll map out the process I need to take. Since it's a CFG, I might consider using a parsing approach or look for the derivation steps from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the derivation starts with NT17 and NT59. Each of these must be expanded until they become terminal symbols.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the exact string. Alternatively, I could try to see if the steps lead to the required sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that NT17 and NT59 might be good starting points. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n   So, the initial symbols in the derivation are NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, I need to expand NT17 and NT59. Let me look at the productions for these.\n\nNT17 can be:\n- NT37 NT54 (from NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54)\n- NT44 (from NT17 \u2192 NT44)\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see that NT17 has two productions. Let me check: Oh, the productions listed are:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT17 -> NT44\n\nSo, when expanding NT17, it can either be split into two non-terminals or become a terminal. But NT44 isn't a terminal; let's check the terminals. The string has t4, t1, etc., so looking at the terminals, they seem to correspond to NT rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and see which NTs correspond to them. Looking through the grammar, the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', 't10', 't11', 't1', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56, and NT56 might produce t5. Wait, no, let me check each production.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Maybe a better approach is to look for a leftmost derivation path that results in the given string.\n\nLet me consider that the string starts with t4. So the initial symbol must lead to a production that includes t4 at the start.\n\nLooking at NT17, if it can produce a terminal, then NT17 might produce t4 or t7 or t5, etc. Let me check the productions of NT17:\n\nFrom NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 and NT17 \u2192 NT44. NT44 isn't a terminal, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no, looking at the productions, for example, NT44 \u2192 t8, because in the list, NT44's production is NT25 NT44 and NT44 \u2192 t8? Wait, no, looking:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44,\nand NT44 \u2192 t8.\n\nSo, NT44 \u2192 t8. Similarly, other NTs have productions that go to terminals.\n\nSo, coming back to NT17. If NT17 can go to NT37 NT54, then I need to see what NT37 and NT54 produce.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to build a parse tree from the string and see if each step corresponds to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt4 t1 t9 t4 t8 t3 t11 t3 t3 t10 t9 t9 t9 t1 t2 t4 t7 t1 t7 t9 t2 t5 t7 t8 t7 t2 t5 t8 t0 t10 t9 t9 t6 t9 t2 t8 t8 t5 t10 t5 t11 t4.\n\nThat's a lot of symbols. Let me split it into tokens to see their order.\n\nNow, considering that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, we start with the entire string as the sentence to parse. We look for a production that can match the beginning of the string.\n\nBut starting with the full string is complex because it's a long string. Alternatively, I can consider whether each step in the grammar can be matched sequentially.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check whether there's a path from S to the string by expanding S's productions and seeing if they can get to that string.\n\nAlternatively, given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to look for reduction steps, trying to reduce the string according to the grammar.\n\nSo, let's start with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nThen, the initial string after expansion is NT17 followed by NT59.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t4. So, after parsing the first t4, that must come from NT17 or NT59.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The derivation is top-down, so the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string must start with symbols from NT17 and NT59. But in the string, the first symbol is t4, which must come from the expansion of one of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me instead approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, reducing it according to the grammar.\n\nWe'll start with the entire string: t4 t1 t9 t4 t8 t3 t11 t3 t3 t10 t9 t9 t9 t1 t2 t4 t7 t1 t7 t9 t2 t5 t7 t8 t7 t2 t5 t8 t0 t10 t9 t9 t6 t9 t2 t8 t8 t5 t10 t5 t11 t4.\n\nWe need to find symbols in the string that correspond to the right-hand sides of the production rules in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some rules directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT59 -> 't4' (No, looking at the grammar, NT59's productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nBut in the given grammar, for example, NT59 has:\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nAdditionally, there's a production for NT59:\n\nIn the given grammar, line 5 says:\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nWait, in the original grammar provided, there's a line that says NT59 -> NT12 NT16, so that's likely a typo, because otherwise NT59 can't produce t9 or something else. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in transcribing the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the original grammar has several expansions, but perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the grammar with multiple lines, and in one line, it's written as: NT59 -> 't4', which I think is incorrect. Let me check:\n\nHere's the user's grammar:\n\nIt ends with lines like:\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\n...\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo no, I think the user made a typo, because otherwise NT59 would not produce a terminal. So the lines for NT59 should be NT59 -> NT12 NT16 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Similarly, looking elsewhere, I think some rules produce terminals, like NT44 -> 't8', but in the list, it's written as NT44 -> 't5'?

{"custom_id":"request-671","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by that grammar. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a way to write context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t7 t8 t10 t5 t7 t5 t7 t5 t6 t2 t5 t5 t0 t6 t11 t9 t11 t0 t11 t7 t4 t2 t10 t10 t9 t5 t6 t8 t8 t2`. That's a lot of symbols, but I can break them down. Each symbol must be generated by the grammar, so I'll need to see if the entire string can be derived step by step.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to perform a parsing attempt using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals. Parsing can be done using a top-down approach, specifically using a method like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to see if the string can be broken down according to the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar structure, the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So, the string must start with a production from NT17 and NT59. Let me check the string: it starts with t7, t8, etc. I need to see if these correspond to any productions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT17 can produce a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. Looking at the productions under NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 or NT17 \u2192 NT0. So, either it produces two non-terminals or one terminal. Let's see which one applies here.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t7, t8, etc. So perhaps NT17 is producing t7. Wait, the productions for NT17 are:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 NT0 (and then what does NT0 produce?)\n\nWait, the initial rule for S is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So both NT17 and NT59 need to be expanded. So maybe I should look at both starting symbols.\n\nWait, let me look at NT59's productions. From the grammar, NT59 has several rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 (probably a typo, but likely same as the second one)\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT59 ends with some specific terminal productions like \u2192 't0', 't3', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, actually in the given grammar, looking at NT59, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nAdditionally, earlier rules have NT59 -> NT12 NT16, which seems to be the same as the second one, perhaps a duplication. Then, later, it's also listed as NT59 \u2192 some terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nAnd also, at the end:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nWait, but in the grammar, it's:\n\nLooking again: under NT59, do we have any terminal rules?\n\nIn the grammar provided, under NT59, there's:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nThen later, in the grammar, there are two more entries where NT59 is a terminal:\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nThe grammar entries:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT59 -> nt12 nt16 (same as above)\nNT59 -> nt57 nt24 (same as above)\nAnd in the terminal productions:\n\nWait, no, in the grammar list, there's:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nBut looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nThe line says:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nWait, but in the list, also:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nAnd other lines:\n\nNT55 -> nt25 nt0\nAnd elsewhere, the terminals appear as:\n\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, I think I need to parse the entire string step by step, starting from S. Let me try to find a way to break down the string.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first part is NT17, the second is NT59. So the string should start with the symbols from NT17 and then those from NT59.\n\nLooking at the string: t7, t8, t10, t5, t7, t5, t7, t5, t6, t2, t5, t5, t0, t6, t11, t9, t11, t0, t11, t7, t4, t2, t10, t10, t9, t5, t6, t8, t8, t2.\n\nHmm, that's a lot, but perhaps I can start breaking it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider NT17. Its productions are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 or NT17 \u2192 NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 NT16 NT5, for example.\n\nWait, let me write down the possible steps:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So I need to derive the given string as a combination of the symbols generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me write the string as two parts: first the part generated by NT17, then by NT59.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, S produces NT17 and NT59, so both are used, and the entire string must be the combination of the symbols generated by these two non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps I should split the string into two parts: first part generated by NT17, second part generated by NT59.\n\nBut that might not be straightforward. Maybe it's better to see if the entire string can be generated step by step through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be considered as a sequence of symbols that can be generated by the combination of the rules for NT17 and NT59.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is the concatenation of the symbols from NT17 and NT59 derivations. So we can treat the string as a sequence of symbols that starts with NT17's symbols, followed by NT59's.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so each string generated by S is the concatenation of the symbols from NT17 and NT59. So, for instance, if NT17 generates a string A, and NT59 generates string B, then the overall string is A followed by B.\n\nBut in the given string, it's a long mix of symbols, but perhaps the first part is generated by NT17, then the second part by NT59.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two non-terminals are interleaved, but since each production in CNF can only generate pairs of non-terminals, it's more about parsing the string in a way that the symbols come from the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by recursively applying the grammar's productions.\n\nBut manually doing this could be complicated. Maybe I can look for specific symbols that only appear in certain rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example, NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nLet me see if any symbol in the string can only be produced by one rule.\n\nLooking at the string: t7, t8, t10, t5, t7, t5, t7, t5, t6, t2, t5, t5, t0, t6, t11, t9, t11, t0, t11, t7, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t0 t11 t9 t1 t8 t9 t7 t3 t8 t8 t7 t0 t1 t8 t5 t3 t8 t3 t1 t3 t8 t6 t0 t11 t11 t8 t0 t4 t1 t1 t2 t1 t0 t1 t4 t2 t9 t8 t6 t6 t11 t5`.\n\nLet me note that each part of the string is a terminal, either something like t0, t1, t2, etc., or letters like t6, t7, etc., up to t59. The grammar has productions that eventually reduce to these terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the string starts with t2. Looking at the grammar, I can see that some NTs produce t2. For example, NT25 -> NT13 NT44 and NT13 -> t3, and NT44 -> t0. But wait, no, looking again, the NTs are actually non-terminals that can expand into other NTs or terminals. Let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, some of the NTs directly produce terminals. For example:\nNT25 -> t7\nNT55 -> t8\nNT49 -> t3 or t11\nNT59 -> t18 etc., but also, perhaps more importantly, some NTs like NT5 and NT25 expand into terminals. Hmm.\n\nI need to trace how the string could be built. Since the grammar is in CNF (Chomsky Normal Form), each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a non-terminal splitting into two terminals. So each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two symbols (either both non-terminals or both terminals).\n\nThe string given is quite long, so I'm thinking it might be a good idea to look for how each part is built up. Each step would typically process two symbols, so if I can parse the string in chunks that match the possible terminals, I can see if each chunk can be derived from a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to work backwards from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar. Starting from the string, try to match the end, seeing if the last few symbols can form a production that leads to a non-terminal that can then be reduced further.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT25 -> t7, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT5 -> t5, t3, t10. NT2 -> t0, t6, t4, t5. NT0 -> t0, t6, t1. NT12 -> t11, t1. NT17 -> t4, t7, t6, etc. Wait, no, I think the NT17 has multiple productions. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the productions, perhaps I should list all the NTs that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT5 -> t5, t3, t10\n- NT2 -> t0, t6, t4, t5\n- NT0 -> t0, t6, t1\n- NT12 -> t11, t1\n- NT17 -> t4, t6, t7 (Wait, looking back, actually, in the productions, there's nt17 -> nt37 nt54, but then nt37 -> nt9 etc., but perhaps nt17 also has a terminal production. Wait, let me check the initial part of the grammar:\n\nWait, initial grammar listed:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nBut then looking further down, there's NT17 -> NT37 NT54 and so on, but does NT17 have any terminal productions? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT17 -> anything terminal. Hmm, but earlier in the list, NT41 -> NT17 NT37, which is part of the grammar. So maybe the NT17 doesn't produce a terminal but another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each NT to see which produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36 (from earlier) but then looking further, NT59 also appears in other productions, like S -> NT59, but in more detailed list, NT59 has additional rules, like NT59 -> NT12 NT16, etc. So perhaps I need a more comprehensive list.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me make a list of all NTs that have a terminal in their productions.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT41 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't10'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT16 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n- NT57 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT37 -> 't9'\n- NT36 -> 't0'\n- NT44 -> 't2'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't3'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT32 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT43 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT37 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't9'\n\nWait, okay, so now I can identify that several NTs directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT5 -> t5, t3, t10\n- NT2 -> t0, t6, t4, t5\n- NT0 -> t0, t6, t1\n- NT12 -> t11, t1\n- NT17 -> t4, t7, t5? Wait, no. From the productions, NT17 only appears in S and another rule, but does it produce a terminal? Looking at the full list, it seems that NT17 doesn't have a production to a terminal. It's always combined with another NT. Similarly, NT25 -> t7.\n\nSo, perhaps the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\nNT25 -> t7\n\nNT49 -> t3, t11, t0\n\nNT55 -> t8\n\nNT2 -> t0, t6, t4, t5\n\nNT0 -> t0, t6, t1\n\nNT12 -> t11, t1\n\nWait, let me list all the NTs that have a rule to a terminal:\n\n1. NT25 -> t7\n\n2. NT5 -> t5, t3, t10\n\n3. NT2 -> t0, t6, t4, t5\n\n4. NT12 -> t11, t1\n\n5. NT17 -> t?

Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol, which might produce a terminal. The start symbol here is S. Looking at the grammar, the first production is S -> NT17 NT59. So, I guess I'll need to trace each of those NTs back to their terminals to see how they can produce the string.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t1 t0 t3 t1 t10 t2 t4 t4 t0 t11 t2 t7 t8 t11 t4 t6 t4 t0 t11 t0 t9 t11 t11 t9 t1 t11 t11 t10 t5 t3 t4 t7 t6 t8 t0 t11 t3 t8 t2 t1 t7 t11 t5 t4`.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a parsing strategy, maybe the CYK algorithm, which is applicable for CNF grammars. But to do that, I need to know all the production rules and map them out thoroughly.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules as I understand them:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16 (Wait, isn't this a duplicate of the previous NT59 rule?)\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nNT41 -> 't6'\n\nNT49 -> 't3'\n\nNT24 -> 't10'\n\nNT49 -> 't11'\n\nNT8 -> 't10'\n\nNT36 -> 't2'\n\nNT15 -> 't0'\n\nNT16 -> 't5'\n\nNT2 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't6' (Hmm, multiple rules for NT2 as itself?)\n\nNT2 -> 't4'\n\nNT24 -> 't0'\n\nNT18 -> 't0'\n\nNT24 -> 't5'\n\nNT17 -> 't4'\n\nNT12 -> 't11'\n\nNT0 -> 't6'\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT25 -> 't7'\n\nNT5 -> 't3'\n\nNT5 -> 't10'\n\nNT36 -> 't6'\n\nNT55 -> 't8'\n\nNT44 -> 't0'\n\nNT25 -> 't2'\n\nNT57 -> 't7'\n\nNT0 -> 't1'\n\nNT37 -> 't9'\n\nNT36 -> 't0'\n\nNT44 -> 't2'\n\nNT36 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't3'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT17 -> 't7'\n\nNT0 -> 't1' (Wait, already had this?

For example, NT59 appears to have two production rules: NT59 -> NT12 NT16 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Also, NT24 is 't10' in one rule and 't5' in another, but I think it's intended to have 't10' as the rule since that seems more consistent with NT24 -> 't10' and other rules.\n\nAlso, NT18 has two rules: NT18 -> 't0' and NT18 -> 't0' again? So, perhaps it's a mistake, but in any case, it's just 't0'.\n\nI might need to create a table of all non-terminals and their possible productions, along with their terminal equivalents, to see if I can form the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is NT17 and NT59. So, the first step would be to split the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT17 and the second by NT59. Alternatively, it could be any split, but with the given productions, perhaps there's a specific way to split.\n\nLet me list the symbols again for clarity: the string is:\n\nt1, t0, t3, t1, t10, t2, t4, t4, t0, t11, t2, t7, t8, t11, t4, t6, t4, t0, t11, t0, t9, t11, t11, t9, t1, t11, t11, t10, t5, t3, t4, t7, t6, t8, t0, t11, t3, t8, t2, t1, t7, t11, t5, t4.\n\nThe first symbol is t1. Looking through the production rules, which non-terminals can produce t1?\n\nLooking at NT rules:\n\n- NT15: 't0'\n- NT16: 't5'\n- NT2: 't0', 't6', 't4'\n- NT5: 't5', 't3', 't10'\n- NT24: 't0', 't5'\n- NT8: 't10'\n- NT36: 't2', 't6', 't4'\n- NT55: 't8'\n- NT44: 't0', 't2', 't4'\n- NT37: 't9', 't10', 't6'\n- NT54: 't2', 't9', 't10', 't6'\n- NT7: Hmm, wait, looking back, I might have missed NT7. Let me check: NT36's rules include 't0', 't2', 't4'. There's also NT13 -> 't3', NT25 -> 't7', so NT25 can produce 't7'. So, NT25: 't7'.\n\nSo, NT17 and NT59 are the starting points.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by looking for possible expansions. Since the string starts with t1, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't1'.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT25: 't7'\n- NT54: 't9', etc. Doesn't produce 't1'.\n- NT2: produces 't0', 't6', 't4' \u2013 no 't1'.\n- Is there any NT that can produce 't1'? Looking through, maybe NT55: 't8' no. NT41: 't5' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check: The production rules only include certain NTs with terminals. It's possible that some NTs can produce a t0, t1, etc., but from the given rules, it seems that:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't1':\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT24: 't0', 't5'\n- NT17: 't4'\n- NT12: 't11'\n- NT5: 't5', 't3', 't10'\n- Others don't seem to produce 't1'.\n\nWait, so none of the non-terminals directly produce 't1'. That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake in transcription.\n\nWait, let me look at the original grammar again. The start is S -> NT17 NT59. So S is split into NT17 and NT59. Each of those needs to produce a part of the string.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't1', so which NT can produce 't1'? From the grammar provided, I don't see any non-terminal that can produce 't1' directly. So perhaps there's a mistake in the transcription, or maybe the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is supposed to be NT17 and NT59, and each of those can produce multiple symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-683","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit because each production has two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, the task is to check if the string `t9 t4 t6 t6 t6 t0 t0 t4 t8 t9 t11 t10 t7 t8 t11 t2 t1 t10 t0 t1 t0 t3 t6 t7 t6 t8 t9 t5 t7 t9 t3 t5 t0 t4 t11 t3 t7 t8 t3 t6 t9 t11 t8 t6` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nThe approach I usually take for such problems is to use the CYK algorithm. I remember that CYK is efficient for parsing context-free grammars, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to jog my memory.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring corresponding to that cell. The size of the table is determined by the length of the string. The algorithm proceeds in passes, each corresponding to a position in the string.\n\nBut wait, this string is pretty long\u201438 tokens. That would mean the table would be 38x38. Manually constructing this would be extremely time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter way or look for patterns or shorter derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a top-down derivation, starting from the start symbol S and trying to expand it step by step, seeing if I can reach the given string. Let's see.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 and NT59. So the first step is to see if the string starts with NT17 or NT59. Looking at the string, the first token is t9. Let me check if t9 is the result of any production from NT17 or NT59.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24\n\nSo t9 must be the result of one of these productions.

For example, NT57 \u2192 't7', and NT37 \u2192 't9' and so on.\n\nSo, for NT37, the productions are:\n\nLooking back: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nWait, no, my mistake.

Wait, looking back:\n\nActually, in the provided grammar, some lines are:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT57 -> 't7'\n\nNT37 -> 't9'\n\nNT36 -> 't6'\n\nNT55 -> 't8'\n\nAnd so on. So, NT57 produces 't7', NT37 produces 't9', NT36 produces 't6', etc.\n\nSo, for NT37, the production is NT37 \u2192 't9'.\n\nWait, no, because the grammar is CNF, so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, the rules that produce terminals directly are single-symbol productions. So, for example:\n\nNT57 \u2192 't7' (line: NT57 -> 't7')\n\nNT37 \u2192 't9' (line: NT37 -> 't9')\n\nSimilarly, NT36 \u2192 't6' (line: NT36 -> 't6')\n\nAnd NT54 \u2192 't9' (line: NT54 -> 't9')\n\nWait, but no, looking again. For example, NT37 \u2192 't9' is a rule, so it can directly produce t9.\n\nSimilarly, NT57 \u2192 't7' can produce t7 directly.\n\nSo, in that case, for the given string, the first token is t9. So S starts by deriving either NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, if the first token is t9, then either NT37 or NT54 must produce t9.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT37 \u2192 't9' directly.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't9' as well (from NT54 -> 't9' in the given grammar? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce 't9'. For example:\n\nIs there a NT54 \u2192 't9'?

Let's see: NT17 produces NT37 and NT54. If both NT37 and NT54 can produce t9, then the first token could come from either.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.

Let's see how.\n\nIf the first token is produced by NT37, then S \u2192 NT17 NT59 \u2192 NT37 ... , but wait, no: S starts with NT17 and NT59, so S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which would produce the concatenation of NT17's derivation and NT59's derivation.\n\nWait, but since S \u2192 NT17 NT59, it's the concatenation. So to derive the entire string, each part comes from NT17 and NT59, so perhaps the first part is from NT17 and the second from NT59.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the string is a sequence where the first part comes from NT17's derivation and the second part from NT59's derivation.\n\nSo the entire string must be of the form (NT17 derivation)(NT59 derivation).\n\nTherefore, the first part of the string is from NT17's derivation, and the second part from NT59's.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case.

The string is quite long, and the grammar has several non-terminals. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recap the grammar to ensure I've got it right. The grammar starts with S and each production is a combination of two non-terminals except for a few that directly produce terminals ('t's and 'n's like NT10, etc. Wait, actually looking at it again, the NT0, NT1, etc., seem to be non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. So, the topmost symbol is S, which goes to NT17 NT59. Then, each of those NTs will have their own productions.\n\nGiven the string to check is a sequence of t's, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string. Each step in the derivation should produce exactly two symbols, since it's in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nLet me list out the steps I might need to take:\n\n1. Understand the structure of the grammar and how each non-terminal can be expanded.\n2. Start with the start symbol S, which is NT17 NT59.\n3. Expand NT17 and NT59 using their production rules, making sure each expansion contributes a part of the string.\n4. Continue expanding the non-terminals in a way that when all are replaced by terminals, the resulting string matches the given string.\n\nLooking closer at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT49->t3, NT59->t18, and so on. So, the leaves of the derivation tree will be these terminals.\n\nThe given string has 38 tokens (as I count: t10, t9, etc.), so each non-terminal expansion must consist of two terminals or a mix that, when combined, will produce this exact sequence.\n\nI think the best approach is to attempt to parse the string from the grammar. However, without a recursive descent parser or more advanced techniques, it might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a way to build the string by expanding the non-terminals step by step. Let's see.\n\nStarting with S = NT17 NT59.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54 (Production 2: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54)\n- NT59 -> can go to multiple productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 (Production 7: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16), or NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24 (Production 8: NT59\u2192 NT57 NT24), or NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 (Production 9: NT59\u2192 NT18 NT36). Let's see which one fits.\n\nLooking at the string, after T11 (from the start), the next few are t10, t9, etc. Not sure yet, but perhaps starting with NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 might help because NT16 is a non-terminal that goes to t5.\n\nLooking at NT12 and NT16:\n\nNT12 productions:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43 (Production 12)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT11 (Production 11: NT12\u2192 t11)\n\nSo either NT12 becomes t11 or takes more steps.\n\nSimilarly, NT16:\n- NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32 (Production 6: NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32)\n- NT16 \u2192 NT45, no, wait, checking NT16 productions: NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32 (Production 6) and NT16 \u2192 NT2 (Production 14: NT2 seems to have multiple options).

Wait, so Production 4 is NT5 \u2192 NT5, but that's a problem because it can lead to infinite recursion. How is this possible? Usually, in CFGs, a rule like A \u2192 A would cause problems unless it's part of a chain leading to a terminal.\n\nBut here, NT5 can expand to itself or to NT10 or t9. If it expands to itself, then without another way to terminate, it's an invalid grammar. Unless NT5 eventually leads to a production that doesn't keep expanding. Let me check NT5's productions more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me list all NT5's productions:\n\nLooking through the given grammar lines:\n\n- NT5 produces 't5' (from line: NT56 -> NT2, possibly not)\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading.

So, this suggests a problem in the grammar itself. Perhaps a typo or I've misread.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't5' is elsewhere.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I misread NT5's production. Let me compile all the rules for each non-terminal.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\n\nNT54 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT5 -> NT5\n\nNT5 -> NT10\n\nNT5 -> 't9'\n\nSo yes, NT5 has three options: NT5 \u2192 NT5, NT5 \u2192 NT10, NT5 \u2192 t9.

{"custom_id":"request-692","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar consists of production rules, each of which replaces a symbol with a combination of other symbols until all symbols are terminals (like 't0', 't1', etc.), which would form the string. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe target string is: `t0 t2 t8 t11 t5 t5 t7 t10 t5 t8 t1 t1 t9 t7 t1 t11 t8 t11 t3 t7 t3 t4 t11 t7 t8 t10 t11 t4 t0 t11 t9 t4 t10 t7 t4 t2 t5 t5 t11 t1 t10 t10 t9 t3 t4`.\n\nSince this is a CFG in CNF, each production rule either produces two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So, to parse the string, I can think about reversing the process: starting from the string and seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and terminals involved. The non-terminals seem to be things like S, NT0, NT1, etc., except for the 't' symbols, which are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is of the form NT -> NT1 NT2. So, each production introduces two symbols, each of which could be a non-terminal that further splits into more symbols.\n\nA key approach in such parsing is to consider the possible ways the string can be split into such pairs. Each pair should correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nThe string length is 43, which is an odd number. Since each step in the grammar production adds one non-terminal, the number of symbols in the string should be equal to 1 (start symbol) plus the number of production steps. For example, S -> NT1 NT59 would be two symbols. Then each of those can split into two more, making a total of four, and so on.\n\nThe total number of symbols generated after n production steps is 2^n. So, for the string's 43 symbols, 2^n should be 43 or more. Wait, but 2^6 is 64, which is larger than 43. So, 6 steps might be enough. However, it's not exactly straightforward because some steps might involve terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the number of symbols between two possible splits is a multiple of 2 or reduces in a way that fits the grammar. Also, since the grammar might have specific patterns, the string needs to fit that.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which splits into NT1 (probably NT17) and NT59. So, the string must start with t0 t1 or something, but let's check.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is t0. Let me see which non-terminals produce t0.\n\nLooking through the productions for each NT:\n\n- NT43 -> t10 (as per the given productions: NT43 -> 't10')\n- NT12 -> 't11' (NT12 -> 't11')\n- NT15 -> 't0' (NT15 -> 't0')\n- NT17 -> 't4' (NT17 -> 't4')\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a long sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 w where w is a terminal string (a single terminal). The given grammar seems to fit this because all the non-terminals on the left have right-hand sides that are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe string I need to check is: `t10 t1 t6 t0 t10 t7 t7 t2 t0 t1 t3 t2 t1 t7 t10 t4 t11 t1 t5 t10 t3 t7 t5 t4 t8 t10 t9 t4 t4 t7 t3 t5 t8 t0 t3 t1 t11 t11 t1 t6 t1 t10 t4 t10 t3 t0`.\n\nMy first thought is that since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree for the string should have a certain structure. In CNF, each production leads to exactly two non-terminals, so the parse tree will be a binary tree. The height of the tree will be log2(n), where n is the length of the string. So for a string of length m, the number of steps in the derivation should be around log2(m).\n\nBut wait, let me think about the string length. The given string has 52 tokens. That's quite long, so the derivation must have gone through many steps. Each non-terminal split adds two non-terminals until we reach the leaves, which are terminals. So for a string length of m, the leftmost derivation would have m-1 non-terminals, each split contributing to the tree depth.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to parse the string from the grammar. That might be more straightforward. Parsing algorithms like CYK can handle CNF grammars efficiently, but since I don't have the actual grammar rules with non-terminals, just the right-hand sides for each, maybe I can manually check.\n\nBut wait, given the complexity of the grammar, with many non-terminals, manually trying to find a derivation would be time-consuming and error-prone. Perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be segmented into the allowed productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the beginning of the string: t10 t1 t6 t0 t10 t7 t7 t2 t0 t1 t3 t2 t1 t7 t10 t4 t11 t1 t5 t10 t3 t7 t5 t4 t8 t10 t9 t4 t4 t7 t3 t5 t8 t0 t3 t1 t11 t11 t1 t6 t1 t10 t4 t10 t3 t0.\n\nI recall that in CNF, the derivation is a sequence of steps where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals until you reach the base case of terminals. Since the first symbol is t10, I need to find a production that directly gives t10. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand to single terminals:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t7\n- NT57 \u2192 t7\n- NT49 \u2192 t3\n- NT55 \u2192 t8\n- NT44 \u2192 t0\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT10 \u2192 t10 (but there's no NT10 in the grammar as given)\nWait, let me check the rules again. The grammar has rules like NT2 \u2192 t0, NT2 \u2192 t6, NT2 \u2192 t4. But I don't see a production for NT10. Oh wait, the string starts with t10, so how does that happen? Every production in CNF either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal, so t10 must be the result of a non-terminal expanding directly into it. Looking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 t4, NT2 \u2192 t0, t6, t4. No NT10, so how is t10 being produced?\n\nWait, that's a red flag. If the string starts with t10, but none of the non-terminals in the grammar produce t10 directly, then it's impossible. Because in CNF, the only way to get a terminal is from a production like A \u2192 t10. But looking through the given rules, I don't see any NT producing t10. So this would mean that t10 cannot be part of any string generated by this grammar, making the answer immediately 'No'.\n\nBut let me double-check. The rules provided have many non-terminals, but looking through them:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\nNT41 \u2192 't6'\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\nNT24 \u2192 't10'\nOh, wait! There's a NT24 rule that directly produces 't10'. So NT24 \u2192 t10. So the non-terminal NT24 can produce t10. \n\nSo looking back, in the string, the first token is t10. So how did we get t10? That must come from NT24 expanding to t10. So in the derivation, there must be a step where NT24 \u2192 t10. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT24's production is given as:\nNT24 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo that's a terminal production. Now, how would that fit into the CNF? In CNF, a production can be A \u2192 t10, which is directly terminal, but in this case, NT24 is already a non-terminal that can produce t10. \n\nBut wait, in CNF, all productions on the left must be non-terminals, but in the given grammar, NT24 can produce 't10', so it's a direct production. So the string starts with t10, so it must come from NT24 \u2192 t10. But then, how did NT24 get into the string? It must have been derived from another non-terminal that expands into NT24. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the parsing process, the leftmost non-terminal can produce t10 directly. So the first step is NT24 \u2192 t10. But then, how did NT24 appear in the first place? Because in the initial symbol of the grammar, the start symbol is S, and we need to derive from S. So for the string to start with t10, S must generate NT24, which then generates t10. \n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT59 (from the given rules). So the initial step is S expands into NT17 and NT59. Then, one of these must expand to include NT24 as the first symbol. \n\nLooking at NT17 and NT59, let's see if they can lead to NT24. \n\nStarting with NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 (from the rules). Then, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, and NT49 can produce 't3' or 't7'? Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the rules:\nNT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't7'?\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The rules for NT49 are:\nNT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't7'? Or is that another rule? Wait, looking back, the rules provided are:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT41 \u2192 't6'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT24 \u2192 't10'\n- NT25 \u2192 't7'\n- NT57 \u2192 't7'\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT44 \u2192 't0'\n- NT36 \u2192 't6'\n- NT49 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. \n\nLooking through the rules, NT49 appears twice:\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The given rules include:\n\nNT49 has two productions:\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t4 t7 t11 t1 t2 t10 t0 t8 t1 t11 t1 t8 t11 t0 t7 t8 t7 t8 t3 t0 t9 t3 t1 t5 t10 t3 t4 t6 t3 t6 t6 t1 t11 t3 t10 t4 t5 t2 t4 t11 t9 t8 t8 t0 t1 t1`.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. A grammar is in CNF if each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar indeed is in CNF since each rule is either a direct production to two non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nMy task is to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. The string provided consists of a series of terminals (t0, t1, etc.), so I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start rule S, which initially produces NT17 NT59. Each segment in the string is separated by spaces, indicating each is one token. So the entire string has 36 tokens.\n\nI'll outline a general approach:\n\n1. **Start from the beginning**: The start symbol is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step would involve expanding NT17 and NT59.\n2. **Check possible derivations**: For each non-terminal, look at the productions associated with them and see which can lead us closer to the terminals in the string.\n3. **Trace the string step by step**: Each time I expand a non-terminal, I should match a terminal in the string. If I get a non-terminal that doesn't match the next token, that path is invalid. If all tokens can be matched through the grammar, then it's generated.\n\nBut doing this manually for 36 tokens would be extremely time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or repetitions in the string that match known derivations.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: `t4 t7 t11 t1`. The first part is `t4`, which is part of NT17 or NT14? Wait, let me check the productions. NT14 isn\u2019t listed, but the first production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step is to expand NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 must expand to these.

Then NT49 could be 't3' or 't11'. NT18's productions: NT18 -> 't0', NT18 -> 't2', NT18 -> 't0', etc. Wait, from the rules, NT18 \u2192 't0', 't2', and 't0' again?\n\nWait, the NT18 rules: Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT18 -> 't10', NT18 -> 't0', NT18 -> 't2', and another 't0', 't10', etc. Wait, let me list them correctly.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT18 -> 't0' (appears multiple times: lines NT18 -> 't0', NT18 -> 't0', etc.), NT18 -> 't10', NT18 -> 't2' (appears twice?), let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT18: \n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't2' (twice?)\n\nWait, the lines are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n- NT57 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't0'\n- NT37 -> 't9'\n- NT36 -> 't0'\n- NT44 -> 't2'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't3'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT32 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT43 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT37 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't9'\n- NT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, I might have miscounted.

{"custom_id":"request-713","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals (except for some that directly produce terminals like 't0' to 't11'). The start symbol is S, which produces NT17 and NT59.\n\nThe string to check is: `t11 t8 t8 t3 t5 t7 t6 t9 t9 t5 t10 t0 t3 t6 t5 t7 t1 t2 t3 t10 t11 t0 t4 t2 t8 t0 t9 t5 t10 t7 t0 t4`.\n\nTo validate the string, I can approach this by checking if there's a leftmost derivation that produces this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of a derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols. So the number of symbols in the string should be equal to the length of the leftmost derivation, which should be n-1 for a string of length n.\n\nThe given string has 40 tokens. Therefore, the derivation should consist of 39 steps, starting from S.\n\nLet me outline the approach: for each token, I'll try to trace back through the productions to see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step is NT17 and NT59. Let's break this down.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So after the first step, the stack would be [NT37, NT54, from NT17], and we have NT59.\n\nNow, NT59 has multiple productions. Looking back, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, NT57 NT24, etc. Let's see if NT59 can produce 't11' as the second token.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to process the string step by step, checking each terminal as it appears.\n\nLet me consider the order of the string:\n\nt11, t8, t8, t3, t5, t7, t6, t9, t9, t5, t10, t0, ... and so on.\n\nLooking at the first token 't11'. Which non-terminal produces 't11'? Looking through the productions, I see NT44 \u2192 't10', NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10', etc. Wait, there's an NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10', and maybe others. Let me check: NT24 is mentioned with multiple productions ending with 't0', 't5', 't10', etc. Specifically, the provided grammar has:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10'.\n\nSo NT24 can produce 't10' (from T10). Therefore, the first token 't11' is not directly produced by any of the non-terminals except perhaps NT32 or others? Wait, looking back, I don't see any NT producing 't11' directly except possibly NT24 with a 't10' but not 't11'.\n\nWait, checking the list of grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT24 appears in the list as:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10'. So it can produce 't10', but not 't11'. Hmm, but the string starts with 't11'. So either there's a mistake, or the string isn't produced.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me re-examine the grammar. The non-terminals are: S, NT0, NT41, NT55, NT12, NT16, NT57, NT59, NT25, NT43, NT37, NT8, NT36, NT15, NT17, NT49, NT24, NT18, NT2, NT2's productions, etc.\n\nLooking again, NT2's productions are: NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'. So 't11' isn't in there. Wait, perhaps some other non-terminal produces 't11'. Let me check all the Nonterminals:\n\nLooking for any production that ends with 't11'. Checking through all the NT rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't11', except perhaps if we have a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps via some intermediate steps. For example, could a non-terminal expand into two other non-terminals that together produce 't11'?\n\nLet me think. Maybe NT24 can produce 't10' and something else. Let's say NT24 \u2192 NT10 't0' and another symbol, but I don't see any NT that produces 't11' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look for any NT with 't11' as a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't11'. So that would suggest that the first token 't11' can't be produced by any rule, which would make the entire string not derivable.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't10'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT16 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 't7'\n- NT57 \u2192 't7'\n- NT59 \u2192 't18' and others\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'\n- NT2's productions also include NT24, which can produce t0, t5, t10.\n\nWait, wait, looking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. NT37 \u2192 NT9? Or wait, looking at NT37 rule: NT37 \u2192 NT9? Let me check:\n\nLooking again, NT37 \u2192 NT9. And NT9? Let me check if any NT9 rule exists. From the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT9, I don't see any NT9 rule. But wait, perhaps from another rule. Wait, looking at the initial rules, I don't see an NT9. Hmm.\n\nWait, but there's a NT37 \u2192 NT9. So how does that work? So NT37 expands into NT9. But where is NT9 defined? Let me check all the NT rules again.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any rule for NT9. So perhaps NT9 is a typo and shouldn't be there. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps NT37 \u2192 NT9 is a typo, and it should produce a terminal. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nLooking at NT37: does it have a rule that produces a terminal? Looking through the list, I don't see NT37 \u2192 something like 't9'. So how doesnt produce 't9'?\n\nWait, but in the given rules, there's a NT54 \u2192 NT9. So NT54 produces NT9 and other things. But if NT9 isn't defined to produce a terminal, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-714","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the grammar provided. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. But wait, looking at the grammar, some rules have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, like S -> NT17 NT59. Oh no, so actually, it's a context-free grammar, but not exactly CNF because some rules might produce terminals and non-terminals mixed. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. But the given rules seem to sometimes have terminals, so maybe the user made a typo. For example, looking at NT41 -> 't6', which is a terminal. Hmm, so the grammar has both non-terminal and terminal productions. That's okay because they just have to be context-free.\n\nAnyway, the string is a sequence of terminals: t7 t2 t5 t10 t11 t3 t9 t10 t3 t11 t4 t10 t11 t6 t9 t1 t9 t4 t1 t6 t6 t6 t4 t2 t5 t4 t7 t2 t11 t5 t9 t4 t1 t1 t11 t5 t6 t3 t4 t10 t11 t7 t11 t0 t1 t10 t4.\n\nI think the approach is to use the grammar to parse the string step by step, checking if each step is valid.\n\nFirst, I'll note that Chomsky Normal Form allows for generating strings by replacing symbols according to the rules. Since some symbols produce terminals, the process involves replacing non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut looking at the given production rules, I can see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, so these are the leaves of the parse tree. For example, NT41 -> 't6', which immediately gives a 't6' in the string. But I need to structure the derivation such that the entire string is produced.\n\nWait, the string starts with t7. Let's find which non-terminals produce t7. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT55 -> NT55 NT8 (Wait, no, I see later that NT55 -> NT25 NT0, which then maybe produce t8. Or maybe wait, wait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the rules that result in t7. Let me scan the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41 (does this produce t7? No, because it's two non-terminals. What about NT8? Let me check NT8. NT8 -> 't10', so NT57 is t8 followed by t10.)\n\nWait, looking for any production that results in 't7'. Let's check all.\n\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18. NT49 -> 't11', NT18 -> 't0'. So that's t11 t0, which is t11 t0, not t7.\n\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41. NT8 -> t10, NT41 -> t6. So t10 t6, not t7.\n\nWait, maybe some other rule. Let me look:\n\nAh, NT54 -> t9. Hmm, maybe other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT7? Let me check again. NT17 was defined as: NT17 -> NT37 NT54. So NT37 is 't11 t0', and NT54 is t9. So NT17 becomes t11 t0 t9. Wait, but 't7' isn't appearing here.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all rules where a terminal appears.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0. NT25 -> t7. NT0 is t0. So that's t7 t0, right? So NT55 can produce t7 t0.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT41 is defined as t6, but NT57 is: NT57 -> NT8 NT41, which is t10 and t6. But wait, looking back, the rule for NT57 is actually in the provided grammar as: NT59 -> NT18 NT36; but that's about NT59. Wait no, original rules:\n\nIn the grammar, the NT rules include:\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nAnd NT8 is 't10'.\n\nWait, but NT57's production is NT8 NT41, which would result in t10 t6, not t7.\n\nBut looking for where 't7' is produced. Looking again:\n\nWait, in the rules, NT17 is defined as NT37 NT54, which becomes t11 t0 t9, so that's t11 t0 t9.\n\nBut NT54 -> t9; so when you use NT54, you get t9 right away.\n\nWait, let me think about the rule NT55 -> NT25 NT0. NT25 is 't7', and NT0 is something else. So NT55 can produce t7 followed by whatever NT0 produces.\n\nIf S starts as NT55 NT9. So let me see the initial rule. S -> NT55 NT0.\n\nYes, S -> NT55 NT0. So the derivation starts with S, which becomes NT55 and NT0. So to produce the entire string, these two non-terminals must produce the given string when combined.\n\nSo, the string's start is t7, which suggests that either NT55 or NT0 must produce a t7. From the rules, NT55 can produce t7 (via NT25). So let's consider:\n\nS -> NT55 NT0\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nWhere NT25 -> t7, so that's t7, followed by whatever NT0 produces, which may include other non-terminals that produce the remaining string.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with t7 t2 t5 t10...\n\nSo, the first part after t7 is t2 t5 t10 t11 t3 t9 t10 t3 t11 t4 t10 t11 t6 t9 t1 t9 t4 t1 t6 t6 t6 t4 t2 t5 t4 t7 t2 t11 t5 t9 t4 t1 t1 t11 t5 t6 t3 t4 t10 t11 t7 t11 t0 t1 t10 t4.\n\nSo, if NT55 produces t7 and NT0 produces the rest, let's check if that's possible.\n\nSo, NT55's production: NT25 NT0. If NT25 is 't7', then the first t7 is covered. Then, the remaining part is t2 t5 t10 t11 t3 t9 t10 t3 t11 t4 t10 t11 t6 t9 t1 t9 t4 t1 t6 t6 t6 t4 t2 t5 t4 [etc.]\n\nNow, NT0's production must yield the rest. Let's see what NT0 can be. Looking at the rules for NT0:\n\nNT0 can be NT55 NT12, NT12, etc. Let's check NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT0 -> NT12\n- Others: like NT0 -> 't6', or maybe other rules?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the initial list, many of the NT rules are defined with more than two non-terminals, but wait, no\u2014they're all two non-terminals because it's in CNF. Or were some rules in terminal plus non-terminal? Wait, for example, a rule like 'A -> a B' is okay because it's a terminal followed by a non-terminal. But in CNF, all productions must be A-> B C, where B and C are non-terminals. But according to the user, some of the rules have terminals, like:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT41 -> 't6' \u2192 this is a terminal.\n\nBut others have both? For example:\n\n- NT25 -> t7.\n\nSo each rule can have zero, one, or two terminals, but in CNF, the rule must be two non-terminals. So perhaps the user messed up the format. Or perhaps the grammar does include rules that are mixed. Hmm, perhaps the initial understanding was wrong. If some rules have a terminal, they are not in CNF. So perhaps the user intended the grammar to be in Chomsky Normal Form, which only allows A->BC, so all rules must have two non-terminals. But in the provided rules, some have terminals, so it's not CNF. Maybe the user just gave a CFG in general, not necessarily CNF.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, but looking at the rules, some have terminals, which contradicts CNF.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT17 and NT59. Each of these NT symbols further breaks down into combinations of other NT symbols until some point where they directly produce terminal symbols (like t0, t1, etc.). The string to evaluate is a series of these t's and numbers.\n\nThe string is: t1 t3 t2 t1 t2 t11 t2 t3 t2 t4 t0 t4 t9 t1 t10 t11 t4 t9 t11 t10 t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t6 t5 t10 t7 t1 t6 t8 t9 t7 t9 t9 t4 t5 t4 t7 t1 t11 t6 t3 t2 t2 t7 t10.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S, breaking it down into the right symbols until we reach terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nSo, let's start with the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S -> NT17 NT59. So, the string should be a concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me first try to parse NT17.\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSo, the string starts with t1, which might correspond to a terminal from NT37 or NT54. Wait, looking at the NT37 productions, NT37 can produce 't9' or 't10' or maybe other terms? Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT37 -> NT49 NT18 and NT37 -> NT10 NT10. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all the production rules for the NT symbols to see where they point.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't11'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't0'\nNT37 -> 't9'\nNT36 -> 't0'\nNT44 -> 't2'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't3'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT43 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't9'\nNT37 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't9'\nNT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, that's a lot of rules. Let me extract all non-terminals and their possible productions.\n\nI notice some symbols have multiple productions, either to other NTs or to terminals. For easier parsing, it might be better to build a parse tree starting from S, using the productions to match the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me start by parsing the string step by step.\n\nGiven string: t1 t3 t2 t1 t2 t11 t2 t3 t2 t4 t0 t4 t9 t1 t10 t11 t4 t9 t11 t10 t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t6 t5 t10 t7 t1 t6 t8 t9 t7 t9 t9 t4 t5 t4 t7 t1 t11 t6 t3 t2 t2 t7 t10.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t1. So the first symbol is from NT17 and NT59. Let me see which productions for NT17 and NT59 start with.\n\nNT17: NT37 NT54\nNT59: NT18 NT36, NT57 NT24.\n\nSo looking at the start, the first two symbols after S would be the expansion of NT17 and NT59. So T0: S => NT17 NT59, which would produce two parts.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t1. Let's see where each part comes from:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54. So NT37 might produce t1 or something else. Wait, looking at NT37: NT49 NT18 and NT10 NT10 (wait, in the initial given grammar, was there a NT10? Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I missed that.)\n\nWait, the initial grammar provided doesn't have NT10. Let me double-check all the NT rules provided. Hmm, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT10 defined. So perhaps NT37's productions are:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nAnd maybe another production I missed. Wait, the original grammar only has NT37 -> NT49 NT18 as the production. But that can't be, because in the provided initial grammar, NT37 has only this production, but in the overall set, I think I might have an error.\n\nWait, let me list all NT37's productions:\n\nLooking back, in the initial grammar:\n\nNT37: NT49 NT18.\n\nWait, but that's the only production for NT37. Hmm, that's strange because Chomsky Normal Form requires every non-terminal to have productions that are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since NT37 only has two non-terminals, maybe it's intended that it can only expand further. But in the context of the grammar, we need to see if it can produce terminals.\n\nWait, but in our string, t1 comes after S. Let me think: S produces NT17 and NT59. Let's see what NT17 produces first. NT17 is NT37 NT54. So each NT37 and NT54 must expand into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to build a parse tree from the string upwards using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to reverse the string and try to build the parse tree from the root, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach is to see if the string can be fully generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Since the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, the length of the string must be 2^k for some k if it's directly generated from the start symbol. Let's count the number of symbols in the string.\n\nThe string has:\n\nt1 t3 t2 t1 t2 t11 t2 t3 t2 t4 t0 t4 t9 t1 t10 t11 t4 t9 t11 t10 t0 t1 t2 t6 t7 t6 t5 t10 t7 t1 t6 t8 t9 t7 t9 t9 t4 t5 t4 t7 t1 t11 t6 t3 t2 t2 t7 t10.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-719","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal. However, looking at the rules, all are non-terminals producing two non-terminals. So, every step replaces a non-terminal with two others, meaning the derivation will proceed until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe string to check is: `t7 t9 t4 t8 t9 t9 t1 t10 t11 t6 t9 t1 t9 t8 t6 t9 t1 t3 t10 t0 t4 t3 t3 t5 t7 t10 t11 t8 t4 t6 t7 t1 t5 t2 t9 t10 t1 t7 t3 t11 t9 t1 t6 t0 t3 t2 t10 t6`.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens. Let me count them: 1, 2, ..., up to 41. So, 41 tokens.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n where n is the number of steps. Let me see: the initial S is replaced by two symbols, so each expansion step doubles the number of symbols until we have only terminals.\n\nWait, but the initial step starts with S, which is a single non-terminal. So after first expansion, it becomes two non-terminals. Each subsequent expansion replaces each non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols is 2^k, where k is the number of expansions.\n\nBut the initial string is 41 symbols, which is not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So this is problematic because 41 isn't a power of 2, which makes me think the string can't be generated by the grammar. However, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, no, because the grammar might have multiple starting points or perhaps it's not a simple binary tree. Wait, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so every step increases the count by 1 (since one non-terminal is replaced by two, so the count goes from x to x-1 + 2 = x+1). Wait, no: starting with 1, then each step increases by 1. So total length after n steps would be 2^n. Wait no:\n\nWait, each production takes a single non-terminal and replaces it with two, so the count increases by 1 each time a non-terminal is expanded. So starting from 1 (S), then after one expansion, you have 2 symbols. After another step, if you expand one, you get 3, but if you expand both, you get 4. Hmm, so the total number of symbols is 1 + the number of expansions. Since each expansion can choose which symbols to expand, the total can vary.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Each non-terminal can only produce two symbols, so each production step either introduces more symbols or not. The length of the string is equal to the number of symbols, each being a terminal. So, the total number of symbols must be 2^k, where k is the number of times a non-terminal is expanded. Because each time you expand a non-terminal, it adds one symbol to the total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think about the parse tree: each non-terminal has exactly two children, so the total number of leaves in the parse tree is 2^n, where n is the depth of the tree. So, the number of terminals must be 2^n.\n\nIn our case, the string has 41 symbols, which is not a power of two. Let's check: 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 41 is between them, so it's not a power of two. That suggests that the string can't be generated by the grammar, which only produces strings of length 2^n. So, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nExplanation: The given string has 41 tokens, which is not a power of two. The grammar starts with S (1 symbol) and each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, leading to string lengths that are powers of two. Since 41 is not a power of two, the string cannot be generated by the grammar."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces: `t7 t7 t7 t3 t8 t3 t4 t0 t8 t1 t3 t3 t2 t4 t10 t9 t2 t3 t0 t7 t10 t6 t1 t4 t1 t4 t6 t2 t11 t5 t10 t9 t1 t2 t4 t10 t11 t2 t9 t0 t4 t4 t7 t5 t6 t8 t11 t9 t0`. Since it's a string in CNF, each production starts with 'S' and the grammar can be represented with productions that produce two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string into its components. The string consists of various 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals, and non-terminals like NT0 to NT59. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol 'S' using the given productions.\n\nThe productions are all in CNF, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nI think the approach here is to perform a top-down parsing using either the Earley or recursive descent method. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I'll try to apply the recursive descent method step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking for the start symbol 'S'. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, to produce the string, we need NT17 to derive a substring followed by NT59 deriving another substring.\n\nSo, let's split the input string into two parts: the part corresponding to NT17 and the part corresponding to NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t7, but that's part of a larger sequence. Instead, I think each production needs to be broken down into the correct sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be matched step by step through the productions.\n\nLet's map out the string again:\n\nt7, t7, t7, t3, t8, t3, t4, t0, t8, t1, t3, t3, t2, t4, t10, t9, t2, t3, t0, t7, t10, t6, t1, t4, t1, t4, t6, t2, t11, t5, t10, t9, t1, t2, t4, t10, t11, t2, t9, t0, t4, t4, t7, t5, t6, t8, t11, t9, t0.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted earlier. Actually, the string provided is:\n\nt7 t7 t5 t3 t8 t3 t4 t0 t8 t1 t3 t3 t2 t4 t10 t9 t2 t3 t0 t7 t10 t6 t1 t4 t1 t4 t6 t2 t11 t5 t10 t9 t1 t2 t4 t10 t11 t2 t9 t0 t4 t4 t7 t5 t6 t8 t11 t9 t0.\n\nWait, no, initial splitting might not be correct. Let me double-check the string provided. Upon checking, the original string seems to be: \n\n`t7 t7 t5 t3 t8 t3 t4 t0 t8 t1 t3 t3 t2 t4 t10 t9 t2 t3 t0 t7 t10 t6 t1 t4 t1 t4 t6 t2 t11 t5 t10 t9 t1 t2 t4 t10 t11 t2 t9 t0 t4 t4 t7 t5 t6 t8 t11 t9 t0`.\n\nSo, each 't' is followed by a number, making 66 symbols in total.\n\nWait, but each 't' is a terminal. So the entire string is a sequence of 33 terminal symbols, each 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 't's:\n\nLooking at the string: each token is 't' followed by a number, so each token is a single terminal. For example, 't7' is a single terminal symbol. The string has 33 tokens, each a terminal symbol like t7, t5, t3, etc.\n\nWait, no, the string is written as a series of tokens separated by spaces, each being 't' followed by a number, but those are all part of a single string, so the entire string is 33 terminal symbols.\n\nEach terminal symbol is of the form tX, where X ranges from 0 to 59, so each is a distinct terminal.\n\nGiven that, the problem is to check if the entire sequence of terminals can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nTo check this, I can attempt to build a parse tree using the productions.\n\nStarting with the initial non-terminal S, which is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Therefore, the string must be divided into two parts: one derived from NT17 and the other from NT59, concatenated together.\n\nSo, the entire string should be split into two parts, say, the first part corresponds to NT17 and the second to NT59.

The grammar looks a bit complex with all those non-terminals and production rules. The string provided is a sequence of tokens like t1, t3, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar can produce. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 and NT59. So, S is the top-down starting point.\n\nI should probably start by breaking down the string step by step using the production rules. The string is: t1 t3 t7 t1 t4 t7 t6 t2 t3 t8 t1 t9 t10 t2 t0 t4 t1 t4 t0 t2 t1 t4 t5 t9 t11 t8 t6 t1 t9 t8 t6 t10 t7 t2 t3 t2 t4 t2 t6 t1.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens. It looks like there are 40 tokens. That seems like a lot. The grammar has a lot of non-terminals, so it can probably generate longer strings.\n\nI think I should start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string. Since S produces NT17 and NT59, I can write S as NT17 NT59. So, the derivation starts with NT17 NT59. Each of these can further produce other non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for each of these. NT17 -> NT37 NT54. NT59 -> NT18 NT36. So, now the derivation becomes NT37 NT54 NT18 NT36.\n\nNext, I need to expand NT37, NT54, NT18, and NT36. Let's see:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT54 -> NT55 NT37\nWait, that's NT54 -> NT55 NT37. But wait, NT37 is already being expanded, and so is NT18 and NT36. I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to work backwards, checking each token in the string against the possible production rules.\n\nLooking at the first token, t1. Let me see where t1 appears as a terminal. Looking through the rules, NT2->t0, NT2->t6, NT2->t4. Also, NT56->t5, NT43->t10, NT5->t5, etc. Hmm, let me check where 't1' appears as a terminal. Wait, checking the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't1'. That's odd. So if the string starts with t1, but none of the non-terminals produce t1, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Because there's no production that results in 't1'.\n\nWait, is that possible? Let me double-check the grammar. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule for a non-terminal producing 't1'. So if the string starts with t1, then the grammar can't generate it because there's no way to produce t1.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be No, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the string is long, and maybe I'm missing something. Did I check all rules? Let me scan again. The rules for NT are all like A->BC or A->a, with a being a terminal. The terminals I see are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, etc., up to t11, and t12, t17, etc. But no t1 is on the right-hand side.\n\nYes, t1 is not a terminal in any production.

I need to determine if this string is generated by the grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form typically means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From the given grammar, I see that every non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals except for some that directly expand into terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. This is helpful because it means each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which contributes to the length of the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is quite long. Breaking it down into tokens: t5, t2, t4, t2, t3, t0, t11, t4, t4, t9, t3, t9, t0, t6, t4, t8, t7, t11, t10, t9, t9, t10, t1, t0, t2, t10, t10, t6, t2, t10, t2, t10, t5, t0, t7, t11, t3, t2, t1, t9, t8, t8, t2, t8, t10, t0, t0, t3, t9, t9.\n\nI notice that each non-terminal is eventually expanded into a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar follows CNF, each production step will increase the length of the string by 1, starting from 1 (for a single non-terminal). So if the string has, say, n tokens, the derivation path will have n-1 steps. But since I'm working forward, I think I need to see if the string can be built by the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a derivation starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can reach the string. Starting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nFirst, S expands into NT17 and NT59. Then each of these can further expand.\n\nLet's look at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 and NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, NT18 \u2192 NT43 NT55 (wait, no: NT18 \u2192 NT44 NT36, NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15, NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56, NT56 \u2192 NT5, etc.\n\nWait, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree starting from the string and working backwards, trying to find if each part of the string can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children, and the leaves are terminals. So the string length is 44 tokens, which means 43 internal nodes (from the start symbol S). \n\nBut 44 is an even number minus one? Wait, the initial S expands to two non-terminals, and each production adds one token. So the length of the string should be 2^k where k is the number of expansion steps. Hmm, but 44 is not a power of two, which might be an issue. Wait, no\u2014because each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, but those could be non-terminals further expanding. So the total length could be more flexible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as each non-terminal can contribute a certain number of tokens, and the total should match the string length.\n\nLet me think about the expected string length. Each production of non-terminals can lead to a variable number of tokens. But since all the productions go into terminals or other non-terminals, I can model this as a recursive process.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the number of tokens produced by each non-terminal. For example, if a non-terminal A \u2192 BC, then the number of tokens contributed by A is (number of tokens from B) + (number of tokens from C). If a non-terminal directly expands to terminals (like nt5 \u2192 t5), then it contributes 1 token.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and see how many tokens they would contribute:\n\nNT0: Look at its productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12 \u2192 (55 contributes x tokens) + (12 contributes y tokens)\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0 \u2192 25 +0\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44 \u219213 +44\nNT13 \u2192 NT3 NT2 \u21923 +2\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT9 \u21924 +9\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT5 \u21925 +5=10\nNT9 \u2192 NT0 NT3 \u21920 +3=3\nSo NT25 \u2192 (13+44)+(14+3) ?\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps each production step adds one token every time a non-terminal is expanded into two others. So each step adds one more token than the sum of the children. Hmm, not exactly. Wait, the initial length of S is 2 (S \u2192 NT17 NT59). Each of these NTs expands into two, so the next level has 4 tokens. But if any of these NTs are terminals, that adds more tokens.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, each production A \u2192 BC increases the length by 1, but only if B and C are non-terminals. Because if either B or C is a terminal, the expansion doesn't increase the number of non-terminals. So for example, if S \u2192 NT17 NT59, then each NT17 and NT59 can be either terminals or further expansions.\n\nSo the string length will be equal to the sum over the number of terminals each non-terminal contributes. So perhaps I can compute the string length by seeing how many terminals each NT contributes.\n\nLet's compute the length of the string for each NT:\n\nWe have 36 NTs in the grammar. Let's see:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 two options, but we can compute the length it contributes.\n2. Similarly, for each NT, we'll find the number of terminals they contribute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see the total length of the string and check if it's possible given the grammar's expansion rules.\n\nThe string has 44 tokens. Let me think: S starts with 2 non-terminals. Each expansion step can increase the number of non-terminals by one, up to a point where all remaining non-terminals are terminals.\n\nBut 44 tokens imply that the number of expansion steps must allow for the sum. Wait, the number of tokens is equal to 1 + the number of expansions. Since S starts with 2, but each production adds one more if they are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of expansions is the number of times non-terminals are replaced. Since each such replacement increases the length by one.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of the total number of terminals produced.\n\nEach non-terminal will expand into a certain number of terminals. The total length is the sum of all these terminals from the start.\n\nGiven the string length is 44, which is an even number, I need to see if the grammar can sum up to an even number or not. Wait, no, because each step could add one terminal or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just as straightforward as trying to parse the string backward, checking each terminal against the non-terminals that can produce it.\n\nSo starting from the string, let's try to match it from the end.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is t9. So the last non-terminal before the terminals must produce t9. Looking in the grammar, which non-terminals produce t9?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t9. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT \u2192 't9' directly. Hmm, that's odd. So if t9 is a terminal, and no NT produces it directly, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Because there's no production for t9. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't9'. So that suggests that the string can't end with t9, because none of the non-terminals expand into t9. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any production:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT0: produces to 't6' directly.\n- NT36: produces 't6' directly.\n- NT18: produces 't0' directly.\n- NT15: produces 't0' directly.\n- NT12: produces 't11' directly.\n- NT25: produces 't7' directly.\n- NT55: produces 't8' directly.\n- NT24: produces 't5' and 't10' directly.\n- NT37: produces 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Check the grammar again: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44, and NT13 \u2192 t3, NT44 \u2192 t2. So NT25 actually produces t3 t2, which is t3t2, not t7. So I might have made a mistake earlier. Need to correct this.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 't5' and 't3' and 't10'\u2014so if NT5 appears in a production, it can produce any of these terminals.\n\nI should build the parse tree starting from S. Let's see the structure of S:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59 (from the first production)\nSo the entire string must be built from the two sub-productions NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me first check if NT17 can produce the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 | NT37 NT54\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nYes, that's one production. So NT17 can directly produce t7 and t4 (but wait, NT37 produces t9, and NT54 produces t2 or t6, depending on the production).\n\nWait, let me correct that: Let me find NT17's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT17 has this production: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nYes, so NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Now, looking at NT37 and NT54:\n\nNT37 \u2192 t9 (from NT37 \u2192 t9)\nNT54 \u2192 NT13 NT56 and NT37 \u2192 t9, but perhaps there are more. Wait, NT54's productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT13 NT56 | NT17 | t7\n\nWait, let me check the correct productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar, looking for NT54:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\nNT54 \u2192 t5? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing NT54.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 t2 (Wait, no, NT54 doesn't produce directly; perhaps it's from another rule. Let me check the provided grammar line by line. Hmm, I might have misread. Wait, in the grammar provided, there's:\n\nLooking at the provided lines:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2'? Wait, I see \"NT54 -> 't1'\".

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I remember the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit that form since all the rules have either non-terminals on both sides or terminals.\n\nThe string to check is \"t7 t7 t5\".

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to determine if the string \"t4 t0 t4\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into sequences of other non-terminals and terminals. Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of NT (non-terminals) and terminal symbols like t0, t1, etc. My task is to see if \"t4 t0 t4\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSo, the string is \"t4 t0 t4\", which has three tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production must generate exactly two symbols, except for terminals which are single symbols. Wait, no, in CNF, terminals can only be on the right-hand side of grammar rules that produce a single terminal. So each production either has two non-terminals or exactly one terminal.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That means every expansion step in a derivation must combine two non-terminals into two symbols, either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal, but I think in practice, each step produces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut this particular string is three terminals, so to get to three terminals, the derivation would need to involve two steps: the top-level symbol S expanding into two parts, each of which then has to expand into their own sequences, possibly building up to the required terminals.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules again for clarity:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't11'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT37 -> 't9'\nNT36 -> 't0'\nNT44 -> 't2'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't3'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT43 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't9'\nNT37 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't9'\nNT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking at the string \"t4 t0 t4\" and see which non-terminals can produce this when expanded.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which must expand into NT17 and NT59. So the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then, each of these will produce some strings.\n\nLet's consider NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking up NT17: it can either expand into NT37 NT54 or more possibilities? Wait, from the grammar, NT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: I believe each rule is under NT17. Let me check again. The grammar has NT17 -> NT37 NT54, yes.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 has two options: NT59 -> NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24. So let's see if either of these can produce t0 t4.\n\nWait, the output is three t's, so S produces two symbols, each of which must produce two symbols, but maybe in their derivations. Wait, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then, each of NT17 and NT59 will need to generate a sequence that combines into \"t4 t0 t4\". So perhaps NT17 needs to generate \"t4 t0\" and NT59 needs to generate \"t4\"? Or perhaps other combinations.\n\nWait, but \"t4 t0 t4\" has three tokens. Since each step in the grammar produces a combination of two symbols (non-terminals or terminals), starting from S (step 1: two symbols from S), then each of those symbols potentially expand into two each (so four symbols in step 2), but then possibly step 3, combining into two. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the string has three terminals, so perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be generated through one step for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, another approach: Each non-terminal expands into two parts. So to have a string of three terminals, perhaps one non-terminal expands into a terminal and another into a string that requires further expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to decompose the string into parts that can be produced by the non-terminals in the CFG.\n\nWait, the string is \"t4 t0 t4\". So it's three terminals. Let's see if any combination of the non-terminals can produce this.\n\nFirst, thinking about S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So both NT17 and NT59 need to generate some combination that, when combined, form \"t4 t0 t4\".\n\nSo, let's see what each NT can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17: it can be derived from NT37 and NT54. So let's see NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 can go to NT49 NT18. NT49 is either 't3' or 't11' (from NT49 rules). So NT37 can expand to t3 t18 or t11 t18.\n\nSimilarly, NT54 can go to NT9? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT54: looking back, does it have a production? Oh, from the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't2' (if that's an option), or NT13 NT54 (which can't be). Wait, let me check: looking through the rules, there's:\n\n- NT54 -> 't2' (from the list, NT54's rules are: NT13 -> 't3', etc. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Wait, the grammar as presented includes:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nNT54 -> NT13 NT54 (wait, that can't be a production because it's left-recursive; perhaps a typo, but in the list provided, looking again:\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- Wait no, actually looking at the list, I think I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-44","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t10 t6 t0 t0` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Let me start by looking at the start symbol and the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string must be derived from NT17 and NT59. Let's break down NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nSo, after generating NT17, we need to split it into NT37 and NT54.\n\nNow, let's look at NT37:\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\nSo, NT37 splits into NT49 and NT18.\n\nNext, NT49 can produce 't3' or 't11'. Let's see both possibilities.\n\nIf NT49 \u2192 't3':\n- Then NT18:\n  - NT18 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo, this path would generate 't3 t0'.\n\nAlternatively, if NT49 \u2192 't11':\n- Then NT18 \u2192 't0', so the string would be 't11 t0'.\n\nNow, let's look at NT54:\n- NT54 \u2192 't2' or 't5' or 't9'\nWait, looking back at the grammar for NT54, I see:\n- NT54 \u2192 't2' or 't5' or 't9'\nSo, NT54 can generate any of these terminals.\n\nSo, the overall approach is that S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which then becomes NT37 NT54 (from NT17) and NT59.\n\nNow, NT59 can split into several options. Let me list them:\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT59 \u2192 NT55 NT0 (but wait, the given string is `t10 t6 t0 t0`. Hmm, maybe not relevant here)\n\nLet's take each possibility for NT59 and see if we can get the required terminals.\n\nLooking for t6 in the string. Let's trace the possible productions.\n\nFirst, considering NT37 becomes NT49 NT18, which can produce 't3 t0' or 't11 t0'. Then, NT54 can produce 't2', 't5', or 't9'.\n\nCombining these, the overall would be 't3 t0 t2' or 't11 t0 t5' or 't11 t0 t9', etc. But the string we have is 't10 t6 t0 t0', which doesn't match any of these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let's consider NT59. Another possibility is NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Let's see NT57's productions:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n- NT57 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n\nSo, NT57 can split into either 't8' 't5' or 't12' 't11'.\n\nWait, let me correct that. NT8 is 't8', but in the given string, I have 't10', not 't8'. So that won't help. Similarly, 't12' and 't11' are in the string, but I need 't10'.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, maybe I need to find a different path for NT59. Let's consider NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16.\n\nNT12 can produce 't5' or 't11'. Similarly, NT16 can produce 't5' or 't4'.\n\nSo, combining NT12 and NT16, possible combinations are 't5 t5', 't5 t4', 't11 t5', 't11 t4'.\n\nThen, combining with NT37's 't3 t0' or 't11 t0', and NT54's 't2', 't5', 't9', etc., this path doesn't seem to lead to 't10 t6 t0 t0'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another path. Let's consider NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36.\n\nNT18 produces 't0'.\n\nNT36 can produce 't6', 't2', 't0', etc.\n\nSo, NT18 is 't0', and NT36 can be 't6', 't2', or 't0'.\n\nSo, if NT59 produces 't0' and another terminal, let's see:\n\nSuppose we have S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18 \u2192 't3' or 't11' then 't0'.\n\nNT54 can be 't5' \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, combining NT37 and NT54: 't3 t0 t2' or 't11 t0 t2', but our string is 't10 t6 t0 t0'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT54 can produce 't6'. Let's check the productions of NT54.\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT54 is:\n- NT54 \u2192 't2', 't5', or 't9'?\n\nWait, checking the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nI see:\n- NT5 \u2192 't9'\n\n- But looking specifically for NT54:\n\nFrom the given list, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT54 \u2192 't6'. So maybe 't6' comes from another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that 't6' is generated somewhere else, like from NT6 or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43.\n\nSimilarly, NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32.\n\nHmm, perhaps 't6' can come from NT12, but NT12 can produce 't5' or 't11'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT2, the productions are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't0', 't6', 't4'\n\nWait, yes! NT2 has productions to 't0', 't6', 't4'.\n\nSo, perhaps in one of the steps, one of the non-terminals can produce 't6' by expanding to NT2 and then NT2 producing 't6'.\n\nThat might bridge the gap.\n\nLet me try to build the string `t10 t6 t0 t0` step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT49 can be 't3', 't11', or another option?\n\nWait, according to the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', or other?\n\nFrom the given grammar, for NT49:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', 't7', or 't9' perhaps? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', 't7', 't9'\n\nYes, NT49 can be 't3', 't11', 't7', or 't9'.\n\nWait, let me double-check the given grammar:\n\nThe production rules provided include:\n\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT49 -> 't9'\n\nSo NT49 has four terminal options: 't3', 't7', 't9', 't11'.\n\nNow, proceeding with NT49 as 't7', for example.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 \u2192 NT37 NT54 \u2192 NT49 NT18 NT54.\n\nIf NT49 is 't7', then:\n\nNT49 is 't7', and NT18 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo, part of the string would be 't7 t0'.\n\nNow, NT54 has production options: 't2', 't5', 't9'.\n\nIf NT54 is 't6', that would fit. But in the grammar, looking again, NT54 doesn't have 't6' as a terminal. So where does 't6' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps through another path.

{"custom_id":"request-61","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t9 t2 t3 t10 t5\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the production rules to see how the non-terminals can be expanded into terminals.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT17 NT59. Both NT17 and NT59 are non-terminals that eventually turn into terminal symbols (t's and maybe others, but I don't see other options here).\n\nLooking at NT17, it can be broken down into NT37 NT54. Then NT37 can either be NT49 NT18 or NT54 NT6 (the last line for NT17 says NT54, but I think it's a typo because earlier NT54 is defined as NT0 t7... Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the NT54 rule: looking back, I see NT54 -> t2. That might be important. So when NT54 is reached, it just becomes 't2'. Let me map this out.\n\nAlso, NT17 can become NT37 NT54. If NT37 is either NT49 NT18 or NT54 NT6, but from the rules, NT54 is 't2' because of NT54 -> t2. Also, NT49 can become 't3' and 't11'. Wait, looking at the rules, NT49 has two productions: -> 't3' and -> 't11'. So NT49 can produce either 't3' or 't11'.\n\nSo let's see, starting from S: S must produce NT17 NT59. Both must derive into t's.\n\nNT17:\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT37 can be:\n- NT49 NT18\n- NT54 NT6 (Wait, earlier in the rules, I think I might have misread. Let me check the rules again carefully.)\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT49 -> 't3' and 't11'.\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n\nWait, the NT17's rule was given as NT17 -> NT37 NT54. Now, NT37 has two rules: NT37 -> NT49 NT18 or NT54 nt6. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the rules for NT17: it says NT17 -> NT37 NT54. Then, looking for NT37, I see:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT37 -> NT54 NT6\n\nBut wait, in the list provided earlier, I see:\n\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT37 -> NT54 NT6\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the production for NT37 is:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\n... and so on.\n\nSo, NT37 only has one rule: NT37 -> NT49 NT18.\n\nThen, NT54 -> t2 (from earlier, NT54 is 't2').\n\nSo, for NT37, it becomes NT49 NT18. Now, NT49 can be 't3' or 't11', and NT18 is 't0'.\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT49 -> 't3' and NT49 -> 't11'. So NT49 is a terminal either 't3' or 't11'.\n\nSo, putting this together, NT37 becomes NT49 NT18, which is (either 't3' or 't11') 't0'.\n\nWait, but NT18 can be 't0' as well, right? Because NT18 -> 't0'.\n\nWait, that seems like a way to produce 't3 t0' or 't11 t0'.\n\nSo, going back to NT17: NT17 -> NT37 NT54. NT37 is (t3 or t11) 't0', and NT54 is 't2'.\n\nThus, NT17 becomes (t3 or t11) t0 t2.\n\nTherefore, NT17 can produce two possibilities: t3 t0 t2 or t11 t0 t2.\n\nNow, let's look at NT59. In the grammar, NT59 has two rules:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, NT59 can choose between these two.\n\nFirst, NT59 as NT18 NT36:\n\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT36: looking at the rules, NT36 has multiple productions:\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT36 -> 't4'\n\nWait, so NT36 can produce 't6', 't2', or 't4'.\n\nSo, NT59 as NT18 NT36 would produce 't0' followed by 't6', 't2', or 't4'.\n\nAlternatively, NT59 can be NT57 NT24:\n\nNT57: looking at the grammar, NT57 -> NT8 NT41.\n\nNT8 -> 't10'.\n\nNT41: looking at the grammar, NT41 -> 't6'.\n\nSo, NT57 starts as NT8 NT41, which becomes 't10' 't6'.\n\nThen, NT24: looking at the grammar, NT24 has two rules:\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\n\nSo, NT24 can be 't0' or 't5'.\n\nSo, putting this together, NT57 -> NT8 NT41 becomes t10 t6, and then followed by NT24 which is t0 or t5.\n\nThus, NT59 via NT57 NT24 would produce t10 t6 followed by t0 or t5, giving t10 t6 t0 or t10 t6 t5.\n\nWait, but let's re-examine that because NT59 as NT57 NT24 leads to NT57 -> NT8 NT41 -> 't10' 't6', and then NT24 is either 't0' or 't5', so the full expansion would be 't10' 't6' 't0' or 't10' 't6' 't5'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The grammar for NT59 is:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36 OR NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, in the first case, as I said, 't0' followed by 't6', 't2', or 't4'.\n\nIn the second case, 't10' 't6' followed by 't0' or 't5', so 't10 t6 t0' or 't10 t6 t5'.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is 't9 t2 t3 t10 t5'.\n\nWait, that's five 't's in order: t9, t2, t3, t10, t5.\n\nSo, let's see how the production can generate this.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nWe have S splitting into NT17 and NT59.\n\nWe already found that NT17 can produce 't3 t0 t2' or 't11 t0 t2'.\n\nBut in the string, 't3' doesn't immediately come early enough.\n\nWait, let's consider both possibilities for NT17 and NT59.\n\nOption 1: NT17 -> 't3 t0 t2' and NT59 -> 't0 t2 t4' or 't0 t6' or 't10 t6 t0' or 't10 t6 t5'.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf NT17 is 't3 t0 t2' and NT59 is 't10 t6 t5', then the entire string would be 't3 t0 t2 t10 t6 t5' which is six 't's, but our target is five.

{"custom_id":"request-63","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is produced by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t9 t9 t5 t10 t5`. I'm a bit overwhelmed because the grammar is quite large, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I need to see if the given string can be generated by the start symbol S through these rules.\n\nThe given grammar has several NT (non-terminal) nodes, and I notice that the string consists of a series of terminals: t9, t5, t10, etc. My job is to see if these terminals can be formed by the non-terminals through the given productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string must be parsed as NT17 followed by NT59. The string is `t9 t9 t5 t10 t5`, which has five terminals. Wait, but S in the grammar is producing two symbols (since it's two non-terminals). So each production of those non-terminals must lead to the entire string. But wait, each of those non-terminals is itself a production. So perhaps each of NT17 and NT59 can be broken down further, each possibly producing multiple symbols.\n\nWait, but let me think. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with its production. So starting from S, we have S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then, each NT17 and NT59 are replaced by their own productions, and so on until only terminals are left.\n\nSo, the overall string is built by expanding NT17 and NT59. Each of these could produce multiple symbols, either directly (if they're terminals) or by expanding further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT17 \u2192 t4. Wait, no, in the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Similarly, NT49 appears several times with terminals. So maybe I need to see how each part of the string is formed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree. Let's think about the structure.\n\nThe string is `t9 t9 t5 t10 t5`. Let's assume it's the entire sentence, so the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT17 NT59, and each of these non-terminals needs to expand into the appropriate sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, let's consider NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17 in the grammar: The productions for NT17 are two possibilities:\n\n1. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n2. NT17 \u2192 t4 (Wait, no, looking back, actually in the grammar, for NT17 \u2192 t4? Or is it other way around? Wait, checking the given grammar:\n\nYes, I see NT37 \u2192 t9 t10. Wait, no. Let's check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, here's what I see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT24 NT54\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the rules for each non-terminal up to the terminals.\n\nLet's start with NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nAnd I also see NT17 \u2192 t7 (Wait, no, looking again, the rules are:\n\nLooking for NT17: in the given grammar, it seems to have two productions:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 ... any others? Let me check. Wait, in the given grammar, line by line:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to read all the rules and list each non-terminal and their possible productions.\n\nLet me list them all:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n2. NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n3. NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n4. NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n5. NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n6. NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n7. NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n8. NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n9. NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n10. NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n11. NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n12. NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n13. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n14. NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n15. NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n16. NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n17. NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n18. NT41 \u2192 't6'  \u2190 Wait, no, earlier in the given grammar, some rules end with terminals. For example, line 18: NT49 \u2192 't3'.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the grammar, which is listed as a series of (A \u2192 ...) lines. For example, the line says \"NT59 -> NT57 NT24\", etc., and towards the end, in line 19: NT12 \u2192 't11', line 20: NT5 \u2192 't9', line 21: NT2 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the grammar correctly. It's a long list, so I need to list all the productions accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to process each non-terminal and see how they can produce the required terminals.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So S expands into two non-terminals, which must produce the string when both are fully expanded.\n\nGiven the string is t9 t9 t5 t10 t5, which is 5 terminals. Each of S's productions (NT17 and NT59) must expand into some sequence of terminals. So each must produce 3 and 2 terminals, respectively, because 3 + 2 =5.\n\nWait, but that adds up, but wait, each non-terminal is a symbol that can expand into more non-terminals or terminals. So perhaps it's better to see what each part could generate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can work from the string backwards using the reverse of the grammar, or look for the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a leftmost derivation step by step.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So to generate the string t9 t9 t5 t10 t5, the expansion of NT17 should be t9 t9 and NT59 should be t5 t10 t5? Wait, but that's 5 symbols: 2 from NT17 and 3 from NT59, which totals 5.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm mixing the order. Let me think: the string is \"t9 t9 t5 t10 t5\". So S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which then each expand into their respective sequences.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the terminals can be broken down backward.\n\nStarting from the outer terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t9 t9 t5 t10 t5.\n\nI'll try to see if any non-terminal can produce \"t5 t10 t5\" because the second part of S is NT59. So, NT59 should expand into \"t5 t10 t5\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT59 \u2192 't5' is not, because I think from the grammar, NT59 only expands to other non-terminals. Let's check the given grammar again for NT59.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nand\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo NT59 can expand to these combinations.\n\nWait, then for the string to end with t5 t10 t5, that's three symbols. So if NT59 is supposed to produce three terminals, perhaps it's two expansions. For example, NT59 could first expand into something that also expands further. Alternatively, perhaps NT36 can expand further.\n\nLooking into NT36: from the grammar, NT36 \u2192 't6' (I think that's from line 14: NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32; but wait, I might have misspoken earlier. Let me check the full list.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions:\n\n1. NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n2. NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n3. NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n4. NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n5.

But I'm not sure if that's needed here.\n\nWait, the string starts with t4, which is directly produced by NT17. So perhaps the first rule used is NT17 \u2192 t4.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\nNT17 -> t4\nYes, that's one of the productions, so the first token t4 is produced by NT17.\n\nNow, the initial symbol of the grammar is S. Let's see the production for S:\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nSo S expands into NT17 NT59. So in the string, we have t4 followed by t3. Wait, the string is t4 t3 t5 t5 t5 t5. So after t4 (from NT17), we have t3. But where does t3 come from?\n\nWait, the next part after NT17 is NT59, so maybe the NT59 part produces the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, let's think about how the string is built. The string is t4 t3 followed by four t5s.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So S generates a parse where NT17 produces the first part (from t4) and NT59 the rest (t3, t5, t5, t5, t5). Wait, that can't be because each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the NT17 must produce t4, which is a single terminal, and then NT59 must generate the remaining tokens: t3 followed by four t5's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the parse step by step.\n\n1. Start with S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n   So S expands to NT17 NT59. The next step is to parse the string by breaking it down into NT17 and NT59 parts.\n\n2. NT17's production: one of the options is t4. So the first token is t4. That matches 't4' in the string. So from S, we have NT17 \u2192 t4, and the remaining is NT59 which must produce the rest: t3 t5 t5 t5 t5.\n\n3. Now, the remaining string after t4 is t3 t5 t5 t5 t5. So this has to come from NT59. Therefore, the next step is to check if NT59 can generate t3 followed by four t5's.\n\nLooking at NT59's productions from the grammar:\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nSo NT59 can produce either NT18 NT36 or NT12 NT16.\n\nThe string we're trying to generate after t4 is 't3 t5 t5 t5 t5'. Let's see which of these options would lead to that.\n\nCase 1: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nSo the two parts would be NT18 and NT36.\n\nWhat do NT18 and NT36 produce?\n\nLooking at production rules:\n\n- NT36 -> t6? Wait, from the grammar, let's check NT36's productions:\n\nFrom the user input, NT36: NT36 -> t6 and NT36 -> t3? Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar input:\n\nThe user-provided grammar includes these lines (simplified):\n\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT36 -> t2\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n... other lines...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some NT36 productions.\n\nLooking back, the user provided grammars include NT36 -> 't2' and NT36 -> 't6'.

{"custom_id":"request-84","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided with several production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t7 t11 t7 t8 t11 t6`. \n\nFirst, I should review what Chomsky normal form is. From what I remember, a CFG is in Chomsky normal form if all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, most rules seem to fit this, like S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which is a production of two non-terminals. However, I notice some rules have single terminals, like NT13 \u2192 t3. But the initial production S is fine.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The string is `t7 t11 t7 t8 t11 t6`, which is six elements long. \n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the first two symbols in the string must come from the expansions of NT17 and NT59 respectively. \n\nLooking at NT17, its production rule is NT17 \u2192 t4. So the first symbol t7 doesn't match t4. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check NT17's rules. Oh, looking back, I see NT17 has a rule \u2192 t4, t5, t7. So from NT17, I can derive t4, t5, or t7. The first symbol is t7, so that's possible. So S \u2192 NT17 (t7) NT59.\n\nNext, the second symbol comes from NT59. The production for NT59 includes t10, t18, and t6, among others. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT59 has two productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 t6, which I think was from the initial part. Wait, checking again, the grammar for NT59 is: NT59 \u2192 t6, as per the given rules. So the second symbol t11 doesn't match t6. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, let me look again. The given grammar for NT59 has two rules: one is NT59\u2192 t6, another is NT59\u2192 t12 t16, or another with NT59\u2192 t57 NT18. No, wait, looking back, the user wrote some lines. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the initial grammar:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nOther rules:\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconstruct the entire grammar from the given lines. Let me list all production rules:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 -> t6? Or wait, looking at the list, the grammar has entries like:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait, no, looking at the last lines:\n\nNT49 -> 't3' etc.\n\nWait, I think the initial part of the grammar is perhaps just a list of rules, and some have terminals like 't0', 't2', 't3', etc. So for NT59, the production is:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nAnd also, at the very end, there's NT59 -> NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nHere's the string: `t7 t11 t7 t8 t11 t6`.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t7, which must come from NT17. NT17's rules are: \u2192t4, t5, t7. So t7 is possible.\n\nThen, the second symbol is t11, which must come from NT59. But looking at NT59's rules, it's only producing combinations of non-terminals, or is there a rule that produces t11 directly? Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, in the user's list, there's a rule for NT49 that produces 't11' perhaps. Wait, no, looking back, the rules are:\n\nNT24 -> 't0', 't10', 't5'\n\nNT15 -> 't0'\n\n...\n\nWait, in the rules, NT59 doesn't have a rule with t11. All the NT59 rules produce non-terminals, like NT12, NT16, etc. So unless there's a rule for NT59 that produces t11, that would be a problem because t11 can't come from NT59. \n\nTherefore, if NT59 can't produce t11, the string is impossible. Wait, but let me check the grammar again. Wait, in the given rules, there's a rule called 'NT59 -> NT12 NT16' but is there a rule that has t11? Or perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, in the user's message, the rules are:\n\nLooking again at the second to last lines:\n\nNT24 -> 't0', 't10', 't5'\n\nNT18 -> 't0'\n\nNT24 -> 't0'\n\nNT17 -> 't7'\n\nNT0 -> 't6'\n\nNT5 -> 't5'\n\nNT25 -> 't7'\n\nNT5 -> 't3'\n\nNT5 -> 't10'\n\nNT36 -> 't6'\n\nNT55 -> 't8'\n\nNT44 -> 't0'\n\nNT25 -> 't2'\n\nNT57 -> 't7'\n\nNT0 -> 't0'\n\nNT37 -> 't9'\n\nNT36 -> 't0'\n\nNT44 -> 't2'\n\nNT36 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't3'\n\nNT54 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT17 -> 't7'\n\nNT0 -> 't1'\n\nNT32 -> 't6'\n\nNT49 -> 't7'\n\nNT43 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't9'\n\nNT37 -> 't10'\n\nNT54 -> 't6'\n\nNT5 -> 't9'\n\nNT56 -> 't5'\n\nI don't see a rule for NT59 that directly produces t11. All the rules I see for NT59 involve non-terminals. For example, NT59 can become NT12 NT16, but NT12 is NT5 NT43 and NT16 is NT55 NT32. Neither of these produce t11. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all rules for NT59:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nAnd that's it. So NT59 cannot produce a terminal directly. So in our string, the second symbol is t11, which can't come from NT59. Therefore, it's impossible for the string `t7 t11 t7 t8 t11 t6` to be generated by this grammar, because the second symbol is t11, which is a terminal, but NT59 can't derive t11.\n\nWait, but what about NT24? Because perhaps the second symbol is being derived from a different NT that then produces t11. Let me think. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So NT17 can produce t7, which is the first symbol. Then, the next symbol is t11, but it comes from NT59. But as per the grammar, NT59 can't produce t11 directly because all its rules involve non-terminals. So unless NT59 can produce t11 via some expansion, which it can't because all its rules lead to more non-terminals, then the string with t11 in the second position is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which symbols come from which NT. Let me re-examine the derivation.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 can produce t7, so the first symbol is t7.\n\nNow, the second symbol comes from NT59. Since all rules for NT59 go through non-terminals, the second symbol must be a terminal produced by NT59. But since there's no direct rule for NT59 that generates t11, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. So the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-100","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t9 t6 t11 t2 t0 t6 t6` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, it's S -> NT17 NT59. So, S directly produces two parts: NT17 and NT59. The string starts with t9, which isn't an NT symbol, so I should see which non-terminals can produce t9.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice NT49 has two productions: NT49 -> 't3' and NT49 -> 't11'. Hmm, but wait, in the string, we have t9 after t6 and t11. Let me check if any non-terminals produce t9.\n\nLooking through the rules: I don't see NT49 -> 't9', but another rule says NT37 -> NT49 NT18. And then NT18 -> 't0'. Wait, maybe I should follow NT49's productions. Wait, NT49's only direct productions are 't3' and 't11'. No 't9' there. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, I also see NT54 has rule NT54 -> 't9'. Oh, that's right. So, NT54 can produce t9. So, the first part of the string must come from NT54 somewhere.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nThe string is t9 t6 t11 t2 t0 t6 t6. So, the first element is t9, which must come from NT54 (since NT54 -> t9). So, I look at the grammar for NT54.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT54 is defined as NT54 -> 't9'. So, NT54 directly produces t9. So, the first token t9 must come from NT54.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT54, meaning that in the parse tree, the root is S -> NT17 NT59, and one of these must expand into NT54.\n\nWait, no: S -> NT17 NT59, which would mean that the root is S, which produces two non-terminals NT17 and NT59. The overall string has seven tokens. Let's see:\n\nThe first part of the string is t9. So, the first element comes from either NT17 or NT59. Since t9 is produced only by NT54, the first element t9 must come from NT54. But what's the rule for NT54? NT54 -> t9.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the rule for NT54 is not NT54 -> 't9'; instead, I see that NT54 -> 't2'. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't2' (this is in the last part: NT54 -> 't2').\n\nWait, that's strange because in the string, we have t9. So, either I've missed a rule or perhaps I need to look again.\n\nWait, no: looking through the entire list again, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't5', NT54 -> 't9' (Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed that.)\n\nWait, let me go through the list again more carefully:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT54's rules: NT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, so the only rule for NT54 is NT54 -> 't2'.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar rules for clarity. The grammar is provided with non-terminals S, NT0, NT41, etc., and terminals 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to check is `t10 t6 t11 t7 t6 t0 t6`.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (a terminal). So, the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is `t10 t6`. Let's see which production can lead to `t10` and `t6`.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT1 \u2192 't10' (multiple 't's are present, but let's check specific rules)\nWait, actually, I should check the rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice some NTs produce terminals:\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3' (Wait, that's redundant; maybe different productions)\nWait, some non-terminals directly produce terminal 't' with certain numbers.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce 't10' and 't6':\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT36 \u2192 't6'\n- NT36 \u2192 't0'\n- NT18 \u2192 't10'\nWait, let's check each NT that can directly produce 't10':\nLooking at the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't10'. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, 't11' is a terminal. Does any NT produce 't11'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't11'. So that's a problem because 't11' is a terminal in the string but I don't see any rule that allows it.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, I see:\n- NT12 \u2192 't11'\nSo maybe 't11' comes from NT12, but in the string, it's a terminal, so perhaps 't11' is part of an NT production. Wait, but in the string, it's a single 't11', which must come directly from an NT production. However, looking at the rules, the only NT that directly produces a 't' is NT18 \u2192 't10' and others like NT5 \u2192 't5', NT12 \u2192 't11', NT2 \u2192 't0' (three times), NT15 \u2192 't0', NT17 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, but NT12 \u2192 't11' is correct. So 't11' can be generated by NT12. So the second token in the string is 't11' which would come from NT12, but then how do we proceed? Let me map the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t10 t6 t11 t7 t6 t0 t6\n\nLet me split it into individual symbols: ['t10', 't6', 't11', 't7', 't6', 't0', 't6']\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo S produces two parts: NT17 and NT59. Let's see what each of these produce.\n\nFirst, NT17. Looking at the rules:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nSo NT17 expands to NT37 and NT54.\n\nThen NT59. Looking at the rules, NT59 appears multiple times, but looking closer:\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nSo NT59 can produce different combinations of NTs leading to terminals.\n\nI think I need to track each possible path, but this could get complicated. Let's try to match the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\n1. t10\n2. t6\n3. t11 (from NT12)\n4. t7\n5. t6\n6. t0\n7. t6\n\nSo S expands into NT17 NT59. Let's represent S as A and B.\n\nSo after S, we have:\n\nA: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nB: either of NT59's options.\n\nLet me handle A first. NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT36 (looking at the rules) or NT49 \u2192 't3'. Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT49 has two productions:\n- NT49 \u2192 't3'\n- NT49 \u2192 't11'\n\nWait, that's an error; actually, no. Let me check the exact rules.\n\nWait, from the rules:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\nNT49 \u2192 't11'\n\nSo NT49 can produce 't3' or 't11'. But in the string, one of the terminals is 't7', which isn't directly produced by any of the terminals I see, so maybe that's a problem. Wait, 't7' is present, but looking at the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't7' as a terminal. So that could be an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check all the rules again for any NT that can produce 't7'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- I don't see any NT that directly produces 't7' as a terminal. So perhaps this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake because 't7' is obtained through expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some NTs that can produce 't7'. Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2' or NT54 \u2192 't9' (because from the rules: NT54 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no. Looking again:\n\nWait, checking NT54: from the rules, NT54 \u2192 't5'? Or is that different? Wait, let me recheck:\n\nWait, from the rules, I see:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't9' and NT54 \u2192 't2'? Or no, perhaps I'm mixing numbers.\n\nWait, wait. No, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't5' (twice?)\nWait, no, let's look carefully:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n...\nWait, I might have made a mistake in reading earlier.

Hmm, since I'm just starting to learn about this, I should probably go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form is. From what I remember, CNF means that all the production rules are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar given, it seems to fit that because all the rules transform a single non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-124","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. From what I remember, CNF requires that each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. So, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the productions are either terminals or two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 is a production of two non-terminals, and some other productions like NT59 \u2192 't9' are terminals. So that's good.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t9 t2 t9 t10 t7 t6 t4 t2`. I'm assuming this is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so each 't' followed by a number is a separate terminal symbol.\n\nTo check if this string is in the language, I think I should trace back from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step, making sure each terminal matches the corresponding symbol in the string.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first two symbols of the string should correspond to the symbols derived from NT17 and NT59. Wait, but in the string, the first token is 't9', which is a terminal. But according to the production, S produces NT17 followed by NT59. So the first symbol should be from NT17. Looking at the string, the first token is 't9', which is a terminal. So I need to see what NT17 can produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT17 \u2192 t4 and NT17 \u2192 t7. Wait, let me check that again. The productions for NT17 are: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, NT17 \u2192 t4, NT17 \u2192 t7. So NT17 can derive a terminal symbol 't4' or 't7'. But in the string, the first 't9' doesn't match either of these. Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the order. The string is t9 t2 t9 t10 t7 t6 t4 t2. So the first symbol is t9, but NT17 can only produce t4 or t7, not t9. That suggests that either my analysis is wrong, or there's a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, the productions for NT59: there are two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and also NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. And there's another one: NT59 \u2192 't9'. Oh, right! So NT59 can produce 't9' as well. So maybe the first NT59 in S's production is producing 't9'.\n\nWait, hold on. The S production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first symbol is from NT17, which might produce t4 or t7, but the string starts with t9. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe the NT59 is the one producing t9, so perhaps the NT17 is producing something else? But no, the first symbol is always from NT17, right?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. Let me think. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 means that to get S, you have to derive NT17 and then NT59. So the first symbol in the string comes from NT17, not NT59. So if the string starts with t9, then NT17 must produce t9. But looking at the productions for NT17, the terminals it can produce are t4 and t7, not t9. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but is there a way for NT17 to produce t9? Because in the given productions, NT17 only goes to t4, t7, or combinations with other NTs. So it seems that t9 isn't a direct production of NT17. So that suggests that the string can't be derived from S, which would start with NT17.\n\nBut the string provided starts with t9, which suggests that the first step should derive t9, but that's not possible from NT17. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the productions.\n\n productions for NT17:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT17 \u2192 t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t7\n\nNo t9. So NT17 cannot produce t9. Therefore, the string t9 cannot be the first symbol.

The first symbol is t11. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT12 \u2192 t11, NT24 \u2192 t11, and NT18 \u2192 t11. So, t11 must be from one of these NTs. Let's see which ones can produce t11.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT12 \u2192 t11, so if NT12 is in the NT positions, it can produce t11. Alternatively, NT24 \u2192 t11 as well. So, now I need to see how NT12 and NT24 are derived.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string must expand from NT17 NT59. Let's look at NT17's production.

Each of these needs to be expanded into terminals.\n\nLet's take NT17 first.

Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nAlso, looking at NT17's other rules? No, only that. Hmm, maybe I got it wrong. Wait, maybe I have to check all the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. The grammar's rules are as given, so I have to parse them again.\n\nLooking at NT17:\n\nLooking through the lines, the only rules for NT17 are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nIs there another rule for NT17? Because in some cases, a non-terminal might have multiple productions, some producing terminals and others non-terminals. It seems that NT17 only has one production rule as NT37 NT54.\n\nBut wait, checking again, I think I might have misread. Let me go through all the rules again to see if any NT17 has another production.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36; also NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n- NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n- NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT41 \u2192 't6'\u2014Wait, no, looking at the rules, for example:\n\nWait, some entries are written as 't3', 't4', etc. Wait, perhaps I misread NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. Let me check: Yes, the rule is listed as NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. So for NT59, it can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, but in the given rules, NT59's rule is listed as NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and another as NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. So perhaps NT59 has two production rules.\n\nBut for NT17, from the given rules, the only production is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Wait, but earlier I thought there was another production, but maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the lines:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't4' \u2014 No, perhaps that's a NT4 \u2192 t4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let's clarify.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier. Perhaps NT17 has two production rules: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 and another NT17 \u2192 t4. Let me check the given rules.\n\nLooking again, I find that the rules for NT17 are indeed only NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 can only be expanded into two non-terminals. Hmm, that complicates things because the starting symbol S \u2192 NT17 NT59 would require that both NT17 and NT59 expand into at least one terminal each, otherwise, the string would consist of non-terminals and\/or undefined.\n\nBut our string starts with t11, which is a terminal, so in the initial expansion, either NT17 or NT59 must produce a terminal. So let's see.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT17 NT59, then to get t11, either NT17 must produce t11 or NT59 must. But from the rules, NT17 currently doesn't have a production that gives a terminal. It only produces NT37 NT54, which are non-terminals. Similarly, NT59's production rules are:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSo the initial expansion of S cannot produce t11 in the first place because both NT17 and NT59 can only produce non-terminals. That would mean the string starts with a non-terminal, which is impossible. But wait, our string starts with t11, so that would suggest that the grammar cannot generate the given string. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nWait, that seems too quick. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying the productions for NT17 and NT59. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT17 is defined as NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\n- NT59 has two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSo neither NT17 nor NT59 directly produce t11.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed some other NT that can produce t11.

NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT55 NT44\n\nBecause earlier I thought it was NT55 NT33, but looking again, it's NT55 NT44.\n\nSo first symbol of the string is t9. So for NT17, the first symbol is 't9'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT17:\n\n- If NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, then the first symbol must be the first symbol of NT37 or NT54.\n\n- NT37 produces symbols. Let's look at NT37 rules: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18 and NT37 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo NT37 can directly derive 't9'.\n\nWait, that's perfect because the string starts with t9. So for the first rule of NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, NT37 can derive 't9'.\n\nNow, the second non-terminal in NT17 is NT54. So from the rules for NT17, it can also be NT55 NT44. So perhaps I can choose this path and see.\n\nLet's explore that: NT17 \u2192 NT55 NT44.\n\nBut then the first symbol of the string is t9, which comes from NT37 in the first production path.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's take NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nThen NT37 \u2192 't9', which matches the first symbol. Then NT54 must produce the rest of the string starting from the second symbol, which is t2 t10 t9 t5 t5 t7 t6 t6.\n\nWait, that can't be right because t2 is too long. Maybe I should try taking the other production for NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT55 NT44. But then NT55's first symbol would have to be t9, but let's check what NT55 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT55's rules:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nSo NT55's first symbol would be from NT25 or NT0.\n\nLooking at NT25's rules:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nSo NT25's symbols are from NT13 and NT44.\n\nLooking at NT13: NT13 \u2192 't3' and NT13 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo NT25 can produce:\n\n- If NT13 \u2192 't3', then NT25 produces t3 followed by NT44, which can be 't0' or another rule.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let's try to see if either production path for NT17 can lead to the required string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try both paths and see which one leads to a successful derivation.\n\nLet me consider NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 first.\n\nSo NT37 is 't9', and then NT54 must produce the remaining symbols starting from the second symbol: t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-163","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t4 t3 t3 t0 t7 t2 t0 t0 t11 t6`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it consists of multiple non-terminals (like S, NT55, etc.) and terminals. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT55 and NT0 (S \u2192 NT55 NT59). My goal is to see if the given string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S step by step until I get the string.\n\nI think the best approach is to model this as a parse tree, starting from S and seeing if we can expand down to the given string. Since CNF grammars are efficient to parse with algorithms like CYK, but manually doing that might be a bit involved, but maybe with the string length here being 10 tokens, I can track it.\n\nLet me write down the production for S: S \u2192 NT55 NT59. So the string must be built from the two parts generated by NT55 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the string: `t4 t3 t3 t0 t7 t2 t0 t0 t11 t6`. So the first token is t4. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t4. Looking through the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 t6, NT44 \u2192 t0, NT54 \u2192 t6, etc. Wait, t3 is NT49 \u2192 t3 (wait, no, looking at the rules: NT49 is under NT? Wait, the rules say NT49 \u2192 't3'? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't11', so NT49 can produce t3 or t11.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t4. Does any non-terminal produce t4? Let's go through the rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t10, NT36 \u2192 t6, NT16 \u2192 t5, NT24 \u2192 various 't's, NT44 \u2192 t0, NT25 \u2192 t7, NT5 \u2192 t3, t5, or t10, etc. Wait, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t4 directly. So how is the first token t4 generated? That's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing the rule for NT something. Let me check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT55 NT59\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24 (Wait, this might be another production for NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Earlier, I thought NT59 only had one production, but looking again, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nWait, is that correct? So NT59 can produce either NT18 NT36 or NT57 NT24?\n\nNow, in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT55 NT59. So NT55 and NT59 are parts of the string.\n\nWait, looking at the first token t4; I don't see any production for t4, but perhaps one of the non-terminals in the expansion can produce it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list all the possible ways to produce t4 from the given rules. Let's look through all the rules to see if any non-terminal's production can result in t4.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17 (t5 and t4?)\nNo, because NT16 \u2192 t5 and NT17 \u2192 t4, so this would be t5 followed by t4. So NT41 can produce t5 t4.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0. Let's see: NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44, and NT44 \u2192 t0. Then NT13 \u2192 NT17 NT54. Let me trace this:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT17 NT54\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 t3 or t11\n\nNT54 \u2192 t2, t5, t6, t9.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if any non-terminal can produce t4 directly. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t4. So perhaps t4 must be part of a larger expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t4 is part of a longer production that involves other non-terminals. Let me check each non-terminal's expansion to see if any can produce a sequence that includes t4 as a constituent.\n\nLooking at the production NT44: Let's see, NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0. Let's expand this step by step.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT17 NT54\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNow, NT49 can be either t3 or t11, and NT18 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo putting this together, NT44's expansion would be something like:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT55 NT0 \u2192 NT25 NT44 \u2192 NT13 NT44 \u2192 ... Hmm, this seems like an infinite loop. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the entire string being generated step by step.\n\nThe string is `t4 t3 t3 t0 t7 t2 t0 t0 t11 t6`. The length is 10 tokens, so it's quite long. So S must expand into two parts, each of which is a sequence of 5 tokens each. Or maybe one part is longer and the other is shorter, but given the grammar, I think the split is into NT55 and NT59, each generating sequences. Let me see.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT55 NT59, so the entire string is a combination of two sequences: one from NT55 and one from NT59. So each of these can be thought of as separate trees.\n\nLet me first check what each part might expand into.\n\nStarting with NT55:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT17 NT54\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNow, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 can be t3 or t11, and NT18 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo this gives us t3 or t11, followed by t0, which would be t3 t0 or t11 t0.\n\nThen NT54 \u2192 t2, t5, t6, t9, or maybe more.\n\nWait, let's see, NT54 is part of the production:\n\nWait, looking back: NT54 is defined by which rules? Looking at the given rules, it seems that NT54 is on the left-hand side of a rule as part of another non-terminal's expansion. Specifically:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nAnd NT54 appears in the rule NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 (as per the given grammar). No, I must have misread.\n\nWait, no, looking through all the rules:\n\nWait, the rules include several non-terminals being replaced.

No, looking again, the user wrote:\n\nLooking back, I think the user may have listed all the NT rules and then some terminal productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules include both non-terminals and terminals, but in the standard Chomsky NF, only non-terminals are on the left. So perhaps some of the rules are terminals. Wait, no\u2014if a rule has a terminal on the left, that's not how Chomsky NF works. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and actually, all rules except for the terminals have non-terminals on the left. Therefore, the lines where a non-terminal is transformed into a terminal (e.g., NT24 -> 't10') are terminals, while others are non-terminals.\n\nSo, assuming that, I need to see how the string can be formed by the grammar.\n\nThe string is t9 t9 t11 t7 t2 t0 t0 t11 t6 t4.\n\nBut the problem is that this string has 10 tokens, which is an even number, but in Chomsky NF, the derivation starts with the start symbol S, which is S -> NT17 NT59. So S produces two non-terminals. Then each of those would break down into more non-terminals, until the leaves are terminals.\n\nSo, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals in the string representation decreases by one each time. Starting from S, we have 1 non-terminal, then 2, then 3, etc., until the final string is generated with 10 terminals.\n\nWait, in the given string, we have 10 tokens. So that would mean that the derivation started from S (1 non-terminal), and each step doubles the number, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, in Chomsky NF, each rule produces two non-terminals. So starting with S, each production adds one non-terminal each time. Wait, no, S is replaced by NT17 NT59, so S (1) becomes 2 non-terminals. Then each of those non-terminals can be replaced by more non-terminals, potentially increasing the count.

Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals like NT2 are defined, but in their rules, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, looking again, in the provided grammar, I don't see any rule for NT2.

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Okay, first, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That means each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal.\n\nThe given string is `t11 t0 t9 t10 t2 t0 t0 t0 t0 t4 t5`. Since the string has spaces, I think they might represent individual tokens, so the string is a sequence of these tokens: t11, t0, t9, t10, t2, t0, t0, t0, t0, t4, t5.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S -> NT17 NT59, so the first two non-terminals must come from NT17 and NT59. Wait, actually, no. When leftmost derivation is considered, the initial step is to derive from S, which would produce NT17 NT59. Then each non-terminal needs to be expanded until we get all terminals.\n\nBut since the string starts with t11, I should check what terminals are possible from NT17 or NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: NT17 -> NT37 NT54, NT17 -> t4, NT17 -> t7. So, possible terminals for NT17 are t4, t7, and t (but wait, the productions show t4 and t7, and in the string, the first token is t11). Wait, the string starts with t11, which isn't t4 or t7. So, does that mean there's a problem?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 -> NT37 NT54, NT17 -> t4, NT17 -> t7. So, NT17 can only produce t4, t7, or non-terminals. Oh, but t11 isn't in there. So, if the string starts with t11, but NT17 can't produce t11, then that's a problem. So that would mean the grammar can't produce a string starting with t11, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. NT17 can derive t4, t7, or two non-terminals. But none of them can produce t11 directly. Similarly, let's check NT59.\n\nNT59's productions: NT59 -> NT18 NT36, NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and NT59 -> 't3' (from the given list). Wait, in the given grammar, I see NT59 -> NT57 NT24, and also NT59 -> 't3' (look near the end, I think I saw 't3' listed for NT55 as well, but maybe I miswrote it). Wait, actually, checking the grammar again: yes, for NT59, one production is -> N T57 N T24? Or is it NT59 -> NT57 NT24? Or 't3'? Wait, I think I misread it earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The rule for S is `NT17 NT59`. So, the string must be a combination of the strings derived from NT17 and NT59. Let me note this down: S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the entire string should decompose into two parts, each starting with NT17 and NT59 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 11 tokens long. So, when we split it into two parts at the decomposition point, each part should be a derivation from NT17 and NT59. Since the grammar is context-free and CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, and the derivation builds up the string step by step. \n\nI think I should start by trying to parse the string from the left using NT17 and NT59. Let me first see what NT17 and NT59 derive into. \n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24\n\nSo, NT17 will generate NT37 and NT54.

Wait, but looking back, the rules for NT49 have 't3' and 't11' as terminals. So, NT49 can produce t3 or t11.

I need to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar provided has both non-terminals and terminals. My job is to see if the given string can be formed by expanding the non-terminals step by step until I get all terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that the start symbol S is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. That means the string must start with NT17 producing some terminal, followed by NT59 producing another. So the first two tokens should come from NT17 and NT59.\n\nBreaking down NT17: Looking at the rules, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So from NT17, I can get two non-terminals, NT37 and NT54.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, all the rules here are in CNF, which is good because that might make things easier.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the grammar consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT12, etc.) and terminals (t0 to t59). The string we're checking has several terminals: t11, t0, t9, t9, t9, t5, t5, t3, t0, t0, t6, t6.\n\nMy first thought is to work backwards. Since the string starts with t11, I should find which non-terminal can produce a t11. Looking through the rules, I see that NT59 has two rules: one that produces t18 and others, and another that produces t18 and t36. Wait, no, wait. Wait, there are two rules for NT59: one is NT59 ->NT18 NT36, and another is NT59-> something else? Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the first line is S-> NT17 NT59. Then, NT0 is split into NT55 and NT12, etc. Wait, the initial NT59 is in two places. Let's see: the rules for NT59 are:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nand?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nand\n\nWait no, looking again, the grammar has two lines for NT59:\n\nLine 6: NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n\nThen further down:\n\nLine 13: NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nWait, but earlier lines mention NT59's rules. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking here: line 1 is S-> NT17 NT59.\n\nThen line 2: NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nline3: NT41-> NT16 NT17\n\nline4: NT55-> NT25 NT0\n\nline5: NT12-> NT5 NT43\n\nline6: NT16-> NT55 NT32\n\nline7: NT57-> NT8 NT41\n\nline8: NT59-> NT18 NT36\n\nline9: NT59-> ...

Let me check the entire list.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nLine 2: NT0-> NT55 NT12\n\nLine 10: NT15-> NT16 NT56\n\nLine 11: NT17-> NT37 NT54\n\nLine 12: NT43-> NT5 NT15\n\nLine13: NT57-> NT8 NT41\n\nLine14: NT59-> NT18 NT36\n\nLine15: NT59-> NT12 NT16\n\nWait, so I see that NT59 has two production rules:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36,\n\nand\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16.\n\nWait, that's it. So NT59 can produce two different two-symbol sequences: one involving terminals 18 and 36, and another involving 12 and 16. Hmm.\n\nBut our string starts with t11, so where is t11 produced from? Looking through all the rules again, I think there's a rule for NT24: line 20 is NT24-> 't0', line 21: NT24-> 't10', line 22: NT24-> 't5'. Wait no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT24 has three rules:\n\nline 20: NT24-> 't0'\n\nline21: NT24-> 't10'\n\nline22: NT24-> 't5'\n\nWait, that can't be. Or perhaps I misread. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nline 12: NT24-> 't0'\n\nline13: NT49-> 't3'\n\nline14: NT59-> NT12 NT16\n\nline15: NT59-> NT57 NT24\n\nAh, yes! So NT59 can also go to NT57 and NT24. So that's another production for NT59: NT59 -> NT57 NT24.\n\nSo for NT59, there are multiple options:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo when trying to parse the string, starting from the beginning, the first symbol is t11. So how can t11 be generated? Looking at all the rules, I see that NT24 has a production to t10, t0, and t5. Wait, but how does t11 get produced? Because none of the non-terminals directly produce t11, unless a non-terminal chain leads to it.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. For example, NT55 has a rule for NT25 NT0, and NT25 is in other rules. Hmm, maybe t11 is produced by a non-terminal that's further down. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce t11.\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any rule directly producing t11. The only non-terminals that have terminal symbols are like NT8->t10, NT5->t5, etc. So perhaps t11 is part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Perhaps NT17 can produce a t7 and something else, and then NT7 produces t11. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT24 can produce t10, t0, t5. NT12 produces t5, etc. Wait, maybe I should see if there's a chain that leads to t11.\n\nWait, perhaps NT55-> NT25 NT0. And NT25-> NT13 NT44. Hmm, but how does t13 relate? Let me check if any rule leads to t13.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT13 can produce t2: line 26 says NT13-> t3, and line 33 says NT13->t2.\n\nWait, in the string, I do have a t2 later on. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nBack to the string: `t11 t0 t9 t9 t9 t5 t5 t3 t0 t0 t6 t6`.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence of symbols that the grammar must derive. Since we're starting from the left, the first symbol is t11. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t11 directly or through a series of productions.\n\nBut from the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t11. So maybe t11 is part of a larger expansion. Wait, perhaps NT17 can produce a t7 and something else. Let me check:\n\nIn the rules, NT17 can go to NT37 NT54 (line 11) or to t4 (line something). Wait, looking at line 11: NT17-> NT37 NT54, and earlier, line 17: I think NT17 also has another rule. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking again, line11: NT17-> NT37 NT54,\n\nline21: NT49-> 't5'\n\nline33: NT54-> t2,\n\nso perhaps NT17 can produce t4 or t7, but I'm not sure. Let me recap:\n\nThe first step is to have a leading t11. Since none of the rules produce t11 directly, I must look for a way that a production leads to a t11 via other non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because maybe a non-terminal I thought didn't have a t11 rule actually does. Or perhaps there's a chain where NT24 can produce t11.

The string is `t10 t6 t10 t10 t2 t2 t2 t8 t11 t11 t6 t5 t5`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the string should start with whatever NT17 and NT59 produce.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and find the productions for each. It seems like NT17, NT59, and others are recursive, so I need to track their possible expansions.\n\nStarting with NT17: according to the given rules, NT17 -> NT37 NT54 and NT17 -> NT49 NT24. And NT49 -> 't3', 't11', and 't10'; NT24 -> 't10', 't5', 't0', etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to find the possible terminals for each non-terminal but that might take a while. Instead, maybe I can approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. So we can treat each token as a separate element in the string and look for possible derivations.\n\nThe string is: t10, t6, t10, t10, t2, t2, t2, t8, t11, t11, t6, t5, t5.\n\nSo the first non-terminal in S is NT17 and NT59. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nNT17 can derive to t4 or t7, based on NT4 being the intermediate non-terminals? Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT17's production is either NT37 NT54 or NT49 NT24.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54 and NT17 -> NT49 NT24. So when we have NT17, it can expand into these two options.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 can produce a few things. Looking at NT59, I see NT59 -> NT12 NT16 and NT59 -> NT57 NT24. Also, wait, looking back, I realize that NT59 has two rules: NT59 -> NT57 NT24 and NT59 -> NT12 NT16. Wait, but in the provided grammar, NT59 appears multiple times, but some seem to be duplicates. Let me parse the complete list to make sure.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT59 is present in two rules, so perhaps that's an error or perhaps one of the rules is duplicated.\n\nBut focusing on NT59: the possible productions are (from the given grammar)\n\nLooking at the start of the provided grammar:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 ->...\n- NT41 ->...\n- NT55 ->...\n- NT12 ->...\n- NT16 ->...\n- NT57 ->...\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- ... etc.\n\nSo NT59 can produce NT18 NT36, or NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNow, I need to break down each non-terminal into terminal symbols or further non-terminals.\n\nLet's tackle NT17 and NT59.\n\nNT17 can expand into either NT37 NT54 or NT49 NT24.\n\nBut if I choose NT37 NT54, then NT37 is NT37 -> NT49 NT18, and NT49 can be 't3', etc. Similarly, NT24 can be further broken down.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose NT49 NT24, then NT49 can produce 't3', 't10', 't11', etc., while NT24 can produce 't10', 't5', etc.\n\nHmm, but this might get complicated. Let's instead try to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t10 t6 t10 t10 t2 t2 t2 t8 t11 t11 t6 t5 t5.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the possible derivations that lead to t10 first.\n\nLooking at NT17's possible expansions:\n\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nThen, NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n\nThen, NT49 can be 't3', 't10', 't11'.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 could lead to:\n\n- If NT37 -> NT49 NT18, and NT18 -> 't10' (since NT18 -> 't10' and 't0'?)\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT18 -> 't10' and maybe other possibilities? Wait, looking back: NT18 -> 't10'), is NT18 a non-terminal? No, looking at the provided grammar, the productions are:\n\nLooking for NT18: in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT18 -> 't10' or maybe other? Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the provided grammar:\n\n- NT18 -> 't10' (appears once)\n- Also, is there any other production for NT18?\n\nLooking through the list: I see NT18 -> 't10', so it's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 can be 't0', 't5', etc.\n\nAlternatively, if I try the other expansion for NT17: NT17 -> NT49 NT24. Then NT49 can be 't3', 't10', 't11', and NT24 can be 't0', 't5', etc.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I should think in terms of possible parse trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nAnother thought: since S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the first two symbols after S must be the symbols derived by NT17 and NT59. So, the first symbol of the string is t10.\n\nSo, let's see if the first part of the string can be covered by NT17's production.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT17 NT59, and the first symbol is t10. So, I need to see if NT17 can produce a sequence that starts with t10.\n\nLooking at NT17's possible expansions.\n\n1. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nThen, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. NT49 could be 't10' (since NT59 has NT59 -> NT57 NT24, which may not be directly relevant here. Wait, in the given rules, NT59 is in S's production, but here we are in NT37 and NT54.\n\nWait, looking at NT54: Is there a production for NT54? Let me check. Looking through the provided list:\n\nLooking for NT54: Yes, in the given rules, NT54 is defined as NT54 -> 't2' (or perhaps is it? Wait, looking through each line:\n\nYes, here's where:\n\nNT54 -> 't2' (because in the given grammar: NT54 -> 't2'? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe provided grammar has:\n\n- NT54 -> 't2'? Let me look through each line.\n\nLooking for 'NT54 -> ...':\n\nWait, looking through the provided list, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT18 -> 't10'\n- NT24 -> 't0', etc.\n- Also, looking for NT54, I see:\n\nIn the provided grammar list, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT37 -> 't9'\n\nWait, yes: NT37 -> 't9' and NT54 -> 't2', as well as other possibilities.\n\nWait, so if I have NT54, it can produce 't2' or possibly other routes, but in this case, it's also a production that may lead to terminals. Wait, no, I think in the given grammar, NT54 is a non-terminal that can only produce 't2'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nLooking back: The user provided the grammar with various rules. Let's scan each production for NT54 and others.\n\nLooking for any NT... with '\u2192' producing a terminal.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0 ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me correct that. It looks like some rules are repeated. For example, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 is the same as NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. I should note that each production leads to a specific string or a non-terminal. The terminals are 't0' to 't11', 't13', 't17', 't19'\u2014wait, the string given is `t7 t11 t3 t2 t2 t1 t5 t10 t8 t6 t5 t0 t4`. So the string has t7, t11, t3, t2, t2, t1, t5, t10, t8, t6, t5, t0, t4. So the string length is 13, and each part is separated by a space.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, until we reach the terminals. So the process is to see if the string can be built by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions.\n\nBut manually checking this could be time-consuming because the string is quite long. Alternatively, I can analyze the string step by step, from the terminals and see if they match any productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t7 is the first symbol, followed by t11, t3, etc. So maybe I can work backwards or look for patterns in the productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So S is two symbols; the given string starts with t7 followed by t11, so maybe NT17 \u2192 t7 and NT59 \u2192 t11. Or perhaps one of them is a non-terminal that can produce t7 and t11 in two steps. Let me check the productions for NT17 and NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 is made up of NT37 and NT54. NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. NT49 can be 't3' or 't11'. NT18 \u2192 't0'. So NT37 could become t11 or t3, and NT18 becomes t0. So NT17 would produce something like (t11, t0) or (t3, t0). So combined, NT17 would result in t11 t0 or t3 t0. But in our string, the first part is t7 t11. That doesn't match. So maybe NT17 isn't responsible for the start symbols. Alternatively, perhaps S is derived into NT17 and NT59, but I need to see how NT59 can produce a string starting with t11.\n\nLooking at NT59: it can produce NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24. Let's see NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43. NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15. NT5 is 't5' but that doesn't help here. Or NT12 \u2192 't11' directly. So NT12 can produce t11. Similarly, NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32. NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0. NT25 \u2192 't7' (from NT25 \u2192 't7'), and NT0 \u2192 't1' or others. Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, NT16 can be 't5'. So if NT12 is 't11' and NT16 is 't5', that would give t11 t5 as the output from NT59. But in our string, after t11, it's t3, not t5. So maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, NT59 can also produce NT57 NT24. Let's look at NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41. NT8 \u2192 't10' directly. NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17. NT16 \u2192 't5' (from NT16 \u2192 't5') and NT17 \u2192 't7' (as earlier). So NT41 \u2192 t5 t7. Therefore, NT57 \u2192 't10' NT41 \u2192 't10 t5 t7'. But we have t7 t11 t3... so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire possible derivation. Perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions. Let me think of the string as t7 t11 t3 t2 t2 t1 t5 t10 t8 t6 t5 t0 t4. Hmm, that's 13 tokens, so we might have 12 steps of splitting into two non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S (which is NT17 NT59) can produce t7 t11. Let me check if that's possible. So NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54; NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, which can become t11 and t0. NT54 \u2192 NT22 (wait, in the productions, I don't see NT54 \u2192 anything; let me check the productions again. Oh, NT54 \u2192 't9' and 't6' because in the rules, NT54 is produced by NT54 \u2192 't9' and NT54 \u2192 't6'. So NT54 can be either 't9' or 't6'.\n\nWait, looking back, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So the path could be:\n\nNT17 \u2192 (something) (something').\n\nBut NT37 can go to NT49 NT18, which then becomes (t3 or t11) and t0. So combining, the two NT17 would produce (t11, t0) or (t3, t0).

Let me find the productions for NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nWait, but in the provided string, after S, the first two tokens are t7 and t11. So N17 needs to derive t7 and N59 t11.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So that's two non-terminals, which need to produce t7 and another thing. NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Then, NT49 \u2192 t3 or t7? Looking at the rules, NT49 has two productions: NT49 \u2192 t3 or NT49 \u2192 t7. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 t0 or NT18 \u2192 t5. Wait, but in the string, after t7 comes t11. So this path might not lead to t11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I took the wrong approach. Maybe I should consider the entire string and see if I can backtrack the productions.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string into segments that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t7 t11 t3 t2 t7 t2 t2 t1 t11 t5 t9 t5 t5 t6.\n\nIf I think about S \u2192 NT17 NT59, then the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59. So maybe the string can be divided into two parts: part derived from NT17 and part from NT59.\n\nSo the initial split could be t7 followed by t11, because in S's production, it's NT17 and NT59, which in the string look like t7 and t11. Wait, but that might not be correct because NT17 and NT59 are sequences that will each generate a long string, not single tokens. So perhaps the first two non-terminals in S's expansion must correspond to the first tokens in the string.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think differently. Since S \u2192 NT17 NT59, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59. So if the string starts with NT17's expansion followed by NT59's expansion, that should match.\n\nSo let's try to parse the string as two parts: the first part from NT17 and the second part from NT59.\n\nLooking at the first token, t7, and the last token of NT17's expansion should be t7, and then NT59's expansion should start with t11. Wait, but I need to see how each non-terminal expands.\n\nStarting with NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT49 \u2192 either t3 or t7.\n\nNT18 \u2192 t0 or NT18 \u2192 but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t0 or NT18 \u2192 NT24 NT5. But NT18 is directly producing t0 or a combination of NT24 and NT5.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t7, the next token is t11. So if NT37 produces t7, then that would mean NT17's expansion ends with t7, and then NT59 must start with t11.\n\nBut NT59's production is NT12 NT16. So NT12 needs to produce t11, because the first token after S is t7 (from NT17) followed by t11 (from NT59). Wait, but NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, so the expansion would be the concatenation of NT12 and NT16.\n\nSo the first token from NT59 would be whatever NT12 produces, which is t11. So the first token of NT59's expansion is t11.\n\nBut looking at NT12's production: NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43. Let's see NT5 and NT43.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t5 or t9 (looking at the rules: NT5 \u2192 t5 or NT5 \u2192 t9, since NT5 has two productions: one to t5 and one to t9). So NT5 can derive t5 or t9.\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15. So NT15's production is either t0, so let me see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56, and NT56 \u2192 NT5.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try another approach, like working backwards from the string, applying reduction steps with the grammar rules.\n\nLet me consider that the entire string must be the result of expanding S. Each expansion step should involve replacing a non-terminal with its production, leading to the entire string.\n\nBut the string is 14 tokens long, so that would involve 13 reduction steps, which is quite a lot. Alternatively, I can try to find a leftmost or rightmost derivation tree that matches the string.\n\nMaybe it's better to take the string and see if each segment can be mapped to a production in the grammar.\n\nSo the string is: t7 t11 t3 t2 t7 t2 t2 t1 t11 t5 t9 t5 t5 t6\n\nI can split it into two parts based on S's production: the first part would be the result of NT17's expansion, and the second part would be NT59's expansion.\n\nSo the first part: t7 t11 t3 t2 t7 t2 t2 t1.\n\nWait, that's 8 tokens, but S's production is two non-terminals. So maybe the first part is \"t7 t11 t3 t2 t7 t2 t2 t1\" and the second part is \"t5 t9 t5 t5 t6\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should map S \u2192 NT17 NT59 as splitting the string into two parts. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, NT17's expansion: Maybe \"t7 t11 t3 t2 t7 t2 t2 t1\"\n\nAnd NT59's expansion: \"t5 t9 t5 t5 t6\"\n\nNow, let's check if these segments can be derived from NT17 and NT59.\n\nStarting with NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nLooking at the expansion of \"t7 t11 t3 t2 t7 t2 t2 t1\", perhaps this corresponds to NT37 followed by NT54.\n\nSo NT37 should expand to the first part, and NT54 to the second.\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nSo NT49's expansion would have to produce the first few tokens. NT49 can be t3 or t7.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens of the first part: t7 t11. So maybe NT49 must produce t7, and NT18 must produce something, but then the next token is t3, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if NT49 produces t7, then the next non-terminal should produce t11. Let me see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 t7. Then NT18's expansion would need to produce t11. But looking at NT18's rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t0 or NT24 NT5.\n\nIf NT18 produces t0, that can't be t11, so maybe it's NT24 NT5.\n\nWait, but NT18 \u2192 NT24 NT5, so if I have NT24"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-244","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: \"t7 t3 t9 t8 t6 t5 t7 t2 t2 t1 t11 t3 t10 t6\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This typically makes parsing a bit structured, and I think it might be possible to simulate the parsing process step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t7, t3, t9, etc. So, each token in the string needs to correspond to a production in the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 NT59. So, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. That means the string must be derivable from NT17 and NT59. So, the entire string is a concatenation of the strings generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nNow, I'll need to see if I can parse the string into the components generated by NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet's list out the productions for each NT:\n\nStarting with NT17: looking at the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, NT17 needs to produce a string that is the concatenation of what NT37 produces and what NT54 produces.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and also NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Wait, I see ND59 has two productions: one is NT12 NT16, the other is NT57 NT24. So, when expanding S, we might have two options for NT59, either as 12 and 16 or as 57 and 24.\n\nSo, S can expand to either NT17 NT59 as (37 54) plus (either 12 16 or 57 24), leading to four components: 37,54,12,16 or 37,54,57,24. Alternatively, wait, no: S\u2192NT17 NT59, and each NT17 and NT59 must each derive into a string.\n\nWait, no, each NT is a non-terminal, so when expanded, they produce sequences of terminals and non-terminals. So the full string must be a concatenation of what NT17 derivates and NT59 derivates.\n\nLooking at the given string, let's count the number of tokens: 15 tokens. Since each production is between two non-terminals except the terminals, the depth of the parse tree should give the number of symbols, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, it's maybe easier to see if we can match the tokens step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since it's Chomsky Normal Form, we can represent the parsing using a queue. Each step, we dequeue the first symbol and see if it can be matched by the start symbol S. If it can, we enqueue the right-hand sides of S's productions. Then, with the queue, continue dequeueing symbols and checking if any production has a matching symbol on the left.\n\nSo, let's try this method.\n\nWe start with the entire string in a queue: [t7, t3, t9, t8, t6, t5, t7, t2, t2, t1, t11, t3, t10, t6].\n\nWe enqueue the productions S\u2192NT17 NT59 and S\u2192 (any others, but it's only one production for S). So the queue becomes [S, t7, t3, t9, t8, t6, t5, t7, t2, t2, t1, t11, t3, t10, t6]. Wait, no, maybe it's better to represent it as [ S ], since initially, the first symbol is S, and we process it.\n\nWait, maybe not. I think I might be mixing the order. Let me correct myself.\n\nWait, the string is a series of terminals, so each token is a symbol in the string. We can model this using a recursive descent approach, but perhaps a simpler way is to use the method of checking derivations.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the entire string must be a derivation from S, passing through NT17 and NT59. So, the first step is to see if the entire string is a concatenation of two parts: one generated by NT17 and another by NT59. So, we can try different splits and see if both parts are derivable.\n\nGiven the string is 15 tokens long, the split between NT17 (n tokens) and NT59 (m tokens) must add up to 15, so n + m = 15.\n\nLooking for possible splits where both n and m can be generated by NT17 and NT59 respectively.\n\nLet's consider the NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So, NT17's expansion is two non-terminals: NT37 and NT54. Each of these non-terminals can produce sequences of terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 can expand into NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, let's consider each possible split of the string into two parts, and check if the first part is generated by NT17 and the second by NT59.\n\nBut given the string is 15 tokens, that's a lot of splits to check. Let's think if we can find some patterns or look for terminals early in the string that correspond to the start symbols of the sub-NTs.\n\nLooking at the string: t7 t3 t9 t8 t6 t5 t7 t2 t2 t1 t11 t3 t10 t6.\n\nThe first token is t7. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, we can see:\n\n- NT17 produces t37... Hmm, but I don't see a production where NT17 goes directly to t7. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the productions are all pairs of non-terminals, except the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT17: it goes to NT37 NT54. So, NT17's expansion doesn't include t7 directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT59's productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24. NT59 doesn't produce t7 directly.\n\nSo, t7 must come from some other expansion deeper in the parse tree.\n\nWait, so if t7 is in the first part (from NT17), then we need to see if there's a path through the grammar where NT17's expansion leads to t7.\n\nLooking at NT37: from the grammar, NT37 \u2192 NT36 NT44.\n\nThen, NT36 is in the productions: NT36 \u2192 NT2 NT36. So that seems like a recursive production where NT36 expands to t2 followed by itself. Similarly, NT36 can also expand to NT36... Wait, no, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT36: according to the provided rules, NT36 \u2192 t6, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, NT36 has a production: NT36 \u2192 t6. So, that's a way for NT36 to produce t6 directly. But in the grammar, I think I might have to look again.\n\nWait, let me list the productions for each NT:\n\nNT0 has multiple productions, including NT55 NT0, but that might not help here.\n\nLooking specifically for NT36:\n\nNT36 \u2192 t6. So, that's the only terminal production for NT36.\n\nSo, if NT37 expands to NT36 NT44, and NT36 produces t6, and NT44 produces t8. Because from the grammar, NT44 \u2192 t44, but wait, actually, looking back at the grammar, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the production for NT44 is: NT44 \u2192 t0. Wait, t0 might be a non-terminal, but let's check.\n\nWait, the user might have provided some typos, especially in the terminal symbols. For example, looking at the grammar, I see \"NT5 -> 't5'\", but in the string, we have t7, t3, etc. So perhaps the grammar's terminals are represented by 'tX' where X is a number, and each 'tX' is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, to check if a node can produce a t7, I need to look at the productions that have a 't7' as a terminal. Or, is 't7' represented by any NT's production?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT70: Not present, but in many CNF grammars, the terminals are the leaves.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. CNF is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, especially if using the CYK algorithm or similar methods, but maybe I can approach it manually here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, in any derivation starting from S, the first step is to produce NT17 and NT59. Each of these non-terminals will then be replaced by sequences of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals. So, the string starts with t10, which I need to see if it appears in any of the productions. Let me list out all the productions that end with a terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions, all NT production rules eventually reduce to terminals except some which might derive further. But I think since it's in CNF, every non-terminal directly produces terminals. So, the string is a concatenation of these terminals.\n\nNow, I need to see if the string can be derived starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT17 NT59, I'll need to see if the string can be split into two parts starting with the terminal sequences generated by NT17 and NT59 respectively.\n\nWait, no. S produces NT17 and NT59. Each of these will generate sequences of terminals. So the overall string would be the concatenation of what NT17 produces and NT59 produces. So the entire string's length should match the sum of what NT17 and NT59 produce in terms of terminal counts.\n\nLet's check the length of the string. It's 15 tokens: t10, t9, t5, t10, t5, t5, t3, t2, t2, t1, t5, t9, t5, t5, t6. So total 15 terminals.\n\nNow, the start symbol S's production (S \u2192 NT17 NT59) has both NT17 and NT59, each contributing some number of terminals. So 15 must be the sum of the number of terminals in NT17's derivation and NT59's derivation.\n\nI'll need to find out how many terminals each of NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLet me consider NT17. Its production is NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 starts with NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, and NT54 \u2192 NT17 NT54. Wait, wait, no\u2014that might not be right. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions for NT54 are:\nLooking back:\nNT54\u2192 NT17 NT56, but wait, in the initial grammar, I think I might have misread.

Let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't2' \u2192 so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I need to parse all the productions carefully.

Or is it one production with multiple options?)\n\nWait, looking at the initial list, each NT has multiple productions. For example, NT0 has two productions: one to NT55 NT12 and another to 't6'.\n\nWait, no.

Maybe I can create a map of each NT to its possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to attempt to parse the string step by step, seeing if it's a possible derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the CYK algorithm is the way to go, but I'm not confident in applying it manually without more structure.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each rule on the left side of the grammar is a non-terminal, and each production on the right side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string we're checking is a sequence of terminals: t7, t0, t2, t3, t9, t7, t2, t8, t11, t11, t0, t4, t5, t8, t6. Since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol in the string must expand from one of the productions, which is either two non-terminals or a terminal, and since it's a leftmost derivation, each step should expand one non-terminal into two others or a terminal.\n\nTo approach this, I think building a parse tree might help, but considering the string is quite long, that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into possible non-terminals.\n\nLet's denote the string as S1 to S15 for clarity:\n\nS1: t7\nS2: t0\nS3: t2\nS4: t3\nS5: t9\nS6: t7\nS7: t2\nS8: t8\nS9: t11\nS10: t11\nS11: t0\nS12: t4\nS13: t5\nS14: t8\nS15: t6\n\nWe start with the entire string, so we have to find the start symbol S that expands into this entire string. Let's look at the start symbol S in the grammar. The original S is defined as `S -> NT17 NT59`. So the start symbol S is a non-terminal NT17 and NT59.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the production is S -> NT17 NT59. So NT17 and NT59 are non-terminals that must be expanded to form the start symbol S. So the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nWait, but in our case, the string has 15 tokens. So perhaps we need to check if the entire string is generated by NT17 and NT59, which in turn are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is generated by S, which means S must expand into the string. But S is two non-terminals, so each of those must be expanded into the appropriate parts of the string.\n\nLet me write out the grammar rules again for clarity to refer to them more easily. Let me list all the productions:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't11'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't0'\nNT37 -> 't9'\nNT36 -> 't0'\nNT44 -> 't2'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't3'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT43 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't9'\nNT37 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't9'\nNT56 -> 't5'\n\nWait, the grammar seems a bit tricky because some non-terminals expand into two terminals or combinations of non-terminals. To parse the string, we might need to see if the string can be produced by the start symbols.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT17 and NT59. Let's see what each of those produces.\n\nNT17 can expand into either:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54 or NT12 NT16, etc. Wait, let me check the production for NT17.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar rules, NT17 is `NT17 -> NT37 NT54` or is it another production? Wait, in the list of rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT17 has two productions? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nYes, that's one of NT17's productions, but earlier in the list, I see:\n\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\n\nAnd other rules like NT25 -> NT13 NT44, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is that in the list, some non-terminals have multiple productions, others only have one. For example, S has one production, and NT17 has one production. Hmm, but the way it's presented is in a list, but the user hasn't clarified if each non-terminal has multiple rules or just one. However, I think each non-terminal in the CNF will have only one production on the left, but it may have multiple right-hand sides.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is a single rule, so a non-terminal can have only one production but each can have different RHS. So in this case, some non-terminals have only one production. For example, S is only \"S -> NT17 NT59\", and NT5 has a rule that ends with 't5'.\n\nWait, no, in the given problem, the grammar is presented as a list, which suggests each line is a separate production for the same non-terminal? Or each line is a new non-terminal? This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, actually, the way it's presented is as a list of productions, each on a separate line, so each line is of the form X -> ..., meaning each non-terminal X has a production rule with the right-hand side as the subsequent terms.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n\nThen NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n\nThen NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo each non-terminal is defined once, with a production that can consist of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for example, S is defined as S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 is defined as NT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 may have other productions if there were more, but here it's a single production. So each non-terminal is defined once, and can only produce a certain RHS.\n\nSo, okay, moving forward.\n\nSo S is defined as -> NT17 NT59.\n\nTherefore, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT17 and the expansion of NT59.\n\nSimilarly, both NT17 and NT59 must be able to expand into sequences that, when combined, form the given string.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the string into two parts: one that could be the expansion of NT17 and the other for NT59.\n\nBut how do we decide where to split the string? Because without knowing how those non-terminals expand, it's impossible to know. So perhaps we need a way to infer the split based on the possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find possible expansions for NT17 and NT59 such that their concatenation equals the given string.\n\nSo let's first try to find a possible expansion"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol S has only two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59, NT17 \u2192 t4, and so on. Each production either starts with two non-terminals or ends with a terminal.\n\nNow, I need to check the string `t11 t0 t9 t10 t3 t0 t2 t0 t1 t10 t3 t5 t5 t6 t4 t5` and see if it can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I think I'll need to work backwards using the grammar rules to see if I can parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking for possible end components in the string. Since the grammar has several productions that reduce to terminals, I can check each symbol and see if it's directly derived from a single non-terminal or if it requires a combination.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t11. Let's see which non-terminals produce t11. Scanning through the productions, I notice that NT24 \u2192 t10 and t5, and NT49 \u2192 t7, but also NT59 has two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 and also NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. Wait, and in the given string, the last symbol is t5, which comes from NT5 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how the string might split. Since the grammar uses NT symbols, each of which can split into terminals or further non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each part of the string must be generated by some combination of productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backward. The last symbol is t5, which is produced by NT5 \u2192 t5. So the last token t5 could have come from NT5. Then before that, the symbol t5 in the second to last position. That might be part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the longest possible derivations first. But maybe a better approach is to try to build a parse tree for the entire string.\n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of a top-down parser, starting from the start symbol S and expanding it into the string. But since the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be formed by a sequence of productions. Let me list the productions and terminals for reference:\n\n- NT59 has two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 and NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\n- NT24 has rule NT24 \u2192 t10\n- NT49 has two rules: NT49 \u2192 t7, but wait, looking back, in the productions, I see NT49 has two rules: NT49 \u2192 t7, and also another rule? Or maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions provided include:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT49 has two rules: NT49 \u2192 't3' and NT49 \u2192 't11'? Wait, no.

No, from the given, line 7 is NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, line 8 is NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36. So, only line7 for NT57. Maybe line 9 is NT59 -> NT18 NT36 and also NT59 -> NT12 NT16.\n\nWait, line1 is S\u2192NT17 NT59\n\nLooking further:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nWait, but also NT59 has another rule: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. So, production 5: NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0; production 1: S\u2192NT17 NT59; production8: NT59\u2192 NT18 NT36; and another production: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16.\n\nSo, NT59 can split into two different paths.\n\nNow, the string is t11 t0 t9 t10 t3 t0 t2 t0 t1 t10 t3 t5 t5 t6 t4 t5.\n\nThat's 17 tokens. Let's see how many symbols we have here.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT17 NT59, so the initial expansion would produce two symbols, then each of those can split further. Since this is a context-free grammar, each step of the parsing involves replacing a non-terminal with its symbols.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, it must be that each production contributes to the terminals in the string. So each terminal must come from a production where the non-terminal directly produces a terminal.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which are all the lowercase 't's with numbers. The grammar consists of non-terminals (NT) and terminals. The top-level non-terminal is S, which is rewritten as NT17 NT59. So my starting point is S => NT17 NT59, and I need to see if the string can be derived from this.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every rule is either a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. So each production in the string must be matched by some rule either directly or through substitutions.\n\nThe string is `t4 t5 t9 t3 t2 t8 t11 t6 t5 t2 t8 t3 t9 t0 t0 t6`. Let's consider this as a list of tokens and work from the start symbol S.\n\nS starts with NT17 and NT59. Looking at NT17, it's rewritten as NT37 NT54. So now, the string is split into NT17 and NT59, which become NT37 NT54 and NT59. Then, each of those can be expanded further.\n\nNT37 is rewritten as NT49 NT18. NT18 is a terminal, so it becomes 't18' in the string. So far, the string must be `t18 t54` after NT37 and NT18.\n\nNT54 is rewritten as NT54, wait, let me check. Looking at the grammar, NT54 is not a non-terminal; instead, NT54 is a terminal 't4'. So NT37 becomes 't4' because NT54 is 't4'.\n\nWait, let me check that again. In the grammar, NT54 is written as NT54 -> t5. Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see NT54 -> 't2', not 't5'. Let me check the detailed productions:\n\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT54 -> NT54 -> 't2'\n\nWait, no, looking back, NT54 is 't2'? Because in the grammar, NT54 is under NT54: it's not a rule, but a terminal 't2'. Similarly, NT18 is 't18'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT18 is rewritten as NT0 NT0.

Let me go back. So, starting with S, which is NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54, and NT59 is either NT57 NT24 or NT18 NT36.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t4 t5 t9. Let's see how this breaks down.\n\nAfter S, NT17 is replaced by NT37 and NT54. Since NT54 is a terminal 't5' because in the grammar, NT54 is a terminal 't2' as per the production NT54 -> 't2'. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at NT54 in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT41 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't10'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT16 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n- NT57 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't0'\n- NT37 -> 't9'\n- NT36 -> 't0'\n- NT44 -> 't2'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't3'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT32 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT43 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT37 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't9'\n- NT56 -> 't5'\n\nAh, I see now. NT54 is a production that can be either a terminal or broken down further. Wait, no, looking again, NT54 seems to be a terminal 't2' because in the grammar, the production for NT54 is not listed as a non-terminal rule but is written as 't2'. So NT54 in the grammar is a terminal 't2'.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me make sure: NT54 is rewritten as 't2' directly, so whenever we have NT54 in the string, it's replaced by 't2'. So in the string, when we see 't2', it must come from NT54.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 is rewritten as 't9' because in the grammar, NT37 -> 't9'.

{"custom_id":"request-304","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t9 t6 t9 t10 t2 t2 t2 t7 t0 t3 t10 t9 t10 t8 t6 t5 t6`. It has 17 tokens, so the derivation must result in exactly these 17 steps. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first step should generate NT17 and NT59. Let me check the string: it starts with t9, so perhaps NT17 produces t9? Looking at NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Do NT37 and NT54 each produce a terminal? Let's see.\n\nWait, NT37 is a non-terminal. Its productions: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Both are non-terminals. NT18 \u2192 NT41 't0'. NT41 has productions. Let's check: NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17 and also NT41 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Hmm, so NT41 can produce non-terminals or terminals. Maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT59 can produce t9. Wait, looking at NT59's productions: N59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, N59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and N59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Wait, let me see the individual NT59 rules: in the grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, and also in another line, it's again NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. That's probably a mistake because it's the same production. So I think NT59 can produce either NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nLooking back at the grammar: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and also NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, and those are the same, so maybe it's a typo, but it's listed twice. I can proceed with either.\n\nIf the string starts with t9, maybe it's from NT59 producing NT57 and NT24. Wait, let's see NT57's productions: NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41. NT8 \u2192 NT10, which is 't10'. So if NT57 produces t10, then the next part would be something else. Wait, but the first token is t9, not t10. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if t9 can come from any NT. Let's check all non-terminals that have 't' in their productions. NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18; NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', 't10' (from NT49 \u2192 't3', 't11', 't10'). Wait, looking at NT49: yes, NT49 \u2192 't3', 't10', 't11'. So if NT49 produces 't9', it's not there. Hmm, maybe NT55 produces 't8', which is in the grammar: NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, and NT55 also \u2192 't8' (I think looking back, line 9 says NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, but line 10 says NT55 \u2192 't8'. So yes, NT55 can produce 't8'. But in the string, there's a t8 towards the end towards the end. Let's see, but the first part is t9. So maybe t9 needs to come from another NT.\n\nWait, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Let me check NT17's production. If NT17 produces t9, maybe via NT37 and NT54. Then NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, and NT18 \u2192 NT41 't0'. If NT41 produces t7 (from line 17: NT41 \u2192 't7'), then that would get t7. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is correct. So S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Let me see if I can find a way to have NT59 produce t9. Looking back, is there a way for NT59 to produce t9? I don't see any production for NT59 directly giving t9. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nWait, another approach: look at the end of the string, which is t5. Which non-terminals produce t5? Looking through the productions: NT2 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't6'; NT5 \u2192 't5'; NT24 \u2192 't0', 't5'; NT54 \u2192 't2', 't5'. So maybe the last part must be produced by one of these.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the end. The last token is t6. Looking back, t6 can come from NT24 \u2192 't6', or NT5 \u2192 't5' but that doesn't hit t6. So perhaps NT24 produces t6. So before that would be t5. Let me check: NT24 produces t5, which would come from, say, NT54 \u2192 't5' or NT55 \u2192 't8' but that's t8, not t5. Wait, looking again: NT54 \u2192 't5'. So from NT54, can I get t5? Yes, line 18 says NT54 \u2192 't5'. So the last token t6 could be from NT24, then the previous is t5, which could be from NT54. So let me see: the last two tokens are t6 and t5. Wait, no, the string is ...t9 t6 t5... So the last token is t5, and before that is t6, but t5 is t5, so perhaps the production is NT54 \u2192 t5 and NT24 \u2192 t6, or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' or 't10' or 't11'. Hmm, but the first token in the string is t9, so that can't be. Maybe NT49 \u2192 't10', which is the second token. Then the next part would be t9.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a way to get t9 from NT49, but according to the grammar, NT49 can only produce t3, t10, or t11. So unless there's a way for NT49 to go further, but I don't think so. So perhaps this path is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking for NT59. Let me see: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nIf I take NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, then NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, so that's 't10' and then NT41 \u2192 what?\n\nNT41 has productions: NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17 or NT41 \u2192 NT37 NT54. Let's say NT41 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So then NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18, and NT18 \u2192 NT41 't0'.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe another approach: look for the start of the string and see if any of the non-terminals can produce t9.\n\nLooking through all non-terminals: NT7 can produce t7, NT9 can produce t9? Wait, let me see. The list includes NT37\u2192 't9'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT37's productions: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So no, NT37 doesn't produce t9 directly. Perhaps NT49 \u2192 NT37... but NT49 cannot produce t9 directly.\n\nWait, wait. Looking back at the productions, I see that NT41 has a production producing t7, and NT54 produces t5. Maybe the string starts with t9 coming from T41 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this step by step, building the string bottom-up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT17 NT59 is first, and then from NT17, we have to produce t9. Let's think again: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 produces two non-terminals, which then have to be expanded.\n\nSo for NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, both need to produce parts of the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nLooking back, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, the initial grammar has several rules.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar is provided as:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't11'\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't2'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT16 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't4'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT43 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't9'\nNT37 -> 't10'\nNT54 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't9'\nNT56 -> 't5'\n\nHmm, some parts are a bit confusing. For example, NT59 has two productions: one to NT12 NT16 and another to NT57 NT24. So when we look at the string starting with t4, which is produced by NT17, the next part starts with t9, which is produced by NT54 (NT54 -> 't9').\n\nWait, the string is t4 t9 t3 t3 t2 t2 t8 t11 t5 t3 t0 t6 t5 t2 t0 t6 t4.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. t4: comes from NT17 -> 't4'.\n2. Then t9: comes from NT54 -> 't9'.\n3. Next is t3: which is produced by some NT. Looking at the rules, NT5 creates 't5' and 't3' (NT5 -> 't5' and 't3'), but also, some other NTs produce 't3' as well. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT5 -> 't5' and 't3', and NT59 is 't9' via NT54.\n\nWait, but after t9, I need to see what comes next. So the next symbol is t3. So after NT17 (which is 't4'), the next part is t9 (from NT54), followed by t3, which would come from NT5, but NT5 is part of the productions. Let me see.\n\nWait, the string is: t4, t9, t3, t3, t2, t2, t8, t11, t5, t3, t0, t6, t5, t2, t0, t6, t4.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the first symbol must be 't4' (from NT17), which it is. Then the second part begins with NT59.\n\nSo the second part is generated by NT59. Looking at NT59's productions, it can go to NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nLooking at the next symbols: after 't4' comes 't9', which is 't9' (from NT54). But NT59 can't directly produce 't9'; that would require a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that NT59's production leads to NTs which further break down. So when I have NT59, it can split into NT57 and NT24, for example. Let me think: NT59 -> NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, then the string after 't4' is 't9', which would come from NT57 or NT24. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT57's productions: NT57 -> NT8 NT41.\n\nSo, if I have NT57, it becomes NT8 and NT41.\n\nNT8 -> 't10', and NT41 -> 't6' as per the rules.\n\nWait, but in the string after 't4', the next is 't9', which doesn't fit into 't10' or 't6'.\n\nAlternatively, another production for NT59 is NT12 NT16. Let's check that.\n\nIf NT59 -> NT12 NT16, then NT12 and NT16 are generated.\n\nLooking at NT12: its production is NT5 NT43.\n\nSo NT12 becomes NT5 and NT43.\n\nNT5's productions are 't5' or 't3'. NT43 can produce 't5' (from NT43 -> 't5' and NT43->'t5' ?? Wait, looking back, the rules for NT43: NT43 -> NT5 NT15.\n\nWait, let's check: NT43's production is NT5 NT15, which are further NTs.\n\nNT5 can be 't5' or 't3', and NT15 is 't0'.\n\nHmm, getting a bit complicated. I think I need to approach this systematically.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree:\n\nS -> NT17 NT59\n       |\n       NT17 is 't4', so the first symbol is matched.\n       Then, NT59 needs to produce the remaining symbols: t9, t3, t3,..., t4.\n\nSo, starting with NT59, what can it produce?\n\nOption 1: NT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT8 -> 't10'\nNT41 -> 't6'\nSo, NT57 would produce 't10' and 't6', making the symbols 't10 t6'.\n\nBut in our string, after 't4', the next symbol is 't9', which doesn't match.\n\nOption 2: NT59 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has specific structures that make parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that directly helps in this case.\n\nFirst, I think I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. So each step of the derivation should introduce one non-terminal, which eventually will be replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the start symbol is S, which produces NT17 NT59. So the string starts with `t10` for NT17 and `t4` for NT15, but wait, looking back, the initial productions might need to be checked again. Wait, no, the initial string is given as a sequence of t's, so the parsing should start from the top. Let me see.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first two symbols generated should be from NT17 and NT59. Let's look at the string. The first symbol is `t10`, which is the result of NT17, and the next symbol is `t9`, which should be the result of NT59.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 is replaced by NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So NT37 is replaced by NT49 and NT18.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'. Wait, looking back, grammar has NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36, but also NT49 \u2192 't3' and 't11'.\n\nWait, let me cross-check the grammar rules. Oh, the initial part shows NT59 has multiple rules, but in the given grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\n\nWait, but later on, NT59 also has NT12 NT16 and NT57 NT24. Wait, no, no, sorry, let me check the actual grammar provided:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nThen, NT59 is further defined as:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nBut in the string, after S is t10 (NT17) and t9 (NT59). Wait, but in the string, the second token is t9, which would come from NT59.\n\nLooking at NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36. So NT59 is replaced by NT18 and NT36.\n\nNT18 \u2192 't10' and NT36 \u2192 't6' or 't0' from the grammar rules.\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT59: It has a few production rules, the primary one is NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36.\n\nSo when parsing, the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. The first two tokens are t10 and t9. So for S, we have NT17 generating t10 and NT59 generating t9.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT37 must generate t9 and NT54 must generate whatever comes next.\n\nWait, no. Let me structure this.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first symbol is from NT17, the second from NT59.\n\nFirst symbol is t10: so NT17 \u2192 something that gives t10.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo for NT17, it's replaced by NT37 and NT54. So the next two symbols would be generated by NT37 and NT54.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t10, which is generated by NT17, and then the next is t9, which is generated by NT59. So actually, the first two symbols t10 and t9 would come directly from NT17 and NT59, but wait, NT17 only produces NT37 and NT54, not terminal symbols. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, if NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, then the production is non-terminal, so it's further expanded into NT37 and NT54. NT37 can be expanded further until it becomes a terminal.\n\nSo let's re-examine.\n\nThe string starts with t10 and t9.\n\nBut according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first two symbols are supposed to be the results of NT17 and NT59.\n\nBut looking at NT17's productions, all are non-terminals: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, NT54 \u2192 't9', and other possibilities. Wait, let's check NT54's productions.\n\nLooking at NT54: The original grammar has NT54 \u2192 't2' or 't5'. Wait, yes, looking at the grammar, in some cases, NT54 has terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let me go back to the grammar provided in the problem. The user listed a lot of rules, and I think I need to parse each step carefully.\n\nThe grammar has non-terminals NT0, NT41, NT55, NT12, NT16, NT25, NT32, NT37, NT57, NT59, NT8, NT36, etc. Each production has two non-terminals except some which have terminals.\n\nBut wait, according to the problem statement, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So all the given rules should have two symbols on the RHS, except possibly for terminals.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user listed some rules like NT59 -> 't18' or 't12', etc. Wait, that can't be right because in Chomsky normal form, all productions must be from variables to two variables or to a terminal. So it's possible that some symbols in the grammar are terminals (like t0, t1, etc.), but others are non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the RHS has two symbols, each of which can be a terminal or a non-terminal. But in the given grammar, some productions have two non-terminals as in S->NT17 NT59, but others have one terminal and one non-terminal, like NT59 -> NT8 NT41, etc.\n\nWait, but I think that's okay because in CNF, you have left-hand sides producing two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form requires left-hand sides to be a single non-terminal and the RHS to be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, that's correct. So for a terminal symbol, perhaps the production is like NTsomething -> tX, which is a single terminal as the RHS, but in that case, it's a single symbol, not two. So that would mean it's not in CNF because CNF requires two symbols on the RHS, both non-terminals or both terminals (I think? Wait, no: in CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A and B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, so actually, the given grammar seems to have productions with two symbols, but some of them have two non-terminals, others have a terminal and a non-terminal. That can't be in CNF because CNF requires that the RHS is two non-terminals or two terminals. So I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has both types, but the user miswrote the grammar, perhaps including both cases. So let's proceed.\n\nThe string is t10 t9 t10 t10 t2 t7 t1 t5 t10 t8 t6 t5 t6 t5 t7 t6 t6 t0.\n\nWe have 18 symbols in the string.\n\nLet's parse it step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. The first two symbols are t10 (NT17) and t9 (NT59).\n\nNow, we need to see if NT17 can produce t10 followed by NT59 producing t9.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'\n\nNT49 can produce 't3' or 't11' as terminals.\n\nLooking at NT54 productions:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't9' or 't2'\n\nSo NT54 can produce 't9' or 't2'.\n\nSo NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nIf"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-347","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and I'm given a specific string to evaluate. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when a production is a terminal string, like when a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal symbol. So, looking at the provided grammar, I see that there are a lot of non-terminals (NT) and some terminals (t) involved. \n\nThe string to evaluate is `t7 t0 t6 t5 t10 t7 t2 t8 t9 t9 t3 t0 t0 t6 t5 t9 t10 t6 t4`. That's 19 tokens, so the string length is 20, which suggests that the derivation will have a certain number of steps, but I can figure that out later.\n\nThe goal is to parse this string using the given grammar. I remember that in CNF, the parsing can be done using a method similar to the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is given explicitly, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the leftmost derivation or bottom-up parsing.\n\nAlternatively, I might build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be broken down into the symbols on the right-hand side of the production rules.\n\nLet me note the start symbol S. From the grammar, the S rule is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first two symbols in any derivation must come from NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t7, which isn't a non-terminal. So the first step should be to see if either NT17 or NT59 can produce t7. Wait, no, because S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first two symbols must be the results of NT17 and NT59.\n\nWait a second, in the given string, the first token is t7. So let's see if NT17 can produce t7. Looking through the production rules for NT17:\n\nLooking through the NT17 productions, I find that NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 can't directly produce t7, but it can produce two other NT symbols. Similarly, if I look for NT59, I see that it has rules like NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24, NT59 \u2192 NT59 NT24 (wait, that's a cycle to itself?), but perhaps more importantly, I see several rules where NT59 can lead to terminal strings.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar for NT59. From the grammar provided:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\nWait, is there another rule for NT59? Let me see the list again:\n\nWait, I also see NT59 \u2192 't6' and NT59 \u2192 't12' and NT59 \u2192 't16'? Or no? Let's check:\n\nLooking back, I see lines like:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT59 -> 't6'\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, let me list all NT59 rules:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- What else? Wait, another line:\n\n\"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\"\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- Line: \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\"\n\nSo that's a production where NT59 splits into NT12 and NT16. Then, looking further down:\n\n- Also, there's \"NT59 -> 't6'\"\n\nWait, but let me check: the initial lines after the grammar are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nThen we have:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nWait, no, I think I might have misread.

NT41 \u2192 't6' (Wait, no, line 3 is NT41, but line 15 is NT59.)\n\nSo, NT59 has two productions: \n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nAnd in line 15, for NT55 and others, but that's for NT55.

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So the grammar here seems to follow that because all productions are two non-terminals on the right or a terminal.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals: t7, t3, etc. The string is divided by spaces, so each token is a terminal. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S -> NT17 NT59. So the string should start with NT17 and NT59. The first part is t7, t3, etc., so let's see where t7 and t3 come from.\n\nWait, NT17 and NT59. Let me check the productions for NT17 and NT59. NT17 can be derived from NT37 or NT54 because looking at the grammar, S is NT17 and NT59. So NT17 and NT59 need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT59: I see NT59 can go to NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24. So the second part of S is NT59, which can be either of these. The initial string after NT17 might be starting with t3, which could come from NT59's production.\n\nWait, the string starts with t7, which might come from NT37 or NT54. Let me check NT37's production: NT37 -> NT49 NT18. NT49 can be 't3' or 't11'. So if NT49 is 't3', then NT37 would produce 't3' and NT18 as well.\n\nLooking at the string: first token is t7, which must come from NT37 because NT49 would give t3, but maybe not. Wait, NT37's production is NT49 NT18. So the string would be t3 followed by t18, but the first token is t7. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, hold on, NT17 can go to NT37 NT54. So starting with NT17, which can be NT37 or NT54. NT37 is followed by NT49 and NT18. But NT54 goes to NT17 NT0, which is t17 and t0.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try building the parse tree.\n\nLet's start with the entire string: [t7, t3, t5, t2, t1, t6, t5, t2, t0, t8, t9, t9, t3, t0, t0, t4, t4, t5, t6, t6]\n\nWe'll use dynamic programming to see if each substring can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the entire string, check if it can come from S or maybe a non-terminal with two productions.\n\nBut S is NT17 NT59, so the entire string must be the concatenation of two parts: one from NT17 and the other from NT59.\n\nSo, the first part (the first 2n-1 tokens) must come from NT17, and the second part (the next n tokens) from NT59.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so each step doubles the length minus one. But since this is a leftmost derivation, the process builds up the string step by step. But perhaps it's easier to model this with a parsing table or use a method like checking for possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to split the string into possible non-terminals.\n\nLet's consider that the string starts with t7, which might come from NT37, but let me check the NT37 production: NT37 -> NT49 NT18. So the first part would produce t3 and t18? But the first token is t7, not t3. So perhaps NT37 is not the start.\n\nWait, maybe the initial NT17 has another production. Let's check NT17's rules: NT17 -> NT37 NT54 or NT17 may come from another production? No, according to the grammar, NT17 is only in S and NT17's own productions are: NT17 -> NT37 NT54. So the initial part of the string is t7, which must come from one of NT37 or NT54.\n\nWait, no. NT37 is part of NT17's production. So if NT17 is the start, and it can be split into NT37 NT54, then each of those can be further expanded.\n\nSo, for the string to start with t7, perhaps the first NT37 produces t7, but looking at NT37's production: NT37 -> NT49 NT18. NT49 can be 't3' or 't11'. So NT37 can't produce t7 directly. Therefore, t7 can't be from NT37. So where else can t7 come from?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't7' except possibly NT37 and NT58 (but wait, I don't have NT58). Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT37: NT37 -> NT49 NT18, which gives t3 or t11 followed by NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT17 can be expanded into NT37 and NT54. Let's consider NT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nSo, the first part, which would be t7... could that come from NT37? Or maybe NT54.\n\nNT54's production is NT54 -> NT17 NT0. So that could generate more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts from another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should try building the string step by step.\n\nThe string is 20 tokens long.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT17 NT59. So, the string is built from two parts: the first part from NT17, the second from NT59.\n\nSo, we can split the string into two parts: first 10 tokens and next 10 tokens?\n\nWait, no. Because in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, so the string's length must be 2^n for some n. Wait, 20 is 2^4.58, which is not an integer. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, but maybe because of mixing in terminals and non-terminals, the string's length isn't strictly 2^n, but perhaps close.\n\nWait, but 20 is 2^4 + possible some, but maybe not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps the process builds it step by step regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a list of terminals and see if it can be parsed using the productions.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched to the corresponding production.\n\nWait, let me look at the start symbol: S is NT17 and NT59.\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me first handle the first part, which should come from NT17:\n\nSo, the first part is [t7, t3, t5, t2, t1, t6, t5, t2, t0]\n\nWait, why 9 tokens? Because each step in the production can add terms, but maybe it's better to check step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial production is S -> NT17 NT59, so each expansion from NT17 and NT59 contributes to the string.\n\nLet me think about how the string is built.\n\nThe entire string is built by expanding NT17 and NT59 into sequences of terminals. Each non-terminal must be able to derive the corresponding part of the string.\n\nSo, the first part of the string (from NT17) is: [t7, t3, t5, t2, t1, t6, t5, t2, t0]\n\nThe second part (from NT59) is: [t8, t9, t9, t3, t0, t0, t4, t4, t5, t6, t6]\n\nWait, that's 11 tokens each? Wait 9 + 11? No, the entire string is 20 tokens, which is 9 + 11, but that doesn't fit 2^n. Hmm, maybe I'm splitting wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial NT17 can generate a certain number of terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. That simplifies things a bit because it means each non-terminal expands to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT17 NT59.

{"custom_id":"request-385","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex with many non-terminals and productions. The string I need to check is \"t7 t0 t2 t5 t10 t7 t2 t0 t7 t1 t3 t10 t3 t0 t6 t4 t6 t5 t11 t0 t4\".\n\nFirst, I recall that grammar in CNF has rules where each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal. This means that every string produced by the grammar must have a length that's a power of 2. Let me look at the string length. The string has 21 tokens. Hmm, 21 isn't a power of 2. The powers of 2 around 21 are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). So 21 isn't a power of 2, which might already indicate that the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe that's not enough to conclude yet. Let me think again. Each production in a CNF grammar is such that replacing a non-terminal increases the length by a factor of 2 each time. So starting from a single non-terminal S, each step can produce two other non-terminals, each of which may then produce more. The total number of terminals in the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of levels in the derivation.\n\nSo if the string has 21 terminals, which isn't a power of 2, it's impossible for it to be generated by a CNF grammar. Because the length would have to be 2^n for some n. Since 21 isn't a power of 2, regardless of the exact derivation, the string can't be produced.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if the grammar is indeed in CNF. The given grammar only has productions where non-terminals are split into two non-terminals except for those that produce terminals. For example, S->NT17 NT59 is two non-terminals. So yes, it's in CNF, so each step is a derivation where the number of symbols doubles, eventually. So the string's length must be 2^n.

Okay, so the string is 't10 t2 t10 t2 t2 t0 t1 t10 t5 t2 t0 t7 t0 t11 t4 t0 t5 t6 t2 t7 t10'. That's a long string with several 't' terms. I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the strings in the language should be sequences of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nFirst, I think I need to parse the string and see if it's a sequence that can be generated step by step. Since we're dealing with expansions, probably a bottom-up or top-down approach would work. I'm not entirely sure which is easier here. Maybe the top-down approach starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is only in the first production: S -> NT17 NT59. So the string must start with NT17 followed by NT59. But wait, looking at the string, it starts with t10, which is a terminal. So perhaps the NT17 and NT59 produce these terminals in some way.\n\nWait, let me check the productions. NT17 -> t4, t5, t7, t5 (I see multiple options). Similarly, NT59 -> t18 or t57. Let's see the string starts with t10. But according to the productions, NT17 and NT59 may not produce t10. Hmm, let's see: NT59 has productions like -> NT12 NT16, -> NT57 NT24, -> NT12 NT16 (again), etc. Wait, I notice some confusion. Let me clarify the productions for each NT.\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT17 can become t4, t5, t7, etc., but also possibly other options.\nWait, actually, looking at the full list, each NT has several productions. For example, NT59 has a production -> 't6' and a production -> 't18'. But in the string, the first part is t10, so maybe t10 is produced by one of the NTs.\n\nWait, looking at each NT, do any of them produce t10? Let's go through each:\n\nCheck NT10: No, I don't see any NT10 in the productions. So, that's confusing because the string starts with t10. That suggests that there must be a non-terminal that can produce t10. Let's go through each NT:\n\nLooking for NT with a production to t10.\n\nLooking at NT2: Its productions are NT2 -> 't0', 't6', 't4'. No t10.\n\nNT5: NT5 -> 't5', 't3', 't10'. Oh, look, NT5 has a production to 't10'. So if any part of the string is 't10', maybe it's coming from NT5. But in our case, the first token is t10, so in the parse tree, that would have to be the start of a terminal symbol from a non-terminal that produces t10. So perhaps somewhere in the derivation, we have a NT5 that becomes t10.\n\nWait, but the initial S production is S -> NT17 NT59. So S would be the first symbol, which would split into NT17 and NT59. The string starts with t10, but NT17 and NT59 don't directly produce t10. Or do they?\n\nWait, maybe in the derivation, one of them becomes a sequence that includes 't10' as the first symbol. So for example, if NT17 can produce t10 through a chain of productions, that could explain it. Let me see what NT17's productions are.\n\nLooking at NT17: The productions are:\n\nNT17 -> t4\nNT17 -> t5\nNT17 -> t7\nNT17 -> t54\nWait, no, wait looking again, each NT has multiple lines. Let me list all the NTs:\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18\nNT15 -> NT16 NT56\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\nNT41 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't0'\nNT18 -> 't0'\nNT24 -> 't5'\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT12 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't6'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT44 -> 't0'\nNT25 -> 't2'\nNT57 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't0'\nNT37 -> 't9'\nNT36 -> 't0'\nNT44 -> 't2'\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't3'\nNT54 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT17 -> 't7'\nNT0 -> 't1'\nNT32 -> 't6'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT43 -> 't10'\n\nWait, now that I look closely, maybe I made a mistake earlier. I see that NT54 has a production -> 't2'. NT54 can be derived as NT17 (since NT17 has -> NT54). Also, NT43 has a production to 't10': NT43 -> 't10'. So that could be a way.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t10. So that could come from NT43 -> 't10'. So in the grammar, NT43 is one of the non-terminals, and it directly produces 't10'. So perhaps the first token in the string corresponds to NT43 -> 't10'.\n\nSo maybe the parse starts by having S -> NT17 NT59, and then one of these produces 't10'. But wait, in the string, the first token is 't10', so perhaps S directly produces t10, but no, S only produces NT17 NT59. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse tree is more complex. Maybe the 't10' comes from a subtree. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe string is t10 t2 t10 t2 t2 t0 t1 t10 t5 t2 t0 t7 t0 t11 t4 t0 t5 t6 t2 t7 t10.\n\nLet me try to break this down. Maybe the entire string can be divided into segments that correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to parse the string by looking for possible subunits.\n\nThe string is:\n\npos: 0: t10\n\n1: t2\n\n2: t10\n\n3: t2\n\n4: t2\n\n5: t0\n\n6: t1\n\n7: t10\n\n8: t5\n\n9: t2\n\n10: t0\n\n11: t7\n\n12: t0\n\n13: t11\n\n14: t4\n\n15: t0\n\n16: t5\n\n17: t6\n\n18: t2\n\n19: t7\n\n20: t10\n\nWell, the first token is t10. Looking for which NT can produce t10. The NTs are:\n\n- NT5 has a production to t10 (NT5 -> 't10')\n\n- NT43 has a production to 't10' (NT43 -> 't10')\n\n- NT0 has a production to 't1' and others, but none to t10.\n\nSo either NT5 or NT43 can produce t10.\n\nLooking at NT43's production: NT43 -> 't10', which would mean that in the string, 't10' can come directly from NT43. So that would be possible.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 can produce 't10'. Let's see what its other productions are: NT5 -> t5, etc., but I'm more interested in which non-terminals can go where.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't10', so that would correspond to a non-terminal that can produce 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Now, the string to evaluate is: `t4 t5 t9 t8 t4 t6 t5 t2 t2 t3 t2 t1 t3 t5 t0 t10 t10 t7 t1 t6 t5 t6`\n\nFirst, the string length is 21 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step (except the initial terminals) produces two non-terminals. So, for a string of length n, the parse tree has depth log2(n) approximately. But maybe I don't need to get into that right now.\n\nLet me jot down the string as a list: ['t4', 't5', 't9', 't8', 't4', 't6', 't5', 't2', 't2', 't3', 't2', 't1', 't3', 't5', 't0', 't10', 't10', 't7', 't1', 't6', 't5', 't6']\n\nWait, actually, I think the string might have 21 tokens, which would typically correspond to a parse tree where each non-atom node has exactly two children. Let me count the tokens:\n\nt4, t5, t9, t8, t4, t6, t5, t2, t2, t3, t2, t1, t3, t5, t0, t10, t10, t7, t1, t6, t5, t6\n\nThat's 21 tokens, so 20 non-terminal steps? No, wait. Each production step adds two non-terminals, so for a string of length n, the parse tree has a height log2(n). Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT17 NT59. Then each of these NTs will produce other NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the start is two NTs. Each NT will produce other NTs or terminals. Each step, the NTs are expanded until we reach the terminals matching the string.\n\nThis feels a bit involved. Let me see if there's a systematic way to approach this.\n\nAnother approach is to reconstruct the parse tree by working top-down, starting from S, and seeing if we can reach the target string by expanding the rules. But manually reconstructing a parse tree for 21 tokens might be tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to represent the possible string generated by the grammar, but given the complexity of the grammar, it's not practical without some pattern recognition.\n\nLet me start by identifying the possible terminals and non-terminals. Non-terminals are strings like NT0, NT1, NT2, etc., up to NT59, I think. Terminals are 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nSo the string is composed of these 't' tokens, none of which are non-terminals (I don't see any NT in the string). So the goal is to see if these terminals can be derived by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo we have two components to generate: NT17 and NT59.\n\nLet me see what each of these can produce.\n\nFirst, NT17: the production rules for NT17 are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT17 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo NT17 can produce either 't4' directly or a sequence of non-terminals leading to 't4' or another t.\n\nSo, since the string starts with 't4', that suggests that the first part of the string is generated by expanding NT17 as 't4'.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't4', so let me check what is NT17:\n\nLooking up NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nAnd then, looking at NT37:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n\nWait, NT18's production:\n\nLooking at the list, NT18 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n\nAnd then, NT0 and NT10 have their own productions.\n\nWait, the string doesn't have any NT tokens; all are terminals. So the derivation must lead directly to the given string. So, for the start symbol S, which is NT17 NT59, both must generate a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the first part is NT17 generating the first terminal or a sequence leading to the first token. Let me see what's possible.\n\nLet's start with NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNow, let's see what NT37 and NT54 can do.\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 can be 't3' or 't11'\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n\nNT0 can be 't6' as per NT0 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT10 \u2192 ... Wait, looking at the grammar, do we have NT10? I don't see an NT10 in the production list. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, the list provided doesn't seem to include NT10. Let me check the productions again. \n\nLooking through the given productions, NT10 doesn't appear as a non-terminal in any production. That's a problem because the string uses 't10' a few times, which suggests that something in the grammar must be able to derive 't10'. But none of the non-terminals seem to have 't10' as a terminal. Wait, but maybe through multiple steps.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, let's check where 't10' comes from.\n\nIn the given productions, NT36 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, yes: looking for production rules where 't10' is a terminal.

My goal is to check if the string `t10 t9 t3 t5 t3 t0 t8 t11 t6 t4 t5 t2 t0 t2 t1 t5 t9 t8 t6 t4 t5 t6` can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of several non-terminals (NTx) and terminals (tx). Each production rule in the grammar breaks down non-terminals into other non-terminals until terminals are reached, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals from t10 to t6, repeated a few times. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can attempt a recursive descent approach or a dynamic programming method. However, since the string is long and the grammar is large, it might be easier to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their possible productions. For example:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16 (Wait, I noticed earlier that NT59 appears twice, once as NT59 -> NT18 NT36 and another as NT59 -> NT12 NT16. So NT59 can be either of these. That means when I encounter NT59, I need to consider both possibilities.)\n- NT49 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT41 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT16 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\nWait, that last line seems suspicious. Looking back, it's written as NT5 -> 't5', NT5 -> 't3', NT5 -> 't10'. So the same non-terminal NT5 can produce t5, t3, or t10.\n\nI think the string has 21 tokens, so it's a sentence of length 21. Since the grammar likely allows for a leftmost derivation, I can try building the parse tree from the string.\n\nLet me start with the first token, t10. Looking through the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't10'?\n\nFrom the terminal lists:\n\n- T10 is from NT8, NT36, NT2, NT24, NT18, NT5, NT25, NT44, and others. Let's go step by step.\n\nCheck NT8: production is only 't10'.\nSo NT8 -> t10.\n\nSimilarly, NT36 -> 't2' in one production, but there's another for NT37? Wait, NT36 -> 't2' and also in another production? Or is it another way? Let me recheck:\n\nLooking back, the grammar entries:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nWait no, the string has t10, which is not t12.\n\nLooking for where 't10' is a terminal, it's listed in NT8 (only), NT36 (another production?), NT2 (so multiple non-terminals produce it.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, the terminal 't10' is:\n\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n\n- NT36 -> 't10'? Wait, from the given grammar:\n\nThe entry for NT36 in the provided grammar is:\nNT36 -> 't6'?\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT36 -> 't6'?\nWait, no, looking through:\n\nIn the first list:\n\nNT36 -> 't6'?

The string is `t7 t5 t3 t2 t2 t2 t0 t8 t5 t9 t2 t1 t6 t5 t10 t10 t10 t10 t0 t6 t5 t8 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have production rules that are non-terminals producing two non-terminals or terminals. The given grammar is already in CNF because each production either consists of two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nTo check if the string can be generated by the grammar, I need to trace through the string and see if each terminal appears step by step according to the production rules. Starting from the start symbol S, the string should be derived by expanding S to the entire string.\n\nLet me first look at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S -> NT17 NT59. So the entire string must be formed by first generating NT17 and then NT59, and their expansion should concatenate to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll split it into two parts based on S's production: the first part should come from NT17 and the second from NT59.\n\nThe first part is `t7 t5 t3 t2 t2 t2 t0 t8 t5 t9 t2 t1 t6 t5`. The second part is `t10 t10 t10 t10 t0 t6 t5 t8 t6`.\n\nStarting with NT17, the production for NT17 is NT37 NT54. So the first part of the string should come from NT37 and NT54.\n\nNT37's production is NT49 NT18, so after splitting, NT49 and NT18 will contribute to the first part. NT49 is either 't3' or 't11' (looking at the rules: NT49 has two productions \u2192 't3' and 't11'). NT18 produces 't0' but looking back, NT18's production is NT44 NT18 \u2192 looking again, NT18 in the rules is not present. Wait, in the grammar provided, I notice that NT18 has two rules: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 and NT54 produces 't9' or 't6'? Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT59 there are two productions: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24. Also, NT59 is derived from NT17 NT59 in S. Wait no, S is NT17 NT59, so the string must be the expansion of NT17 followed by NT59.\n\nSo for NT17, the production is NT37 NT54. Then NT37's production is NT49 NT18 (from the rules: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18). Then NT49 can be 't3' or 't11', and NT18 is NT17 NT59. Wait, that can't be because NT18's production isn't explicitly given. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT18: wait, in the grammar, NT18 is not present as a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-424","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided, and it's already in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see it's quite extensive with many non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t4 t10 t9 t7 t8 t10 t3 t7 t8 t9 t3 t5 t5 t6 t5 t0 t6 t5 t3 t2 t6 t6 t6`. That's a long string of t6, t7, t9, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 NT59 (S \u2192 NT17 NT59). So the first step is to see if the string starts with the concatenation of two symbols from NT17 and NT59. Both NT17 and NT59 should expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nLet's start by looking at NT17. From the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So NT17 will produce a t from NT37 and a t from NT54 (since NT54 in the grammar has production rules that sometimes produce terminals).\n\nWait, looking at NT17, it's defined as NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54. So whatever NT37 and NT54 expand to, their productions will form the string. Similarly, NT59 is defined as NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16. So for NT59, it will produce from NT12 and NT16.\n\nLet me outline a possible approach. Since the string starts with t4, I can try to see which non-terminals can produce t4. Looking through the terminal productions, NT44\u2192t0, NT45 (wait, not here), NT2\u2192t0, t4 is produced by NT24 and NT36. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t0\nNT24 \u2192 t10\nNT17 \u2192 t4 (looking for NT17\u2192t4?)\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, for example, NT37 \u2192 NT36 NT54, which can sometimes produce t0 or t something. Let me check where t4 comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 t0, NT24 \u2192 t10, NT25 \u2192 t7, NT43 \u2192 t10, and several others. Wait, NT17's production is NT37 NT54.\n\nWait, let me see where t4 is a terminal. Checking each production in the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals have direct terminal expansions. For example, NT24 can produce t0 or t10, NT36 can produce t2 or t6, NT13 can produce t3 or t2, and so on.\n\nWait, looking for t4 specifically in the terminals, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing t4. Let me double-check the grammar. Okay, in the list of productions, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t0 or t10\n- NT37 \u2192 t9 or t10\n- NT54 \u2192 t2 or t9\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT36 \u2192 t2, t6\n- NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, and looking at NT12 and NT16:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n\nWait, NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, which then might have terminal productions.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this as a parsing problem, trying to parse the string from left to right, applying the grammar rules step by step.\n\nThe string is: t4 t10 t9 t7 t8 t10 t3 t7 t8 t9 t3 t5 t5 t6 t5 t0 t6 t5 t3 t2 t6 t6 t6\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, we can try a recursive descent approach, starting with S, and expanding symbols as needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the string into tokens: [t4, t10, t9, t7, t8, t10, t3, t7, t8, t9, t3, t5, t5, t6, t5, t0, t6, t5, t3, t2, t6, t6, t6].\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the first step is to derive the first part, NT17, which should produce the first few symbols, and then NT59 should produce the rest.\n\nFrom NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nThen, the first part of the string starts with t4, which we need to see if NT37 and NT54 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT36 NT54. So NT37 will expand into whatever NT36 and NT54 produce.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t4. Let's see if any production of NT36 or NT54 can start with t4.\n\nLooking at NT36, its productions are: NT36 \u2192 t2, t6.\n\nLooking at NT54, its productions are: NT54 \u2192 t2, t9.\n\nNeither of these produce t4 directly. Wait, but perhaps through further expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe another approach is to use a CYK parser or some kind of dynamic programming approach, but perhaps manually step through the parsing.\n\nWait, maybe starting from S and expanding:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part from NT17 and the second part from NT59.\n\nThe string starts with t4, which is the first symbol. So the first part of NT17 must start with t4.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo NT37 NT54 must start with t4, and their expansions should account for the entire first part.\n\nLooking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT36 NT54.\n\nSo NT37 needs to expand into something that starts with t4.\n\nLooking at NT36's production: NT36 can be t2 or t6, and NT54 can be t2 or t9.\n\nWait, but if NT36 produces t2 or t6, and NT54 produces t2 or t9, then the first symbol of NT37 (which is the expansion of NT36) would be t2 or t6. But the first symbol in the string is t4, so this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each non-terminal's possible terminal productions.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look back at the productions:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT5 NT15, which can be further broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps I should walk through the productions more carefully.\n\nBut this could take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to see if any of the non-terminals lead to t4.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for which non-terminals can produce t4. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t0 or t10\n- NT37 \u2192 t9 or t10\n- NT54 \u2192 t2 or t9\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT36 \u2192 t2 or t6\n\nNone of these directly produce t4, so perhaps t4 is produced via a longer chain. Let me see if any non-terminals can produce t4 through their productions.\n\nLooking for where t4 can be derived. Let's see:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, let's see if any combination can lead to t4.\n\nHmm, maybe looking for non-terminals that eventually lead to t4.\n\nWait, maybe NT24 leads to t10, which is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should instead recognize that since t4 is not directly a production of any non-terminal except perhaps through some chain, but looking at the grammar, it seems that t4 is never directly produced. Wait, is that possible?\n\nWait, let's check the grammar again. Looking through the productions, all terminals are either a or NT24, which produces t0 or t10, and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking for where NT24 is involved. NT24 \u2192 t0 or t10, and NT17 \u2192 t37 t54, which might then produce t9, t10, etc. But how do we get t4?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's possible that none of the non-terminals produce t4 as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-444","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which are either t numbers or possibly some letters, but in this case, all are t followed by numbers.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT17 NT59. So every derivation starts with NT17 and NT59, and each of these will be expanded into non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nThe target string is \"t9 t9 t3 t9 t5 t5 t2 t3 t0 t3 t0 t1 t10 t9 t7 t1 t6 t5 t5 t9 t5 t5 t0 t0\". Let me note that there are 21 tokens here. \n\nI think the approach is to parse this string from left to right, using the grammar to derive it step by step. Parsing in CNF can often be done with a recursive descent parser, checking each rule to see if parts of the string can be matched.\n\nFirst, looking at S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the entire string must be the result of expanding NT17 and NT59. Let me start with NT17 and NT59.\n\nLooking at NT17: The production for NT17 is NT37 NT54. So we need to expand NT17 into NT37 NT54. Now, let's match the tokens starting from the beginning with NT17's expansion.\n\nThe first two tokens are t9 t9. Let's see if NT37 can produce t9 and NT54 can produce t9.\n\nChecking NT37: Its production is NT49 NT18. Hmm, wait, no, looking back, NT37\u2192NT49 NT18, so NT37 is NT49 followed by NT18. Then, NT49\u2192t3, according to the rules, as it says NT49 \u2192 't3'. So NT49 needs to expand to 't3', and NT18 needs to produce the next token, which is t9.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions: Wait, let me check the grammar. Oh, I think I made a mistake. NT18's productions aren't listed twice, but perhaps I misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT59\u2192NT12 NT16\nNT59\u2192NT57 NT24\nNT41\u2192NT16 NT17\nNT49\u2192't3'\nNT24\u2192't10'\nNT18\u2192't0'\nWait, I think I might have mixed up the productions. Let me check each step carefully.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, let's list the relevant productions step by step:\n\nStarting with NT17: production is NT37 NT54.\n\nSo to get the first two tokens as t9 t9, let's see if NT37 can produce 't9' and NT54 can produce 't9'.\n\nLooking at NT37: production is NT49 NT18. So NT37\u2192NT49 NT18. Now, NT49\u2192't3', so that's just 't3', and NT18\u2192't0' according to the rules (NT18 \u2192 't0'), but that would mean we need to produce 't9' which is not matching 't3' or 't0'. So that's a problem. This suggests that the first part might not work.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the indices. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT17's expansion leads to something that can generate 't9 t9'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe building the parse tree from the root down, ensuring each production is correctly matched.\n\nLet me outline the steps more clearly:\n\n1. S produces NT17 NT59. So the string must be the combination of the expansions of NT17 and NT59.\n\n2. Let's handle NT17 first. Its production is NT37 NT54.\n\n   a. So NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\n      i. Now, NT37's production is NT49 NT18.\n\n         - So NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18.\n\n            * NT49 produces 't3', so that's the first token: t3.\n\n            * Then, NT18 \u2192 't0', which would be the next token: t0.\n\n      But the string starts with t9 t9, not t3 t0. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that this path doesn't produce the first tokens correctly. Did I make a mistake in the grammar? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT17 production is missing or I'm misremembering the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar list includes:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nBut NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo indeed, NT17 would expand to 't3' followed by 't0'. But the string starts with 't9 t9'. So this suggests that the first part can't be derived from NT17's production. So that would mean the string isn't generated, right? But that seems too quick.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in which NT17 is expanding to. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 \u2192 NT49 NT18 NT54\n\nWait, no. NT17 produces NT37 NT54, and each of those, in turn, produce things. So NT37 is NT49 NT18, and NT54 is what? Looking at the grammar, NT54's productions are:\n\nLooking for NT54 in the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT54. Wait, let me check. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT54 is present as a terminal in NT37, but I need to check NT54's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me look for NT54 in the production rules.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nI see NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, but that's not helpful. Wait, no: NT55 is a non-terminal in the list, but I don't see productions for NT54. Hmm, that's a problem because if NT54 is a non-terminal, it must have a production rule, but I don't see it in the provided grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the list again: I don't see NT54 in any production, which suggests that perhaps I have a mistake in either the grammar or my memory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misindexed some of the grammar rules. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the original grammar list, each line is a production, but perhaps some were omitted or mislabeled.\n\nLooking through the longer grammar list:\n\nWait, in the lines provided, after NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, we have:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT49 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but I don't see a production for NT54. Therefore, NT54 is a non-terminal, but it's supposed to have a production. That's a problem because without a production rule for NT54, the grammar is incomplete.\n\nThis could be a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps I misindexed the productions. Let me check the entire production list carefully.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT59, there's a rule: NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, and another: NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT54: I don't see it in any production, which suggests that perhaps NT54 is a terminal, but I don't see it as such.\n\nWait, in the rules above, all the NTs except for the parts after \u2192 are non-terminals except when a terminal is on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, looking through the entire grammar:\n\n- For example, NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41, so NT57 is a non-terminal.\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't10', which is a terminal.\n\n- Similarly, NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0, both NTs.\n\nWait, if I look for NT54, it's not present in any production, which suggests it's not a non-terminal in the grammar. That can't be, unless it's a typo, but if I'm supposed to use it as a non-terminal, perhaps the user intended it to have a production.\n\nBut as per the given grammar, NT54 isn't there, which is a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-462","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. CNF means each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So, I can systematically analyze how each non-terminal can expand into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which production is S -> NT17 NT59. This means the string must start with the expansions of NT17 and NT59. So, each of these non-terminals needs to generate parts of the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t7 t0 t2 t10 t2 t7 t0 t9 t5 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t6 t10 t3 t0 t11 t6 t5 t6 t9 t6 t0`.\n\nSince the string starts with 't7', and the first production is NT17 -> NT37 NT54. So, NT17 can expand into two parts, and the string starts with the first part. Let's see what NT37 and NT54 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT37, according to the grammar, it's part of NT43: NT43 -> NT5 NT15, but NT17 -> NT37 NT54. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking back, NT17 -> NT37 NT54. So NT17 expands into NT37 and NT54. So the string starts with either the expansion of NT37 or NT54. But in the string, the first term is t7. So I need to see if either NT37 or NT54 can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15. Not relevant here.\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18. NT49 can be 't3', 't4', 't5', 't10', or 't11'.\n- NT54 -> t9 or others. Wait, let's check NT54. From the grammar, NT54 -> 't2' or 't5', or wait, looking again: NT54 is under NT25: NT25 -> NT13 NT44. Wait, no. Let me list the productions directly.\n\nWait, looking at the given productions:\n\n- NT17 -> NT37 NT54\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT54 -> t2, t5, etc. Let me check each:\n\nNT37: NT37 -> NT49 NT18. So NT49 can be 't3', 't4', 't10', or 't11'. NT18 can be 't9'. So NT37 would produce something starting with t3, t4, t9, t10, or t11. But our string starts with t7. So maybe NT54 is the one producing t7.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT54. From the grammar, I see NT54 is part of which rule? Looking through the productions, I see NT54 isn't directly a production because I don't see NT54 in the list, except in NT37, which is NT37-> NT49 NT18. Wait, no. Let's check each production:\n\nFrom the given list:\n\n- NT43 -> NT5 NT15\n- NT54 -> 't2', 't5' from NT54?\n\nWait, no, I'm looking for how NT54 is defined. Wait, the grammar is given as a list of productions. Let me parse them:\n\nLooking for NT54, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's list the productions:\n\nThe productions I see include:\n\n- NT15 -> NT16 NT56\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT54 -> 't2', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the list:\n\n- NT54 isn't directly a production. The productions that expand to terminals are:\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT10 is not mentioned as a production.\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, NT57 -> NT8 NT41. NT59 -> NT18 NT36, etc.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe grammar is given as a list of productions where each line is A->B C or A-> a. Looking at each line:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT59\n- NT0 -> NT55 NT12\n- NT41 -> NT16 NT17\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT43\n- NT16 -> NT55 NT32\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT25 -> NT13 NT44\n- NT32 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT37 -> NT49 NT18\n- NT55 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24\n- NT41 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't10'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT16 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0', 't6', 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n- NT57 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT32 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT43 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n\nWait, now I see. For example, NT54 has two productions: NT54 -> 't2' and NT54 -> 't9'. Oh, that makes more sense. So NT54 is a non-terminal but both terminals can be directly produced. So, when a non-terminal has a production that is a terminal, that becomes a leaf.\n\nSo, in the case of NT54, it can produce either 't2' or 't9'. Similarly, looking at NT59, it has multiple productions, including some that produce terminals.\n\nSo, coming back, S-> NT17 NT59. So the string must start with NT17's expansion and then NT59's.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is 't7', so let's check if NT17 can expand to produce 't7' as its first symbol. But NT17's production is NT37 NT54. So NT37 and NT54, each of which can produce different terminals.\n\nWait, no, NT17 is a non-terminal that's defined as NT17 -> NT37 NT54. So its expansion is two non-terminals, so the first symbol of the string would come from NT37, and the next from NT54.\n\nBut our string's first symbol is 't7'. So if NT37 can produce 't7', then that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT37: It's defined as NT37 -> NT49 NT18. So NT49 can produce 't3', 't4', 't5', 't10', or 't11'. NT18 can produce 't0'.\n\nSo, if NT37 leads to 't7', then NT49 must produce 't7' as the first symbol, but looking at NT49's productions: NT49 -> 't3', 't4', 't5', 't10', 't11'. So NS49 never produces 't7'. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, am I looking at this correctly? Let me re-express the grammar more clearly.\n\nLet me list all the productions again in order, perhaps grouping non-terminals:\n\n- S -> NT17 NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My job is to figure out whether each token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form of a context-free grammar where each production rule is either of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most of the rules are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, which fits the first part of CNF. However, some rules have terminals on the right-hand side, like NT44 -> 't0', which also fits since CNF allows terminals on the right. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the provided string: \"t7 t3 t5 t0 t7 t7 t2 t7 t3 t2 t6 t5 t5 t8 t4 t0 t5 t3 t3 t5 t5 t9 t10 t11 t0 t2\". This string seems to consist of multiple tokens, some of which might be non-terminals, others terminals. So my first step is to parse this string into individual tokens: [t7, t3, t5, t0, t7, t7, t2, t7, t3, t2, t6, t5, t5, t8, t4, t0, t5, t3, t3, t5, t5, t9, t10, t11, t0, t2].\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, I know that each production rule can only result in two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal. This is useful because it suggests that the parse tree will have a specific structure, with each internal node having exactly two children.\n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a top-down parsing using the grammar. Starting from the start symbol S, I need to see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT17 NT59. So S -> NT17 NT59. Therefore, the string should start with t7 and t3 because looking at the given grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> t4\n- NT59 -> t3\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, according to the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT17: NT17 -> t4 and t7? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar defines NT17 -> NT47 NT41?\n\nNo, actually, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nWait, let me make sure. I have to be careful here. The grammar provided in the question is a bit long. Let me list out the relevant rules for NT57, NT59, etc.\n\nWait, actually, for NT17, according to the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT17 -> NT37 NT54, not directly to t4 or t7. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check the rules again. The grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54.\n\nAnd NT37 -> NT9 NT10?\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18.\n\nWait, that's not it either. Hmm, perhaps it's better to list out all the rules for NT17, NT37, etc., to see how they might derive to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and I should approach this by building the parse tree from the bottom up, checking if each rule leads to the corresponding token.\n\nAnother approach is to think recursively: starting from S, try to match the string by expanding each symbol until the string is fully consumed.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. The string starts with t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what non-terminals produce 't7'? Let's check the rules where a non-terminal is directly replaced by 't7'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- Wait, no, looking through:\n\nWait, in the list, I see rules like:\n\n- NT55 -> NT25 NT0\n- NT1-> 't0'\n- Wait, perhaps I should list all the rules that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT0 -> NT55 NT12 \u2192 not a terminal\nNT41 -> NT16 NT17 \u2192 no\nNT55 -> NT25 NT0 \u2192 no\nNT12 -> NT5 NT43 \u2192 no\nNT16 -> NT55 NT32 \u2192 no\nNT57 -> NT8 NT41 \u2192 no\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36 \u2192 no\nNT25 -> NT13 NT44 \u2192 no\nNT32 -> NT2 NT36 \u2192 no\nNT37 -> NT49 NT18 \u2192 no\nNT43 -> NT5 NT15 \u2192 no\nNT49 -> 't3' and 't11' \u2192 Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36 (not terminal)\nWait, no, perhaps I should look for rules that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36 (not terminal)\n- NT59 -> NT57 NT24 \u2192 NT57 produces NT8, which perhaps I need to check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the rules that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, no, perhaps not.

But some rules have two non-terminals, like NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17. That's fine in CNF because it's two non-terminals. But I notice that some rules have a mix, like NT59: it has two productions, NT12 NT16 and NT57 NT24. So, it's a bit ambiguous, but I think that's acceptable as long as each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is a sequence of t's and numbers. Each t is a terminal, and each number like t7, t10, etc., is a terminal as well.\n\nSo, the string is: t7, t10, t3, t5, t5, t2, t2, t2, t2, t8, t5, t3, t8, t0, t4, t5, t9, t10, t3, t5, t2, t1, t6, t5, t6, t0.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I might need to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing context-free grammars.\n\nBut considering the time, perhaps I can try to look for the starting symbol S and see how it expands.\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nSo, the initial symbol is S, which expands into NT17 and NT59. So the string must be split into two parts: one that corresponds to NT17 and another to NT59, in that order.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be generated by NT17 and the second part by NT59.\n\nWait, actually, in CYK, S is the start symbol, and the entire string must be generated by S. So each symbol is generated by the start symbol.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each part of the string corresponds to a non-terminal expansion. So for example, S \u2192 NT17 NT59 means that the string is divided into two parts: the first part is generated by NT17, the second by NT59.\n\nSo, the given string is 27 tokens, which is an odd number. Splitting into two parts would mean that NT17 generates the first k tokens, and NT59 generates the remaining (27 -k) tokens.\n\nSo, first, I need to find possible k such that NT17 can generate the first k tokens and NT59 can generate the remaining 27 -k.\n\nBut k must be such that the number of tokens in the first part is compatible with the number of symbols in the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the grammar can produce such a string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I might try to see if any rules can directly match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT59 has two options: it can produce t3 or t10 or ...? Wait, no, NT59 is a non-terminal, and its productions are to other non-terminals. From the given rules, NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16 and NT59 \u2192 NT57 NT24.\n\nSo, NT59 can generate a pair of non-terminals. Similarly, other rules are also like that.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, so we have to see if each part of the string can be generated by the non-terminals in a way that flows from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to see if the string starts with t7, which is from NT17 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, or from earlier rules, does NT17 have any production with a terminal? Let's see:\n\nFrom the given rules, NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54, and also NT17 \u2192 't4'? Wait, looking back, in the provided grammar, under NT17, one of the productions is NT17 \u2192 't4'. So NT17 can produce t4 directly.\n\nWait, no, checking the list:\n\nLooking for NT17, the rules are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.

The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S produces NT17 and NT59. So, the string must start with t7 (since NT17 is 't7') and end with 't6' (since NT59 is 't6').\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t7 and ends with t6, which aligns with S's productions.\n\nNow, I need to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules. Let me list the string's tokens to make it easier: [t7, t0, t9, t11, t7, t2, t0, t3, t2, t0, t11, t9, t10, t7, t8, t3, t5, t2, t2, t0, t6, t0, t5, t4, t4, t5, t6].\n\nStarting from S, the first step is to produce NT17 and NT59. So the first two symbols should be t7 (from NT17) and t6 (from NT59). That's correct as per the string.\n\nNext, let's handle NT17. NT17 -> t4 or NT37. Looking at the string, the next token is t0, which isn't t4. So NT17 must produce NT37. So now, we'll produce NT37.\n\nNT37 has two options: t9 or NT36 or NT49. The next token is t9, so NT37 -> t9. Now we're at position 3 in the string.\n\nMoving on, we now handle NT59 (the second part of S). NT59 is t6, which is the current token, so that's done.\n\nNow, the next token is t7 (position 3 in string) from the NT17 side. Wait, no, after handling NT37, the next part is the third token. Hmm, maybe I should structure it differently.\n\nActually, each production can have two non-terminals, so maybe I should break it down as each rule.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to represent it as a tree or use a stack-based approach. Alternatively, think of the grammar as a system of equations, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to find a leftmost derivation. Let's attempt that.\n\nStart:\nS -> NT17 NT59\nSo, we split into NT17 and NT59.\n\nStep 1:\nNT17 can be t4 or NT37\nNT59 can be t6 or NT44 or NT57\nLooking at the string, the current tokens after S are t7, t0, etc. Wait, actually, the first two tokens after S would be from NT17 and NT59. So after S, NT17 -> t7, NT59 -> t6. So that's the first two tokens: t7 t6.\n\nBut the string starts with t7 t0, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, the string is a sequence of all the symbols produced, including from the leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, no, in the string, it's the sequence of generated symbols. So the initial string starts with t7 (from NT17) followed by t6 (from NT59). Let's correct that.\n\nWait, the first token is t7, so that comes from NT17. The next token should be from NT59, which is t6. So the first two tokens should be t7 t6, but the given string starts with t7 t0. That's a contradiction.\n\nWait a second, that might mean that the string cannot be generated because the first two symbols are t7 t0, but according to S's rules, it's t7 followed by t6.\n\nSo that would immediately invalidate the string because the initial two symbols don't match the production of S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's recheck the grammar. The rule S -> NT17 NT59. NT17 is defined as:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 -> t4 or NT37.\n\nBut in the string, after t7 comes t0, which isn't t4. So, in term of leftmost derivation, after S => NT17 NT59, NT17 must produce something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t7 t0 t9 t11 t7 t2 t0 t3 t2 t0 t11 t9 t10 t7 t8 t3 t5 t2 t2 t0 t6 t0 t5 t4 t4 t5 t6.\n\nWe need to consume these tokens one by one, starting from the start symbol S.\n\n1. S produces NT17 and NT59: So, the next two symbols should be the expansions of NT17 and NT59 respectively.\n\nNT17: Possible rules are NT17 -> t4 or NT37.\n\nBut the first token is t7, which matches the production of NT17, so:\n\nNT17 -> t7. Now, the next token should come from NT59.\n\nNT59: Possible rules are NT59 -> t6, NT59->NT12, or NT59->NT16.\n\nWait, looking back to the grammar, for NT59, the productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 or NT16.\n\nBut in the initial tokens after t7, the next is t0. So NT59 would have to produce t0, but according to the grammar, NT59 can't produce t0. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT59's productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 or NT16.\n\nSo, it can't produce t0 directly. Therefore, the first production after S would require NT59 to produce a non-terminal.\n\nHmm, but in the given string, the first three tokens are t7, t0, t9.\n\nSo, after S, we have NT17->t7, then NT59, which must expand to something that starts with t0.\n\nLooking at NT59's options: NT59 -> NT12 or NT16.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12's productions are:\n\nNT12 -> NT5 and NT43. NT5 outputs 't5', and NT43 is NT5 and NT15.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce t0, t3, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the string starts with t7 (from NT17) and then nt59, which must generate t0.\n\nLooking back, NT59 can go to NT12 or NT16.\n\nNT12's start may not produce t0, but let's see: NT12's productions are NT5 and NT43. So, to produce t0, perhaps NT5 or NT43 can produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT5: NT5 has production NT25 and NT5 (again) or NT5 -> t3 or t10 or t5 or t9 via other rules.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should list all possible terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\nt4: appears in NT37 (t4) or NT15 (t0).\n\nt6: appears in NT24 and NT20 (possibly).\n\nt7: NT17 produces t7.\n\nt0: produced by NT5 (t0, via NT5 -> 't5' but that's not t0. Wait, looking at NT5:\n\nNT5's productions are:\n\nNT5 -> NT25 and NT5, which I think is a typo, maybe NT55.

Let's start by looking at the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me note that the start symbol is S, which breaks down into NT17 and NT59. So, the string must start and end with NT17 and NT59 respectively after processing all tokens, but wait, actually in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string provided is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions appropriately, step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: `t7 t10 t10 t2 t7 t2 t2 t8 t3 t9 t0 t10 t3 t0 t10 t5 t3 t2 t8 t10 t10 t6 t4 t5 t11 t6 t4`. That's 27 tokens, which are all terminals. The grammar only produces terminals, so we need to see if these tokens can be generated by the rules.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree from the string, starting with S, and trying to split the string into the right parts according to the productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So the first part is NT17, and the second part is NT59.\n\nLet's break down NT17. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nSo NT17 can be split into NT37 and NT54. Now, let's look at the beginning of the string. The first token is t7. Let's see if NT37 can produce t7.\n\nLooking up NT37 \u2192 t9 \u2192 No, wait. Let me check: The productions for NT37 are:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n\nBut in the string, after the first t7 (from NT17), the next tokens are t10, t10, etc. So perhaps NT37 is more involved.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string is a list of terminals, I should consider the entire list and see if it can be generated by breaking it down using the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the string as a list and use a recursive descent parser. But perhaps a better way is to see if the entire string can be divided according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out all the productions for each non-terminal to see possible splits:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT55 NT12\n- NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17\n- NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0\n- NT12 \u2192 NT5 NT43\n- NT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32\n- NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41\n- NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 or NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24\n- NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44\n- NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n- NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18\n- NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56\n- NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n- NT43 \u2192 NT5 NT15\n- NT59 \u2192 multiple options, but in the string, the first part is t7, so probably NT59 is involved there.\n\nWait, the string starts with t7 t10 t10 t2 etc. Let's try to see how t7 can be generated.\n\nLooking at NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36 or NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nThe options for NT59 split into two parts. Let me check if any of these lead to starting with t7.\n\nLooking at the string, after the initial t7, the next few tokens are t10, t10, t2, etc. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the entire string and see how it can be split.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work from the top down. The start symbol S produces NT17 NT59. So the string must be structured as the concatenation of derivations of NT17 and NT59.\n\nSo let's first process NT17. NT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo the subtree under NT17 must produce a string that starts with t7 followed by other tokens. But looking at the production for NT37, NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. Then NT49 can be t7 or t3 or t10. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at NT59 first. NT59 can be split into different options. Let's see which one might produce a string starting with t7.\n\nLooking back, in the string, after the initial t7, the next tokens are t10, t10, etc. Wait, but if I pick NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, then NT12 produces NT5 NT43, and then those can produce t5, t8, etc. Hmm, perhaps that's another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial part of the string is t7, t10, t10, which corresponds to NT37 \u2192 t7 t... Wait, let's see NT37's production: NT37 \u2192 NT49 NT18. So if NT49 is t7, which it can be via NT59 \u2192 t7 (wait, NT59's productions don't list t7 directly. Looking at NT59, it's either NT18 NT36, which is t? Or other options. Wait, checking the grammar, I think NT59 is defined as multiple productions, including NT57 NT24.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the possible terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLet me make a list of productions for each non-terminal that result in a terminal:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- NT41 \u2192 't0'\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT25 \u2192 't7'\n- NT32 \u2192 't6'\n- NT49 \u2192 't3' or 't11'\n- NT8 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't2' or 't6' or 't4'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT16 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't0' (there are three versions of NT2? Or maybe NT2 has three productions leading to 't0', 't6', 't4'? Let me see, in the given grammar, \"NT2 -> 't0'\", it's written as three separate entries but all same: three 'NT2 -> 't0''? Or does \"NT2\" mean multiple? No, in the grammar, each production is unique. So maybe \"NT2 -> 't0'\" appears once, but written three times. So NT2 only produces 't0'.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> 't10'\nNT49 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't7'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT36 -> 't6'\nAnd others. So each non-terminal can have multiple productions leading to the same or different terminals.\n\nSo for NT2, the production is \"NT2 -> 't0'\" appearing three times, but likely just one production. So NT2 always produces t0.\n\nSo, in the string, the tokens are:\n\n1. t7\n2. t10\n3. t10\n4. t2\n5. t7\n6. t2\n7. t2\n8. t8\n9. t3\n10. t9\n11. t0\n12. t10\n13. t3\n14. t0\n15. t10\n16. t5\n17. t3\n18. t2\n19. t8\n20. t10\n21. t10\n22. t6\n23. t4\n24. t5\n25. t11\n26. t6\n27. t4\n\nLet me try to build this step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nSo the string is split as [NT37 derivation] followed by [NT54 derivation].\n\nNow, the first token is t7.

The grammar has a lot of non-terminal symbols, so I'm going to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are organized as such.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t7 t9 t9 t10 t3 t2 t2 t1 t5 t5 t8 t6 t5 t6 t4 t5 t2 t3 t2 t2 t0 t1 t11 t5 t10 t8 t6 t6 t5 t6`.\n\nWait, the string has some repeated terms. Let me write them down clearly: t7, t9, t3, t2, t2, t1, t5, t5, t8, t6, t5, t6, t4, t5, t2, t3, t2, t2, t0, t1, t11, t5, t10, t8, t6, t6, t5, t6.

Let me correct that to 29 so I don't get lost. Hmm, no, maybe I miscounted. Let me recheck.\n\nThe string after the `:` is: `t7 t9 t3 t2 t2 t1 t5 t5 t8 t6 t5 t6 t4 t5 t2 t3 t2 t2 t0 t1 t11 t5 t10 t8 t6 t6 t5 t6`. Let me group them:\n\nt7, t9, t3, t2, t2, t1, t5, t5, t8, t6, t5, t6, t4, t5, t2, t3, t2, t2, t0, t1, t11, t5, t10, t8, t6, t6, t5, t6. That's 29 symbols.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the string should start with NT17 and NT59. Let's check: the first two symbols are t7 and t9. So I need to see what NT17 and NT59 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT17 can be derived from different rules. Let me look up NT17 \u2192 ? The productions are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nWait, and also, is there any production for NT17 that leads to terminals? Or only the non-terminals? Let me check: the productions for NT17 are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54.\n\nWait, but looking at the full list, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nWait, but I don't see any terminal in NT17's productions. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check all NT17 productions.\n\nWait, the full list includes:\n\nNT17 -> NT37 NT54\n\nWait, is that it? Or perhaps I missed another production for NT17. Let me scan the productions again. Hmm, I only see NT17-> NT37 NT54. So that means NT17 is a non-terminal that must be expanded further.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking at NT59's productions:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo, but assuming it's correct, NT59 can produce (NT12 NT16), (NT57 NT24), or another (NT57 NT24). Let me check for more NT59 productions.\n\nNT59 has two more productions:\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nand another NT59 -> NT57 NT24?\n\nOr perhaps that's duplicated, so NT59 has three productions? Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT59 productions are:\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nWait, the full list says:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nNT59 -> NT57 NT24\n\nSo, yes, that's three productions. The first two are different (NT12 NT16 and NT57 NT24), and then the third is redundant (same as the second). So effectively, NT59 has two possible non-terminals: either NT12 and NT16, or NT57 and NT24.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be the results of NT17 and NT59.\n\nNow, let's see: t7 t9.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54 (since that's its only production)\n\nSo, the NT17 part would expand to NT37 NT54, which themselves must expand to terminals. Let's track that.\n\nSo, step 1: S \u2192 NT17 NT59 \u2192 (NT37 NT54) (NT59)\n\nSo the string starts with NT17 expanding to two non-terminals: NT37 and NT54. So the first two symbols in the string should come from NT37 and NT54.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. The first symbol in the string is t7, then t9, but S \u2192 NT17 NT59, so the first part is NT17, which becomes NT37 and NT54, and the second part is NT59, which becomes...\n\nWait, let me think. The entire string is 29 symbols, so after S \u2192 NT17 NT59, which becomes (as per the first expansion) NT37 NT54 and NT59. So NT37 and NT54 are the next to produce. But in the string, the first symbol is t7, which is the terminal output from one of these non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, determining which non-terminals can produce the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more systematic, but since the grammar is quite extensive, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since it's in CNF, the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. Wait, but let me check the length.\n\nThe string has 29 symbols. Let me see: 2^n = 29? Well, 2^5 is 32, which is more than 29. So perhaps it's not a direct power of two. Maybe the parse tree has a certain structure.\n\nWait, but even if the length wasn't a power of two, maybe the string is valid if it can be broken down into the non-terminals correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can generate strings of a certain structure.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to simulate the parsing step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the first step is to consume the output of NT17 and NT59. The first part is NT17, which is NT37 NT54, and the second part is NT59, which can be either NT12 NT16 or NT57 NT24.\n\nSo let's think about possible expansions.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Perhaps it's better to try to see if the string can be generated by following the grammar productions.\n\nWait, let me see the grammar again:\n\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT59\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT37 NT54\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, or NT57 NT24.\n\nLet me denote the string to parse as T: t7 t9 t3 t2 t2 t1 t5 t5 t8 t6 t5 t6 t4 t5 t2 t3 t2 t2 t0 t1 t11 t5 t10 t8 t6 t6 t5 t6.\n\nI think the first step is S \u2192 NT17 NT59.\n\nSo the first two symbols must come from NT17 and NT59 expansions.\n\nSo NT17's output is NT37 NT54, and NT59's output starts with either NT12 or NT57.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t7.

NT57's production is NT8 NT41, which are both non-terminals. So NT57 can produce 't10 t6' as a string, but that's not a single terminal. So I think the correct way is that NT57 produces 't10 t6', which are terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for NT57, the RHS is NT8 and NT41, both non-terminals. So NT57 can produce any concatenation of the productions of NT8 and NT41.\n\nBut this might get complicated.

So let's parse the string by identifying the possible rightmost derivatives.\n\nFirst, the string has 34 tokens. Each production, whether it's splitting into two non-terminals or a single terminal, will split the string into parts.\n\nPerhaps I should start from the end of the string and see if I can match any rightmost derivation.\n\nLooking at the last part: the string ends with 't2'.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals that can produce 't2' directly:\n\nLooking at the productions, which non-terminals have 't2' as an option. Let's go through each:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't2' directly.\n\nOther non-terminals with 't2': NT15 can produce t0, but I don't think any others have 't2'.\n\nWait, let's see each production:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't2' (so yes, NT36 can produce t2)\n- Are there others? Let's check:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't4' or 't5' or 't0' \u2014 doesn't produce t2 directly.\n\nNT24 \u2192 't10', 't5', or 't0'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t7 t3 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t2 t2 t1 t5 t3 t3 t0 t7 t7 t1 t9 t9 t5 t5 t3 t9 t5 t5 t6 t0 t5 t0 t0`. \n\nFirst, I'm a bit rusty on CFGs, but I remember that CNF has specific structures where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow this structure since all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals: t0 to t9. My task is to see if this particular sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe first step is to understand the start symbol. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT17 NT59. So, the string must begin with the symbols that NT17 and NT59 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17: Its production rules include NT37 NT54 and NT54 \u2192 t9. So, NT17 can produce t9 via NT54, but there's also another rule for NT17: NT44 NT2, which leads to t8 and NT2. Wait, actually, looking back, the rules for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT16 NT56, and NT16 is NT55 NT32, which could go to more non-terminals.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step, seeing if each non-terminal can be expanded into the corresponding terminals.\n\nLet's start:\n- The string starts with t7. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t7.\n\nLooking at NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41. Let's see if 8 or 41 can produce t7. NT41 has a rule NT41 \u2192 NT16 NT17. Let's check NT16 and NT17.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT55 NT32. NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0. NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44. NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT3 (two times?) Or does it have another rule? Wait, I see NT13 \u2192 NT3 and also NT13 \u2192 NT2. Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT13 \u2192 NT3? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, under NT13, the productions are:\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3\nWait, no, under NT13, I see: NT44 \u2192 t0, and earlier, NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44. So NT13 \u2192 NT3 is not there. Wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nIn the list, under NT13, I see only NT13 \u2192 NT3? Or wait, looking again:\n\nNo, actually, no, under NT13, the rules are:\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 (twice?), or is it just one rule? Wait, under NT13, I see NT13 \u2192 NT3 once, and also another rule NT13 \u2192 NT2. So NT13 can produce either NT3 or NT2.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, under NT13: `NT13 -> NT3` and `NT13 -> NT2`. So NT13 can lead to either NT3 or NT2, which then need to be resolved.\n\nSo going back to NT57 \u2192 NT8 NT41. NT8 is a terminal, so NT57 can produce t8 followed by whatever NT41 can produce.\n\nWait, but wait, the string starts with t7, so maybe I made a mistake. Because NT57 is producing t8 first, but the string starts with t7. So perhaps that's not the right path. Maybe another NT can produce t7.\n\nLooking at other NTs that can produce t7. Let's check NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT25 NT0. NT25 \u2192 NT13 NT44. NT44 \u2192 t0. So from 55, NT55 could go to NT25 (which goes to 13 and 44) and then 44 is t0. So NT55 might not be useful for t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that directly produce t7. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, the only non-terminals that produce terminals include NT57 \u2192 t7? Wait, no. Let me check each production rule:\n\nWait, in the grammar given, for NT57, the rule is NT57 -> NT8 NT41. So NT57 can't directly produce t7.\n\nWhat about NT59? NT59 has two rules: one is NT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16, another is NT59 \u2192 't6' and 't11'? Wait, looking again, the rules for NT59 are:\n\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- NT59 -> 't16' ?\n\nNo, wait, the grammar given includes:\n\nNT59 -> NT12 NT16\nNT59 -> NT18 NT36\nNT59 -> 't6'\nWait, no, let me recheck.\n\nNo, in the given grammar, under NT59, I see two rules:\n\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- And other rules for NT57: NT57 -> NT8 NT41\n- And NT59 at the bottom of the list: NT59 -> 't6' and also \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\" but I think the 't6' is another rule for NT59.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nYes, later in the list, under NT59, the rules are:\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- Also, looking further, I see NT59 has another rule: \"NT59 -> NT12 NT16\" again? Or perhaps not. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but I think the correct rules for NT59 are:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT12 NT16\nNT59 \u2192 NT18 NT36\nNT59 \u2192 't6'\nAnd also another rule: looking more carefully, the list ends with:\n\"NT55 -> 't8'\nNT59 -> 't6'\nNT36 -> 't6'\n... many lines later ...\nThe user listed each rule as a separate line, so let me list all the rules for clarity.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules for NT59 are:\n\n- NT59 -> NT12 NT16\n- NT59 -> NT18 NT36\n- NT59 -> 't6'\n- Then, at the end, under 'NT55 -> 't8'', 'NT49 -> 't3'', 'NT24 -> 't10'', etc.\n\nWait, at the very end, the grammar has:\n\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT49 -> 't3'\n- NT24 -> 't10'\n- NT49 -> 't11'\n- NT8 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT16 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't4'\n- NT24 -> 't0'\n- NT18 -> 't0'\n- NT24 -> 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't4'\n- NT12 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT44 -> 't0'\n- NT25 -> 't2'\n- NT57 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't0'\n- NT37 -> 't9'\n- NT36 -> 't0'\n- NT44 -> 't2'\n- NT36 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't3'\n- NT54 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n- NT32 -> 't6'\n- NT49 -> 't7'\n- NT43 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't9'\n- NT37 -> 't10'\n- NT54 -> 't6'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
