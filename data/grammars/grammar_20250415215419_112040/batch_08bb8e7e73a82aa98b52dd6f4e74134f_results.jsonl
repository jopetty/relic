{"custom_id":"request-3","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the string \"t4\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the rules to either single terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nThe starting symbol is S, and from the production rules, S can go to NT4NT8 or NT1NT2. So the string we're checking is \"t4\", which is a single terminal symbol. Since the start symbol S produces strings of two non-terminals, \"t4\" must come from a single derivation where S directly produces it. But looking at the rules, none directly produce S -> t4; instead, the non-terminals on the left side of the rules produce the terminals. So the first step is to check if any of the non-terminals directly produce 't4'. \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT4 has two rules: NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5'. Also, from the terminal productions, NT4 can produce 't4' if that's a defined rule, but I don't see NT4 -> 't4' in the given productions. So wait, there's no rule where NT4 directly produces 't4'. \n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let's check all the terminal productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't5', NT2 -> 't2', NT10 -> 't6', NT13 -> 't4', NT13 also -> 't6', NT9 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't0' and 't5', etc. So yes, NT13 produces 't4'. But S doesn't produce S -> NT13 anything; S's options are all combinations of other non-terminals. So to get 't4' in the string, the derivation would have to somehow get to NT13 from S somehow, but S's productions don't include NT13. \n\nLet me see: S can produce NT4NT8 or NT1NT2. To get t4, perhaps one of these sequences would derive to t4. But wait, the string is only \"t4,\" which is length 1. Since S's productions are two non-terminals, if \"t4\" is the result, it would have to be from a rule where two non-terminals together derive to \"t4\". But looking at the productions, each non-terminal only produces either a single symbol or two symbols, and no two non-terminals are combined to produce \"t4\". \n\nWait, maybe it's possible to derive \"t4\" by having a non-terminal that produces \"t4\", but S cannot directly do that. So is there any way for S to produce \"t4\"? Let's think.\n\nSince S starts, the only ways to get \"t4\" are if S can produce something that eventually leads to \"t4\", but since S's first step is to produce two non-terminals, unless those non-terminals can generate \"t4\" in combination. But \"t4\" is a single symbol. So the only way is if one of the non-terminals on the right side of S's production can derive to \"t4\" when the other non-terminal contributes nothing. But that's impossible because all productions are either terminals or two non-terminals. So in order to get \"t4\", one of the non-terminals on the right side of S's production must be able to produce \"t4\" and the other must produce a single symbol? No, because each production is non-terminals on the left, and the right side must be a sequence of terms, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. The productions are in the form of non-terminals on the left and on the right, either terminals or non-terminals. So for S -> NT4 NT8, each of NT4 and NT8 must produce something. If S produces NT4 NT8, each of those non-terminals must expand into a terminal or sequence of non-terminals that produce terminals. So the entire string would be the combination of the derivations of NT4 and NT8. But each of those would produce strings themselves, so the total string would be the concatenation of those two.\n\nBut the string we have is just \"t4\". So unless one of the non-terminals in NT4 or NT8 directly produces 't4', which I don't see, it's not possible. From the terminal productions, only NT13 produces 't4'. But S's production doesn't involve NT13. S's productions are all combinations of other non-terminals. So how would 't4' come into play?\n\nWait, unless through the sequence of productions. Let's try to see if any of the non-terminals derived from S can produce 't4' through a chain. For example, if S -> NT4 NT8, and NT4 can produce 't4' and NT8 can produce an empty string, but there's no empty string production. Alternatively, each non-terminal must produce at least a terminal or a non-terminal that can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's start from S:\n\nS can go to NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2.\n\nSo to get 't4', one of these paths must lead to 't4'. Let's look at the first option: NT4 NT8. So each of these must generate a terminal. NT4 can generate 't0' or 't5', but not 't4'. NT8 can generate various things, but unless one of these non-terminals can generate 't4', it's not possible. Looking at NT8's productions, I see NT8 -> 't6', NT8 -> 't0', and some other rules, but not 't4'. So that's not helpful.\n\nLooking at the other option: S -> NT1 NT2. Then NT1 produces what? Let's check NT1's rules. NT1 -> 't8' directly, or it can go to NT9 NT13. Hmm. If NT1 goes to 't8', then NT2 needs to go somewhere. NT2's rules include NT2 -> 't2' and others, but also NT2 can be NT2 NT4. But to get 't4', if the first step is S -> NT1 NT2, and NT1 -> 't8', then NT2 must produce 't4' or contribute to the string. Wait, but 't8' and 't4' would create the string 't8t4', not 't4', so that wouldn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if NT1 goes to NT9 NT13, and NT13 produces 't4', then perhaps we can have NT1 => NT9 NT13, which then gives 't' something and 't4'. But let's trace it:\n\nFrom S -> NT1 NT2. Suppose NT1 -> NT9 NT13, then NT9 produces 't9' (since NT9 -> 't9') or more non-terminals? Wait, checking NT9's productions: NT9 -> 't0', but also NT9 -> NT4 NT2. So if NT9 -> NT4 NT2, then NT4 could go to 't0' or 't5', and NT2 could go to 't2' or more. But let's try to see if we can get 't4':\n\nIf NT1 -> NT9 NT13, then NT13 -> 't4'. So NT1 would contribute the string from NT9 and NT13. But NT9's rules: let's say NT9 -> 't9' for now. Then NT1 -> 't9t4'. Then S would have 't9t4' from one branch, but that's 't9' followed by 't4'. Not just 't4'. Alternatively, can NT9 generate something else?\n\nWait, looking again: NT9's rules include NT4 -> 't0' and 't5', but also NT9 can go to NT3 NT5. NT3 is a terminal 't5', so NT9 can become 't5' or go further. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if NT13 can be part of a way to produce just 't4'. But looking back, S's production doesn't involve NT13. So unless S can somehow generate NT13 via one of its productions, but looking at the initial productions, none of S's right sides include NT13. For example, S->NT4NT8 or NT1NT2, nothing with NT13.\n\nTherefore, for 't4' to be generated, it must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't4' directly, but none of the non-terminals can do that except NT13. But S can't reach NT13 because its initial productions don't include any NT13. Unless through some left-derivations where S's rules lead to something that eventually can produce 't4' via NT13, but I don't see that path.\n\nWait, perhaps the string 't4' is part of a longer string that includes 't4' as a substring? But no, the string we're evaluating is exactly 't4'. So it's a single character. Therefore, the only way is if S produces S's first part via NT4 or NT1 to generate 't4' or a component of it.\n\nLooking again, S's options:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it makes parsing easier, but the string is only two tokens long.

Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals? Wait, no, I think in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, the terminals are the multi-character ones, like 't0', 't1', etc. So each production either has two non-terminals or one terminal on the right.\n\nThe input string is \"t2 t8\". Since it's two tokens, let's split them as two separate symbols, so the string is [t2, t8].\n\nI need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string. Let's see how S can produce these. S has two productions: S \u2192 NT4 NT8 and S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So I can look into both and see if either can generate t2 t8.\n\nFirst, let's look at S \u2192 NT4 NT8. NT4 can produce t4 or t7, right? Wait, looking at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 t0, t5. Wait, in the grammar, the rules for NT4 are:\n\nNT4 -> t0\nNT4 -> t5\nNT4 -> t7 (since NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT9 \u2192 t0, so NT4 can go to t0 NT7.

Let's try both options for S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, NT4 must produce t2 and NT8 must produce t8. Wait, no, because NT4 and NT8 are both non-terminals, so each can derive a string, and when combined, their concatenations must form the desired string.\n\nWait, but the desired string is [\"t2\", \"t8\"], which is two tokens. So, in terms of the parse tree, it would be S producing NT4 and NT8, each of which must produce a terminal at the root level. But wait, NT4 and NT8 can only produce terminal strings, so each must derive a single terminal token. Or maybe more, but in this case, the entire S production would generate two terminals.\n\nWait, but each NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals, so each can produce sequences of terminals. So, for S \u2192 NT4 NT8 to generate \"t2 t8\", we need NT4 to produce \"t2\" and NT8 to produce \"t8\" in one step, but looking at their productions, I don't think that's possible because NT4's productions are to non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, wait, let's look at NT4. NT4's productions are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0\nNT4 \u2192 t5\nNT4 \u2192 t7 (through NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT9 \u2192 t0, so t0 NT7, but NT7 can produce t10, right? Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the rules step by step.\n\nLooking at NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT7. Then, NT9 \u2192 t0, so that production becomes t0 NT7. Now, NT7 has rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT7\nWait, so NT7 can go from non-terminal to more non-terminals, but it seems that with recursion.\n\nWait, but the terminal production for NT7 is none, except when it's reduced via other rules. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me check the NT4 and NT8 productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol S can produce NT4 NT8. So, both NT4 and NT8 must derive to terminal strings in such a way that when they are concatenated, they form \"t2 t8\". That would mean NT4 must produce \"t2\" and NT8 must produce \"t8\". But looking at NT4's productions, do any of them directly produce \"t2\"?\n\nLooking at NT4: its productions are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0\nNT4 \u2192 t5\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 (and then NT14 \u2192 t3, NT7 \u2192 t10, etc. But none of these directly produce \"t2\".\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the grammar, there is a production NT2 \u2192 t2. Let me check if there's a NT2 somewhere.\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, NT2 \u2192 t2 is one of the productions. But that's a production for NT2, not NT4. So NT4 cannot directly produce t2 because its productions don't include t2. So if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then to get t2 t8, NT4 must produce t2, but it can't. So that path doesn't work.\n\nSo Option 1 is out.\n\nNow, Option 2: S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nSimilarly, we need NT1 to produce \"t2\" and NT2 to produce \"t8\", but wait, NT1 is a non-terminal, so let's see NT1's productions. NT1 has productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT14\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT1 \u2192 NT3 NT1\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT14\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nWait, looking more closely, in the grammar, NT1 has a production to \"t8\", which is NT1 \u2192 t8. So that's a terminal. So NT1 can produce t8, but cannot produce t2 directly because none of its productions are t2.\n\nWait, but maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but wait, NT1 \u2192 t8 is directly. So if NT2 can produce t8, but NT2 \u2192 t2. So back to NT2 \u2192 t2 is part of the grammar. But in this context, S \u2192 NT1 NT2, so NT2 must produce t8, but NT2 \u2192 t2 is one of its productions. So to get t8, NT2 must have a path that allows it to produce t8.

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t3 t4`, and the grammar is quite extensive with all sorts of production rules. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, I notice that some rules might start with a single non-terminal followed by two terminals, but that's allowed as long as they're derived from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't0', etc. These are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string to check is `t3 t4`. So I think about how this string could be formed. Each token is a terminal, so it must be produced directly by a production or via some derivation.\n\nLet me check which non-terminals produce 't3' and 't4'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't5' and NT2 \u2192 't5' (but that's irrelevant here). Wait, looking again, I see NT3 \u2192 't3'... no, wait: Looking back, in the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't7' and other t\u2019s. Hmm, maybe I missed some?\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nWait, or is there another? Let me check:\n\nYes, the rules include:\n\nNT3 -> 't7'\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nSo NT3 can produce 't7' or 't2', but where does 't3' come from? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules again to see if any non-terminal produces 't3' directly. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT0 rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\nSo NT0 can produce, among others, 't3' via NT6 \u2192 't3'. So if a production leads to NT0, which then leads to NT6 which gives 't3'.\n\nFor 't4', looking through the rules, I see NT13 \u2192 't4' in one of the rules. Let me check:\n\nYes, the rule NT13 -> 't4' is present. So 't4' is directly produced by NT13.\n\nSo, the string is 't3 t4', which would require the start symbol S to derive into a sequence that first produces 't3' and then 't4'. So the parse tree would have S as the root, with two children, each producing one of the terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S produces NT4 NT8 or similar. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So each S expansion produces two non-terminals. To get two terminals, each of those must derive into a terminal.\n\nBut in our case, the string is just two terminals, so perhaps S must choose a rule that immediately produces two terminals. But looking at the rules for S:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4\nWait, no. The S rules are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce two non-terminals each time.\n\nSo in the string, we have 't3 t4'. So each of these must come from a production starting with two non-terminals.\n\nSo to get 't3 t4', the only way is to have the S produce two non-terminals, each of which then produce a terminal.\n\nBut 't3 t4' is two tokens, so the parse tree would have S at the root, with two children, one producing 't3' and the other producing 't4'.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S, each production of S is two non-terminals:\n\nThe possible S rules are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo let me check if any of these can derive into 't3' and 't4'.\n\nFor S \u2192 NT4 NT8:\n\nWe need NT4 to produce 't3' and NT8 to produce 't4'.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n... etc.\n\nWait, do any of these produce 't3'? Let's see NT4's rules. I don't see 't3' being produced directly by NT4. So NT4 might not directly produce 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, for S \u2192 NT1 NT2:\n\nWe'd need NT1 to produce 't3' and NT2 to produce 't4'. Looking at NT1's rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT6\nNT1 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n... Wait, so NT1's rules don't produce 't3' directly. They all seem to produce combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nWhat about S \u2192 NT4 NT8:\n\nNT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or via a more complex derivation. Similarly, NT8's rules:\n\nLooking at NT8, it has multiple production rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6'\nNT8 \u2192 't3'\nNT8 \u2192 't0'\nNT8 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, that's four rules where NT8 can produce 't6', 't3', 't0', or 't5'. So if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then if NT4 could produce 't3' and NT8 could produce 't4'... but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT4 \u2192 't3'. So that won't work.\n\nWhat about S \u2192 NT4 NT11:\n\nIn that case, NT4 needs to produce 't3' and NT11 to produce 't4'. But again, NT4 doesn't directly produce 't3'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the S rule S \u2192 NT1 NT2 can be used, with NT1 producing 't3' and NT2 producing 't4'.\n\nLooking again at NT2's rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2' (a direct production)\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT1\nBut the only direct terminal is 't2'.\n\nSo NT2 cannot produce 't4' directly, so that path won't work.\n\nWait, but is there any other way? Let me think. Maybe the string can't be derived from S because the production rules don't allow for two terminals in S's immediate expansions.\n\nWait, S's productions are all to two non-terminals, so the string would have to consist of the concatenation of two such non-terminals each producing a terminal. But the given string is 't3 t4'\u2014only two terminals. So the only way is if S directly produces 't3 t4', but looking at S's rules, none of them produce two terminals. All S rules produce two non-terminals. \n\nTherefore, unless some of those non-terminals can be further derived into two terminals, but wait, the immediate productions from S are all to two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals may then produce two more, but that would result in four terminals.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought S could produce two non-terminals, each of which may derive into a terminal in one step. But looking at the definitions, I don't see NT4 or NT8 or any other direct production that produce 't3' or 't4'. So perhaps it's impossible.\n\nWait, did I miss any rules? Let me double-check the NT13 and NT9 rules.\n\nLooking at NT13, it has a rule NT13 \u2192 't4', so that directly produces 't4' from NT13. So if S could produce NT13 and something else that produces 't3', then the string would be possible. But looking at the S rules, none have NT13 except in S \u2192 NT11 NT13, etc. Let me see:\n\nCheck S's rules for NT13:\n\nLooking through S production rules, I see that none directly contain NT13 except in:\n\nS \u2192 NT11 NT13\nS \u2192 NT0 NT13\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT11 NT13. If NT11 can produce 't3' and NT13 can produce 't4', that would make the string 't3 t4'. But do NT11 and NT13 produce 't3' and 't4' respectively?\n\nNT11's rules: NT11 \u2192 't1', and others like NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11 or NT11 \u2192 NT12 NT9 or NT11 \u2192 NT9 NT7. So NT11 can eventually produce 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-40","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if the string \"t8 t7 t4\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Honestly, this looks a bit intimidating at first, especially because the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals and production rules. But I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow that structure, which is good because it might be easier to parse the string according to these rules.\n\nLooking at the string \"t8 t7 t4\", it's a sequence of three terminals. My goal is to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals through these productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S has several productions: S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, and S -> NT1 NT2. So, my first thought is that the string must start with either \"t8 t8\", \"t4 t4\", or \"t1 t2\", depending on which production we take. But wait, t8 is the third token in our string, so I need to see if any of these can lead to the entire string.\n\nLet me consider each possible starting production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8: This would result in t4 followed by something from NT8. Our string starts with t8, so this can't be the first production because it would start with t4, not t8. So this production might not be relevant unless there's an indirect way to get t8 from elsewhere.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11: This would give t4 followed by something from NT11. But the string starts with t8, so again, this might not be the right path.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2: This would result in t1 followed by t2. But our string starts with t8, so this direct path also doesn't seem to fit.\n\nHmm, that suggests that none of the direct starting productions start with t8. So maybe the start symbol S doesn't directly produce t8 as the first symbol. That would mean that to get t8, it must be produced by one of the non-terminals that S can expand into.\n\nLooking back, perhaps S produces NT1 NT2, which then each can expand into other non-terminals or terminals. Maybe NT1 can produce t8 through a chain of productions.\n\nSo, let's see what NT1 can produce. From the grammar, NT1 has the production NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. So NT1 can expand into another non-terminal chain, which then might produce t8. Let's see where NT9 and NT13 go.\n\nNT9 has production NT9 \u2192 't0', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT13 has several productions: one that becomes 't2', another that becomes 't6', and another that becomes 't4'. So from NT13, we could get t2, t6, or t4.\n\nWait, but our string has t8 first, so I need to find a path where a NT1 expands to something that produces t8. Let me check the rules for NT1.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. So from NT1, we go to NT9 and NT13. NT9 is a terminal 't0', and NT13 can produce 't2', 't6', or 't4'. So that path would only give us combinations like t0 t2, t0 t6, t0 t4, but not t8 directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check other non-terminals that might produce t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT4 has productions to 't0', 't5', 't7', etc., but not directly t8. Let me look for non-terminals that can produce t8 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the NT entries, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't0', 't3', 't5', 't6', etc. So NT8 can produce 't0', but when does it produce t8? Wait, looking again, I think I might have mixed up the NT names. Let me scan all the rules where a NT produces a terminal.\n\nAh, here's a list of NT productions ending with terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7', NT5 \u2192 't0', NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', NT8 \u2192 't0', 't3', 't5', 't6', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT10 \u2192 't1', 't3', NT11 \u2192 't3', NT12 \u2192 't4', NT13 \u2192 't2', 't6', 't4'.\n\nWait, so I don't see any NT producing 't8' as a terminal. That's a problem because our string has t8. That suggests that t8 might not be in the language because no NT directly produces 't8'. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the NT8 rules are in the grammar. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and so on. Let me check again for any NT that produces 't8' as a terminal. Hmm, I don't see any NT's production that outputs 't8' directly. All the NT's only produce terminals like 't0', 't1', 't2', etc., but 't8' doesn't appear as a terminal in any of the NT productions.\n\nWait, maybe my initial analysis was wrong. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at the list, none of the NT rules have a production ending with 't8'. The only NT that might consider 't8' is if some intermediate rule produces it. But from the given rules, I don't see any NT rule producing 't8'. So that would mean that 't8' is not a terminal in this grammar. So the string \"t8 t7 t4\" would not be in the language because the grammar can't produce 't8' as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, let me look through all the NT \u2192 a (terminal) rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0', 't3', 't5', 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1', 't3'\n- NT11 \u2192 't3'\n- NT12 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't6', 't4'\n\nHmm, indeed, there's no rule that has NT8 producing 't8' as a terminal. So if the string starts with 't8', it's impossible because the grammar can't produce 't8' directly or through any sequence.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing any indirect way through a production. But since all the NT's terminal productions only lead to 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't10', there's no way to get 't8'. Therefore, the string \"t8 t7 t4\" cannot be generated by this grammar because 't8' isn't a terminal in the grammar at all.\n\nSo, the answer is No, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-62","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string \"t1 t9 t10 t2\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a series of production rules for various non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) that eventually lead to terminal symbols (like 't1', 't9', etc.).\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the starting symbol, which is S. Looking at the production rules for S, there are three options:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, from S, the next step is to choose one of these three options. Let me see which of these can lead to the string \"t1 t9 t10 t2\".\n\nThe string has four terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production rule on the left side is a non-terminal, and each rule on the right side has two symbols. So, the length of the string and the number of steps needed to derive it can be determined by counting the symbols.\n\nThe string has four t's, so it must have been derived using three production steps because each step adds one terminal (since each rule has two symbols, each step can produce up to two terminals, but here we have four, which is two steps, wait, no, let me think again). Wait, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. Each terminal contributes to the final string, so the number of terminals is two times the number of productions, but since S produces two symbols initially, which could be non-terminals, each of those may produce two more, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the derivation. The number of symbols in the string is four. Starting from S (which produces two symbols), each step can either produce more symbols or replace non-terminals.\n\nThe length of the string is four, starting from S, which is two symbols. To get four, each of the two symbols from S must derive into two symbols each, meaning two production steps.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to see each step increases the number of symbols by one, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each production rule produces exactly two symbols, the number of symbols can be calculated as follows: starting with S (1 symbol), each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the count increases by one each time a non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: S->NT4 NT8, which is two symbols. So the initial expansion is two. To get four, each of these two NT4 and NT8 must be expanded into two symbols each.\n\nSo, each of them must be terminal or non-terminal? If NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals, each would need to be expanded once.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to try to find a derivation path.\n\nLet's consider each possible starting rule:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n\nSo, the string must be t1 t9 t10 t2, which is four symbols. So from S, we have NT4 and NT8.\n\nSo, I need to see if NT4 can derive t1 t9 t10 (wait, no, four symbols would require each NT4 and NT8 to produce two each, but wait NT4 and NT8 would have to each produce two symbols, so the total would be four. So, NT4 -> two symbols, NT8 -> two symbols. Let me see if NT4 can produce 't1', 't9', 't10', 't2'.\n\nBut NT4 can be part of multiple production rules. Looking at the grammar, NT4 can be rewritten in several ways:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4:\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT0 NT4 (Wait, no, looking back at the provided rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT4: several rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT4:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT0 NT4?\nWait, no, in the provided rules, I think the first part is S's rules. Let me look for NT4.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, under NT4:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\nHmm, perhaps I misread. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of productions, each in the form X -> Y Z. Then, at the end, they listed some of the terminals as 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nSo, for example, looking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, no, looking again, the user provided a list. Let's see:\n\nLooking for 'NT4 -> ...':\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT14 -> 't3'\n\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n\n- NT10 -> 't6'\n\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n\n- NT10 -> 't3'\n\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n\n- NT11 -> 't3'\n\nSo, NT4 has three rules leading to terminals directly:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, so that's three options for NT4. That would mean that NT4 can directly match any of these terminals, but since we need to derive multiple symbols, we can't use all of them in a single step because we need to have combinations. So, each production must consist of exactly two symbols.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production on the left has exactly two non-terminals. So, the symbols NT4, NT8, etc., each derive into symbols until they become terminals.\n\nBut if one of them is a terminal, does that mean it only takes one step? For example, if NT4 can produce 't0' directly, then 't0' is a terminal.\n\nBut in our string, the terminals are t1, t9, t10, t2. So, let's see which of these NT4 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 can produce 't0' directly, or 't5' directly, or 't7' directly. None of these are t1, t9, t10, or t2. So, in the first step, S->NT4 NT8, which would produce, say, 't0' and something else. But our string starts with 't1', which is not t0, t5, or t7.\n\nSo, let me check if S can derive to something else.\n\nAlternative option 1: S->NT4 NT8\n\nLooking at the NT4 and NT8 productions. Since in the string, the first symbol is 't1', which isn't t0, t5, or t7. So perhaps this option can't be used, because NT4 can't produce 't1' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. So, perhaps I need to see if there's a way for NT4 and NT8 to produce more non-terminals that eventually derive to t1, t9, etc.\n\nAlternatively, option 2: S-> NT4 NT11.\n\nThen, NT4 and NT11. But again, NT4 can't produce t1, so NT4 would need to produce 't1' either directly or through some derivation. But NT4's rules are 't0', 't5', and 't7', and also perhaps some rules to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at NT4's rules, besides the terminal ones, do they have production rules to other non-terminals?\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, NT4's production rules are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n\nSo, NT4 cannot produce any non-terminals further. So, any path through S->NT4... would immediately lead to 't0's, 't5's, or 't7's, which are not present in the desired string.\n\nTherefore, option 1 and 2 for S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, which has several productions:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the very first step is to see which production to use. Since the string starts with \"t7 t10 t2 t2\", I need to see if any of the initial symbols can derive \"t7\" followed by \"t10\". Looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly expand into terminal symbols. For example, NT3 -> 't2', NT5 -> 't0', etc.\n\nWait, let me see. The initial productions from S all have two non-terminals. So I need to find a way to get \"t7\" from the first NT. Let's see which NT can produce \"t7\".\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT7 has some rules. Let me check:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\nNT11 -> NT3 NT11\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\nAnd others...

That's strange. Let me check if any NT produces 't7'. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0' or 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2' or other combinations\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n\nWhoa, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't7'.

Let me see if any NT can produce 't7' indirectly.\n\nLooking again at the rules for NT7:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\nBut NT9 is 't0', so NT7 can produce 't0' followed by something. Which doesn't help with 't7'.\n\nWhat about NT11? It's NT3 NT11, and NT3 is 't2'. So NT11 starts with 't2' and then more NT11. Hmm, but the start symbol is S, which breaks into NT4 or NT11 or NT2.\n\nWait a minute. If S starts with NT4 or NT11, let's see:\n\nIf S uses S -> NT4 NT8, then we look at NT4. NT4 can be 't0' or 't5'. But the string starts with 't7', which none of these produce. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if S uses S -> NT11, then NT11 can be NT3 NT11. NT3 is 't2', so the first part would be 't2', but the string starts with 't7'. So that's also a problem.\n\nWait, looking at the initial symbols, none of the NTs derive 't7' as the first symbol. So does that mean that the first 't7' in the string can't be generated by any production? That would imply the string is not part of the language.\n\nBut that seems too quick. Let me make sure I'm not missing any rules that might produce 't7'. Let me review all the NT productions to see if any of them can lead to 't7'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT2 -> 't2' or other things, but no 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't0' or 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't0' (from NT7's production)\nWait, no, there's a direct rule?

{"custom_id":"request-82","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t8 t9 t5 t1 t4\" is generated by the given CFG in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in Chomsky normal form has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side consists of either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see a bunch of production rules. Some are like S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, and so on. Others are terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't5', which I think mean the non-terminals NT3, NT4, etc., produce specific terminal strings.\n\nThe string to check is \"t8 t9 t5 t1 t4\". Since it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, I can think of it as the string: t8 t9 t5 t1 t4, which is \"t8 t9 t5 t1 t4\".\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the start symbol is S, I should see if S can produce this string.\n\nLet me list the production rules for S:\n\nS can be:\n\n1. NT4 NT8\n2. NT4 NT11\n3. NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the string starts with either NT4 and NT8, NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nThe given string starts with t8. So, let's look into the production rules that can produce t8.\n\nLooking for where a terminal like t8 appears. In the rules, NT8 can produce 't0' or 't5'. Wait, no, NT8 has rules like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3 and others. Wait, let's check the individual production rules.\n\nLooking at NT8, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nWait, but none of these directly produce t8. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check again. Are there any production rules that directly produce t8? In the production rules, do any NT symbols directly produce t8?\n\nLooking at the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't8'. Wait, but wait. In the production rules, maybe it's via a different path.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t8. So, to have t8 as the first symbol, there must be a rule that produces t8.\n\nLooking again, in the production rules:\n\n- NT8 has NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which would lead to t6 or t3, but I don't see NT8 directly producing t8. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 t10, and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me list the production rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT0 has a rule \u2192 't10'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4'\n- NT12 \u2192 't4'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't6'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't7' (wait, NT7 has a rule NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which might allow recursive production of sequences that end in t7 or t0)\n- NT11 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 has a few rules but none directly produce t8.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT11 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which eventually resolve to 't0' and 't7'. NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which would produce 't6' and 't3', which are t6 and t3. But perhaps there's a way to produce t8 from some combination.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t8, and the entire string is \"t8 t9 t5 t1 t4\". That would require the first symbol to be t8, but looking at the production rules for S, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which would generate two symbols, the first being whichever NT4 produces, and the second being whatever NT8 produces.\n\nWait, but looking at the production rules for NT4: NT4 can produce 't0', 't5'. So, if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first symbol is t0 or t5, but the string starts with t8. So, perhaps that production isn't the way to start.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Let's see: NT1 can produce 't8', and NT2 can produce 't2', 't5', etc. So if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the first symbol is 't8' (from NT1), and the second is something from NT2. But let's see: the string starts with t8, followed by t9. So, the production could be S \u2192 NT1 NT2, where NT1 \u2192 t8 and NT2 \u2192 t9. But do we have a rule that allows NT2 \u2192 t9? Looking at NT2's rules:\n\nWait, in the list, NT2 has:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5\n- WT2 \u2192 NT2 NT5\nWait, actually, looking back, I think I miscounted the NT2 rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT2 has:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4\n\nSo, NT2 can produce 't2' directly, 't5' directly, or through combinations. So, can NT2 produce 't9'? Wait, let's check.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a table of each NT and their possible derivations.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nWe need the string to start with t8, so looking for a production where the first symbol is t8.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce t0 or t5. So, NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5. Thus, any production via NT4 would start with t0 or t5, not t8. Therefore, the only possibility for starting with t8 is through NT1 \u2192 t8, because NT1 \u2192 t8 is a rule.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then NT1 can produce t8, and NT2 can produce the next symbols.\n\nSo, the string starts with t8, then t9, t5, t1, t4.\n\nLet me see what happens if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and then NT1 \u2192 t8, and NT2 \u2192 somehow produce t9 t5 t1 t4.\n\nBut wait, NT2's rules: let's see, from the production rules, NT2 can produce 't2', 't5', or combine via NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4, which allows recursion, but in this case, NT2 needs to produce t9, which is a terminal, so I need to see if NT2 can directly produce t9.\n\nLooking through NT2's rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4\nWait, no 't9' in NT2's rules. So how do we get t9?\n\nWait, maybe I have this wrong. Let me check the production rules again. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule for NT2 that includes t9.\n\nWait, let me re-examine all the rules:\n\nLooking through each rule, I don't see NT2 \u2192 t9. Instead, looking at NT9's rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0', NT9 \u2192 what else? Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't0', so NT9 produces t0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, how does the string get t9? The string is t8 t9 t5 t1 t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the production rules for other non-terminals.\n\nLet me check NT9's production rules. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, I think I should list all production rules systematically:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nFor NT1:\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n\nFor NT2:\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4\n\nWait, that's it.

{"custom_id":"request-83","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t1 t6 t8 t9 t0`. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice that all rules either have two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So that's good.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the string: `t1 t6 t8 t9 t0`. Each 't' is a terminal, so each of these must be produced directly by the grammar without further non-terminals. I'll check each terminal in the string against the productions to see if they exist.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\n- t1: Is there a rule for NT1 producing t1? Checking the list of terminals in the grammar, I see NT1 -> 't1'. Okay, so that's good.\n- t6: Checking the rules, there's NT6 -> 't9'. Hmm, that's 't9' not 't6'. Wait, but in terminals, I don't see NT6 -> 't6' directly. Or do I? Let me double-check. Oh, I see NT10 -> 't6'. That's 't6', so t6 can be generated. Good.\n- t8: Let's see. The rules include NT8 -> 't0', so t8 can produce 't0', which is allowed, but does it have a direct production for t8? Looking at the rules, it seems NT8 isn't directly converting to a terminal. Instead, it's producing combinations of non-terminals. Wait, but in the string, it's t8, so perhaps the grammar allows for that. I might need to check if t8 can be a terminal somehow.\nWell, let's think differently. Maybe t8 can be part of a chain of productions. Alternatively, perhaps t8 is not present as a terminal, but the string has t8, so the grammar must produce t8 as a terminal. Let me check if any rule on the NT8 side produces t8. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT8 -> t8, but maybe through some other productions. That's a problem because if t8 isn't a terminal, then the string can't be generated. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. The rules for NT8: I see NT8 -> NT6 NT3 in some places. That doesn't produce a terminal. Also, NT8 -> NT5 NT2 and NT8 -> NT1 NT5. So it seems NT8 doesn't directly produce t8. But is there a way that NT8 can produce t8 through another rule? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Since the string has t8, the grammar must have a production that allows it. Otherwise, the string can't be generated. Hmm.\n\nI think I might have missed something. Let me search again. Looking through the rules, I see NT2 has some 't's. For example, NT2 -> 't2', 't5', etc. But for t8, I don't see any rule directly. So perhaps the grammar doesn't have a production for t8, which would mean the string can't be generated. But wait, maybe through other rules. Let's track possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps t8 can be generated indirectly. For example, maybe NT8 can produce a combination that includes NT9 or other non-terminals which can eventually lead to t8. Let me try to find a path:\n\nNT8 can produce NT6 NT3. NT6 produces 't9'. NT3 has several rules. Let me check NT3: NT3 -> NT7 NT1, etc. Is there a way to get to t8?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Perhaps I should think in terms of the entire string and see if each terminal can be matched step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to build the parse tree. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a sequence of productions that can generate this string.\n\nLet me break down the string: t1, t6, t8, t9, t0.\n\nFirst, the string has 't1', so the starting symbol S must derive a sequence that includes 't1' somewhere.\n\nLooking at the productions for S: S -> NT4 NT8, etc. So S is followed by two non-terminals, both of which may produce sequences of terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a top-down approach isn't the easiest. Maybe a bottom-up approach could help, but I'm not very familiar with that method. Alternatively, I could try to see if the string can be generated by each part.\n\nLet me start by considering the last symbol, t0. I see that NT0 can produce t10 or t4, but wait, no, looking at the rules, NT0 has several options, like NT0 -> NT14 NT13, etc., but also, earlier I noticed NT13 can produce t2, t4, etc. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me look at each terminal in the string and see if they can be produced.\n\n1. 't1' is from NT1 -> 't1'.\n2. 't6' is from NT10 -> 't6'.\n3. 't8' - I'm stuck here because I don't see NT8 directly leading to t8. Let me re-examine the rules for NT8. Looking through the rules, none of them have NT8 -> t8. So that's a problem because the string has t8, which must be produced by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way for NT8 to be part of a chain that eventually leads to t8. Let me see: Maybe NT8 can produce NT6 NT3. NT6 is 't9', and NT3 can produce various things. For example, NT3 has a rule NT3 -> NT7 NT1. NT7 can produce NT9 NT7, which in turn can go to t0, t10, etc. It's getting complicated, and I'm not seeing a direct path for t8 to appear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that certain terminals are only produced by specific non-terminals. If NT8 doesn't have a production that includes t8, then the string can't contain t8. So maybe this means the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure because perhaps there's a chain where NT8 indirectly leads to t8. But in the given rules, I don't see any path that would allow NT8 to eventually produce t8.\n\nPutting it all together, since one of the symbols in the string is t8, and the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT8 -> t8, I think the string can't be generated.

Alternatively, perhaps S is supposed to generate two NTs, each of which then produce more symbols. But wait, the given S rules in the user's message are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4\n\nS -> NT8 NT8\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, that can't be, because S is producing a pair of non-terminals each time. But the string to check is six symbols, which would require three production steps from S, each expanding to two symbols. So, perhaps the initial S rules are correct, and each S produces two NTs, which themselves expand.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the initial S rules in the user's message may have been cut inaccurately. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote more clearly: the first lines start with S followed by two NTs. Let's make sure.\n\nLooking again, the user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4\n\nS -> NT8 NT8\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because NT1 could expand to more NTs. But given the structure, perhaps the correct S rules are S \u2192 NT1 NT2, while others might be irrelevant or perhaps a typo. Hmm, but the way it's written, the initial S rules may produce a terminal, but perhaps the user meant that S has different rules, e.g., S could be NT2 NT8 or similar, but regardless, the key is to model the derivation tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S is only S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and others are irrelevant or part of more complex rules. Maybe the user mistyped, but perhaps, in any case, let's proceed.\n\nAssuming S is the top symbol and starts a derivation. The string is \"t0 t4 t10 t8 t6 t9\", which is six symbols, so it would require three expansions from S, each time generating pairs that contribute to the string.\n\nWait, for example, if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then each NT would produce a string. But let's see the possible expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a parse tree where the start is S, then S splits into two NTs, each of which can further split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S rule is S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and each NT in that splits further. Let's explore.\n\nWait, considering that, let's model the leftmost derivation.\n\nThe string is t0 t4 t10 t8 t6 t9, which is six symbols, so I think each expansion step is adding two symbols each time, so three steps from S.\n\nLet me see possible leftmost derivations:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, symbols so far: NT1 NT2\n\nStep 2: Let's see what NT1 and NT2 expand to.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n\nSo NT1 expands to NT9 NT13.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 depends on the rule NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some NT definitions.\n\nWait, the actual NT2 rule in the provided grammar is:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n\nWait, that can't be, because according to the given rules, I see multiple NT2 rules. Wait, no, actually, in the user's grammar, NT2 is defined as:\n\nLooking back, in the user's grammar, line 13:\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\n\nHmm, but earlier, it's also written:\n\nNT2 -> NT2 NT4\nNT2 -> NT5 NT1\n\nWait, perhaps they're conflicting, but generally, each NT can have multiple productions.

{"custom_id":"request-103","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t9 t6 t7 t8 t3 t4`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CFGs in CNF have production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The terminals are leaf nodes. The given grammar has many non-terminals (NT1, NT2, etc.) and some terminals like 't0' to 't9' and other strings like 't13', 't14', etc.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, some of them directly produce single terminals. For example:\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT7 \u2192 't7'\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nSo, terminals are 't0' to 't14' and some multi-symbol ones like 't13' and 't14'. Wait, actually, looking closer, some NT production rules have two terminals. For example, NT13 \u2192 't5' 't12' is not correct because in the given grammar, NT13 has multiple productions like NT13\u2192't2', 't4', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, the terminals are sometimes single and others might be combinations. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that consist of two terminals. For example, NT11 \u2192 't3' 't11'. Wait, but that's a problem because 't11' is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Looking at the grammar, 't11' isn't part of it\u2014it's just 't3' and 't11'. Wait, but 't11' isn't defined, so perhaps this is a mistake. Or maybe it's 't1' and 't1'? Wait, perhaps 't11' is a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal symbols present. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT7 \u2192 't7'\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6' (I think)\nWait, the grammar has NT13 \u2192 NT6 't12' and NT13 \u2192 't6', 't10', 't4'. Hmm, that's confusing because 't12' might be a terminal or NT. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking deeper, I see:\nNT13 \u2192 NT6 't12' (so NT13 \u2192 NT6 't12')\nWait, but NT12 has some productions. For example, NT12 \u2192 NT8 't4' and NT12 \u2192 't8', 't4', etc. So 't12' is a terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently.\n\nThe string to analyze is `t9 t6 t7 t8 t3 t4`. It's a sequence of six terminals. Let's see how this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe grammar has S as the start symbol. S initially branches into several options, but all eventually lead through a series of non-terminals until terminals are reached.\n\nTo generate the string, we'll need to trace the derivation steps from S to the string.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string length: 6 terminals. Each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, so the derivation will have a tree structure, and the number of steps is roughly n-1 for a string of length n. So for 6 terms, we need 5 splits.\n\nBut the actual steps depend on the grammar structure. Since this is a tree, it's a bit involved, but maybe we can think in reverse: start from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't4'. Looking at the grammar, 't4' appears in NT4 \u2192 't4' (from S's productions, like S\u2192NT4 NT8, which branches into 't4' and whatever else).\n\nSimilarly, the symbol before 't4' is 't3', then 't8', 't7', 't6', and finally 't9'.\n\nWait, string is t9, t6, t7, t8, t3, t4.\n\nLet me list them in reverse order to see if I can find a leftmost or rightmost reduction.\n\nStarting with the last symbol 't4', it can be generated by NT4 \u2192 't4' or perhaps another production. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT4, the productions are:\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 't7'\nNT4 \u2192 't4'\nSo 't4' can be generated directly, or from NT14 \u2192 't7' and then maybe other steps.\n\nWait, but in the string, 't4' is the last symbol, so maybe the last production is S\u2192... leading to 't4'. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about each symbol and how it can be generated.\n\nLooking at 't9': From the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo 't9' must come from NT9. Now, where in the string is 't9'? It's the first symbol. So in the first position, 't9' must be generated. So we need a production that eventually produces 't9' in the first step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which branches into NT4 NT8, etc. Let's see which options can start with 't9'.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8: Starting with NT4 and NT8. So let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nStarting with 't9', which is generated by NT9. So for the first production, S \u2192 NT4 NT8: NT4 and NT8.\n\nBut to get 't9' from NT4, we need NT4 to produce a symbol that can start with 't9'. Wait, but NT4's initial productions are NT14 't7' or 't4' directly. So NT4 doesn't start with 't9'. Therefore, 't9' cannot come from NT4.\n\nSo the other option for S is S \u2192 NT1 NT2: So NT1 and NT2. Now, NT1's terminal productions include 't8' and others.\n\nAlternatively, another S production is S \u2192 NT6 NT3, which might include 't9' if NT6 or NT3 can produce that.\n\nWait, checking NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11. So NT6 can produce two non-terminals. NT9 is 't9', so in that case, 't9' would come from NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11. So 't9' could come as the first symbol if the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT3 or S \u2192 NT6 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let's take the first symbol, 't9' must come from some NT that can directly produce 't9'. The only such NT is NT9, which has a production NT9 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is 't9', so we must have a production where one of the non-terminals in the current step produces 't9'. Therefore, one of the steps in the derivation must have a non-terminal that is NT9, which directly becomes 't9'.\n\nGiven that, let's assume that in the first step, we have S \u2192 NT9 something, but looking at the given S productions, do any of them have NT9 as a part?\n\nLooking at the given S productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8: No\nS \u2192 NT5 NT11: No\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2: No\nOthers: S \u2192 NT10, etc. So none of the S productions directly produce NT9 as a component. Instead, NT9 is derived from other non-terminals. So we must have S \u2192 a production that eventually leads to NT9.\n\nAh, S \u2192 NT10 NT1: Let's check. NT10 might produce 't1' or some other symbol. But NT10 also has a production NT0 \u2192 't10' which could lead to something.\n\nWait, perhaps a more systematic approach: let's try to find the possible paths that can generate the string.\n\nThe string is t9 t6 t7 t8 t3 t4.\n\nI'll try to work from the start symbol S and see if I can build a derivation tree that matches the string.\n\nLet me first see which S productions can start with 't9'. Looking at all possible S productions, none have NT9 directly as a component.

{"custom_id":"request-119","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string `t1 t7 t7 t1 t10 t3 t4` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two symbols on the right (which can be non-terminals or terminals). This makes parsing potentially easier using algorithms like CYK.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which has three productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT10\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with the concatenation of two non-terminals from these options. Looking at the string, the first symbol is `t1`, which is a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals can derive `t1`. From the grammar, I see that NT1 can derive `t1` via NT1 \u2192 't1' (I think, but I need to check the rules). Wait, looking through the rules, I see that NT1 has several productions ending in terminals, like NT1 \u2192 't8', NT1 \u2192 't10', and so on. So NT1 can produce `t1` as one of its options.\n\nBut wait, S's first option is NT4 and NT8, both of which are non-terminals. Let me check if NT4 can derive `t1`. Looking at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', or 't7'. So NT4 can produce `t4` if it produces 't4'? Wait, no, NT4's productions are:\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo NT4 can't directly produce `t1`. The only way to produce `t1` is through NT1. So the first step would be to start with S \u2192 NT1 NT2 or another production that leads to `t1`. But S's production options don't directly lead to `t1` as the first symbol, because the first option is NT4 and NT8, which can lead to 't0', 't5', 't7', which are all different from `t1`.\n\nWait a minute, did I miss anything? Let me double-check the S productions. S can be NT4 NT8, which would produce whatever NT4 and NT8 can generate. Since NT4 can't produce `t1`, but NT8 can produce `t6`, `t3`, `t0`, etc. Hmm. Alternatively, S could be NT1 NT2, which if NT1 can produce `t1`, and NT2 can produce, say, `t7`, then the first part could be `t1 t7`. Wait, but the string starts with `t1 t7`, so maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is the path we should take.\n\nWait, no\u2014S \u2192 NT1 NT2 would produce NT1's symbol followed by NT2's symbol, which could start with `t1` from NT1, but NT2 can produce `t2`, `t5`, etc. Let me look again. The string is `t1 t7 t7 t1 t10 t3 t4`. The first two symbols are `t1 t7`. So, if S is broken into NT1 and NT2, then NT1 \u2192 `t1` and NT2 \u2192 `t7`. Let me check if NT2 can produce `t7`.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions: NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, etc. Wait, that might not be right. Let me list out all rules for NT2 to see:\n\nNT2:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0 (Wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake. The user's grammar has several lines, so I need to list all NT2 productions correctly. Let me scan the grammar again:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n\nSo, yes, NT2 can produce NT0, NT5, NT7, etc. But wait, to produce `t7`, NT2 needs to derive to a terminal. So looking for a production in NT2 that leads directly to `t7`. Scanning the rules, I don't see any direct production for NT2 that ends with `t7`. Instead, NT2 seems to have productions that only combine non-terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2, which would produce `t7` followed by something else perhaps.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is `t1`, which comes from NT1 \u2192 't1'. Then, the second symbol is `t7`, which must come from NT2's production. But if NT2 can't directly produce `t7`, perhaps through other non-terminals that can derive `t7`. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong S production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two symbols `t1 t7` come from a different S production. Let me consider if S \u2192 NT1 NT2 can lead to `t1 t7` by having NT1 produce `t1` and NT2 produce `t7` via some derivation.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, none of NT2's productions directly produce a terminal of `t7`. The terminals are things like 't0', 't1', etc., but for NT2, I see that NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT7 has some productions. Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n\nWait, none of these directly produce `t7`. They all lead to combinations of non-terminals. So if NT2 can't produce `t7` directly, how can the second symbol be `t7`?\n\nThis suggests that maybe S can't produce this string because after NT1 (which gives `t1`), NT2 can't produce `t7` through any derivation, given the current rules. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a production where NT2 can derive to `t7`.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, I see this rule:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nWait, actually, let me check again. Looking through all the grammar rules, for NT2, I don't see any direct production that ends in `t7`. So maybe it's impossible for NT2 to produce `t7` because all its productions are combinations of non-terminals. That would mean that the second symbol `t7` can't come from NT2. So the entire string can't be produced by S \u2192 NT1 NT2, because NT2 can't reach `t7` as a terminal.\n\nLet me check the other options for S's initial productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8: NT4 can only produce 't0', 't5', 't7'; NT8 can produce 't0', 't6', 't3', etc. The first symbol is `t1`, so even if NT4 could produce something leading to `t1`, but from the rules, NT4 can't; it only produces terminals like 't0', 't5', 't7'. So NT4 can't derive `t1`. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8 can't produce the first symbol `t1`.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT10: So the first two symbols would be NT1 followed by NT10. NT1 can produce `t1`, so that's possible. But the second symbol in the string is `t7`, so NT10 would need to produce `t7`.

{"custom_id":"request-126","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string `t4 t2 t2 t10 t9 t7 t1` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string structure.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5. But looking at the grammar, it seems to have more complex productions, possibly with multiple non-terminals on the left side. Wait, actually, some of the productions have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left. That fits CNF.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminals: t4, t2, t2, t10, t9, t7, t1. Each of these corresponds to specific non-terminals in the grammar, as per the rightmost terminals in the productions. For example, NT3 \u2192 't5', so when a non-terminal is expanded, it can produce a specific terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. So I'll start from S and see how I can derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the starting production, S can go to NT4 NT8, or NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's see which of these can help us reach our string.\n\nLet's try the first option: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then each of NT4 and NT8 needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT4\u2019s productions:\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT4 produces NT14 NT7, and also sometimes NT4 is on the left with other options, like NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5'. So NT4 can directly produce t4, t5, or be split into two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has productions like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, and others. It can also directly produce t8 or t0 or others.\n\nWait, maybe I should map out the possible terminal sequences each non-terminal can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t5\nNT2 \u2192 t2 via some rules, but looking at the grammar, NT2 can have productions like NT11 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8. But perhaps it's easier to think about each NT's possible terminal productions.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, many NTS have productions that eventually lead to specific terminals. For example, NT13 has two productions: NT13 \u2192 t2 and NT13 \u2192 t4? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are given, so I should list the productions for each NT and see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking at each NT and their productions:\n\nNT1: produces t8 via NT9 NT13 and t1 via NT13 't1', but directly, in the rules, NT13 doesn't directly go to t1, but let's see.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to list all the NTs and their possible direct terminal productions:\n\nNT0: some productions go to t10, t4, t10, etc. Specifically, NT0 has rules that produce t10, t4, t13, maybe others.\n\nWait, let's go through each NT and see which terminals they can produce directly:\n\n- NT0: has rules like 't10', 't4', 't10' etc. So NT0 \u2192 't0' (via some rule), 't4', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking for any rule where NTs produce terminals directly:\n\nNT13 has two rules: NT13 \u2192 't2' and NT13 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, wait, looking again:\n\nIn the given grammar, there are several rules that produce terminals. For example, NT13 has \u2192 't4' as a production. Similarly, NT13 has \u2192 't2' via NT9 NT7. Wait, no, that's a production for another NT.\n\nWait, let's go step by step:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules to find any rule where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\n1. NT3 \u2192 t5\n2. NT10 \u2192 t1 (via NT10)\n3. NT13 \u2192 t2\n4. NT13 \u2192 t4\n5. NT9 \u2192 t0\n6. NT7 \u2192 t0\n7. NT8 \u2192 t0\n\nSo these are the direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t5\n- NT10 \u2192 t1\n- NT13 \u2192 t2 or t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT8 \u2192 t0\n\nAdditionally, some NTS have other rules that split into non-terminals, but the main point is that these NTS can produce specific terminals.\n\nNow, the string we're trying to produce is `t4 t2 t2 t10 t9 t7 t1`. So let's break this down into the sequence of terminals and see if we can find the corresponding NTS.\n\nLet me reverse engineer this: starting from the string, we can try to find which non-terminals can generate these terminals in the correct order.\n\nThe string is t4, t2, t2, t10, t9, t7, t1.\n\nFirst, the last symbol is t1, which comes from NT10. Because NT10 \u2192 t1 (from the rule NT10 \u2192 't1'). So the string ends with t1, which must come from NT10.\n\nSo the last step would be NT10 \u2192 t1.\n\nBefore that, we have t7, which comes from NT7. Looking at the grammar, NT7 has some rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 has rules like:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT7 (Wait, no, in the given grammar, looking through the rules, I don't see NT7 \u2192 itself, so maybe it's part of a production tree).\n\nWait, the rules for NT7 are given as:\n\nLooking back, I see: NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 and NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, etc. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the rules for NT7 include:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nBut that's a recursive production, meaning it's an A \u2192 BC form where C is A itself. So NT7 can be expanded into NT9 NT7, but also has other options like NT11 NT6, etc. Wait, no, the rules are:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar as a sequence of lines; I need to make sure I'm reading them correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nSo NT7 can produce NT9 and then another NT7, recursively. So that would generate sequences of NT9 followed by multiple NT7s or whatever.\n\nBut in our case, after t7, we have t1. So the last two tokens are t7 and t1, but t1 comes from NT10, which is a terminal. Wait, but that would mean that t7 is the previous token, so before that, how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because in the string, the order is t4, t2, t2, t10, t9, t7, t1. So after t9, we have t7, then t1.\n\nWait, no, the string is `t4 t2 t2 t10 t9 t7 t1`. So in order, it's t4, then t2, then t2, then t10, then t9, then t7, then t1.\n\nWait, but that seems like the last step is t1 from NT10. So before t10, we have t7, which comes from NT7. So the substring before t10 is t7, which would be the result of expanding NT7 \u2192 t7, but wait, from the earlier analysis, NT7 has a direct production: from the rule NT7 \u2192 't0' (Wait, no). Wait, in the grammar, NT7 can be a non-terminal that can produce t0 via some rule.\n\nWait, looking again: From the grammar, do any of the NTS directly produce t7 as a terminal? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t2 or t4\n- NT10 \u2192 t1\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0 via NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7? No, that's a non-terminal production. Wait, no, wait, in the grammar, each production has either terminals or other non-terminals. So let's check:\n\nFor example, NT7: from the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 \u2014 that's a split into two non-terminals. Also, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 \u2014 split, and others. But looking for any direct production, like NT7 \u2192 't7' \u2014 I don't see such"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to check is `t1 t4 t2 t5 t10 t8 t3 t9`. The grammar is quite complex with multiple non-terminals and productions, so I need to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a context-free grammar is. It's a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a language. Each production has a single non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS) and a sequence of terminals or non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS). CNF is a specific form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that most rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, except for a few where terminals are present. For example, some NT* produce terminals like 't5', 't0', etc. So, this grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is `t1 t4 t2 t5 t10 t8 t3 t9`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by some series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either consumes a single terminal or combines two non-terminals. This structure can be systematically checked using something like the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break down the string step by step.\n\nLet me first map each terminal in the string to their corresponding production rules. Maybe that will help me see how they can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t1 t4 t2 t5 t10 t8 t3 t9.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\n- t1: Probably from NT10, since one of the rules is NT10 -> 't1'.\n- t4: Could come from NT4, NT2, or NT13 because NT4->t0, NT2->t5, etc., but need to check exact rules.\nWait, actually, looking at the rules: NT4 can produce t0, t5, and other combinations. Similarly, t4 might come from a production rule that has 't4' on the RHS. Wait, no, in the given rules, I don't see a direct production for 't4' except perhaps from NT4. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT4 has rules: S, NT4, etc., but its direct productions include NT14 NT7, and also, looking at the end, some NT4 rules like -> t0 or t5? Wait, at the end, the rules for NT4 include -> t0, t5, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to look at each NT and see which can directly produce t1, t4, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to first list all the terminal symbols and map each to their possible non-terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't10', 't4', 't6', 't11', etc.\nWait, no. Wait, let me see each rule where a terminal appears.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT10 has a rule that produces 't1' (e.g., NT10->'t1').\n- NT2 has rules that produce t5 (like NT2->t5, etc., but in the given rules, NT2 lines up to have NT2->'t5', wait, looking at the rules, some lines have NT2->'t2', others 't5' or 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look through the rules and see all the direct terminals produced:\n\n- NT1 -> 't8' (from line NT13 -> 't8')\nWait, no, looking at the rules, for example:\n\nLooking through all the 'a' symbols given:\n\n- NT10 -> 't1' (line NT10 -> 't1')\n- NT4's rules: I see NT4->t0 (from NT13 -> 't0')? Wait, no, need to parse each rule correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each production where the RHS is a terminal, ignoring non-terminals.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S has rules like NT11 NT8, but those are non-terminals, so the direct terminals come from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through all lines, the terminals mentioned are:\n\n- t1: from NT10\n- t4: from NT4? Wait, checking NT4 rules: do any of them have 't4' on RHS? No, looking through, NT4's rules seem to involve other non-terminals, no direct production of t4. Wait, checking line NT10->t1, NT9->t0, NT4\u2192t0, t5, etc. So maybe 't4' isn't directly produced by any NT. Hmm, that's a problem because the string has 't4', but if there's no production that directly outputs 't4', then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, wait, in the given string, the terminals are t1, t4, t2, t5, t10, t8, t3, t9.\n\nLet me check each terminal:\n\n- t1: from NT10\n- t4: check all rules to see if any production for NT* directly produce t4. Looking through each line:\n\nLine NT4 has rules like -> NT14 NT7, etc., and also, at the end: is there a production for NT4 that directly outputs 't4'? Looking back, the rules for NT4 include:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7,\nNT4 \u2192 t0,\nNT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo no, none of the NT4 rules directly produce 't4'. Therefore, since the string contains 't4', and there's no NT that can directly produce 't4', the string cannot be generated by this grammar. That's because in CNF, each step can only replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So if there's no production that outputs 't4', the string is impossible.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed a production.\n\nLooking at the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT10 has NT10->'t1', yes.\n- NT4: Does any production rule for NT4 have 't4'?

Line numbers may be off, but generally, NT4's rules are mixing non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nLooking through all possible lines, I don't see any production for NT4 that directly outputs a terminal other than 't0' and 't5'.

The string is `t0 t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6`, and the grammar is quite large with a bunch of production rules. Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules that either produce two terminals or one non-terminal. So each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that structure\u2014most rules are two symbols on the right, some are terminals.\n\nNow, I need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string starts with `t0`, and the grammar has several rules where S is derived from combinations of NTs leading to t's. Let's see the production rules for S.\n\nThe S rules are:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can derive into two NTs. The string starts with `t0`, so maybe the first step is to see where `t0` comes from. Looking at the NTs, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (among others)\n- NT2 \u2192 't2' (and other rules)\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't13', etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t0, so perhaps one of the NTs leading to S must produce a t0. Let's consider the possible derivations.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 and NT8 would need to produce t0 and something else. But looking at NT4, it can produce t0 directly. So maybe NT4 \u2192 t0 and NT8 \u2192 something.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT4 rules: NT4 can be 't0', 't5', or other combinations. So perhaps NT4 can be 't0', and NT8 would have to produce the remaining part of the string.\n\nLet's break down the string: `t0 t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6`.\n\nIf the first symbol is t0, and S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 would produce t0, and NT8 would have to produce the rest: `t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6`.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the string is 8 tokens long, so S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would mean the string is t0 followed by whatever NT8 produces. So let's see: NT8 can produce t0 or other things.\n\nLooking at NT8, the production rules are:\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t1 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 t13\n- NT8 \u2192 t0 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5 t4\n- NT8 \u2192 t4 t7\nWait, but the string after t0 is t1, t8, etc., so maybe NT8 is supposed to produce t1, t8, etc. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parsing problem. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a parsing algorithm like the CYK algorithm, which is designed for Chomsky normal form. But I don't remember the details of CYK, so maybe a better approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe string is: t0, t1, t8, t5, t4, t5, t10, t6.\n\nWe start with S, which can be split into two parts. From S's rules, S can split into NTs that produce t0 and the rest. Let's try S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so NT4 produces t0 and NT8 needs to produce the remaining symbols.\n\nSo NT4 gives t0, and NT8 is supposed to derive the rest: t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6. Let's look at NT8's rules. NT8 can be t6 t3, t1 t5, t6 t13, t0 t5, t5 t4, t4 t7. None of these directly produce t1, which is the next symbol. So that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So NT1 produces t8, and NT2 produces t0, t5, etc. Let me check NT1's rules: NT1 \u2192 t8, t13, t14, etc. Hmm, the next symbol is t1, so maybe NT1 doesn't help here.\n\nAnother possibility: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. NT4 can be t0, so we take t0, and then NT8 must produce the rest. Let's see if NT8 can be part of a derivation that creates t1 followed by other symbols.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules, maybe it can derive t1 t8... but let's see if that's possible. For example, NT8 could be t1 t5. But wait, the second symbol is t1, so if NT8 is t1 t5, then the next symbol is t1, which matches.\n\nSo after t0, we have t1, which would mean NT8 is t1, and then the next symbol is t8, but NT8 would need to produce another part. Wait, no\u2014NT8 is just a single symbol? No, NT8 is a non-terminal, so it can produce more symbols. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. The entire string must be derived from S. Starting with S, we pick a production rule. Let's try S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, NT4 must be t0, and NT8 must derive the rest: t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6.\n\nSo NT8 is the second part. Now, I need to see if NT8 can produce t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6. But looking at NT8's rules, each production is two symbols. So for example, if NT8 \u2192 t1 t5, then that's two symbols. But the rest of the string is t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6, which is 6 symbols. So maybe NT8 has to split into multiple productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction. The string is `t0 t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6`, which has 8 symbols. Since each step in the grammar can split a non-terminal into two, the number of symbols in the expansion of the start symbol must be a power of 2 plus 1. Wait, that's not quite right. For example, with 1 non-terminal, you can have 2 symbols. For each application, you add more symbols. So for n symbols, you might have k steps. Hmm, perhaps it's not necessary to worry about the number of symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parse tree will have a leftmost derivation where each step expands one non-terminal into two symbols. Let me try building a parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S. Since S can be NT4 NT8, let's take that. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, expand NT4. NT4 can be t0, so that gets us our first symbol. So we have T0, and now we need to expand NT8 to produce the remaining symbols: t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6.\n\nSo NT8 needs to derive `t1 t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6`. Now, NT8 can be split into two parts. Let's see if NT8 can be split into t1 and t8 t5 t4 t5 t10 t6, but wait, that's seven symbols. Hmm, no, NT8 can only split into pairs each time, so maybe it's more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT8 is part of a larger chain. Let me see the rules for NT8. NT8 can be:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 t1 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 t13\n- NT8 \u2192 t0 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5 t4\n- NT8 \u2192 t4 t7\n\nHmm, so options are t6 t3, t1 t5, t6 t13, t0 t5, t5 t4, t4 t7.\n\nThe second symbol in the string is t1. So perhaps NT8 could be t1 t5, which would give t1 and t5 as the next two symbols. That would match the first two symbols t0 t1, but wait, the first symbol is t0, then t1, then t8, etc. Wait, in our case, the first symbol is t0, so if we're expanding NT8, the next two symbols would have to be t1 and t8 or something else.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nCurrent derivation: S \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a bit extensive, so I need to make sure I cover all the rules. The start symbol is S, which can produce several combinations like NT4 and NT8, NT1 and NT2, etc. Each non-terminal eventually resolves to terminal symbols, which are various 't' with numbers.\n\nThe string to check is `t9 t3 t6 t6 t9 t1 t3 t1 t10`. Let's see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation, starting from S and expanding it step by step until I reach the string. Alternatively, maybe building a parse tree could help, but since it's a linear string, a derivation approach might be more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first step is to expand S into one of the possible NT combinations. Let's see what the options are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8, NT1 NT2, NT11 NT6 (Wait, no, looking back, I think S has three options: NT4 NT8, NT1 NT2, and NT11 NT6. Or did I misread? Wait, the grammar as given shows S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, S -> NT1 NT2, right? Because in the original it says S -> NT4 NT8, S->NT4 NT11, S->NT1 NT2.

The string I'm evaluating is `t8 t5 t5 t9 t3 t7 t6 t0 t3`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammar has productions where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step in the derivation can only expand one non-terminal into two symbols.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that there are several productions that directly result in terminals. For example, `NT3 -> 't5'`, `NT10 -> 't1'`, `NT13 -> 't4'`, etc. So, the plan is to start from the start symbol and see if I can derive the string by replacing non-terminals step by step until I get all terminals.\n\nThe start symbol in the grammar is `S`, which has three productions:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nI'll try each one and see which one can lead to the target string.\n\nOption 1: Using S -> NT4 NT8\nSo, S becomes NT4 NT8.

For option 1, S->NT4 NT8.\n\nSo S becomes NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, each of NT4 and NT8 can be expanded further. Let me choose one production for NT4 and one for NT8.\n\nFirst, for NT4: Let's pick one. Suppose we pick NT4 -> NT0 NT14.\n\nThen NT4 becomes NT0 NT14.\n\nSimilarly, for NT8, let's choose one production. Maybe NT8 -> NT6 NT3.\n\nSo now, the string after first step is NT0 NT14 NT6 NT3.\n\nWait, but that's not getting us closer to terminals yet. So I need to keep expanding.\n\nBut this approach seems tedious. Maybe it's better to try to find a possible derivation path step by step, checking if each part of the target string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more efficient, but since I'm just thinking through it, I'll try to see if there's a possible way.\n\nThe target string is `t8 t5 t5 t9 t3 t7 t6 t0 t3`.\n\nLet me try to see if this can be represented as a sequence of NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the end and see if it can be built from the start.\n\nAnother approach is to see what the target string can be split into.

Let's see what NT8 can produce:\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, which can directly produce 't8'?

The string is `t8 t3 t9 t7 t5 t3 t5 t5 t0 t2`. Hmm, CNF has certain properties: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I think that's what CNF is all about\u2014each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar and the string to see if they can match. The grammar starts with S, and each production eventually leads to terminals. Let me see the rules for S: S can produce NT4 NT8, or NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So S is the start symbol, and its right-hand sides consist of two non-terminals each. That aligns with CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t8, t3, t9, t7, t5, t3, t5, t5, t0, t2. So ten tokens in total. Since the grammar is in CNF, parse trees should be binary trees, meaning each node has two children. So the parse tree for this string should have a binary structure.\n\nLet me try to see how S can generate this string. Starting with S, the first step would be to expand S into one of its productions, say, NT4 NT8. So let's see: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, each of NT4 and NT8 can further be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules: From the grammar, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 't7', and NT4 can also go to 't4' but wait, looking back, the grammar for NT4 is S is producing NT4 NT8, and in NT4, the rules are S NT4 \u2192 ... Wait, what's the exact production for NT4?\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, in the list I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nWait, no, looking again: in the grammar provided, the NT4 rules are:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n\nIs that correct? Because in the initial list, I see lines like:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nThen also:\n\nNT3 -> 't5'\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT4 rules are:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLine 1: S-> NT4 NT4\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar starts with S-> NT4 NT8, S-> NT4 NT11, etc. So looking back, for NT4, the rules are:\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nWait, that's probably all for NT4. Did I miss others? Because in the initial list, I see NT4 -> NT14 NT7. Then looking for NT4 again, perhaps I didn't see others. Let me recheck:\n\nThe grammar lines are as follows:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\n\nS -> NT4 NT11\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nThen NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\n...\n\nLooking through more lines, I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nAnd also in another line:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nIs that correct? Or is there another NT4 rule? It seems so. So NT4 has two production rules: one that produces two non-terminals (NT14 and NT7) and two that produce terminals ('t0' and maybe another? Wait, looking further, there's NT4 -> 't7' and NT4 -> 't5'. Wait, does NT4 have three production rules?\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly:\n\nLooking at each line, each starts with a non-terminal and its production.\n\nSo for NT4, the rules are:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the initial list provided, the lines are:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Wait, no, the lines for NT4 are:\n\nNT4 appears on the left of multiple productions. Let's list them:\n\nLine 1: S-> NT4 NT8\n\nLine 2: S-> NT4 NT11\n\nLine 3: S-> NT1 NT2\n\nThen, for NT4, looking through the rest:\n\nLooking for lines starting with NT4:\n\nI think the lines are:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nWait, perhaps that's it.

{"custom_id":"request-185","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t6 t8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal string. So, all rules here should fit that structure. Looking at the grammar, most are, like S -> NT4 NT8, and eventually some terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't9', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: t6, t8, t7, t2, t9, t9, t9, t7, t5, t10. So, I need to see if we can derive this string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe approach is usually to start with the start symbol S and see if we can expand it into a string of terminals that matches the given string. But since the string is 10 tokens, and each production rule splits into two non-terminals, the derivation will require multiple steps. For a string of length n, the derivation tree should be a parse tree of depth roughly log n, but since this is a leftmost or rightmost derivation, maybe it's more linear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree step by step. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT4 NT8, according to one of the rules. So the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then each of those non-terminals needs to be expanded until we get all terminals.\n\nSo let's break down NT4 and NT8.\n\nNT4 has production rules:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, no, looking back, the production rules for NT4:\nFrom the given grammar, NT4 is expanded as:\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT4 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo NT4 can go directly to 't0', 't5', or 't4', or it can split into NT14 and NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has production rules:\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 't6'\nNT8 \u2192 't3'\nAnd so on, looking at the rules for NT8, it can go to 't6', 't3', or split into NT6 and NT3.\n\nWait, the given string starts with t6, so maybe the first part is t6, but let me think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to parse the string by trying possible derivations.\n\nThe string is: t6 t8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10.\n\nLet's see. The first token is t6. So perhaps we started with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but maybe S has another rule? Wait, the first rule for S is S \u2192 NT4 NT4. Wait, no. Wait the initial rules for S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nHmm, the user presented three options for S: S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So the first step is to pick one of these.\n\nThe string starts with t6, which is a terminal. So looking at the terminal tokens, the first is t6. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce t6:\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n- NT13 can be derived from NT9 NT12, but not directly.\n- NT10 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, looking for a rule where a non-terminal directly produces t6. From the rules, yes, NT13 \u2192 't6' because one of the rules says NT13 -> 't6'.\n\nSo if the first token is t6, that could come from NT13 \u2192 't6'.\n\nBut wait, S can't directly produce NT13. S's rules are NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So perhaps, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and then NT8 \u2192 't6'?\n\nWait, let's look at NT8's production rules. From the given grammar, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't6', NT8 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo in that case, to get 't6', NT8 would produce it.\n\nSo the initial expansion could be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and then NT8 \u2192 't6'. That would give us 't6' as the first token. But then what about the rest?\n\nWait, but then NT4 would have to produce the rest of the string starting from the second token, which is 't8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10'.\n\nWait, but NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 't4', 't5', 't0', or NT14 NT7.\n\nBut our string starts with t6, then t8. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT11, and then NT11 produces 't8'? Let me check NT11's rules.\n\nLooking at NT11, it has production rules: NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, NT11 \u2192 't3'. So to get 't8', which is the first token, we would need NT11 to produce t8, but from the rules, NT11 can produce 't3' directly, and also splits into NT8 NT5. But NT8 can produce 't6' or split into NT6 NT3.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me try constructing the parse tree.\n\n1. The string is t6 t8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10.\n\n2. The start symbol is S, which can produce S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, or S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me try S \u2192 NT4 NT8 first.\n\nSo after the first step, the current string is: [t6][t8][t7][t2][t9][t9][t9][t7][t5][t10]\n\nNow, NT4 can produce t0, t4, t5, or split into NT14 NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can produce t6, t3, or split into NT6 NT3.\n\nGiven that the first token is t6, which is a terminal, let's see if we can get t6 from either NT4 or NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules, it can produce t6 directly. So maybe S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT8 \u2192 't6' \u2014 that would account for the first 't6'.\n\nNow the string becomes: [t8][t7][t2][t9][t9][t9][t7][t5][t10]\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the next step would have parsed 't6', so the string would have 't6' parsed, leaving:\n\nt8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10\n\nBut wait, the first step would have consumed 't6' from the string. So the remaining string is t8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT4 NT8 and NT8 \u2192 't6' would give the first 't6'. So the remaining part is from NT4.\n\nSo we need to parse the remaining string with NT4: t8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10.\n\nBut NT4 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT4 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT4 can produce 't0', 't4', 't5', or split into NT14 NT7.\n\nNone of these directly produce 't8'. So perhaps NT4 must split into NT14 and NT7. Let's try that.\n\nSo NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7.\n\nNow, the remaining string is t8 t7 t2 t9 t9 t9 t7 t5 t10.\n\nWe have NT14 and NT7.\n\nLet's look at NT14's rules: NT14 \u2192 't3', 't0', or split into NT3 NT4.\n\nBut 't8' is the next token. None of NT14's direct productions are 't8', so perhaps NT14 must produce 't8' indirectly through expansion.

The string to evaluate is `t5 t9 t8 t0 t9 t10 t8 t8 t10 t10 t7`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals. Non-terminals are on the left side of the arrows, and the terminals are on the right when they become strings of letters like t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S, which can produce several combinations of non-terminals. For example, S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, and others. Each of these non-terminals, like NT4, NT8, etc., can further break down into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so my job is to see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like top-down or bottom-up, but I'm more familiar with top-down, specifically using the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is in CNF, maybe a recursive descent parser would be easier.\n\nWait, actually, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which allows each production rule to have at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side, it might be possible to use a recursive descent approach where each function handles applying a specific production rule.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to write the entire parse tree step by step. Alternatively, since the string is relatively short, perhaps a memoized approach or step-by-step expansion could work.\n\nLet me write down the string: t5 t9 t8 t0 t9 t10 t8 t8 t10 t10 t7.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from S through a series of expansions.\n\nFirst, let's look at the possible starting rules. S can be NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me check each of these.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, NT4 and NT8 each need to be expanded into terminals. Let's look at NT4. From the grammar, NT4 has the following productions:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT5 (though this seems incorrect, wait, looking back, the rules for NT4 are:\nLooking back: NT4 -> NT14 NT7, NT4 -> NT7 NT1, NT4 -> NT2 NT5 (Wait, no, in the given rules, let me scan again for NT4.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar: NT4 -> NT14 NT7, NT4 -> NT7 NT1, NT4 -> NT9 NT7.

Let me focus on NT4 and see all its productions. It seems that NT4 can be derived into more non-terminals, but some of them directly into terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7  \nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1  \nNT4 \u2192 NT0 NT5  \nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT5 (I think, but I'm not sure if that's correct; perhaps I missed a line. Let me check again.)\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT4, I see:\n\n\"NT4 -> NT14 NT7  \nNT4 -> NT7 NT1  \nNT4 -> NT0 NT5  \nNT4 -> NT2 NT5\"\n\nYes, four productions. So when expanding NT4, it can become NT14 NT7, or NT7 NT1, or NT0 NT5, or NT2 NT5.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at the other starting options.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5, but S is producing NT4 NT8, which are non-terminals. So we need to expand NT4 and NT8 into terminal sequences.\n\nLooking at NT4's possible terminals:\n\nFrom the above, none of NT4's direct productions directly produce a terminal. So we have to expand step by step.\n\nFirst, let's try expanding NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's first production: NT14 NT7. Then NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, and NT4 can again be expanded. Not sure immediately. Alternatively, NT4 could go through other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I notice that some NTs directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't2' (Wait, no, in the list above, NT13 is listed as having production NT13 -> 't2'?

{"custom_id":"request-201","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. The string I'm given is `t5 t1 t3 t1 t4 t7 t9 t2 t7 t4 t4`. Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. There are a lot of non-terminals, which I'll denote as NT followed by a number, and some terminals (t0, t1, etc.). The start symbol is S, and there are multiple productions for S. Each production splits into two non-terminals, except when they directly replace to a terminal. My goal is to see if I can derive the string step by step using these rules.\n\nI know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production contributes to at most one terminal in each step. Let's see the string's tokens: t5, t1, t3, t1, t4, t7, t9, t2, t7, t4, t4. That's 11 tokens, meaning the derivation will have to produce 11 terminals, which would require 10 steps starting from S, as each step adds one terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking for the initial S productions. The possible starting points are:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nI'll consider each possibility and see if any can lead to the target string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8\nLooking at the production for NT4, it has several options:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5 (but that introduces a cycle; not useful right now)\n- Also, NT4 has a terminal production: NT4 \u2192 t0, t4, t5.\n\nSince we need to start with t5, let's check NT4's options. Maybe NT4 can produce t5? Looking at the rules, NT4 can go to t0, t4, t5. So, let's choose NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5. That matches the first token. Next, we need to produce the remaining tokens from NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 can also terminate directly if there's a rule, but from the given rules, I don't see NT8 \u2192 terminal. So, I'll have to go through the chain.\n\nWait, there's a rule NT8 \u2192 t0 because NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 t6 NT3 and others, but looking at the given rules, the productions for NT8 are:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- Also, NT8 was part of several productions, but I don't see a direct NT8 \u2192 t8 or similar. Wait, actually, looking again, there's a production NT8 \u2192 t0? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- Also, in the string, the next token is t1. Hmm, perhaps NT8 can't produce t1 directly. So, maybe I need to look further down.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check NT8's productions again.\n\nLooking back, the production NT8 is split as:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- Also, in the list, under NT8, there's \"NT8 -> NT1 NT5\".\n\nWait, so NT8 can produce NT6 NT3 or NT1 NT5. But none of these directly give a terminal, so we need to follow further. Wait, no, in the given rules, I see that for NT6, there's a production NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, but that's another non-terminal.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Maybe I should consider another initial path.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT4 NT11\nAgain, NT4 can produce t5 as before, so the string starts with t5. So, that's good.\n\nNow, after t5, we need to produce the rest of the string starting from NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions:\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n- NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n\nHmm, let's see. Starting with NT11, the first production is NT8 NT5. NT8, as before, can't produce a terminal directly, so let's see.\n\nAlternatively, NT11 can produce NT3 NT11. Let's consider that.\n\nIf we take NT3 NT11, then NT3 has a production to t2. So, NT3 \u2192 t2. So, the next token would be t2, but in the string, after t5 comes t1, so that doesn't match. So that path might not work.\n\nAlternatively, if NT11 uses the other production, NT8 NT5, then NT5 can produce t0 or something else. Wait, NT5 has production NT5 \u2192 t0? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT5 has production NT5 \u2192 t0, right? So, NT5 can produce t0.\n\nSo, if NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, then the next tokens would be the result of NT8 followed by NT5. But NT8 can't produce t1 directly. Wait, let me list the chain again.\n\nNT5 \u2192 t0. So, in NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, the first part is NT8, which we might need to produce a t1, but looking at NT8's productions, none directly produce t1. So perhaps that won't work.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT1 NT2\nNT1 has production NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 or NT9 NT1. Let me see. The initial string starts with t5, so if S produces NT1 NT2, the first non-terminal would have to produce t5. Let's check NT1's productions.\n\nLooking at NT1, it can produce NT9 NT13 or NT12 NT8 or other terms. Does it have a direct terminal production? Checking, I see NT1 \u2192 t8. So, NT1 can produce t8.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the first part can be t8, but the string starts with t5. So that doesn't match. Thus, this production path is invalid for the given string.\n\nSo, the possible initial productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8 (option 1) or S \u2192 NT4 NT11 (option 2). The third option leads to starting with t8, which doesn't match.\n\nLet me go back to option 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and NT4 produces t5. Now, the string starts with t5, so that's good. Now, we need to derive the rest from NT8.\n\nSo, after t5, we need to produce t1 from NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t1, but perhaps further down the chain. Let me think. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and then NT9 \u2192 't0', which is a terminal. So, that would produce t0. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 't2', which would give another terminal. But we need to produce t1, which is in the string after t5.\n\nWait, where does t1 come from? Looking at the grammar, t1 is a terminal in NT10 \u2192 't1'. Let me check where t1 can come from.\n\nLet me look for non-terminals that directly produce 't1'. In the grammar, NT10 has production NT10 \u2192 't1'. So, to produce t1, we can take NT10.\n\nNow, looking for a path that allows t1 to appear. So, perhaps in some derivation step, one of the non-terminals becomes NT10.\n\nLet me consider the string after t5: t1 t3 t1 t4 t7 t9 t2 t7 t4 t4. So, the second token is t1. So, perhaps after t5, we have NT8 producing something that can lead to t1.\n\nWait, in NT8's production, looking at the second option: NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5. If I take that, then NT1 can produce t8 or t1. Wait, looking at NT1's productions, yes, NT1 \u2192 t8 or NT1 \u2192 t12 NT8 or NT1 \u2192 t1.\n\nWait, no, let me check. NT1 has production NT1 \u2192 t8, but also NT1 \u2192 t13 NT1, and others. Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT1 are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT1 \u2192 t13 NT1 (recursive)\n- NT1 \u2192 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Yes, NT4 can produce 't4' via NT4 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo the first step would be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the string starts with t4, and then the next token should come from NT8.\n\nNow, NT8's possible productions. Looking through the rules, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, and also NT8 \u2192 't6' and NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't7', and NT8 \u2192 't8' (Wait, let me check: looking at the grammar, S's productions don't include 't8' from S directly, but other non-terminals might. For NT8, checking its rules: in the grammar, there's NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, and some other productions: I believe in the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't8'? Wait no, looking at the grammar provided, I think NT8 has rules like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't6', NT8 \u2192 't0', and perhaps others like NT8 \u2192 't8' if present. Wait, checking the grammar provided, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't8' directly, but let's make sure I'm looking correctly. \n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me check if any NT8 production results in 't8'. Looking through, the grammar includes:\n\nFor example, looking for 't8' as a terminal in any production, perhaps not directly from NT8. Maybe it's derived from another non-terminal. For instance, NT1 \u2192 something.\n\nBut perhaps I should check each step more carefully.\n\nSo, after the initial S production S \u2192 NT4 NT8, we have to parse t4 followed by the result of NT8.\n\nSo, after NT4 gives t4, the next part is t6 t8 etc. So let's focus on NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't6'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't8'? Wait, looking deeper: Let me scan the rules for NT8.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nI don't see NT8 \u2192 't8' as a production. Wait, let me check the initial list:\n\nThe first rule is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the next is S \u2192 NT4 NT11, then S \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc.\n\nThen, the rules for NT8 are further down:\n\nLooking for NT8 among the provided rules:\n\nAh, here's NT8 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't6', and possibly others. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me count.\n\nLooking through the grammar list, the rules for NT8 are:\n\nLooking at the entire list, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't5', etc. Wait, actually, here's one production:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6', another is NT8 \u2192 't0', and another is NT8 \u2192 't7' from some other productions. Wait, no, looking again, I think I might be miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT's productions are spread out in the list. For NT8, let's see:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't4', 't6'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', etc.\n- Then looking deeper, for NT8:\n\nIs there a production NT8 \u2192 't8'? I think not, the list I see is:\n\nNT8's rules: For example, is there any where NT8 produces 't8'? I don't immediately see it. So perhaps the string can't be parsed if NT8 can't produce 't8' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar list, under NT4, NT2, etc., but under NT8, I think I don't see 't8' as a terminal. So perhaps the only way to get 't8' is through a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nSo, perhaps after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the 't4' is correct, and then NT8 must produce 't6', but perhaps via NT6 or another path.\n\nWait, the string starts with t4, so S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is a possibility.\n\nThen, after t4, the next token is t6. So NT8 must produce t6, t8, etc. But does NT8 produce t6?\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, NT8 has a production \u2192 't6'. So if NT8 can produce 't6', then we can have t6 after t4.\n\nSo the current string so far is t4 t6. So from S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the first part is 't4', and the next part is 't6' from NT8 \u2192 't6'.\n\nThen, the next token is t8.\n\nWait, the string is `t4 t6 t8 t8 t0 t10 t7 t8 t6 t5 t9 t2`.\n\nSo after 't4 t6', the next is 't8'.\n\nSo now, after S \u2192 NT4, and NT8 \u2192 't6', we need to handle the next part of the string, which is 't8'.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nThe string is being parsed step by step. So starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, we get 't4' from NT4, and then from NT8, we get the next non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that NT8 can derive into a sequence. So for example, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Then, NT6 and NT3 can further derive terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, after the initial 't4', we have to parse the rest of the string, which is 't6 t8 t8 t0 t10 t7 t8 t6 t5 t9 t2'.\n\nBut wait, the string is a series of tokens, so each non-terminal production will generate a sequence of tokens. So, for example, if NT8 is 't6', then after 't4', we have 't6', and then 't8' comes from the next non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure this as a parse tree, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe a recursive descent approach would work better.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. The first symbol is 't4'. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So we process 't4' as the first production from NT4, and then process NT8 to get the next symbols.\n\nWait, no. NT4 can produce 't4', 't5', 't0', or 't7' as terminal symbols.\n\nSo, when S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the first step is that NT4 produces 't4', and then NT8 produces the rest of the string.\n\nBut in the string, after 't4', we have 't6', which would be from NT8's first production 't6'. So the next step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-239","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals and production rules. The string to evaluate is `t1 t3 t0 t5 t9 t7 t3 t0 t2 t0 t3 t3 t3`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to meet CNF because all the rules have either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. So the structure is correct.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to find a way to expand S through the productions to get exactly this string.\n\nI should start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT4 and NT8. Each of these needs to eventually produce the corresponding terminal parts of the string.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens: t1, t3, t0, t5, t9, t7, t3, t0, t2, t0, t3, t3, t3. So the string is 13 tokens long.\n\nStarting from S, the first step would be to apply the production S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So after the first step, we have NT4 and NT8.\n\nNow, each of these needs to be expanded into a sequence that matches the corresponding part of the string. Let's look at the first token, t1. This comes from either NT4 or NT8, depending on how the expansions proceed.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT4:\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n\nHmm, that seems a bit recursive. Let me see how NT4 can produce t4. Wait, in the grammar, NT4 can only produce non-terminals. The only terminal production for NT is in NT3: NT3 \u2192 't3'. Wait, no, NT3 is 't3'? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT3 has production NT3 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal. And NT3 also has NT3 \u2192 't2'? No, wait:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, no, the input string starts with t1, so maybe NT1 needs to produce that.\n\nWait, let me look at the productions for NT1:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, and NT13 has several productions, including NT13 \u2192 't2', but wait:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT13 can produce 't2' (NT13 \u2192 't2'), as well as 't3' (NT13 \u2192 't3') etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should make a parsing tree or use a recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can track the possible sequences.\n\nThe string starts with t1, so I need to see if any of the NT non-terminals can produce t1.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT1 has a terminal production: NT1 \u2192 't8'. No, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit extensive. Let me list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't0', 't9', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10.\n\nEach terminal corresponds to a specific production.\n\nLooking at the first token, t1. Which non-terminals can produce t1?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking for 't1' in the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at NT10: NT10 \u2192 't1'\n\nYes, NT10 can produce 't1'. So NT10 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo maybe the first part of the expansion is NT10 \u2192 't1'.\n\nBut wait, in the initial step, S expands into NT4 and NT8. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo to get t1 as the first token, either NT4 must produce t1 or NT8 must produce t1. But looking at the productions for NT4 and NT8, do they have any terminals?\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT4 also has a production NT4 \u2192 't0' in the list of NT4's rules? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0' and NT4 \u2192 't5'. So NT4 can produce t0 or t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has productions including 't0' and 't6' and others. Let me check:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6' (from NT8 -> 't6'), and NT8 \u2192 't0' (NT8 has a production to 't0'), also NT8 has a production to 't1' (no, wait: looking for 't1').\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT7 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't0', NT9 \u2192 't10', etc. Hmm, maybe I need a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map the entire possible expansion, but that's time-consuming.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t1, so the first part of the expansion must come from a non-terminal that can derive t1. Looking at the grammar, only NT10 has a production NT10 \u2192 't1'. So the first symbol t1 must come from NT10.\n\nBut in the grammar, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So how can S derive NT10 in the first step?\n\nWait, that can't be because S expands into NT4 NT8. So the first symbol must come from NT4's expansion or NT8's expansion.

But I'm not sure yet. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT4 and NT8.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals will need to produce sequences that match the string.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t1, which only NT10 can produce. But the initial productions from S don't include NT10, so that seems impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe during expansion, the NT4 and NT8 can derive into other non-terminals and eventually produce t1. But based on the grammar, I don't see a way for NT4 or NT8 to eventually produce t1 because their productions don't directly or indirectly lead to 't1'.\n\nLooking more closely, NT10 is only produced by NT10 \u2192 't1', and in the initial step, S does not produce NT10. So unless there's a way to get NT10 via some expansion from NT4 or NT8, which doesn't seem possible, the string can't start with t1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because the first symbol t1 cannot be derived from the initial productions of S.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the grammar rules and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is a bit complex with multiple non-terminals and terminals. Each production seems to split into two parts, either other non-terminals or actual terminals like 't0' to 't14' and some 't's in the string. The string only has 't0' and 't7', but wait, no\u2014it actually has t6, t8, t7, etc. Let me double-check: the string is \"t6 t8 t7 t6 t4 t7 t6 t6 t4 t4 t4 t9 t7\". So 't6', 't8', 't7', 't4', 't9'. Hmm, I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has three productions:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n3. S -> NT1 NT11\n\nSince the string starts with t6, I'll focus on the productions that might lead to t6. The first production starts with NT4 NT8, which when expanded could involve t6 or t8. Let's see where NT4 and NT8 could lead.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see NT4 -> NT14 NT7. Then NT14 -> NT3 NT4. Hmm, and NT3 is a terminal 't2'. So NT4 seems to lead into a loop possibly adding t2, but I'm not sure how that gets us to t6 or t8 yet.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, NT8 -> NT6 NT3, and NT6-> NT9 NT11, which then leads elsewhere. Maybe this path is more promising because NT8 could lead to t6 or other things.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6. Let's see where t6 comes from. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that directly gives t6, but perhaps through expansion. Wait, looking closer:\n\nThe string starts with t6. Looking for rules that produce t6 as a terminal. Scanning through, I see NT10 -> 't6', NT11 -> 't3', NT7 -> 't0', etc. Hmm, t6 is only appearing in NT10 and in NT2's productions perhaps. Wait, in the provided grammar, NT2 has 't2' as a terminal, but one of the productions for NT2 is NT2->'t5'? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT2, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT1\nWait, no, looking back: No, the actual grammar has NT2 defined as NT2-> NT0 NT0, NT2-> NT5 NT1, NT2-> NT7 NT1. So NT2 could produce terminals. Looking back, maybe I missed 't2' somewhere.\n\nWait, let me list all the rule terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't2', since in the rules there's NT2->'t2', and NT10 is 't6', etc.\n\nSo, t2 and t6 are terminal symbols. The string has t6, so we can consider how t6 is generated. Looking at NT10, it's a production that directly gives 't6'. So NT10 -> 't6'. So the first token in the string is t6, which would come from NT10.\n\nSo, for the first part of the string, we need NT10 to produce t6, so we have a leftmost derivation S->NT1 NT11. Wait no, S can be NT4 NT8, NT1 NT2, or NT1 NT11. Since the string starts with t6, which is from NT10, perhaps we need to look for rules that include NT10.\n\nBut S is split into two non-terminals. Let's see which S production can produce t6 as the first token. Looking at S->NT1 NT2, which has NT1 and NT2. NT1's productions include NT13, which eventually can lead somewhere. Let's check NT1's possible rules: NT11-> NT8 NT5, and NT1-> NT9 NT13, which again could go deeper.\n\nAlternatively, looking at S->NT4 NT8. NT4 can expand into NT14 NT7. Let's see what NT14 does: NT14->NT3 NT4. NT3->'t2'. So that would give 't2' as a terminal, not t6. Hmm, that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, maybe S->NT1 NT11. NT1->NT9 NT13, and NT13->'t4' or 't6' or 't2'. NT13 has NT13->'t4', 't6', etc. So if NT13 leads to 't6', that could be the initial t6.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nLooking at NT13's productions: NT13-> 't4', 't6', 't2', but does it ever produce t6? Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13-> 't6'?\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13-> 't6'\n\nYes, so NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', or 't6'. So if in NT13, we can have 't6' as the first token.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation starts with S->NT1 NT11. Then NT1 expands to NT9 NT13. NT9 is a non-terminal, and NT13 can expand to 't6'.\n\nSo the first token is t6 from NT13. Then the next token is t8. So after producing t6, the next part must be something that leads to t8.\n\nWait, but after S->NT1 NT11, and then NT1->NT9 NT13, which could produce 't6', then the remaining part would be NT11. But the string is t6, t8, t7, etc. So perhaps the next part is handling t8.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting lost. Perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, using a top-down parsing approach, trying to match the string token by token, applying the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to specific productions.\n\nThe string is: t6, t8, t7, t6, t4, t7, t6, t6, t4, t4, t4, t9, t7.\n\nLet me list each token: [t6, t8, t7, t6, t4, t7, t6, t6, t4, t4, t4, t9, t7]\n\nNow, let's see which parts in the grammar can generate these.\n\nStarting with S. Let's consider S->NT1 NT11 since S-> NT1 NT11 is one of the options.\n\nSo, S -> NT1 NT11.\n\nNow, NT1 can expand to NT9 NT13.\n\nSo, NT1 -> NT9 NT13. So the string starts with NT9 and NT13. Now, the first token is t6, so let's see how NT13 can produce t6.\n\nNT13->'t6' directly, so NT13 -> t6.\n\nThen, NT11 -> ... Let's look at NT11's productions.\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5, or NT3 NT11, or other options? Looking back, the grammar for NT11 is:\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5, NT11-> NT3 NT11, NT11-> NT7 NT11, etc.\n\nSo, after NT13->t6, we have to handle the rest.\n\nWait, the initial expansion would be S->NT1 NT11, NT1->NT9 NT13, NT13->t6. So the first token is t6, then we have to look at NT9 and NT11.\n\nHmm, but after NT13 produces t6, the NT9 and NT11 would produce the next tokens. So the second token is t8, so perhaps NT9 must produce t8.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: NT9 can produce NT0 NT0, or NT1 NT10, etc. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT9->'t0', NT4->'t0', etc. Wait, the provided grammar has:\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\nSo, NT9 can only produce 't0' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-260","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t4 t2 t0 t7 t9 t4 t7 t8 t10 t2 t3 t3 t4 t0`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each non-terminal (on the left side) produces two non-terminals. The terminals are on the right side. The right-hand side can't have more than two symbols. So, all the production rules here seem to fit that structure. That helps because CNF is easier to handle for certain algorithms like the CYK parser.\n\nThe string consists of terminals: t4, t2, t0, etc. So, the approach is to start from the start symbol and see how we can generate this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and from S, there are three possible productions:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n3. S -> NT11 NT13\n\nWait, actually, from the initial context, looking back, I think the start symbol is S, correct. So S can derive either NT4 and NT8, NT1 and NT2, or NT11 and NT13. Hmm, each of these productions gives us two non-terminals.\n\nOur string starts with t4, so maybe the first production involving NT4 is relevant here. Let me check the productions for NT4. From the grammar, NT4 has these:\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7 (repeated)\n\nWait, let's look again. The user provided the grammar in a list, so I'll go through each NT4 production:\n- NT4 production 1: NT14 NT7\n- NT4 production 2: NT7 NT1\n- NT4 production 3: NT9 NT2\n- NT4 production 4: NT2 NT1\n- Wait, the user input shows \"NT4 -> NT9 NT2\", \"NT4 -> NT2 NT1\", and also \"NT4 -> NT14 NT7\" twice.\n\nSo, NT4 has four possible productions: NT14 NT7, NT7 NT1, NT9 NT2, and NT2 NT1. Each of these consists of two non-terminals.\n\nSince our string starts with t4, we need to see if t4 can be derived from NT4, which can then produce the next symbols.\n\nWait, in the starting production, S can either be NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2 or NT11 NT13. So, if the string starts with t4, maybe the first step is S -> NT4 NT8. Then, NT4 needs to derive t4 first.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, is there a way for NT4 to produce t4 as the first symbol? Let's see. NT4 can be NT9 NT2. Hmm, then NT9 is a non-terminal, so it must derive something. Alternatively, NT4 can be NT14 NT7, but NT14's production seems to lead to t3 or t4. Let me check NT14's productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT14:\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4\n- NT14 -> NT4 NT2\n\nWait, these are both productions for NT14, and each RHS is two non-terminals. So, to get a terminal like t4, we need to see if any of these lead to t4.\n\nLooking further, NT4 itself has productions that can lead to t4. For instance, NT4 can be NT9 NT2. Then, NT9's productions:\n\nNT9 has:\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT9 -> 't4' (Is that correct? Wait, looking back at the grammar provided, I see:\nNT9 -> 't0', 't10', and 't4'? Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0' is a production? Or wait, no. The user listed rules like:\n\nLooking back at the user input: I see lines like NT14 -> 't3', but for NT2, there's NT2 -> 't2', etc. Wait, but earlier in the user's input, I saw several lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5'. Also, NT2 -> 't2', NT5 -> 't0', etc. Oh, so some of the non-terminals have terminal symbols as their direct productions.\n\nWait, this is important. So, NT4 can directly produce 't0' and 't5'. Similarly, NT2 produces 't2', and so on.\n\nSo, getting back, S -> NT4 NT8. The first symbol is t4, so we need to see if NT4 can produce a sequence that starts with t4. Let's see. If NT4 is 't4', then we need to check the production path that leads NT4 to 't4'. Looking at NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- Also, wait, I might have missed some. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nUnder NT4:\n- NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- Also, I think I might have other NT4 rules. Wait, checking the initial user input:\n\nYes, the user's list includes \"NT4 -> NT14 NT7\", \"NT4 -> NT7 NT1\", \"NT4 -> NT9 NT2\", \"NT4 -> NT2 NT1\". So, four productions.\n\nBut none of these directly produce 't4' as a terminal. So, to get 't4', NT4 must produce a sequence that includes 't4' as the first terminal. However, looking at NT4's productions, it seems that 't4' isn't a direct terminal; instead, it's always a non-terminal in these productions. For example, NT4 can be NT14 NT7, but NT14 can be NT3 NT4, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the user's provided grammar. For NT4, do any of the RHSs contain a terminal symbol other than 't4' and others? Checking again:\n\nLooking through the NT4 productions:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n\nNone of these RHS contain 't4' as a terminal. So, how can NT4 derive 't4'? Unless I'm missing something. Maybe I'm misreading some NT4's productions. Wait, looking at the grammar list provided:\n\nHere's the list again:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT1\nNT4 -> NT9 NT2\nNT4 -> NT2 NT1.\n\nHmm, so NT4 can only derive into other non-terminals. Therefore, 't4' cannot be produced directly by NT4 in this grammar. So, how can the string start with 't4' if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and NT4 can't produce 't4' directly?\n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait! I think I see. Maybe I misread and some of the NT4 productions do have 't4' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, the user provided grammar:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. No, let me check:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see lines like:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT2 NT1\n- Also, wait, in the list, there is a line: NT4 -> 't0' and another line NT4 -> 't5'. Is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Looking more carefully, the user wrote several rules. For example:\n\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4\n- NT14 -> NT4 NT2\n- Then, later, under NT4, do any of the rules produce 't4'?\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. No, actually, in the grammar, I don't think NT4 has any production that ends with 't4' directly. Let me recheck through each rule:\n\nLooking for NT4, it's productions are:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It goes through NT9 and NT13, which might lead to 't0', 't10', etc. Hmm, maybe not starting with S -> NT4 NT8 since 't1' wouldn't likely come from there.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT4 NT11. Let's check NT4 and NT11.\n\nNT4 can produce 't2' or go to NT14 NT7, etc. NT11 can produce 't3' or go through NT8, which might be relevant. But again, the string starts with 't1', so unless some rule leads to 't1', this might not be the right path. NT11 doesn't directly produce 't1', but perhaps through other non-terminals, it could. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT1's rules, NT1 can produce NT9 NT13. So if we can get NT1 from somewhere, perhaps that's how 't1' comes in. So maybe S -> NT1 NT2 would be better since NT1 can produce 't1' if NT9 produces 't10' or 't0', and NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', or 't6'. Let's explore this option.\n\nOption 3: S -> NT1 NT2. Now, NT1 produces NT9 NT13, and NT2 produces NT0 NT0, which can lead to 't10' or 't4', as per NT0's rules. Wait, actually, NT0 can produce several things, but from the given rules, NT0 can go to 't10', 't4', or other combinations. Also, NT2 can produce 't5' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at NT1's production: NT1 -> NT9 NT13. If NT9 can go to 't0' or 't10', and NT13 can go to 't2', 't4', or 't6', then possible terminal outputs from NT1 could be combinations like 't0 t2', 't0 t4', 't0 t6', 't10 t2', 't10 t4', etc. But we need a 't1' in the string, which suggests that perhaps NT1 is derived from somewhere else, but in this option, S directly branches into NT1 and NT2. So that seems off because NT1 doesn't produce 't1' directly, unless through some chain I'm missing.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's double-check the rules for NT7: NT7 -> NT11 NT6, NT7 -> NT12 NT9, NT7 -> NT3 NT11. Hmm, maybe through these, but how do we get 't1'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the initial S production is S -> NT1 NT2, and then NT1 can produce NT9 NT13. So starting with NT1, let's see how it can lead to 't1'.\n\nFrom NT1: NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n\nNT9 can produce 't0' or 't10'\nNT13 can produce 't2', 't4', or 't6'\n\nSo if NT1 produces 't10' and 't2', that would give 't10 t2', but our string starts with 't1', so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if NT9 produces 't0' and NT13 produces 't6', that's 't0 t6'. Still not 't1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again. Oh, wait! NT3 can produce 't2', 't5', or 't7'\u2014no, actually, NT3's rules are NT3 -> 't2', NT11 -> 't3', and others. Let me check the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT7 rules: NT7 -> NT11 NT6, NT7 -> NT12 NT9, NT7 -> NT3 NT11\nNT11 rules: NT11 -> NT8 NT5, NT11 -> NT3 NT11, NT11 -> NT7 NT11\nNT7 rules: also NT7 -> NT11 NT6, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to track the steps more carefully. Let me try building the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t1 t7 t3 t10 t10 t4 t10 t6 t9 t9 t0 t3 t3 t9\n\nWe need to see if this can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nSince the string starts with t1, perhaps that comes from NT1 somewhere. But looking at the grammar, where can 't1' come from?\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT13 has:\nNT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6' via NT13 -> NT6 NT10, etc.\n\nWait, no. NT13's rules are:\n\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT13 -> NT12 NT8\nNT13-> 't2', 't4', 't6'?\n\nWait, no: NT13 has production NT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6'? Let me check the given rules:\n\nYes:\n\n- NT13 -> 't2' (from NT13 -> 't2')\n- NT13 -> 't4' (from NT13 -> 't4')\n- NT13 -> 't6' (from NT13 -> 't6')\n\nSo NT13 directly produces 't2', 't4', 't6'. So if any non-terminal can derive to NT13, then 't2', 't4', or 't6' can appear in the string.\n\nBut we have 't1' at the beginning. How can 't1' be produced? Looking at the given NT rules, none of them directly produce 't1'. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT rules where a non-terminal produces 't1':\n\nIn the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> 't1'\nOther rules produce 't0', 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', etc. So NT10 can produce 't1'. So perhaps 't1' is generated by NT10.\n\nBut wait, where does 't1' come from? It must come from a non-terminal that can generate 't1'. Looking at the given rules, only NT10 can produce 't1' directly (NT10 -> 't1'). All other terminals are from 0,2,4,5,6,7,9.\n\nWait, checking the rules again:\n\nYes:\n\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n- NT11 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT1 -> 't8', 't13'\n- NT9 -> 't0', 't10'\n\nSo, only NT10 can produce 't1'. Therefore, to get 't1' in the string, there must be a production of NT10 somewhere. But since the string starts with 't1', how does that happen?\n\nSo, let's assume that the first 't1'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I'm looking for a path through the grammar that produces this sequence.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the start symbol S. The initial productions for S are NT4 NT8 and NT1 NT2. So the first symbol of the string must come from one of these options. Looking at the string, the first part is t7 t7... Hmm, the first symbol is 't7'. Let's see which production can start with 't7'.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions, NT7 can produce 't0' or 't10', or combinations. Wait, from the grammar rules, NT7 has several options. One of them is NT8 NT5, another is NT11 NT6, and others involve other combinations. Wait, more importantly, I need to see if 't7' appears as a terminal in any of the production rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice that NT4 is a non-terminal, but its productions sometimes lead to terminals like t0, t5. Similarly, NT2 has productions leading to t2, t5, etc. Let's check the initial step: S can be broken down into two parts: NT4 and NT8, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nThe first symbol is 't7', so let's see which of S's options can lead to 't7'. The first option is NT4 NT8. Looking at NT8's production, I see NT8 can produce 't6', 't3', or even further combinations. One of NT8's rules is NT8 -> 't6' NT3. NT3 can lead to 't7' via NT3 -> NT7 NT1, then NT7 can be NT0 NT1, and so on. Alternatively, NT8 can also produce NT5, which goes further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build the string step by step. Let me consider the starting path: S can go to NT4 NT8. Let's see if 't7' can be derived from NT4 or NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, there's NT4 -> 't0' and 't5' and 't7'. Oh, yes! NT4 can produce 't7'. So from S, the first part could be NT4 -> 't7', and the second part is NT8. Now, the second part of the string after the first 't7' is 't7 t6...'.\n\nSo after 't7', the next symbol is 't7'. Now, what can lead to 't7'? Since we have 't7' after the first 't7', this would come from NT4 again, or perhaps another non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, the first 't7' came from NT4. The next symbol is also 't7', which would come from the second part of S's production, which is NT8. So let's see how NT8 can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: NT8 can go to 't6' NT3, 't3' NT7, or 't7'. Oh, yes, NT8 can directly produce 't7'. So the second symbol 't7' would come from NT8 -> 't7'. So far, the string starts with 't7 t7', which would be NT4 -> 't7' and NT8 -> 't7'.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't6'. So after 't7 t7', the next is 't6'. Let's see how 't6' can be produced. Looking for productions that lead to 't6' as a terminal. Scanning the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't0', NT10 -> 't6', etc.\n\nLooking back, perhaps the production NT10 can produce 't6', and the string continues with 't6 t9 t1...'. Let's see: after 't7 t7', we have 't6', so that would come from NT10 -> 't6'.\n\nSo, perhaps the path is S -> NT4 NT8, NT4 -> 't7', NT8 -> 't7', then we have 't7 t7', then the next symbol is 't6' from NT10.\n\nNow, looking at how S is split, we have two parts from S: left (NH4) and right (NT8). After using NT8 for the 't7', perhaps we need to backtrack because the entire string is a single sequence. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it by thinking in parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is S -> NT4 NT8. NT4 produces 't7', leaving NT8 to produce the rest. So after 't7', the next production would be from NT8. As NT8 can produce 't7', then the next 't7' is from NT8 again. Then, the next is 't6', which is a terminal. How can that be generated?\n\nLooking for where 't6' appears: NT0 can produce 't6' if NT0's production leads to 't6'. Alternatively, NT10 produces 't6'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT10 has a production NT10 -> 't6', so that's possible. So after producing 't7', we have 't6'. So perhaps the next part comes from a different part, maybe S's left or right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second 't7' is from NT8, but then 't6' comes from somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe the initial split isn't the right path, and the first 't7' comes from a different production.\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled. Another approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a path through the grammar that generates the string.\n\nLet's list the string: t7 t7 t6 t9 t1 t7 t7 t2 t10 t5 t4 t0 t4 t9 t9.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nFirst, NT4 produces 't7', so the remaining string starts with 't7 t6 ...'.\n\nNow, NT8 is the other part. So after NT4 produces 't7', the remaining is NT8, which needs to produce the rest of the string starting with 't7 t6 ...'.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because if NT4 is used up, NT8 would be left. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps S can be split into NT4 and NT8, and then NT8 can produce the rest of the string.\n\nAfter 't7' from NT4, the next 't7' must come from NT8. So NT8 produces 't7', leaving the next symbols to be generated by NT8, but that may not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after producing 't7' from NT4, the next 't7' is produced by NT8, and then 't6' from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n   - NT4 is first, so it produces 't7' (t1).\n   - Remaining string: t7 t6 t9 ... (t2 to t15).\n   - Now, NT8 needs to produce t7 t6... So NT8 must produce t7, then the rest.\n\nBut wait, the string now starts with t7, so NT8 can produce 't7' (as per NT8 -> 't7'). So the second symbol is 't7' (t2), leaving the string from third symbol onwards.\n\nNow, third symbol is 't6'. So after producing 't7' from NT8, we have to produce 't6' from somewhere. Looking at NT8's productions, it can go to 't6' NT3. So 't6' would come from NT8's production, so the third symbol would come from 't6' in NT8.\n\nWait, no. Because after NT8 produces 't7' (t2), the remaining string is t6 t9 t1... etc. So the next symbol is 't6', which we need to produce. So perhaps the 't6' comes from a production in NT8, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after NT4 produces 't7', NT8 produces 't7', and then 't6' comes from a different production. Let's think about the context-free grammar, perhaps another way.\n\nAnother approach is to work from the end. Let's look at the last symbol, which is 't9', and see if any non-terminals can produce 't9'. Checking the grammar, looking for any production that leads to 't9'.\n\nLooking through the production rules: NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', etc. NT5 can produce 't0'. Wait, in the rules, I see NT13 -> 't9' is not present. Let's check each rule:\n\n- NT13 -> 't5' (no).\n- NT13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That simplifies the parsing because in CNF, the derivation tree is a binary tree, which is easier to manage.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. Each production rule leads from a non-terminal symbol to two others until it reaches terminals. The terminals are labeled with specific strings, like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminals: t2, t3, t6, t6, t9, t5, t6, t10, t1, t10, t9, t0, t3, t8, t2.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can try to parse the string using a method suitable for CNF, perhaps the CYK algorithm or recursive parsing. But without knowing exactly how to apply that, maybe I can build the parse tree manually or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Let's break it down step by step, perhaps starting from the beginning of the string.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't2'. I need to find a production rule that can derive 't2'. Looking through the grammar, the terminal 't2' appears in several rules:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT8 includes t8 as part of NT8, but NT8 can derive t6 and t3.\nWait, no. Let me check the productions for t2 first.\n\nLooking at the production rules, t2 appears in:\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT12 -> NT7 NT12\nWait, no, let me check each non-terminal that can directly derive t2.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT2: NT2 -> NT0 NT0, and NT0 -> 't10', etc., but I don't see 't2' directly there?

Yes, in the given productions:\n\nNT2 -> 't2' is one of the rules.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The user listed the grammar as various S -> NT..., but I need to look for production rules that end with t2, t3, etc.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT2 appears in several rules, including NT2 -> 't2' (I think).\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nYes, there's a rule NT2 -> 't2'. So, that's direct. So, the first 't2' in the string can be generated by NT2. So, that's the root of the parse tree.\n\nSo, the first part is handled, and we can proceed recursively.\n\nNow, moving on to the next part, after the first 't2', the string is 't3 t6 t6 t9 t5 t6 ...'.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a flat sequence. So, to parse it, each part must come from a production. Let me think step by step.\n\nPerhaps building a parse tree would help. Since S is the start symbol, the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nLet's see the start symbol S; in the grammar, S can go to NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11 or NT1 NT2.\n\nThe string starts with 't2 t3', so perhaps when we start with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and NT4 could derive t2, but let's see.\n\nWait, let's see NT4:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT4 has several productions, including NT4 -> 't0', 't5', etc. So, perhaps NT4 can derive some of the terminals.\n\nWait, let's take a different approach. Let me see which terminals in the string have corresponding non-terminals in the grammar. For each terminal, we can find the possible non-terminals that can derive it.\n\nt2: As above, NT2 -> t2.\n\nt3: Looking for NT3 productions. NT3 can produce 't2' and 't7' (I think I saw NT3 -> 't2' and another rule, NT3 -> 't7'?

But perhaps also, is there another rule for NT6 leading to t6?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT6, the rule is:\n\nNT6 -> 't9' NT11\n\nWait, so NT6 only goes to t9 and NT11. There's no rule that directly makes NT6 derive t6, unless indirectly through other rules. So, does any non-terminal X have a production X \u2192 NT6 ... leading to t6?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 can derive t6. Let me check NT9's productions.\n\nLooking through NT9's rules:\n\nNT9 -> 't9'\n\nand\n\nNT9 -> 't5' NT2 (from the end of the grammar).\n\nSo, NT9 can go to t9 or t5 followed by NT2, which can be t2 or something else.\n\nBut t6 is in the string. Let me check if there's a non-terminal that can derive t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT7 has a production NT7 -> 't6 t3' (from the given rules). So, NT7 can produce t6 t3, which is part of the string somewhere.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 can produce 't3' and 't6'.\n\nWait, let me check NT10's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT10 -> 't3' and NT10 is part of other rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there are rules like:\n\nNT10 -> 't10'\n\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me methodically list all terminals and their possible non-terminals.\n\nTerminals in the string: t2, t3, t6, t6, t9, t5, t6, t10, t1, t10, t9, t0, t3, t8, t2.\n\nFor each terminal, identify the possible non-terminals:\n\nt2: NT2 \u2192 't2'\n\nt3: NT3 \u2192 't2' and 't7'\n\nt6: Looking for NT6. From grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see NT6 \u2192 't9' NT11. So, not directly t6, but via NT11.\n\nBut maybe there's another path. Let me check NT7:\n\nNT7 has a production NT7 \u2192 't6 t3'.\n\nYes, so NT7 can derive t6 t3.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that context-free grammars use production rules to generate strings, and Chomsky normal form typically has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Let me check the grammar provided; it seems to be in CNF because each rule like S -> NT4 NT8 has exactly two non-terminals, and sometimes terminals, but in this case, the terminals are single symbols since they appear as individual rules.\n\nFirst, I think a good approach is to build a parse tree for the given string using the provided grammar. If I can successfully parse the entire string without any leftover symbols, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, no.\n\nStarting with the string: t4 t1 t0 t5 t7 t5 t0 t2 t2 t5 t0 t3 t3 t4 t6 t4.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can derive into NT4 NT8. Looking at the string, does it start with t4? Yes, the first token is t4. So S can become NT4 NT8. Now, NT4 can be either NT4 or NT0, but in the string, after t4, we have t1. Let me see what NT4 derives into.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: NT4 -> NT0 NT13, NT4 -> 't0', and NT4 -> 't5'. Wait, no, let me check. The grammar rules: NT4 can become 't0' or 't5' directly, or through more non-terminals. So, the first token is t4, which can be either 't4' from NT4. Wait, no, checking the rules: NT4 has rules like -> 't0', 't5', etc. So 't4' isn't directly an option. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5' as direct productions. But the first token is t4. That's confusing. Did I read the grammar correctly? Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT4 produces t0 or t5 as terminal symbols, and also NT0 NT7. Wait, but the first token is t4, which is not covered by any of NT4's productions. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again. Oh no, the production for NT4 is:\n\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo 't4' is not directly produced by NT4. That suggests that the first token t4 is produced by a different rule. Wait, but looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S which has productions starting with NT4. So if S -> NT4 NT8, and NT4 can only produce t0 or t5, then the first token can't be t4. That's a contradiction because the string starts with t4, which would require NT4 to produce something that results in t4. But according to the grammar, that doesn't happen. Hmm, this suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the other parts. Oh, wait a minute! There's another production where NT2 -> 't2', NT1 -> 't8', etc. But in the starting production S, it's only NT4 and NT8. So to get t4 as the first token, I need to see if NT4 can produce something that starts with t4.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT4 can't produce t4 directly. So that seems like a dead end. Because in the string, the first token is t4, which would require the initial production to be able to derive t4, but based on the given rules, that's not possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overlooking something. Let me make sure. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT4 NT8. Now, if either NT4 or NT8 can produce something that starts with t4, that could work. But looking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\n\nHmm, and NT6? Let me see. NT6 can be derived from NT9 and NT11. Looking further down, NT9 -> 't0' and NT11 -> NT3 NT11. So NT6 can't produce t4 directly. Wait, but other non-terminals might.\n\nLooking back, NT4's options: only t0, t5, or NT0 NT7. So perhaps I'm stuck here. The problem is that the string starts with t4, but according to the current grammar, NT4 can't produce that. Unless I missed a production for NT4 that produces t4.\n\nWait, let me check again. In the given grammar, NT4 only has rules like NT4 -> NT0 NT7, and NT4 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't5'. No 't4' directly. So if the string starts with t4, that would require a production where t4 is the leftmost symbol, which isn't possible here. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that seems too quick. Maybe I'm missing a chain of productions. For example, maybe NT4 can be expanded into other symbols that eventually produce t4. Let's see: NT4 can produce NT0 NT7. NT0 has, for instance, NT0 -> NT6 NT3. NT6 can be NT9 NT11. NT9 is 't0'. NT11 is NT3 NT11. NT3 is 't2'. So NT6 would be t0 followed by t2, perhaps.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let me look for where t4 appears in the grammar. I see NT4 -> 't4'? Wait, no, checking the list again:\n\nWait, looking again through the provided rules, I see that NT4 has -> 't0', and another rule, maybe I miscounted earlier. Wait, looking at the list provided by the user:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nSo I think I misread earlier. Let me list all NT4's rules. According to the provided grammar, under NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nAnd also, in the list:\n\nWait, looking through, I see several NT0 rules, but not NT4 rules. So NT4's rules are:\n\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo t4 is not directly produced by NT4. Wait, but in the original response, the user said that NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't4'. No, I must have read it incorrectly earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided the list, and under 'NT...' lines, I can see:\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, wait! I think I'm mixing up the non-terminals. Let me look again:\n\nIn the list:\n\nIt says:\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nWait, so that's terminal. Then later, it says:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nBut also, above that, I thought there was a NT4 -> 't4' but that was a mistake. So, in the provided grammar, NT4 doesn't have a production that results in t4. Therefore, if the string starts with t4, it's impossible because none of the NT4 productions have 't4' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user may have a typo, but according to the provided grammar, NT4 can be derived as 't0' or 't5'. So the initial symbol can never be 't4' as the string starts with t4. That would make it impossible for the string to be generated. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait! I must have made a mistake because in the responses earlier, people sometimes confuse NT4 and other non-terminals. Let me check all non-terminals again to see if any can produce t4. Scanning through:\n\nLooking for t4 as a terminal, where is it produced?\n\nIn the list, I see NT4 -> 't0', 't5', etc. Hmm, no t4. Looking through all the terminals, the only t4 is produced by NT4? No, I don't see any NT4 -> 't4' in the given grammar.\n\nWait, wait! Let me go through the entire list of non-terminals and their productions to ensure I didn't miss 't4':\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nNT0: -> t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string we're checking is `t0 t4 t2 t8 t4 t4 t6 t9 t5 t1 t10 t9 t8 t0 t9 t8`.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. The productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\nSo the first step in any derivation would be to choose one of these two. Let's see how the string starts with t0, which is a terminal. So I should check if either NT4 or NT1 can produce a string that starts with t0.\n\nLooking at NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. NT9 \u2192 't0', and NT13 \u2192 't3'. So NT1 can produce 't0 t3' at the beginning. But our string starts with 't0', so maybe NT4 is the right choice.\n\nNT4 has two productions:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (wait, looking back, yes, in the rules, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5'.)\n\nWait, in the initial productions, S starts with either NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. So let's see:\n\nIf we take S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 can produce 't0', which is the first symbol. Let's follow that path.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, NT8 can produce various things. Looking back, in the rules, NT8 has several productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (since in the rules, NT8 \u2192 't0')\nWait, no, looking again, in the rules, NT8 has these:\nLooking back, in the productions, I see NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't6' (no, wait, in the list, I see NT8 is a target of several rules, but in the end, NT8 can only produce 't0'? Let me check.\n\nWait, let me look again. The NT definitions end with NT3, NT10, etc., being mapped to terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\nWait, no, let me check each NT rule ending with a terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't6', 't1'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo yes, several NTs produce terminals. So back to our S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 produces 't0' or 't5'. We took 't0' as the first symbol. Now we need to produce the rest of the string: the next part after 't0' is 't4'.\n\nSo after NT4 produces 't0', the next step is NT8. Let's see how NT8 can produce the next part.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, or 't0', 't6' (Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT8 is used in several places, but in the end, I see NT8 \u2192 't0' or 't6'? Let me check again.)\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't6 NT something'? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't0' \u2192 NT8 \u2192 't0' is one possibility, but also, in the rules, do any NT produce 't6' directly?\n\nLet me re-examine:\n\nLooking at NT8's rules: \n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT7 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n- Wait, no, actually, the rules list for NT8 isn't directly given, but from the overall context, in the initial question, the user provided a list of rules, and in that list, I see:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe production NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all NTs and their rules. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by building a parse tree or seeing if the string can be decomposed into the possible symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each step in the grammar uses productions to expand symbols, and the string is a series of terminal symbols. So the idea is to see if the string can be broken down into a series of productions.\n\nLet me consider the string: t0 t4 t2 t8 t4 t4 t6 t9 t5 t1 t10 t9 t8 t0 t9 t8.\n\nGiven that S starts as either NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. We'll try the first option since t0 is in the first symbol, which can be produced by NT4 as 't0'.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nAfter NT4 produces 't0', we have NT8 to produce the next part, which is 't4'.\n\nSo now, NT8 must produce 't4'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT8, I need to see if NT8 can produce 't4' directly or via some combination.\n\nBut looking through the NT8 productions:\n\nNT8 can produce:\n\n1. NT6 NT3\n\n2. NT7 NT5\n\n3. NT5 NT7\n\n4. NT1 NT13\n\n5. NT8 \u2192 ... others?

From the given, the rules for NT8 are:\n\nLooking for NT8 \u2192 something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The initial problem presented the grammar, and in the grammar, the production S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is present, but in the complete list, NT8 can go to various other NT combinations, but perhaps 't4' isn't directly produced by NT8.\n\nWait, in the list, I don't see NT8 directly producing 't4'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (I think), but in the grammar, is NT8 producing 't4'? Or is 't4' something else?\n\nWait, in the NT rules, looking for 't4', there's NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', but how does 't4' get into the string? Maybe it's part of an NT14, which may produce 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider building the string step by step.\n\nWe have:\n\nt0 from NT4's 't0', then the next part is 't4', which comes from NT8's expansion.\n\nBut perhaps NT8 doesn't produce 't4' directly. Let me see.\n\nLooking again: NT8's possible productions based on the rules.\n\nAh, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking OT8 can produce 't4' directly. Let me check all NT8's productions.\n\nFrom the rules, NT8 is used in several places, but looking for any direct terminals:\n\nLooking through, I see that NT8 \u2192 't0' may be one, but I don't see 't4' directly. So perhaps 't4' is generated by a deeper NT production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at NT8's possible expansions. Maybe via other NTs.\n\nFor example, if NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, can NT6 and NT3 produce t4? Let's see.\n\nNT6: looking at the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11.\n\nSo NT11 can expand into something with NT3 and NT11. So it could produce indefinitely, but perhaps we're looking for a finite expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps this branch is getting too long. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: since the string starts with t0, and we have NT4 producing t0, let's proceed by assuming S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, after the t0,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the given grammar, all the productions seem to fit this form. For example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 has two non-terminals, and the right-hand sides of all other productions are either a single terminal or two terminals. So, that checks out.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is `t4 t0 t2 t5 t9 t9 t7 t9 t8 t0 t5 t5 t9 t1 t6 t6 t2`. I need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nI think the standard approach here is to use a method called the CYK algorithm, which is used to parse strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by filling out a table where each cell represents a substring of the input string, and for each cell, it tries to find a production rule that can generate that substring using the current and previous cells.\n\nLet me start by noting the length of the string. The string has 17 tokens. So, the CYK table will be 17x17. That's a bit tedious, but maybe I can spot some patterns or look for a parse that's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could construct the parse tree step by step. Since the start symbol S can produce either NT4 NT8 or NT2 NT5 or NT1 NT2, depending on the initial productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t4. Let's see what can derive t4.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT4 can be 't0', 't5', or 't7' or 't4' directly. Wait, actually, NT4 has several productions: NT4 \u2192 t0, t5, t7, t4 are the terminals. So, NT4 can directly produce t4.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t4, which could come from NT4. So, I can have the first part as NT4 \u2192 t4. Then, the remainder of the string needs to be parsed starting from NT8, since S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nWait, but the string after t4 is t0 t2 t5 t9 t9 t7 t9 t8 t0 t5 t5 t9 t1 t6 t6 t2. So, next, I have t0, which might come from NT0 or other NT symbols.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 t10, t4, t0. So, t0 can come from NT0 \u2192 t0.\n\nBut let me think step by step.\n\nLet me first consider how the grammar can produce the given string. The string starts with t4, which could be produced by NT4. So, perhaps the first component is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and the t4 comes from NT4.\n\nSo, the remainder of the string after t4 is t0 t2 t5 t9 t9 t7 t9 t8 t0 t5 t5 t9 t1 t6 t6 t2.\n\nNext, we need to parse this part using NT8. So, I have to see what NT8 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT8 has several rules like NT8 \u2192 t6, t3, t0, etc. Wait, more precisely:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT8 can be t0, t3, t6, etc. So, t0 is one of NT8's options.\n\nSo, after t4, the next symbol is t0, which could come from NT8 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo, let's assume that the next part is NT8 \u2192 t0. So, now, the string is t4 t0, with NT4 producing t4 and NT8 producing t0.\n\nSo, now, the remaining string is t2 t5 t9 t9 t7 t9 t8 t0 t5 t5 t9 t1 t6 t6 t2.\n\nBut wait, this approach might be getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a more systematic way.\n\nAnother approach is to list all the possible ways to break down the string into the production rules. Since the string is relatively long, it might help to find a substructure that can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if a word can be generated by the grammar by backtracking.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, meaning that every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the parse can be done in a top-down or bottom-up manner.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt4 t0 t2 t5 t9 t9 t7 t9 t8 t0 t5 t5 t9 t1 t6 t6 t2\n\nLet me process the entire string, considering that the start symbol is S.\n\nSince S can produce NT4 NT8, NT2 NT5, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me see which production could generate the string.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, the next token is t4, which can be from NT4 \u2192 t4.\n\nThen, the next token would be generated by NT8.\n\nLooking at the string after t4, we have t0 t2 t5 ... So, let's see if NT8 can produce a sequence that starts with t0, t2, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider parsing from the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for how the symbols can be grouped.\n\nAnother observation: The first symbol is t4, which we know can come from NT4 \u2192 t4. So, let's consume t4.\n\nNow, the remaining string is: t0 t2 t5 ... etc.\n\nWe need to parse t0 t2 t5... So, let's consider NT8 being the next non-terminal. Because S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the first production is NT4 NT8, so after t4, the next symbol should be the start of NT8's derivation.\n\nThus, after t4, the first part we look at is the remaining string starting at the second symbol, which is t0. So, can this t0 be the start of NT8's production?\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: There is NT8 \u2192 t0. So yes.\n\nSo, so far, we've consumed t4 t0, corresponding to NT4 producing t4 and NT8 producing t0. Now, the next part is t2.\n\nSo, after t0, the next symbol is t2. So, what can produce t2?\n\nLooking at non-terminals that can produce t2. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2 can produce t2 via some productions.\n\nWait, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 t2.\n\nSo, perhaps the next step is to consume t2 as NT2 \u2192 t2.\n\nBut wait, the grammar is in CNF, and we have to parse using non-terminals. So, after t0, we have t2. So, we need to have a rule that produces t2. Let me see if any non-terminals produce t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t2 (multiple times)\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT12 \u2192 t2\n- NT9 \u2192 t2 via some rules.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nLooking through all productions, there are a few that directly produce t2:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t2 (multiple times, e.g., NT2 \u2192 t2 as per the rules)\n- NT12 \u2192 t2 (appears in some rules)\n- NT4 \u2192 t2 (appears in some rules)\n- NT9 \u2192 t2 (appears via rules)\n\nBut perhaps the simplest is NT2 \u2192 t2. So, after t0, consuming t2 as NT2 is straightforward.\n\nSo now, we've consumed t4 t0 t2.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t5. Let's see what can generate t5.\n\nLooking at non-terminals that can produce t5. From the grammar, NT5 can produce t5. Also, NT2, NT1, etc., perhaps via production chaining.\n\nSo, let's consider possible rules for generating t5.\n\nWait, one of the productions is NT2 \u2192 t5, not NT5. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 has a rule NT2 \u2192 t5 (multiple times)\n- NT1 \u2192 ... (does it have t5? Let me look. No, looking through the grammar, NT1's productions don't have t5, but NT2 does.)\n- So, one of the options for NT2 is to produce t5 directly.\n\nSo, after t0 t2, the next symbol is t5. So, that can come from NT2 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo, consuming t5 as NT2 \u2192 t5.\n\nNow, the string so far is t4 t0 t2 t5.\n\nNext, after t5, the next symbol is t9. Let's see what can produce t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, non-terminals that can produce t9:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means the left-hand side (LHS) of each production has exactly two non-terminals, and the right-hand side (RHS) can have one or two terminals. The grammar here is given, and I can see that the S symbol starts the derivations. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived step by step from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that S has two options: S -> NT4 NT8 or S -> NT1 NT2. The given string starts with t5, t4, etc., so I think the first step is to figure out which production from S to use. Let's check the first alternative, S -> NT4 NT8. If I derive from this, the first symbols would come from NT4 and NT8. Looking at NT4's productions, I see NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or something involving other non-terminals. Wait, in the given string, the first symbol is t5. So maybe NT4 can produce 't5'? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n1. NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n2. NT4 -> NT7\n3. NT4 -> NT2\n4. NT4 -> 't5'\n5. NT4 -> 't0'\n\nSo yes, NT4 can produce 't5'. So the first part, t5, can come from NT4 -> 't5'. Then, the second part of S -> NT4 NT8 would be NT8. Let's look at the string: t4 is the second symbol. So NT8 should derive t4. Looking at NT8's productions:\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> 't6'\nNT8 -> 't3'\nNT8 -> 't0'\n\nWait, I'm looking for t4, but none of these seem to produce t4 directly. Hmm, maybe I'm choosing the wrong production for S. Let me check the other option: S -> NT1 NT2. The string starts with t5 (from NT4), but if I take S -> NT1 NT2, the first symbol would come from NT1. Let me see if NT1 can produce t5.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT1 -> NT13 NT14\nNT1 -> 't1'\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nHmm, so NT1 can produce 't1' or 't8', not t5. So if I go with S -> NT1 NT2, the first symbol can't be t5 because NT1 doesn't produce t5. So maybe the correct path is S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, starting with S, the first step is NT4 -> 't5', then NT8. The next symbol in the string is t4, but NT8 can't directly produce t4. Wait, this isn't matching. Did I make a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5, t4, t5, etc. So S -> NT4 NT8. The first symbol is t5, which is from NT4. Then, the next symbol is t4, which should come from NT8. Let's see how NT8 can produce t4. Looking at NT8's options again:\n\nNT8 -> 't6', 't3', 't0', but none produce t4 directly. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless there's a way for NT8 to derive something that eventually leads to t4 through multiple steps. Let me check the productions for NT8 more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the productions. Let me list out NT8's productions again:\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> 't6'\n- NT8 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n\nSo NT8 can go to t6, t3, or t0 directly. There's no production that leads to t4. That's confusing because the second symbol is t4. Maybe I chose the wrong initial production from S. Let's consider the other option: S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nWith S -> NT1 NT2, the first symbol comes from NT1, which can be 't1' or 't8'. But the string starts with t5, so this can't be right. Therefore, the initial production must be S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nWait, but if NT8 can't produce t4 directly, how do we get t4 in the second position? This suggests that maybe the string isn't in the language. But let me double-check everything.\n\nWait, maybe the parse tree is more complex. Let's see if NT8 can derive a sequence that includes t4. For example, maybe NT8 can be broken down into other non-terminals that eventually produce t4. Let's look deeper.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, it can go to NT6 NT3, NT1 NT5, or directly to terminals t6, t3, t0. So let's explore NT8 -> NT6 NT3. Now, NT6's productions:\nNT6 -> NT9 NT11\nNT6 -> 't9'\nNT6 -> 't1'\n\nSo NT6 can produce t9 or t1 directly, or as NT9 NT11. If NT6 is t9, then NT3 comes from NT3's productions. Let's see, NT3 can be:\n\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT3 -> 't5'\n\nSo, if NT6 -> t9, then NT3 could be t2 or t5. Hmm, so the path would be:\n\nS -> NT4 (t5) - first symbol\nNT8 -> NT6 -> t9\nThen, NT3 could be t5, so the second symbol is t9 t5? But the string is t5 t4 t5 t6... So that doesn't match. Alternatively, if NT6 is t1, then NT3 can be 't2' or 't5'. So t5 t1 t2... But the second symbol is t4, so that still doesn't align.\n\nWhat if NT8 is broken down into NT1 NT5? Let's see. NT1 can produce 't1' or 't8', and NT5 can produce 't0', 't5', or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's try to build the string step by step. Starting with S -> NT4 NT8.\n\n1. NT4 -> 't5' (so first symbol is t5)\n2. Now, NT8 needs to produce t4 as the next symbol. Wait, but NT8's options don't include t4, so that's impossible. So this suggests that the string is not in the language, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me double-check the productions. Looking at NT8 again:\n\nThe productions for NT8 are:\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> 't6'\n- NT8 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n\nNone of these produce 't4'. So if the string starts with t5, the next symbol should come from NT8, but there's no way to get t4 from NT8. Therefore, the string is not derivable from the given grammar.\n\nSo, after carefully checking all possible derivations and productions, it seems impossible to derive the given string because there's no rule that allows NT8 to produce 't4'. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the string starts with 't6', I should look at the productions where 't6' comes from. From NT10: NT10 \u2192 't6' and NT10 \u2192 't3'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't6'. So, I think the string likely starts with NT10 \u2192 't6', as that's one of the options. Let me check the grammar:\n\nYes, looking at NT10's productions:\nNT10 \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't7' but that's not 't6'.\nWait, no, NT10 only goes to 't3' directly, but NT0 has NT0 \u2192 't10' or 't4'.

Wait, checking: NT10's productions are:\n\nNo, wait, looking back: the rules include NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1 and NT10 \u2192 NT10 NT11.

Let me list all the NT10 productions to confirm.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't3'\n- NT10 \u2192 't6'\n\nSo NT10 can produce 't3' or 't6'. So the first token 't6' could come from NT10 \u2192 't6'. Alternatively, NT10 could have gone through derivations to produce 't6'. But maybe it's directly.\n\nSo, let's tentatively assume that the first token comes from S \u2192 NT1 NT2, but wait, S's starting productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or S \u2192 NT1 NT2. But the string starts with 't6', so it's more likely that S expands into something that starts with NT10.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's consider that the start symbol S can produce NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. So, if the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then we have two non-terminals to expand: NT4 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't6', so one of NT4 or NT8 must derive 't6'? Let's check the rules for NT4 and NT8.\n\nNT4 has productions like NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't4' (from NT4: 't7', 't4', etc. Or wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me list all the rules for NT4:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't4' via some rules.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, let me find NT4's productions:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't4' via other rules (like NT3 \u2192 't7' etc., but that's for NT3, not NT4)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking for NT4:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (one production)\n- NT4 \u2192 't5' (another)\n- NT4 \u2192 't7' (via NT0: NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13, then NT14 \u2192 't3', NT13 \u2192 't2', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is the right starting point. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the string starts with NT1 and NT2. So, NT1 and NT2 must expand to start with 't6'. Let's see what NT1 and NT2 can produce.\n\nBut the first token is 't6', which would need either NT1 \u2192 't6' or NT2 \u2192 't6'.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't8' (from NT1: 't8')\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 (from NT1: NT9 NT13), etc.\n\nSo, from NT1, the direct terminal is 't8', so the first token can't be 't6' if S starts with NT1. Therefore, maybe S starts with NT4 NT8.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4's expansion would produce a part of the string. Let's see: NT4's possible terminals are 't0' and 't5'. But the string starts with 't6', so this seems problematic.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the first part of the string would be 't0' or 't5', not 't6'. Therefore, perhaps the correct starting production is S \u2192 NT10 NT0 or some other that can produce 't6'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string starts with 't6', so the first expansion must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't6'. Looking at NT10, which can produce 't6' directly, as per:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't6' \n\nYes, so maybe S expands into NT10 and NT0, which then NT10 produces 't6', and NT0 produces something else.\n\nBut let me check the S productions again. S can go to NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. Neither of these seem to lead to 't6' directly. Therefore, perhaps the initial step is something else, but that doesn't make sense because S is supposed to start the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Hmm, that's a bit intimidating with all the rules, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form looks like. Every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this because every left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string in question is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo any string generated by this grammar must start with the concatenation of two non-terminals that expand to these. Now, the given string starts with `t0`, so I should check which S productions derive a string starting with t0.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4, NT8, NT9, etc., we see that some of them can derive 't's. Let me check each option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8: What do NT4 and NT8 expand to? Let me see their productions.\n\nFrom NT4:\n- NT4 \u2192 t0 (since there's a rule NT4 \u2192 't0')\n- NT4 also has other rules but these are the primary ones.\n\nFrom NT8:\n- NT8 \u2192 t7\n- NT8 also has rules like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, but the direct terminal is t7.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check. NT8 has productions like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, etc. But directly, NT8 can produce 't7' because there's a rule NT8 \u2192 't7'?\n\nWait, no.

So, let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce.\n\nNT4 can be t0, t5. NT8 can be t0 (from NT8 \u2192 t0 nt2? No, I think there's a direct rule for NT8 \u2192 t0 nt2. Wait, in the provided rules, NT8 has a rule NT8 \u2192 t0 nt2.\n\nWait, yes, looking through the list again:\n\nYes, I see a rule \"NT8 \u2192 t0 nt2\".\n\nSo, NT8 can directly produce t0. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8 can expand to t0 (from NT4) followed by t0 (from NT8), but wait, that's only two t0's. But the string starts with t0 t4, so that wouldn't match. Alternatively, if NT4 is t0, then the first symbol would be t0, which matches, but the second would be whatever NT8 produces.\n\nBut wait, wait, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So NT4 followed by NT8. The expansion of NT4 could be t0 or t5, and NT8 could be t0, t5, etc., but in our case, the string starts with t0 t4, so after t0, we need t4. So let's see if there's a way to get t4 after t0.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce t0 or t5. So for the second symbol, if NT4 is t0, then NT8 needs to produce t4.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions again, I don't see any direct rule for NT8 \u2192 t4.

Since the grammar is in CNF, this seems incorrect. CNF requires each production to produce exactly two symbols on the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the grammar.

Another possible production. Then S \u2192 NT1 NT2. That would make sense as three productions in CNF.\n\nWait, maybe the first line was a typo, and perhaps it's supposed to be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but the user wrote S \u2192 NT4 NT4 NT8 by mistake. Alternatively, it's possible that the user intended S to have three productions, each producing two symbols. For example, S could produce NT4 NT8, NT1 NT2, and another, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S has three productions, two of which produce two symbols, and one produces three. But that would conflict with CNF. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but for now, I'll assume that each S production has exactly two symbols on the right, as in:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nThat way, all S productions are in CNF.\n\nWait, but the initial prompt says the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so any production must have exactly two symbols on the right, or a terminal. So if S \u2192 NT4 NT4 NT8, then that's a problem because it's three symbols.

Since the problem is presented, perhaps it's better to accept the grammar as given, even if there's a typo. Therefore, I'll proceed with the assumption that S \u2192 NT4 NT4 NT8 is incorrect, and perhaps the intended production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and the other lines are correctly structured.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is with how the user presented the grammar. Let me parse it again.\n\nIn the user's message, after the initial 'S -> NT4 NT4 NT8', the next line is 'S -> NT4 NT11', etc. So perhaps it's a problem with line breaks, and perhaps it's intended as:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4 NT8\n\nS -> NT4 NT11\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, that would make each S production as having three non-terminals on the right, which can't be in CNF. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, second: S \u2192 NT4 NT11, third: S \u2192 NT1 NT2, as that would fit CNF.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the S rules are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nBecause only in that case would the grammar be in CNF.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is `t2 t4 t10 t1 t8 t8 t10 t10 t0 t6 t9 t5 t6 t6 t0 t2 t2 t2 t3`.\n\nSo the string has 19 tokens. I need to see if the grammar can generate this string.\n\nStarting from S, the leftmost symbol, and applying productions step by step.\n\nLet me see. The first step must be to choose one of S's productions: either S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, or S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nIf I choose S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the start is NT4 and NT8. Since the string starts with t2, I need to see if NT4 can derive t2 through some sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing another production would be better.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t2. Let's see which non-terminals can directly produce t2.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2\n\nAlso, looking at NT4, which can produce t4, and others.\n\nSo, to generate t2 as the first symbol, perhaps we need to derive from a non-terminal that leads to t2.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n\nBut NT0 can generate t0, t10, t4, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to construct a derivation tree that matches the string.\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe string starts with t2.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a particular formal language. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. All the non-terminals expand into terminals through these rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The string starts with t5, which is a terminal. So I'll start by looking at the productions that can produce t5. Looking through the rules, I see that NT4 can produce 't0' and 't5'. Wait, actually, looking more closely, the productions for NT4 include 't4', 't5', 't7', and 't0'. So NT4 can directly produce 't5' via NT4 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo the first symbol 't5' must come from NT4 \u2192 't5'. That uses up the first part, and now I'm left with the rest of the string: `t8 t10 t7 t3 t0 t1 t6 t10 t3 t4 t6 t9 t7 t6 t2 t9 t10 t6`.\n\nNext, after NT4, in the grammar, NT4 is on the left side when the string starts with t5. So the remaining string comes from the right-hand side of NT4's production. The productions for NT4 are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT1 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nNT4 \u2192 't4'\nBut we've already used NT4 \u2192 't5', so the next step must have chosen one of the production rules for NT4 except 't5'. Wait, no, in the grammar, each production for NT4 is separate. So after NT4 produces 't5', the remaining string is derived from NT4's next production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. So when the first 't5' is produced, the rest of the string must be produced by the same NT4 or through the chain of productions. No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of parse trees. Each 't' in the string must come from a terminal production.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's model this as a step-by-step parsing.\n\n1. Start with S. The string begins with t5, which comes from NT4 \u2192 't5'. So the current position in the string moves to t8.\n\n2. NT4 is expanded into one of its rules, but we took the terminal. Now, the next part is 't8', so we need to find what is left in NT4's production rules that can produce 't8' again or how the rest can be built.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out what each non-terminal can produce in terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT4 can produce 't5', 't0', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list for each non-terminal, the possible terminal sequences they can generate.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let's see if the overall string can be parsed.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to model this as a leftmost derivation.\n\nSo, S starts the process.\n\nThe string is t5 t8 t10 t7 t3 t0 t1 t6 t10 t3 t4 t6 t9 t7 t6 t2 t9 t10 t6.\n\nFirst, S produces one of its rules. Looking at the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo the first step could be, for example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, producing parts from NT4 and NT8.\n\nGiven that the first token is 't5', which comes from NT4 \u2192 't5', so the first production was S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So NT4 is 't5' and NT8 is 't8'. So now the first two tokens are 't5' 't8', which matches the beginning of the string.\n\nSo now, we have to see if NT8 can produce 't10 t7 t3 t0 t1 t6 t10 t3 t4 t6 t9 t7 t6 t2 t9 t10 t6'.\n\nNT8's productions: Looking through the rules, NT8 can be broken down as:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT8 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT8 \u2192 NT3 NT12\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 NT7 NT6\nNT8 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT3 NT12\nWait, actually, perhaps I should find which NT8's production starts with 't10'.\n\nLooking for 't10' in NT8's productions, does any of them start with t8 \u2192 't10'?\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking at NT8's rules from the given grammar:\n\nLooking for a production rule for NT8 that starts with t8 and leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking down the list:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT12 \u2192 which is 't3 t12' eventually, but let's check all.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to check each production for NT8 to see if it can derive 't10'.\n\nLooking through NT8's productions, is there any rule that can produce 't10'? Let's search for 't10'.\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: for example, NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT5, but does any of NT8's productions produce 't10'? Or maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the productions involving NT8:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT14 NT7, but NT14 \u2192 't3' and NT7 \u2192 't10' (from NT7 \u2192 't0'? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't0' on line NT7: NT7 -> 't0'\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rules for NT7 include NT7 \u2192 't0'. Similarly, NT8 has a rule NT8 \u2192 't0'\u2014no, looking through:\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLine 13: NT7 -> 't0'\n\nLine 23: NT8 -> 't0'\n\nWait, so NT8 can produce 't0' as a terminal after some expansion? But that seems unlikely because in the string we have 't10' later on.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nSo after 't5' and 't8', we're left with the remaining string: t10 t7 t3 t0 t1 t6 t10 t3 t4 t6 t9 t7 t6 t2 t9 t10 t6.\n\nNow, the next step is to parse 't10'. To produce 't10', the non-terminal must be able to derive it. So which non-terminals can produce 't10' directly?\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\n- NT10 can produce 't1' via NT10 \u2192 't1'.\n\nBut wait, we need 't10' which is different. Let's check each rule:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, none of the non-terminals except NT10 produce 't10' directly. Wait, but checking, perhaps some can through expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, NT7 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't0', NT9 \u2192 't10', for example.\n\nWait, looking for where a non-terminal can produce 't10' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9: Line 17: NT9 -> 't10'\n\nYes, so NT9 can directly produce 't10'. So perhaps the next step is NT9 \u2192 't10', consuming the 't10' from the string. Now the remaining string is: t7 t3 t0 t1 t6 t10 t3 t4 t6 t9 t7 t6 t2 t9 t10 t6.\n\nNow, what is the previous non-terminal that produced 't10'?\n\nLooking back, the NT8 \u2192 ... perhaps through some rule. But in this case, the NT9 is being produced next, so perhaps the previous production was NT9.\n\nWait, or maybe it's more complicated. Let's think: when S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the first production, and NT4 gives 't5', so the next part is NT8 must produce the remaining string starting with 't10 t7 t3 ...'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here.

The string is `t1 t6 t9 t2 t0 t0 t4 t7 t5 t3 t10 t6 t8 t8 t3 t2 t0 t5 t10 t7`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I notice NT9 is the starting symbol (since all productions start with S \u2192 something), but wait, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, etc. So actually, S is the start symbol, and each production for S is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nEach production on the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and on the right-hand side (RHS), each production has two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two more non-terminals until we end up with terminals.\n\nThe string provided has 20 tokens, all of which are terminals (like t1, t2, etc.) except for 't0' and others, which are also terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should correspond to a specific pattern based on the start symbol and the productions.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols in the string: the string is 20 tokens long. Starting from S, each production splits into two non-terminals, so the number of steps to reach terminal strings depends on the structure of the grammar. \n\nIn CNF, for a string of length n, the derivation tree has n-1 nodes (since each step increases the count by one). So for 20 tokens, the tree would have 19 steps. Wait, no, more accurately, the number of steps is equal to the number of symbols minus 1. But actually, the number of non-terminals is equal to the number of symbols minus 1 because each production replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals, increasing the count by one each time. So from the start symbol S, each production step adds one non-terminal. Therefore, for a string of length 20, we need 19 productions from the start symbol S to reach that string. Hmm, that's a lot of steps to simulate manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to analyze the structure of the grammar and see if each 't' in the string can be traced back to a production. Each 't' is a terminal, so they must be generated directly from a production rule where the non-terminal is defined as that terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's list the terminals each non-terminal can produce:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t2, t4, t6\n- NT10 \u2192 t1, t6, t10\n- NT7 \u2192 t0, t10, t3, t7\n- NT5 \u2192 t0, t2, t5, t9\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5, t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t0, t1 (since NT9 can produce 't0' via NT0 \u2192 t10 and others, maybe I'm getting this wrong)\nWait, I might need a better approach. Instead, let's map each NT to their terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8, etc.\n- NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', etc.\n- NT8 can produce 't6', 't0', etc.\n- NT1 has 't8', and so on.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to create a list for each non-terminal of all possible terminals they can derive to. For example:\n\nNT4 looks in its productions and sees:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0, t5, t7.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 might produce t0 or t6, etc.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, each production either ends in a non-terminal or a terminal. So some non-terminals can directly produce terminals, others only produce non-terminals.\n\nSo let's list for each NT which terminals they can generate:\n\nNT13 \u2192 t2, t4, t6\nNT10 \u2192 t1, t6, t10\nNT7 \u2192 t0, t10, t3, t7\nNT5 \u2192 t0, t2, t5, t9\nNT4 \u2192 t0, t5, t7\nNT9 can produce some terminals?

{"custom_id":"request-388","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t3 t5 t1 t5 t8 t10 t8 t9 t0 t7 t5 t6 t6 t8 t1 t7 t8 t10 t7 t6`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF has specific characteristics: each production rule has the left-hand side as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nGiven that, I know that the string provided is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be derived from the productions. The approach I think I should take is to try to parse the string using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with 't3', and I remember that NT13 \u2192 't3' and NT3 \u2192 't3'. So, 't3' can be generated by either NT13 or NT3. Looking at the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which is the first rule. So, to generate the string, the start S must derive into a sequence of symbols that can produce t3 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the first symbol should be derived from NT4 or NT8. Let me check the productions for NT4 and NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'. Oh, so NT4 can directly produce 't3' if it can reach that. But wait, in the string, the first symbol is 't3', so I need to see how NT4 or NT8 can produce 't3'.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that: Each production's right-hand side should produce the symbols in the string step by step. So, the first step from S is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the first two symbols in the string must come from NT4 and NT8.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the first symbol is t3, so in the first step, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and then NT4 should produce 't3' and NT8 should produce the rest. Or is that possible?\n\nWait, but looking at NT4's productions: NT4 can go to NT14 NT7 or 't0' or 't5'. None of these directly produce 't3'. Similarly, NT8's productions include NT6 NT3, 't6', 't0', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol t3 comes from the S, but that doesn't make sense because S is a non-terminal. So perhaps S is replaced by NT4 and NT8, which are both non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals is then replaced by sequences of terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S, the string must be a concatenation of two strings generated by NT4 and NT8.\n\nIn the given string, after t3, the string continues, so perhaps the first 't3' comes from NT13, which directly produces 't3', but that would mean that NT4 or NT8 must produce 't13', which isn't directly possible because NT13 \u2192 't3', 't5', 't6'. So maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the string in terms of the productions and see how each symbol can be generated.\n\nAnother approach is to perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar. Starting from S, and seeing if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nLet me outline the string again: t3 t5 t1 t5 t8 t10 t8 t9 t0 t7 t5 t6 t6 t8 t1 t7 t8 t10 t7 t6.\n\nI think the best way is to build a parse tree from the string, working backward to produce the symbols and see if the root can be S.\n\nBut since S is at the top, the entire string must be generated by S. So I need to see if the entire string can be split into two parts, each derived from a non-terminal production, starting from S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT4 NT8. The first part should be the string generated by NT4, and the second part by NT8.\n\nHmm, the first symbol is 't3', so perhaps the first part, generated by NT4, starts with 't3'. Let's check NT4's productions. NT4's rules are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 | 't0' | 't5'\n\nNone of these produce 't3' directly, so for the first symbol 't3', it must come from another production, perhaps through recursion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Since S \u2192 NT4 NT8, when we start parsing, the first step is to have NT4 and NT8 generating the entire string in sequence. So the entire string is a concatenation of two strings, one from NT4 and one from NT8.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, it's 't3'. Let's check NT4's productions. NT4 can only directly produce 't0', 't5', or go to NT14 NT7. So perhaps the first string from NT4 must start with 't0', 't5', or another symbol, but the first symbol is 't3', so maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the entire string as a combination of the two non-terminals. Let me think: the string starts with 't3' and ends with 't6', so perhaps the first part is 't3 t5 t1 t5 t8 t10 t8 t9 t0 t7 t5 t6' and the second part is 't6 t6', but that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to split the string into two parts, each derived from NT4 and NT8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for 't3' in the productions. Since NT13 \u2192 't3' and S doesn't directly produce 't3', it's probably that the first non-terminal is producing a 't3' through NT13.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should list all possible ways the string could be generated, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can check each symbol in the string to see if it can be directly produced by a production rule, working backward.\n\nStarting from the beginning, after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the next symbol is 't3'. So let's see if NT4 can generate some part that leads to 't3'. But looking at NT4's productions, none of them immediately produce 't3', so perhaps 't3' comes from a left derivation where NT4 is expanded recursively.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look at NT13, which directly produces 't3', 't5', 't6'. But 't3' is in the string at the beginning, so perhaps NT13 is part of the production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start from the beginning of the string and work forward, checking if each symbol can be generated, starting from S.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't3', but S cannot produce 't3' directly. So perhaps S must produce two non-terminals, and one of them produces 't3'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be generated via a series of productions where the first symbol comes from NT4's expansion. But from the given productions, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', which are different from 't3'.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the symbols in the string and see which productions they come from.\n\nLooking at 't3', it comes from NT13.\n\nSo, perhaps the first symbol 't3' comes from a production involving NT13.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the first two symbols must come from NT4 and NT8. So the first symbol comes from NT4's production, but none of NT4's rules immediately produce 't3', so maybe it's a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol comes from a deeper expansion of NT4. For example, NT4 could expand into NT14 NT7, and then NT14 could expand into something leading to 't13', and so on, eventually generating 't3'.\n\nBut this seems too convoluted without a clear path. Maybe I need to look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and I can check for the presence of the required terminals.\n\nWait, let me list out the string: t3, t5, t1, t5, t8, t10, t8, t9, t0, t7, t5, t6, t6, t8, t1, t7, t8, t10, t7, t6.\n\nI think a good way is to see which non-terminals can produce each symbol. Starting from the beginning:\n\nFirst symbol: t3 \u2192 must come from NT13.\n\nSo, maybe the first NT13 is part of the derivation.

Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because I remember that working with CFGs can get tricky, especially with something as big as this string. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the grammar is given in a structure where each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) makes things a bit easier because it limits the productions in a specific way, which might help in parsing. I know that CNF requires that each production is either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. So, I should check that. Looking at the productions, it seems they all fit this structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t9 t0 t4 t7 t10 t8 t3 t3 t6 t1 t3 t8 t0 t10 t6 t6 t6 t9 t10 t3`. That's a lot of tokens, so I need to parse through them one by one, probably starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the grammar has three initial productions: S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT1 NT2, S -> NT1 NT11. Let's consider each option.\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8: Let's see what NT4 and NT8 derive to. From NT4, looking at the productions, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5' (since NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5'). Similarly, NT8 can produce 't0' or 't3' based on its productions. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT4 has two terminals: NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5' because in the terminal productions, there are lines like 'NT4 -> 't0'', 'NT4 -> 't5'', 'NT2 -> 't2'', etc. So for NT4, it can produce 't0' or 't5'. Similarly, NT8 production lines include NT8 -> 't6' and NT8 -> 't3' (like NT8 -> 't6' and NT8 -> 't3').\n\nWait, no, looking back, I see that NT8 has productions like NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT8 -> NT1 NT5, and NT8 -> 't0' directly. Wait, no, looking at the productions: There's a line `NT8 -> NT6 NT3`, another `NT8 -> NT1 NT5`, and then `NT8 -> 't0'` and `NT8 -> 't3'`? Let me check again. Oh, actually, in the given grammar, looking at the line `NT8 -> 't6' NT3` and `NT8 -> 't3' NT1`. Wait, wait, no, looking more carefully: The grammar has NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT8 -> NT1 NT5, NT8 -> 't0', NT8 -> 't3', and perhaps others? Or maybe it's just NT8 produces 't6' NT3 or 't3' NT1. Wait, I'm confused. Let me get it straight.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT8 has several productions. Let me list them:\n\n- NT8 -> 't0' (from `NT0 -> 't10'`? No, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me look for NT8. Hmm, scrolling through the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, no, NT8 is not a non-terminal. Wait, looking again, the grammar has NT8 as a non-terminal. Let me check the production for NT8. Looking through, I see lines like:\n\n- `NT8 -> NT6 NT3`\n- `NT8 -> NT1 NT5`\n- `NT8 -> 't0'`\n- Also, somewhere else, maybe `NT8 -> 't3'`? Or perhaps I missed it. Wait, looking at the given grammar, I don't see a line for NT8 directly, but looking again, perhaps in lines like `NT8 -> NT6 NT3` and `NT8 -> NT1 NT5`, but no direct terminal productions for NT8. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, looking at the list, the lines for NT8 are:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> 't0'\nNT8 -> 't6 NT3' \u2192 Wait, no, perhaps I'm misremembering. No, actually, looking at the given grammar, the lines are:\n\nLooking through, I see NT8 is defined as:\n\nLine: `NT8 -> NT6 NT3`\nLine: `NT8 -> NT1 NT5`\nWait, is there a direct terminal production for NT8? Oh, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT8 producing 't3' or other terminals directly. Instead, NT3 has a production `NT3 -> 't2'`.\n\nWait, no, looking again: Let's check each line:\n\n- Line starting with NT8: I only see NT8 production as:\n`NT8 -> NT6 NT3`\n`NT8 -> NT1 NT5`\nAnd in other lines, perhaps there are NT8's in the productions of other non-terminals. But for NT8, it seems the direct productions are those two. But in the given grammar, after line NT8 -> NT6 NT3, I don't see any direct terminal productions. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check all the lines again.\n\nWait, looking through the entire list, I don't see any line where NT8 is on the left-hand side and a terminal on the right. So perhaps NT8 can only produce two non-terminals: NT6 NT3 or NT1 NT5. Then, in the string, if the first token after S is NT4, which leads to 't0' or 't5', but in the string the first token is 't2'. So S -> NT4 NT8 would start with 't0' or 't5', but the string starts with 't2', so S cannot derive 't2' through S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nSo let's consider the next possible production for S: S -> NT1 NT2. Let's see what NT1 and NT2 can produce.\n\nNT1 has productions: NT1 -> NT9 NT13, NT1 -> NT12 NT8, NT1 -> 't8'. So NT1 can produce 't8' directly, or it can produce two non-terminals. Let's see.\n\nIf NT1 is 't8', then the next part is NT2. NT2's productions are: NT2 -> NT0 NT0, NT2 -> NT5 NT2, NT2 -> 't2', NT2 -> 't5', etc. Let me see: NT2 can produce 't2' or 't5' directly, as per lines like NT2 -> 't2', or NT2 -> 't5'. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT2 has several productions, including NT2 -> 't2', and NT2 -> 't5', and more.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't2', so if S uses S-> NT1 NT2, and then NT1 -> 't8', and NT2 -> 't2', that gives us 't8 t2', but the string starts with 't2', so that's not matching. Alternatively, if NT1 is 't8', then the next token is 't2', which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way for NT1 to produce a longer string, but given that the first token is 't2', maybe this isn't the right path. Let me hold onto that thought.\n\nThe third option is S -> NT1 NT11. Let's see what NT11 can produce. NT11 has productions: NT11 -> NT3 NT11 or NT11 -> NT7 NT6. But wait, looking more carefully, NT11 is defined as:\n\nLine: `NT11 -> NT7 NT6`\nLine: `NT11 -> NT3 NT11`\n\nSo, NT11 can produce NT7 NT6 or NT3 NT11. Also, in terminal productions, I see NT7 -> 't0', NT6 -> 't3', etc.\n\nWait, looking again for NT11 in terminal productions: Hmm, in the given grammar, NT11 doesn't directly produce any terminals except as part of other productions. So, if S -> NT1 NT11, then the first token would be whatever NT1 starts with, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe starting with S and trying each production isn't the best approach, especially since the string is long. Maybe it's better to approach this by building a parse tree from the string up, ensuring that each part can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string to see if it can be broken down into symbols that match the grammar. Maybe starting from the last token and working backward, but I'm not sure."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar.

Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, NT stands for non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first productions are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, from S, it can start with NT4 followed by NT8 or NT11, or NT1 followed by NT2. The latter seems a bit different because it's NT1 and NT2. Let's see where each of these NTs go.\n\nStarting with NT4: It has productions like NT4 -> NT14 NT7, NT14 -> NT3 NT4, etc. And in the end, NT4 can go to 't0' or 't5'. So NT4 can generate terminal strings ending with t0 or t5.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 can go to NT9 NT13 or NT12 NT8. Both of these end with t's. For example, NT1 -> NT8 (t8) or NT12 (which can go to t2 via NT2 -> t2), but it also depends on other rules.

Hmm, looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t5?\n\nIn the grammar, NT4 can produce t0 or t5. NT2 can produce t2, t5, or t7. Wait, looking at NT4's productions: NT4 -> t0, t5, etc. So NT4 can directly produce t5.\n\nSo the first t5 might come from NT4. Looking at the first production of S: S can start with NT4. So the first part could be NT4 followed by NT8. But wait, the string starts with t5, which would be from NT4, but the next symbol is t10. So after t5, the next symbol is t10.\n\nLet me see the production chain. If NT4 produces t5, then the next part after Nt4 is NT8. Looking at NT8's productions: NT8 can go to various combinations, including NT6 and t3 (because looking at the rules, NT8 has a production like NT8 -> t6 NT3, but in the string it's t10 after t5. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 can go to 't0' (like NT7), 't6' (from a production), but let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 has several productions, including NT8 -> t6 NT3 (because line says NT8 -> t6 NT3?), no, wait the grammar is written as:\n\nLooking at NT8: Let me check all productions ending with NT8. Wait, the grammar list includes lines like:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, but checking the grammar, for NT8, I don't see any direct terminal production except perhaps looking through all the rules. Hmm, no, most seem to involve combining non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me reorganize the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT13 can produce 't4' and 't6', while NT13 has several productions combining NT's.\n\nWait, actually, some NTs directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\nNT10 \u2192 't6'\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\nAnd others.\n\nSo, for NT4, it can go to t0 or t5.\n\nLooking back at the string. The first symbol is t5, which would have to come from NT4. So perhaps the string starts with NT4 \u2192 t5, and the next step is to find what comes after NT4. Looking at productions: NT4 can produce t5 or t0, but the first symbol in the string is t5, then t10.\n\nWait, S has a production S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So if Nt's are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 produces t5, and NT8 needs to produce t10.\n\nBut does NT8 produce t10 directly? Let's check NT8's rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT8 directly producing t10. Let's see:\n\nNT8 has a production: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Wait, then what produces NT6?\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and NT6 \u2192 't9'. So NT6 can produce t9 or more NTs. So if NT6 is used, it can eventually produce t9.\n\nBut in the string after t5 is t10. So perhaps if NT8 produces t10, but looking back, NT8 can also go to NT6 and NT3, or other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to build a parse tree from the end. The string's last symbol is t6, which could be produced by NT6 or NT2.\n\nWait, looking at NT6: can it produce t6? Looking at the productions for NT6:\n\nNT6 can go to 't9', which doesn't help, or to NT9 NT11. NT9 can go to NT7 and NT9, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, NT2 can produce t2, t5, etc. Wait, but the last symbol is t6, which in grammar is produced by NT2 -> 't6'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT11, which don't directly produce t6. Wait, I don't see a direct production for NT2 to t6. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, NT3 \u2192 t2, NT10 \u2192 t6, so perhaps the string can end with NT10 \u2192 t6.\n\nPutting it together, the end could be NT10 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo the last part could be NT10, which is t6. Then before that, the symbol is t3 (from the string: t3 t0 t6).\n\nWait, the end of the string is '... t3 t0 t6', so after t3, we have t0, which could be NT9 or NT0. And before that, t0, which is NT0.\n\nWait, NT0 can go to t10 or t4, or... Wait, looking at NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 t10, t4, or also NT8 or other NT combinations. But perhaps in this case, the end is t0 leading to t6 via NT0 -> t10?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to write a parsing algorithm, like CYK, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the entire string in the grammar by checking if there's a sequence of productions that generate it step by step.\n\nLet me try another angle. Let's take the string and break it down from the start.\n\nThe string is: t5 t10 t8 t1 t2 t2 t5 t2 t10 t9 t3 t8 t10 t7 t6 t4 t8 t1 t3 t0 t6.\n\nI'll try to parse this from left to right, starting with S.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT4 NT8.\n\nThe first symbol is t5, which should come from NT4. So NT4 \u2192 t5, consuming the first symbol.\n\nNow, the next symbol should be the continuation of NT8. So after t5, we need the NT8 to generate the remaining part of the string starting with t10.\n\nSo now, we have NT4 consumed as t5, remaining string is t10 t8 t1 t2 t2 t5 t2 t10 t9 t3 t8 t10 t7 t6 t4 t8 t1 t3 t0 t6.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.

{"custom_id":"request-420","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let me see. The grammar is provided, and the string is a sequence of tokens. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the process involves parsing the string using the grammar rules and seeing if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol, which in this case is S.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar structure. It starts with S and branches into several non-terminals, ending with terminals that correspond to the tokens in the string. Each production in the grammar seems to split into two parts on the right-hand side, which fits the CNF definition where each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t4 t3 t2 t8 t1 t2 t1 t6 t5 t6 t2 t7 t0 t9 t4 t1 t6 t6 t0 t8 t6`. That's a lot of tokens, but let me count them. It looks like 22 tokens. So, the string has 22 elements, and I need to check if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to parse a string, I can use a method like the CYK algorithm, but I might not need such a sophisticated approach since the grammar might be simple enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to build a parse tree manually. Starting from S, each production leads to two non-terminals. So, the initial string is a sequence of terminals that must be covered by such productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all productions start with S and split into two parts. The first part for S is either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So, S can produce things that eventually lead to t0, t4, t3, etc.\n\nI think the strategy here is to see if the string can be divided into segments that correspond to the grammar's rules. Let me check if the string can be broken down using the rules.\n\nLet's see: the string is t0 t4 t3 t2 t8 t1 t2 t1 t6 t5 t6 t2 t7 t0 t9 t4 t1 t6 t6 t0 t8 t6. Hmm, that's quite long. Let me try to split it into parts that might correspond to intermediate non-terminals.\n\nStarting from S: the first rule is S -> NT4 NT8. Let's say the first part of the string is generated by NT4, and the second part by NT8. Or the other way around, depending on the rules. Similarly, there's S -> NT4 NT11 and S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for possible splits in the string that can correspond to the productions. For example, if I take the first part of the string and see if it can be generated by a certain non-terminal, and the second part similarly.\n\nLet me try to pick apart the string. Let's take the first token, t0. Looking at the grammar, there's a production for NT0 -> NT10 NT11, NT0 -> NT11 NT11, etc., and eventually some terminals. But looking for where t0 appears as a terminal: NT4 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't5', NT2 -> 't2', etc. Wait, looking through the productions, t0 appears in NT4, NT14, NT2, NT5, etc. Let me see.\n\nWait, the terminal tokens in the string are t0, t4, t3, t2, t8, t1, t6, t5, etc. I need to see if these tokens can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, each non-terminal eventually derives a string of terminals. So, for instance, NT3 -> 't2', which would generate t2. NT9 -> 't10', which would generate t10 if that were present, but in the given string, I don't see t10, so that might not be relevant.\n\nHmm. Let's think about each production and see if the tokens can be matched.\n\nFor example, one of the productions is NT0 -> 't10' 't8' (I think I saw that in the grammar). Wait, no. Looking back, I see NT0 has several productions leading to different terminals. For example, NT0 -> NT14 NT13, which then might derive to t3 t2, among others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the string as a sequence of tokens and try to match them to the productions.\n\nThe first token is t0. Looking at the grammar, the only way to get t0 is if a non-terminal directly produces it. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't10' (which isn't in the string)\n- NT0 -> 't10' (also not in the string)\n- NT2 -> 't7' (so t7 could be here)\n- NT9 -> 't9' (which isn't in the string)\n- NT4 -> 't7' (so t7 here)\n- NT2 -> 't5' (so t5 here)\n- NT1 -> 't8' (t8 here)\n- NT0 -> 't4' (so t4 here)\n- NT13 -> 't2' (so t2 here)\n- NT10 -> 't6' (so t6 here)\n- NT7 -> 't0' (so t0 here)\n- NT8 -> 't0' (t0)\n- NT1 -> 't12' (so t12, not in the string)\n- NT12 -> 't6' (so t6)\n- NT11 -> 't3' (so t3)\n- etc.\n\nIn the string, t0 appears multiple times, t4 once, etc. Let me see if the string can be divided into sections matched by the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the entire string and see if it can be built from S. Let me try a top-down approach:\n\n1. The string starts with t0. So, t0 must come from a terminal, meaning a non-terminal that can produce t0. Looking at the grammar, NT4 can produce 't0', and NT1 can produce 't8', but I don't see 't8' as the first token, so wait.\n\nWait no, the string starts with t0. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT3's production: NT3 -> t2. So that's possible. NT7 -> NT7 t0? Wait, looking at NT7: I don't see a production that directly gives t0. Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT7 has this production: NT7 -> NT7 t0. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, the user provided a long set of productions. Looking through them, one production is NT7 -> NT11 NT6, another is NT7 -> NT12 NT9, another is NT7 -> NT9 NT11, which isn't directly t0. Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in reading the productions. The user's grammar has these productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT7: 'NT7 -> NT9 NT7' and 'NT7 -> NT11 NT6' etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed any production that directly yields t0. Wait, maybe I'm wrong, perhaps t0 can only be produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me scan all productions for any that produce 't0' as a terminal.

But I think I can break it down by looking at the grammar rules and seeing how each token is used.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing easier, I guess.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which can derive into several different combinations of NT rules. Looking at the first few options, S can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. I'll need to check if the string can be built starting from S.\n\nStarting with S, let's see the possible options.\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t6. Let's check where t6 appears in the grammar. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT2 -> t2 via some productions, but I don't see t6 appearing directly in any of the NT rules except in the terminal productions after expansions. Wait, actually, looking closer, in the terminal productions, there are NT3 -> t2, NT10 -> t6, etc. So t6 is derived from NT10 perhaps, or directly from a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the terminal productions include NT10 -> t6, so t6 is a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the first token is t6. Looking at the grammar, t6 is a terminal that appears in NT10. That means to produce t6, there's a production like NT10 -> t6, possibly after some expansions. So perhaps the first part of the string starts with NT10, which can expand to t6.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the grammar, for example, NT10 can derive into 't6' or other things. So let's proceed step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, so each production leads to exactly two symbols, except the leaves which are terminals.\n\nThe string is 21 tokens long, but let's see:\n\nStarting with S, it's either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's pick one option.\n\nSuppose S expands to NT4 NT8. Now, let's see if the string starts with NT4 NT8. Wait, the first token is t6. What can NT4 produce? Looking at the production rules, NT4 -> NT14 NT7, and then these can derive into t0, t7, etc. Let me check if NT4 can derive into t6. Looking through the NT4 productions:\n\nIn NT4, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT3 NT2\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- So, NT4 can directly produce t0 or t5, but t6 is another terminal.\n\nWait, no. Wait, t6 is a terminal in NT10, but NT4 doesn't directly produce t6. So if S expands to NT4 NT8, then the first symbol would be t0 or t5, which doesn't match the first token t6 in the string. So this path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another production for S. Let's try S -> NT4 NT11. NT4 can produce t0 or t5, so same issue; the first token is t6, so that wouldn't work either.\n\nNext, try S -> NT1 NT2. NT1's productions include NT9 NT13, etc. Let's see. NT1 can expand into various things, but let's see if the first token t6 can be generated.\n\nLooking at NT13 first, because t6 is in NT10 -> t6. Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe I should see which non-terminals can directly produce t6. Looking through the grammar, only NT10 -> t6 exists directly. So the only way to get t6 is starting from NT10.\n\nSo the string starts with t6, which must come from NT10. So, the first part of the string is parsed as NT10 -> t6.\n\nSo, after the first t6, we need to parse the rest of the string starting from the production that produced NT10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production for NT10 is:\n\n- NT10 -> t6\n- NT10 -> t6 NT10\n- NT10 -> t3\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back, in the grammar rules, NT10 is defined as:\n\nNT10 -> 't6', 't1', 't3', etc., but the exact production is:\n\nLooking at the initial grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT10 -> 't6' (so directly to t6)\nNT10 -> 't1' (so directly to t1)\nNT10 -> 't3' (so directly to t3)\n\nWait, but the actual grammar from the user is:\n\nHere's the user-provided grammar, with a section around NT10:\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT10 -> 't1'\nNT10 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back, the grammar given is:\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT7 (which might seem recursive, but in the initial data, NT10 is present with NT10 -> 't1'...\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back more carefully.\n\nIn the user's grammar, under \"NT10\", the rules are:\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT10 -> 't1'\nNT10 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the user's grammar, under \"NT10\":\n\n\"NT10 -> 't6'\", \"NT10 -> 't1'\", and \"NT10 -> 't3'\".\n\nSo NT10 can produce t6, t1, or t3 directly. Therefore, the first token t6 is generated by NT10 -> t6. So the next step is to parse the remaining string after 't6'.\n\nThe string is \"t6 t0 t6 t6 t3 t10 t1 t3 t1 t10 t10 t3 t5 t0 t6 t5 t5 t10 t7 t7 t10 t1\".\n\nAfter the first t6, the remaining is: \"t0 t6 t6 t3 t10 t1 t3 t1 t10 t10 t3 t5 t0 t6 t5 t5 t10 t7 t7 t10 t1\"\n\nSo, after NT10->t6, we need to parse the rest starting from the current state, which is after t6.\n\nBut how does the NT10 node get processed? When we have a production NT10 -> t6, that's an atomic production, so after t6, it's done, and the next part of the string starts from the next token.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, there are other ways to produce NT10. Like, does any other production for another non-terminal lead to NT10? Or is NT10 only a terminal?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT10 is a non-terminal that can produce 't6', 't1', 't3' directly. So the only way to produce t6 is through the NT10 -> t6 production.\n\nWait, but the string after t6 starts with t0, so the next symbol is t0, but NT10 also can produce t1 and t3, not t0. So perhaps after the initial t6, we have to see what comes next.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me try again.\n\nThe string is t6 followed by t0, t6, etc. So after t6 (from NT10), the next token is t0. But NT10 can only produce t6, t1, or t3. So how do we get t0 next?\n\nThis suggests a problem because NT10 cannot produce t0. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying how NT10 is used.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the first part isn't S -> NT1 NT2, but perhaps another option. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's list all possible non-terminals and see how they can generate the tokens.\n\nWe saw that NT10 can only produce t6, t1, t3. The first token is t6, so that's one way. But then the next token is t0, which isn't something NT10 can produce. So this suggests that perhaps the initial expansion is incorrect.\n\nSo maybe starting with S -> NT4 NT11 instead.

The string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, S can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Since the string starts with t8, I need to see which non-terminals produce t8. Let me check the rules for t8. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5 (so NT11 can produce t8)\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3 (so NT8 can produce t8 via this rule as well)\n- NT13 -> 't8'? Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT13 isn't a terminal yet. Checking the rules, NT13 has some rules but no one directly to 't8'. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me list the terminals:\n\nThe terminals are 't5', 't6', 't8', 't1', 't10', 't4', 't9', 't3', 't7', etc. \n\nSo, the production rules that directly produce terminals are things like NT3 -> 't5', NT9 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't0', etc. \n\nSo, the string starts with t8. Let me see the possible ways to get t8. Looking at the rules, NT8 can produce t8 via a chain of non-terminals. NT8 can become NT6 NT3. Then NT6 can become NT9 NT11, and so on. Alternatively, NT11 can produce t8 directly.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t8. So, perhaps the first step is to apply the rule that produces t8. Let's look at the rules for generating t8.\n\nFrom the rules, NT11 -> NT8 NT5. So if NT11 can produce t8, that would make sense. So maybe the first part of the string is from NT11.\n\nAlternatively, other rules for NT8: NT8 -> NT6 NT3. So maybe the first part is NT8 leading to t6 and t3.\n\nBut I'm seeing that in the string, after t8 comes t6. So maybe the initial steps are producing t8 followed by t6. Let's think step by step.\n\nWait, the string starts with t8 t6 t4 t1... So first t8, then t6, then t4. Let's see how t8 could produce t6 and t4.\n\nIf the first rule is NT8 -> NT6 NT3, then that would give a t6 followed by a t3. But in the string, after t8 comes t6, then t4. So maybe that's not directly. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the first t8. I need to see where t8 comes from. Let me check all the production rules where terminals are at the end.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT0 can produce 't10', 't4', 't5', etc. Let me find where 't8' appears.\n\nWait, in NT8: NT8 can go to NT6 NT3 or NT11, because from NT8, looking at the rules, wait no: actually, in the rules provided, the production is S -> NT4 NT8. So NT8 is on the right side of that production.

{"custom_id":"request-448","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The string is \"t10 t5 t6 t3 t9 t6 t0 t4 t8 t5 t2 t4 t8 t8 t6 t10 t10 t4 t4 t4 t6 t2 t0\". \n\nFirst, I think I should parse the string from left to right, reducing it step by step according to the grammar rules. The idea is to see if I can reduce the entire string to the start symbol S by applying the productions.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see which ones produce terminals. I'll start by listing all the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- S-> NT4 NT8, etc.\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two symbols. So, when we reduce, the current string should be of the form AB, where A and B are non-terminals, and we apply a production A\u2192Xy, substituting X in front and y behind.\n\nBut in our case, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the reduction should involve replacing either a part of the string with two terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of a parse table or use the CYK algorithm, but since the string is linear, maybe I can process it from the start.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is non-terminals only, the top-down approach would involve starting from S and trying to split the string into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that for each step, the current symbol must be the start of a production, and it needs to be broken down into two parts.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to write the string as a list and see if I can apply the productions step by step.\n\nThe string is: t10, t5, t6, t3, t9, t6, t0, t4, t8, t5, t2, t4, t8, t8, t6, t10, t10, t4, t4, t4, t6, t2, t0.\n\nLet me break it down. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, for the entire string to be generated, it must be that the entire string can be split into chunks where each chunk is a production.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not exactly right. Each production is applied on non-terminals, so we start from the start symbol S and replace it step by step with the productions, until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a top-down parse. Let's see:\n\n1. The string starts with t10. So, we need a production that starts with t10. Looking at the grammar, is there any production where the left-hand side is t10? Looking through, I don't think so. The productions are for non-terminals, so t10 is a terminal. So the only way t10 could come from a production is if one of the non-terminals produces t10 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\nDoes NT2 produce t10? Wait, let me find NT2's productions:\n\nWait NT2's rules are:\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\nNT2 -> NT5 NT2\nNT2 -> NT7 NT4\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, looking at the terminals, which are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14.\n\nHmm. So to have a t10 in the string, it must come either from a terminal production, or from the start symbol S, but I don't see S producing t10 directly.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, S is the start symbol and it has several rules. Let me list S's rules again:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce NT4 NT8, which would result in the first part being t4 followed by t8, but that's not matching t10. Alternatively, looking through the string, the first symbol is t10. So, does any production start with t10? Or, does the start symbol S have a rule that starts with t10?\n\nLooking at the rules, S can produce NT9 NT10, but wait, the given rules don't show that. Wait, let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules, S has:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4, etc. Wait, original rules for S are:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- S -> NT4 NT11\n- S -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, where does T10 come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. So in the parsing, when we start, the first symbol is t10. Since it's a terminal, it needs to come from a production whose first non-terminal (A) produces t10 in one step.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t10 as the left-hand side of a production? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4 (so produces a terminal in production)\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT4, etc.\n\nWait, let me check for any non-terminal NT that has a rule where in one step, it can produce terminal t10.\n\nLooking at NT7's rules:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\nNT7 -> NT9 NT10 (Wait, does NT7 have that rule? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT10? No, the given rules are up to \"NT7->NT9 NT10\", but let me check:\n\nIn the provided rules:\n\n- NT7: NT7->nt9 nt10 and other rules like NT7->nt12 nt9, etc. Yes, I see:\n\nNT7 has rules:\nNT7 -> NT6 NT11\nNT7 -> NT7 NT9\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\nWait, let's check line by line:\n\nLooking through, one of the NT7 is:\n\n\"NT7 -> NT3 NT11\"\n\n\"NT7 -> NT11 NT6\"\n\n\"NT7 -> NT12 NT9\"\n\nI don't see any rule for NT7-> t10 as first. So perhaps NT7 cannot produce t10 directly as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but looking at other non-terminals:\n\nLooking for rules that produce t10. For example, NT10 has:\n\n- NT10 -> 't1' as per the rules: \"NT10 -> 't1'\" and \"NT10 -> 't6'\" etc.\n\nWait no, wait: the rules list includes:\n\nLine: \"NT10 -> 't1'\" and another line: \"NT10 -> 't6'\". So when NT10 is a non-terminal, it can produce t1 or t6 directly.\n\nBut the first symbol is t10, so it must be that the top-level non-terminal S can produce t10 as the first symbol, but looking at S's rules, it's either NT4, NT8, or NT1.\n\nSo S produces NT4 NT8, which would start with the result of NT4's reduction followed by NT8. Similarly, NT1's expansion might produce t10 later, but not at the start.\n\nSo maybe t10 is produced as part of a recursive expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the given string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should attempt a parse.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nWe have the string: t10 t5 t6 t3 t9 t6 t0 t4 t8 t5 t2 t4 t8 t8 t6 t10 t10 t4 t4 t4 t6 t2 t0.\n\nI can represent it as L = [t10, t5, t6, t3, t9, t6, t0, t4, t8, t5, t2, t4, t8, t8, t6, t10, t10, t4, t4, t4, t6, t2, t0].\n\nThe idea is to find a way to split L into parts that match the RHS of some production.\n\nBut starting from the beginning, since we're dealing with CNF, let's look for a possible split into AB, where A and B are non-terminals.\n\nLooking for where a production starts with A -> BC, with A being the first part, so that BC matches a prefix of L.\n\nBut the first element is t10, which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure is helpful because it simplifies the process of parsing and determining derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the rules are indeed in CNF. For example, `S -> NT4 NT8`, which breaks down two non-terminals into two others. Some of these non-terminals eventually lead to terminal symbols, which are the ones like 't0', 't1', etc. So, my job is to see if the given string can be derived by starting from S and applying these productions step by step until I get all terminals and no non-terminals left.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I'll need to see if each symbol can be derived from the non-terminals. One approach is to see if each terminal occurs in the correct place according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into smaller parts and see if each part can be generated. Maybe I should look for the starting symbol S and see how it can expand into the string.\n\nThe string starts with `t0 t3 t7`. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that `NT7 -> NT9 NT7` and eventually `NT0 -> 't10'`, `NT9 -> 't0'`, and `NT7 -> 't0'`. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the individual non-terminals.\n\nWait, `NT9 -> 't0'`, right? So, if I have `t0` that could come from NT9. Let me see where NT9 appears.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see `NT7 -> 't7'`, which is 't7', but I'm looking for 't0'. Alternatively, `NT0 -> 't10'`, but that's 't10'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, under the NT rules, I see some NT3 rules, NT5, etc. Wait, maybe I should follow a step-by-step approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a bottom-up approach, trying to parse the string to see if it can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start from the end. The string ends with `t10 t9 t10`. Looking back at the rules, `NT10 -> 't6'` and `NT8 -> 't1'`, but not directly 't10'. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of the non-terminals and their productions to find where each terminal comes from.\n\nI'll list each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them:\n\n- 't0' comes from NT9, NT7, NT5, NT7, etc. Wait, let me check the rules.\n- From the rules:\n  - NT9 -> 't0'\n  - NT7 -> 't7' (but in some rules like NT7->NT11 NT6, which might produce something else)\n  - NT5 -> 't0' (NT5 -> 't0' directly)\n  - NT7 in NT0 -> NT7 NT0, but directly, NT7 can produce 't0', 't7', etc.\n  - NT10 and other NTs lead to different terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Maybe I should approach it differently. Perhaps I can see if the string can be split into factors that match the grammar.\n\nEach production is a binary split except for the start symbol, which might have multiple options. So, the string is a concatenation of t0, t3, t7, etc. Each of these must come from a single non-terminal, and that non-terminal must split into the sequence of symbols in the string.\n\nAlternatively, since each production is binary, perhaps I can parse the string into the required splits.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the string as a sequence of symbols and see if each part can be generated by the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for sequences in the string that match the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions.\n\nBut this might take a while.\n\nWait, let's see. The string is t0 t3 t7 t5 t6 t7 t0 t6 t1 t4 t3 t8 t9 t2 t7 t0 t0 t9 t1 t2 t10 t0 t9 t10.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can go to NT4 NT8, etc. Let me pick the first two options for S:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT5 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t0, which could come from NT9, NT5, or other NTs. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t0 t3 t7.\n\nSuppose the first production is S -> NT4 NT8. If NT4 can produce t0, and NT8 can produce t3, but NT8's rules are like NT8-> NT6 NT3, etc. Wait, no, perhaps I should see what can produce t0 and t3.\n\nLooking at NT4, does it produce t0? Let me check: I don't see NT4 directly leading to t0, except indirectly through other rules. Wait, looking back, under NT4, I see NT4->'t0' or 't5' or 't4' or something?

{"custom_id":"request-481","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: `t5 t7 t2 t5 t8 t3 t2 t0 t10 t7 t2 t9 t9 t2 t10 t6 t5 t6 t7 t0 t8 t1 t5 t3 t10`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All terminals are single symbols. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar must start with one of these combinations. The string starts with `t5`, which doesn't directly match any of these, but I need to track back through the productions.\n\nEach production either immediately gives a terminal (like NT3 -> 't5') or combines two non-terminals. So, I'll need to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the given string can be constructed step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering each option for S and see which one could lead to the string.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT4 NT8\nSo, the first two symbols should be whatever NT4 and NT8 produce.\n\nWait, NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals. So, I need to see what they can produce. Let's look:\n\nNT4 -> 't0' or 't5' (from the production rules). Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules are:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\nNT4 -> 't0' and 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can be broken down.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if the first token t5 can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT3 -> 't5'. So, if somewhere a NT3 is involved, it can produce t5.\n\nBut the start symbol is S, which uses NT4 or NT1 NT2. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the start symbol S can produce a sequence that starts with certain terminals. Let me see:\n\nIf S uses NT4 and NT8, then NT4 and NT8 would produce certain terminals. For example, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', but looking at the rules, perhaps NT4 can go deeper:\n\nWait, looking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> 't0', 't5', or via the longer productions. For example:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT11 -> NT7 NT11 (wait, that's a left recursion? Or maybe it's allowed because it's in CNF. Wait, CNF allows for productions like A->BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals, but no left recursion, so maybe that's an issue? Or perhaps the left recursions are allowed here, but I need to handle them differently. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is structured correctly without left recursion, but I don't see that right now.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since each production in CNF has non-terminals on the left, and each non-terminal can only have a single production, perhaps we can see for each non-terminal what it can produce as terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to match the given string from the start.\n\nThe string is: t5 t7 t2 t5 t8 t3 t2 t0 t10 t7 t2 t9 t9 t2 t10 t6 t5 t6 t7 t0 t8 t1 t5 t3 t10.\n\nThat's a list of 25 tokens. Let's count them: 25 tokens. So, it's 25 symbols.\n\nNow, considering the start symbol S can expand into NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me analyze each possibility.\n\nFirst, S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT4 and NT8. Let's see what these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT4: possible productions are 't0', 't5', or NT14 NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT8: can it produce certain terminals? Let's check NT8's productions.\n\nWait, let me list all productions for each non-terminal:\n\nNT4:\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT8:\n- NT8 -> 't0' (from looking at the productions, checking: yes, NT8 -> 't0' and another production: NT8 -> 't6 NT3'?)\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT8, I see:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT13\n- NT8 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's better to see if the start symbol can generate the first few tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol's first expansion can produce 't5' as the first token. But S's first step is either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet's consider S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 can produce 't9' (looking through the productions, for example, NT13 -> 't2', etc.), but let me see: NT1's production is to NT9 NT13. So, perhaps it can eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, NT1 -> NT9 NT13.\n\nNT9: NT9 can produce 't9' (I'm not sure; looking through the productions, NT13 is a production that sometimes produces 't2' or 't5', etc.), maybe I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider each non-terminal's possible terminal outputs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for the first symbol of the string: it's 't5'. So, let's see which non-terminals can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT4 can produce 't0' and 't5'\n- NT5 can produce 't0' (wait, checking NT5's productions: NT5 -> NT9 NT2, and others. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals that can produce 't5':\n\nLooking for non-terminals X where X->'t5' in the grammar.\n\nFrom the productions provided:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5'\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4 (so not terminal)\n- NT2 -> 't2', etc.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, let me scan through the productions to find which non-terminals can directly produce 't5':\n\n- NT4 can produce 't5' (NT4 -> 't5')\n- Any others?\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT4 -> 't0', 't5'\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2, etc. So, perhaps NT5 can't directly produce 't5'.\n\nOther possibilities: NT14, NT7, etc., perhaps they can produce 't5' via longer productions, but in the case of the string starting with 't5', perhaps the first step must involve a non-terminal directly producing 't5'.\n\nSo, from S, which productions can contribute to the first 't5'?\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, for S's first step, we need to see if either NT4 or NT8 or NT1 or NT2 can produce 't5' as their first symbol.\n\nLooking at options:\n\n- NT4 can produce 't5' directly.\n- NT8's productions: does any of NT8's productions lead to 't5'?\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\nNT8 -> NT7 NT0\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNone of these directly produce 't5', since each is a combination of two non-terminals. So NT8, in its immediate productions, can't produce 't5'. So the only way to get 't5' from S's first step is through NT4.\n\nSo, S must expand to NT4 NT8. Then, the next step is to expand NT4 and NT8 into their respective symbols.\n\nBut wait, the first token is 't5', so perhaps the NT4 in S's first production can expand to 't5', and the NT8 must expand to 't7' (since the second token in the string is 't7').\n\nSo, S -> NT4 NT8\n\nThen, NT4 expands to 't5', and NT8 must expand to 't7'.\n\nBut wait, NT8 can't directly produce 't7'; looking again"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if a certain string is generated by this grammar. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I think I can figure it out by going through the grammar rules step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol, which can have a single terminal. In this case, the start symbol is S, and from the given rules, S has productions like S -> NT4 NT8 and so on. So S is derived from two other non-terminals, each of which eventually lead to terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t9 t10 t3 t7 t6 t4 t8 t6 t3 t4 t8 t1 t10 t9 t8 t10 t6 t3 t2 t6 t9 t5 t10 t9`.\n\nThat's quite a long string, and there are a lot of non-terminals to track. I think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to expand it step by step, ensuring that each step aligns with the rules until I either derive the entire string or get stuck.\n\nLet's start with S. From the rules, S can be NT4 NT8 or other combinations, but I'll pick the first one: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So our current expansion is:\n\nS\n\u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nNow, NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals. Let's expand NT4. Looking through the rules, NT4 has production NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. So:\n\nS\n\u2192 NT4 NT8\n\u2192 NT14 NT7 NT8\n\nNext, NT14 and NT7 and NT8. Expanding NT14, which according to the rules can go to NT3 NT4. So:\n\n\u2192 NT3 NT4 NT7 NT8\n\nNow, NT4 again, so we expand it again to NT14 NT7:\n\n\u2192 NT3 NT14 NT7 NT7 NT8\n\nContinuing this, NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4 again:\n\n\u2192 NT3 NT3 NT4 NT7 NT7 NT8\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Instead of expanding blindly, perhaps try to match the string from the beginning, seeing if I can find a sequence of expansions that produce the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t8. So we need a rule that starts with a non-terminal that can produce t8. Let's look for non-terminals that have t8 in their productions.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT3 produces t2, NT10 produces t6, NT5 produces t0, NT7 produces t0, NT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12, etc. Wait, I'm trying to find where t8 is a terminal. Hmm, maybe the rule S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the right place to start since t8 is the first symbol.\n\nFrom S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so after expanding, we get something like NT4 NT8. NT8 needs to produce t8. Looking at the rules, NT8 can produce \"t8\" (from NT8 \u2192 t8). Wait, is that a rule? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t8.\n\nYes, so when NT8 is expanded, it becomes \"t8\". So now, S can derive NT4 followed by \"t8\".\n\nNow, focusing on NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. So:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 nt8 \u2192 NT14 NT7 t8\n\nNow, we need to expand NT14. From the rules, NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4:\n\n\u2192 NT3 NT4 NT7 t8\n\nNext, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7:\n\n\u2192 NT3 NT14 NT7 NT7 t8\n\nAgain, NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4:\n\n\u2192 NT3 NT3 NT4 NT7 NT7 t8\n\nThis seems like a loop. Maybe I should see if there are other ways to expand NT4.\n\nWait, I can try to see if any NT14 can go to other forms. Alternatively, maybe I'm expanding too much. Perhaps I should start from the front of the string and see what's needed.\n\nThe string starts with t8, so after S \u2192 NT4 NT8 \u2192 NT4 t8, so we need NT4 to produce the rest of the string, which is t9 t10 t3 t7 t6 t4 t8 t6 t3 t4 t8 t1 t10 t9 t8 t10 t6 t3 t2 t6 t9 t5 t10 t9.\n\nBut NT4 can't do that because it's a single symbol. So maybe I need a different production for S.\n\nLooking back, maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 instead. Because S has multiple productions, perhaps the string can be built from there.\n\nWait, let's check all S productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Let's see what that gives us.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Now, NT1 and NT2 are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT1: from the rules, NT1 can produce NT9 NT13 and other forms, but importantly, we can check if it can lead to t9 or t10.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the string is t8, which is different from t9 or t10, which are the first symbols under NT13 and NT10. So maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is not the right way to start, since t8 is expected, and from NT1 we get t9 or t10.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Let me reconsider. The string starts with t8, so we need to see if any production starts with t8. Looking at the productions, only NT8 \u2192 t8, and S has a production that includes NT8, but I'm not sure if any rules start with t8 except for NT8.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rules, S can produce NT4 NT8, so nt4 \u2192 ... and nt8 \u2192 t8. So the first two symbols after S would be expansions of nt4 and then 't8'.\n\nAlternatively, if S uses another production, like S \u2192 NT1 NT2, but that would start with something that can produce t9 or t10, which isn't matching the string's first symbol t8.\n\nSo perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the correct starting production.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now, nt8 \u2192 t8, so the first symbol is 't8'.\n\nNow, we need the next symbols after 't8' to be t9, t10, etc. So after nt4, we have the next production. Let's see what nt4 expands into.\n\nND4 can go to NT14 NT7. So:\n\nnt4 \u2192 nt14 nt7\n\nNow, nt14 \u2192 nt3 nt4. Expanding:\n\nnt14 \u2192 nt3 nt4\n\nSo nt4 is now nt3 and nt4. So the expansion becomes:\n\nnt4 \u2192 nt3 nt4 \u2192 nt3 nt3 nt4\n\nWait, this might not be leading anywhere. Maybe I should try to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, substituting the start symbol and seeing what's possible.\n\nAt step 1: S \u2192 nt4 nt8 \u2192 (whatever nt4 and nt8 expand to) 't8'\n\nBut nt8 \u2192 t8, so now nt4 is the remaining non-terminal. We have 't8' + (expansion of nt4).\n\nThe rest of the string after t8 is t9 t10 t3 t7 t6 t4 t8 t6 t3 t4 t8 t1 t10 t9 t8 t10 t6 t3 t2 t6 t9 t5 t10 t9.\n\nSo after t8, we have the string 't9 t10 ...'.\n\nWe need nt4 to expand into something that starts with t9.\n\nLooking at the rules for nt4:\n\nnt4 \u2192 nt14 nt7.\n\nnt14 can be nt3 nt4.\n\nnt3 \u2192 t2.\n\nHmm, not matching t9. Or nt4 \u2192 nt3 nt7? Wait, no. nt4's rules are nt14 nt7, which in turn nt14 goes to nt3 nt4. So nt4 keeps expanding into nt3 nt4.\n\nWait, maybe nt4 can also expand to nt5 nt2?\n\nLooking back, from the rules: NT2 can go to NT0 NT0, etc., but for nt4, do any of its rules produce t4? Let me check:\n\nIn the rules, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7; NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4; NT3 \u2192 't2'; NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2; NT2 has production NT2 \u2192 NT10 NT4.\n\nWait, no.

From the grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT4 NT8 and S -> NT1 NT2. So the first step is to choose which production to take.\n\nI'll need to start processing the string by looking at the first few symbols.

So yes, these are all the terminals that appear in the grammar.\n\nNow, looking at the string to derive: it starts with t8. So, in the first step, when deriving, the leftmost non-terminal must produce t8 as the first symbol.\n\nSo, possible starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT2 because NT1 can produce 't8' directly. Let me check if that's a possibility. S has another production S\u2192NT4 NT8. If I choose that, NT4 could go to 't0', but that doesn't help with 't8'. Alternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is better because NT1 can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT1: NT1 has production NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, and other rules like NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8, among others.

{"custom_id":"request-502","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is quite complex with multiple production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar consists of variables (non-terminals) and terminals. The given grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) and several terminals, which seem to be the 't' tokens followed by numbers. My task is to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t7 t10 t1 t7 t5 t5 t9 t5 t8 t8 t0 t0 t6 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t0 t10 t8 t1 t8 t7`\n\nI'll start by recalling some basics about context-free grammars. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing and shows that the grammar can be parsed using algorithms like CYK.\n\nHowever, since I don't have to parse the entire string, perhaps I can approach this by building a derivation tree from the start symbol and see if I can reach the given string. Alternatively, I could use the pumping lemma, but that typically applies to showing a language isn't context-free, not for proving membership. So maybe a better approach is to simulate the leftmost derivation of the string.\n\nAlternatively, it might be easier to look for the leftmost and rightmost occurrences and see if the string can be broken down into substrings that match the rules.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's a series of t's and numbers. Let me note the actual terminals present:\n\nIn the string, the terminals are:\nt0, t1, t2, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11 (wait, no, from the grammar, 't11' is a terminal?), Wait, looking back at the grammar, the terminals are 't0', 't1', up to 't13', since in the productions, some terminals are set as 't0', 't1', etc. So t11 is a terminal as it appears in NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11, and in the grammar, for example, NT5 -> NT9 NT2, but I think the actual terminals are those that appear in the right-hand side as single terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT3 -> 't7' and NT10 -> 't6', etc. But more importantly, for example, NT4 has two productions: NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't2' and others. So the terminals are the individual 't' followed by a number, like 't0', 't1', up to 't13'.\n\nGiven that, the string provided uses t0, t1, t2, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, and others. So I'll proceed.\n\nThe string length is 27 tokens long. Considering each production may generate two non-terminals or a terminal, let's see. For example, S starts by producing two non-terminals: NT4 and NT8, each of which might produce more.\n\nSo perhaps I can approach this by trying to split the string into parts that match the productions of the grammar. For instance, looking for the start symbol S's first rule:\n\nThe start symbol S has the following productions:\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo the first step would be to choose one of these three production rules for S. Then, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT4 and NT8 (or NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2).\n\nLet me look at the first few tokens: t0 t7 t10 t1...\n\nWait, S is the starting point. If S uses the production S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then S would expand into NT4 followed by NT8. So I need to first see if the entire string can be split into two parts that correspond to the expansions of NT4 and NT8 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, it might be easier to use a top-down approach, starting from S and seeing if the string can be generated by expanding S into its possible non-terminals and then recursively checking each of those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the most systematic way, but since I'm doing this manually, I can try to see if the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in reverse: can the last few symbols be derived from the grammar?\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t7 t0 t10 t8 t1 t8 t7.\n\nWait, perhaps that's too lengthy. Let me instead pick a starting point.\n\nLet me consider the first symbol 't0'. Looking at the grammar, 't0' appears as a terminal in several NTs. For example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT7 \u2192 't0'\nNT8 \u2192 't0'\nNT9 \u2192 't9'\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\nNT10 \u2192 't6'\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nNT11 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, 't0' appears as a terminal in several NTs: NT0, NT4, NT5, NT7, NT8. So for the first symbol 't0', the corresponding NT must be one that can produce 't0'.\n\nLooking back at the productions, for example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13 (non-terminal)\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3 (non-terminal)\nNT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11 (non-terminal)\nNT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8 (non-terminal)\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 NT (something), wait, let's see:\n\nWait, for NT0, looking at the given productions, I see NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11, NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8, and also NT0 -> NT4 NT14? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\nNT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 NT14 (Yes, as per the given rules: NT4 is a non-terminal that can expand to 't0' or 't5', etc.)\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't0', so the NT at the start of the string must be one that can derive 't0'. So NT0 can potentially be the starting point because NT0 can derive 't0's when its production includes terminal 't0's.\n\nBut wait, NT0's production into nt6 and nt3 doesn't immediately give a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, consider that S starts with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which in their respective productions can generate certain sequences.\n\nWait, let me take a step back. Maybe it's better to try to see if each symbol in the string can be matched to some terminal production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that S can only produce two non-terminals, the entire string must be the concatenation of the two results from those.\n\nSo, starting with the given string:\n\nt0 t7 t10 t1 t7 t5 t5 t9 t5 t8 t8 t0 t0 t6 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t0 t10 t8 t1 t8 t7\n\nThis is 27 tokens. Let me see: perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to the expansion of NT4 and NT8.\n\nSo, if the string is split into two parts, the first part is NT4's expansion, the second part is NT8's expansion.\n\nLet me assume that the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the string should be the concatenation of NT4 derived string and NT8 derived string.\n\nLet me see what the first part could be: t0 t7 t10 t1 t7 t5 t5 t9 t5 t8 t8 t0 t0.\n\nWait, that's 13 tokens. Then the second part would be t6 t4 t7 t1 t6 t9 t7 t0 t10 t8 t1 t8 t7, which is 13 tokens.\n\nWait, but that might not add up correctly because the splitting point is where NT4 ends and NT8 starts, which may not be exactly in the middle. So perhaps trying different split points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the string as:\n\nStart: NT4 expands into a string followed by NT8's expansion.\n\nSo let's try to find if the entire string can be split into two parts.

{"custom_id":"request-519","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to check if the given string is generated by it. The string is `t5 t6 t5 t8 t0 t9 t3 t1 t2 t8 t8 t9 t7 t7 t8 t9 t9 t4 t5 t1 t5 t9 t7 t8 t1 t2 t8` which is pretty long, but let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all production rules in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production can generate either two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure might help in parsing the string bottom-up or top-down, perhaps using a method like the CYK algorithm, but given the string's length, that might be complicated manually.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8  \nS \u2192 NT4 NT11  \nS \u2192 NT1 NT2  \n\nSo, the start symbol S branches into three possibilities. Each of these non-terminals can further branch into other symbols.\n\nLooking at NT4: it can go to NT14 NT7, or directly to 't0' or 't5' through other productions. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, which can lead to 't8' or other NTs.\n\nThe string starts with t5, so I should check which NTs can generate 't5'. Looking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5, and NT12 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, more precisely, checking each terminal symbol:\n\n- t5 appears in NT4 and NT14 \u2192 t3, and others. Wait, let me list the productions that have terminals:\n\nLooking for any rules where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t8 (from NT9 NT13, when NT9 becomes t8)\nNT2 \u2192 t2 (from NT0 NT0 when either part is terminal? Wait, no. Looking at NT2: NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, but NT0 has rules like NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8, which would generate two terminals eventually? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree incrementally, using the given string.\n\nLet me write down the string:\n\nt5 t6 t5 t8 t0 t9 t3 t1 t2 t8 t8 t9 t7 t7 t8 t9 t9 t4 t5 t1 t5 t9 t7 t8 t1 t2 t8\n\nI need to see if I can derive this sentence using the given grammar.\n\nOne thing to note: in CNF, every step introduces exactly one terminal symbol (since each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a). So, the total number of symbols in the parse tree (excluding the root) should be one less than the number of terminals. Wait, the string has K terminals. So, the parse tree should have K-1 non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me think: each production either adds a non-terminal or a terminal at each step. So, starting from S, we'd have to generate a sequence of non-terminals down to the terminals. The number of non-terminals should be equal to the number of production steps, which ends when we reach terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of symbols. But maybe it's too time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into elements that correspond to the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can be derived into two non-terminals. Let me see which NTs can produce each part.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So, the first part is NT4, the second is NT8. Then, looking at the string starting with t5, which could be from NT4 \u2192 't5' (assuming NT4 has t5 as an option). Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT4 and also NT4 \u2192 t0 and NT4 \u2192 t5. So, that's correct. So NT4 can produce 't5' or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, the first token is t5, which could come from NT4 \u2192 t5. So the first part is satisfied by NT4.\n\nNow, the second part of S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would be NT8. Let's look at the string after t5: it's t6. So, after t5, we have t6, which would be the next symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 can be 't0' or 't5' via some rules. Wait, looking carefully:\n\nNT8: It has rules like NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, etc. Some of these may eventually produce terminals. Let me see if any of the NT8 rules produce 't6'.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, I don't see any direct terminal 't6'. Let me check:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7: both non-terminals.\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11 or other non-terminals, NT3 \u2192 't2' \u2192 wait, no, NT3 includes productions like NT3 \u2192 t2 or NT3 \u2192 t5. Wait, wait, let's check NT3:\n\nLooking at NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1 \u2192 't2'? Or perhaps more accurately, looking for where NT3 can produce terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t2 appears directly? Let's check the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t2? No, let me look again:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t2? No, I think I might have confused. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1: both non-terminals.\n- NT3 \u2192 t5: 't5'?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNT3: There's a rule NT3 \u2192 t2? Or wait, perhaps not. Let me check:\n\nNo, looking through all the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1, NT3 \u2192 t0? Or another? Let me check each rule for NT3:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1: non-terminals.\n- NT3 \u2192 t2: No, looking through, I don't see any 't2' directly from NT3. Instead, NT3 generates other NTs.\n\nSo, perhaps NT8 cannot generate 't6' directly, unless there's a longer derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string step by step. Perhaps it's a long process, but let me attempt to build the parse tree.\n\n1. The string starts with t5, which could come from NT4 \u2192 t5.\n2. The next symbol is t6, which would need to come from NT8. But looking at the NT8 rules, can any NT8 derive to t6? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT8's rule: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Then, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11 or other options. NT3 could be a non-terminal, but perhaps eventually produces 't6'? Let me see if any path in NT8 can derive to t6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t6 is part of a non-terminal that can generate it.\n\nWait, looking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11 or NT6 \u2192 NT11. Let me check NT6's rules. Alternatively, from NT8, we have NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. So, if NT6 can produce 't6', then perhaps. But looking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT3 or NT6 \u2192 NT11. So NT6 can't generate a terminal on its own.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I notice that NT9 can produce 't0' and 't8'. For example, NT9 \u2192 t0 or t8. Also, in other rules, like NT0 \u2192 't10', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nWe take the first symbol t5 from NT4 (since NT4 can produce 't5'). Now, the next symbol is t6, which comes from NT8. So, we need to see if any production path of NT8 can produce the remaining part of the string starting with t6.\n\nSo, for S's right-hand side, the second part is NT8. So, after t5, we have t6 in the string, but how does that fit?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the entire process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string doesn't match because S produces NT4 NT8, and the first symbol is t5. Then, to get t6, perhaps NT8's production cannot lead to t6. Let me check all the NT8 rules again.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7: both non-terminals. Can these non-terminals produce terminals?

{"custom_id":"request-521","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string to check if it can be generated by this grammar. The string is: \n\n`t8 t0 t6 t4 t2 t8 t3 t7 t9 t4 t8 t9 t5 t9 t9 t0 t8 t8 t3 t5 t7 t10 t5 t5 t8 t9 t0` \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This structure helps in parsing using algorithms like CYK. But since the string is pretty long, manually parsing might take time, so maybe I can find a pattern or see if each step reduces correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several production rules that break down the non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals. The string starts with `t8`, so I should look for where `S` can produce things starting with `t8`. \n\nThe top-level productions are:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n3. S \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nSince the string starts with `t8`, let's see which production of S can reduce to `t8`. Looking at the productions, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 might be a candidate because NT8 can produce `t8`. Also, S \u2192 NT8 NT8 (from further down, NT8 has a production to 't8' as well).\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NT8. NT8's productions include:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nSo, one of them is NT8 \u2192 't8', which is exactly what we have at the start. So, the S production S \u2192 NT8 NT8 could start the string with `t8`.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and also S has other options. But since the string starts with `t8`, perhaps the top-down approach would be better. Or maybe the string is derived from one of the S productions. Let's assume S \u2192 NT8 NT8 and see if we can parse the string accordingly.\n\nSo the first `t8` would be the result of NT8, and then the next `t8` would come from the second NT8 production. But let me check what each NT8 can produce step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a single derivation from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, every step splits one non-terminal into two. The string has 29 tokens, which suggests a derivation tree with approximately 29 leaves. The start symbol S would need to split into two non-terminals, each of which would split until we get to 29 tokens. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nEach production in CNF leads to an increase in the number of symbols by 1 at each step because each production splits a non-terminal into two. So starting from S (1 symbol), after 1 step, we have 2. After n steps, it's 1 + n. We need 29 tokens, so n = 28. That seems possible, so a leftmost derivation would have 28 splits.\n\nBut to confirm, let's try to break down the string step by step. The first token is `t8`, which must come from NT8 \u2192 't8'. Then the next token is `t0`, which must come from another NT8 production. Let's see, NT8 has multiple productions, so perhaps it's derived through NT8 itself.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree. Let me try to match the string against the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first `t8` which is from NT8 (since S can produce NT8 NT8). So the string starts with NT8 \u2192 't8', but actually, NT8 can only produce 't8' in one case directly. So if the first token is `t8`, it must come from a direct production, which means NT8 must have a production to `t8`.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, yes, NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 't8'. So that's how the first `t8` is generated.\n\nSo the leftmost symbol is generated by NT8, which is directly 't8'. Then the next symbol is `t0`. So the next `t0` must be generated by some NT8 as well, or another non-terminal that can produce `t0`.\n\nWait, but `t0` is also present in other NT9, NT10, etc. Let's see where `t0` can come from.\n\nLooking at NT5: NT5 \u2192 't0' but according to the grammar, NT5 can also be broken down further. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2 (from earlier) and also NT5 has a production NT5 \u2192 't0'. So NT5 can produce 't0' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', and also NT2 can be broken down into other non-terminals like NT9, NT4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps `t0` comes from NT5, which has a direct production. So in the first two steps, we have S \u2192 NT8 NT8, which then the first NT8 becomes `t8` and the second NT8 becomes something that leads to `t0`.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in a leftmost derivation, S would first split into two components, say NT8 and NT8. The leftmost symbol is handled by NT8, which is `t8`. So the next symbol would be from the first NT8's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down the string again:\n\n`t8 t0 t6 t4 t2 t8 t3 t7 t9 t4 t8 t9 t5 t9 t9 t0 t8 t8 t3 t5 t7 t10 t5 t5 t8 t9 t0`\n\nThis is quite a long string, so maybe it's better to use a recursive descent approach or top-down parsing, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the grammar's rules. Let's consider each part:\n\n1. The string starts with `t8`, which is generated by NT8 \u2192 `t8`. So the first symbol comes from NT8.\n\n2. The next token is `t0`. Let's see where `t0` can come from. Looking at the grammar, NT0 has several productions, including NT0 \u2192 't10', NT0 \u2192 't4', etc. But directly, is there a rule that produces `t0`? Yes, NT5 has NT5 \u2192 't0', and NT9 could also derive into `t0` via NT9 \u2192 't9' and so on, but wait, no, NT9 has a production to 't0' or others.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I notice that NT0 has productions that involve 't0', but perhaps NT9 can produce 't0' as well. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 't' something? Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT9 \u2192 't0' directly. Let me check the grammar structure again.\n\nWait, here's a rule: NT9 \u2192 't10' via NT9 \u2192 't9'? Or maybe I'm missing something. Let me systematically check each production for NT9:\n\nNT9 appears in several places, like:\n- NT9 \u2192 't9' (from NT9 \u2192 't9' under some rule)\n- NT9 \u2192 't10' (from a rule where NT9 is in a production leading to 't10')\nWait, actually, checking the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the production NT9:\n- There's a rule NT9 \u2192 't0' (from earlier in the grammar? Wait, no. Let me look through all NT9 productions.\n\nLooking through the provided rules for NT9, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 't9' (is that correct?) Hmm, wait, in the grammar, I see NT9 has production NT9 \u2192 't10' via a rule where NT9 appears on the left. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all rules where NT9 appears on the left:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I find:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11 (etc.)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\n- NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t3 t5 t4 t4 t10 t3 t0 t1 t9 t3 t2 t10 t0 t2 t8 t4 t4 t0 t5 t0 t3 t6 t5 t2 t2 t1 t10 t2`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's presented with a series of productions starting from S. All productions look like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So, it's definitely in CNF.\n\nLooking at the initial productions for S, they all turn S into combinations of NTs and some terminals. For example, S can become NT4 NT8, or NT1 NT2, etc. So each production uses two non-terminals.\n\nNow, I need to parse the string to see if it can be derived from the grammar, starting from S. Parsing in CNF usually suggests using a method like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not too familiar with that, maybe a recursive or stack-based approach could work.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to map each part of the string back through the productions. Let me list all the productions that lead to terminals. Each terminal production is a single symbol, and each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the top, S can be broken down into two non-terminals. Let's take the string and see if it can be divided into parts that match the possible expansions of those non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: `t3 t5 t4 t4 t10 t3 t0 t1 t9 t3 t2 t10 t0 t2 t8 t4 t4 t0 t5 t0 t3 t6 t5 t2 t2 t1 t10 t2`. It's quite long, 29 tokens. So, the initial S must expand into multiple parts, each of which splits into more non-terminals until each non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to try to factor the string into possible parts based on the grammar. Since every production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, the entire string should be a series of such splits, eventually leading to each terminal.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe it's easier to work from the top down. Let's see:\n\nS can go to NT4 NT8. Let's assume the string starts with NT4 NT8. Then, we can split the string into parts where the first part is NT4's expansion and the second is NT8's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 can become various combinations. Let me list NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT1\nNT4 -> NT9 NT2\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nWait, so NT4 can immediately produce 't0' or 't5'. Similarly, NT8 has several productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> NT4 NT4\nNT8 -> 't6'\nNT8 -> 't0'\n\nSo, S = NT4 NT8. So if NT4 is 't4', which is a terminal, but wait, looking at NT4's rules, there's no NT4 \u2192 t4. Wait, let me check the NT4 productions again.\n\nWait NT4 can go to 't0' or 't5'. So if S starts with NT4, and NT4 is 't0' or 't5', but the first token in the string is 't3', that can\u2019t be NT4 directly. So maybe the initial split isn't S -> NT4 NT8 for the first part, perhaps another production.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a way to start from the top and see if any production of S can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check each possibility step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be divided into segments that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's see. The string is: t3 t5 t4 t4 t10 t3 t0 t1 t9 t3 t2 t10 t0 t2 t8 t4 t4 t0 t5 t0 t3 t6 t5 t2 t2 t1 t10 t2.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let's count the tokens: the given string has 29 tokens. Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two parts, the total number of tokens should be 2^n -1 where n is the number of split steps. Wait, but in our case, the number of tokens is 29, which is 2^5 -1=31? No, 2^5-1 is 31. Hmm, 29 is not a power of two minus one. So that suggests that the grammar might not generate exactly 2^n -1 tokens, but maybe it's possible with multiple splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me first consider the possible productions for S. S can be NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2, etc.\n\nBut the first token in the string is 't3'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can directly expand to 't3'?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT3's productions: 't2', but no 't3'.\n\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, looking at the NT11 rule: NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, but in another part, NT11 can also be 't3' because somewhere in the list, for example:\n\nLooking at the list again, at the bottom, I see NT11 \u2192 't3'.\n\nAh, yes, at the end: NT11 -> 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals: NT4 has two rules: 't0' and 't5'. NT5 is 't0'. NT0 is 't10', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nYes, NT3 has a production 't2', but no 't3'. However, NT11 can produce 't3' directly.\n\nSo, perhaps in the string, one of the non-terminals expands to 't3' via NT11 \u2192 't3'.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't3', which could come from NT11.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial split is S = NT1 NT2, and then NT1 is something that can produce 't3'?\n\nWait, S can go to NT1 NT2. So S -> NT1 NT2. Then, we have to expand NT1 and NT2.\n\nNT1 has rules: NT11 -> NT12 NT8, NT1 -> NT9 NT13, etc. Let's see if any of NT1's productions can lead to 't3'.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\nNT1 -> NT10 NT1\nNT1 -> 't8'\nWait, wait, looking more carefully, I see NT1 has a production 't8', but no 't3'. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, is there a path from NT1 to 't3'? Let's think.\n\nLooking through the productions for NT1:\n\nIn the grammar, I don't see NT1 directly producing 't3'. So perhaps 't3' comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first 't3' might be from NT11 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo perhaps S = NT4 NT8, and NT4 somewhere breaks down into NT11 and others.\n\nWait, but NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', so if S is NT4 NT8, and NT4 is 't4', but 't4' isn't a terminal; NT4 can only go to 't0' or 't5'.\n\nHmm, that complicates things because T4 isn't in NT4's terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, looking at the string again: the first token is 't3', which could come from NT11 \u2192 't3'. So perhaps S is split into two parts, where one of them is NT11.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose NT11 is 't3', then the string starts with 't3', so the rest after the first 't3' should be the expansion of the other part of S's production.\n\nBut S can produce multiple things. Let me see, S can produce NT4 NT8, NT1 NT2, NT7 NT9 NT7 (I think), etc.\n\nWait, maybe the first two tokens: 't3 t5'. Let's see. The first token is 't3' from S = NT11, and then what's after.\n\nWait, perhaps S is being produced as NT4 NT8. If that's the case, then the first part is 't3' from NT4, and the second part is 't5' from NT8. But NT4 can't directly produce 't3' because NT4's rules are 't0' or 't5'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a valid expansion.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t0 t9 t4 t7 t4 t0 t8 t10 t0 t8 t9 t5 t10 t4 t1 t9 t0 t1 t7 t5 t1 t3 t8 t7 t2 t4 t8 t8\". That's quite a long string, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side except for the start symbol. The start symbol here is S. The strings in the grammar are made up of terminals and non-terminals, where terminals represent the actual characters, like 't0', 't9', etc., and non-terminals are like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nThe goal is to try to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string provided is a series of terminals, so our task is to see if there's a way to substitute the non-terminals down to the terminals to get exactly this string.\n\nStarting with S, the initial productions are S -> NT4 NT8 or S -> NT1 NT2. Let's see what the string starts with. The first token is 't0', which I see is a terminal in several rules. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 can produce 't0' (NT4 -> 't0'), and NT2 can also produce 't0' (NT2 -> 't0').\n\nSo, let's tentatively choose S -> NT4 NT8. Then we need to parse 't0' from NT4 and 't8' from NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce 't0', 't5', or 't7'. The first part is 't0', so NT4 can definitely produce 't0' because there's a rule NT4 -> 't0'. So that's good. Now, the second part is 't8' from NT8. Let's look at NT8's productions: NT8 can produce 't6', 't3', 't0', 't5', etc. The first is 't8' as a terminal? Wait, I don't see an NT8 production that just has 't8' directly. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules: \n\nI see NT10 -> 't1', NT13 -> 't4', NT13 -> 't6', etc. There's a NT8 production: NT8 -> 't0', 't5', 't7', but not directly 't8'. Hmm, so maybe I've made a mistake. Or perhaps 't8' is produced through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see what NT8 can produce. The grammar for NT8:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT8 -> NT1 NT5, NT8 -> NT6 NT13, etc. Oh, and in CNF, so each production must have two non-terminals.\n\nSo, NT8 -> NT6 NT3. Now, both NT6 and NT3 must be expanded into terminals. Let's check NT6: NT6 -> NT9 NT11, and both are non-terminals. NT9 -> 't0', 't10', etc., and NT11 -> 't3', etc. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, NT6: Rules say NT6 -> NT9 NT11. So to get 't8' from NT8, I need to expand NT8 into non-terminals until I reach terminal symbols. But 't8' is in the start symbol as NT8, but the productions for NT8 only go down to non-terminals, except perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules for NT8. Here's what I have:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nWait, no direct 't8' production. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with 't0', so perhaps we should try S -> NT1 NT2 instead. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption of S -> NT4 NT8 leading to 't0' is incorrect. Maybe the first 't0' comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the possible ways to produce 't0' and see if they can be part of a chain that forms the string.\n\nLooking for 't0' terminals, they can come from:\n\n- NT0: NT0 can go to NT10 NT13, NT0 NT6, etc., but several directly produce 't0':\nWait, let me look at the rules again. Here are some productions where the non-terminal goes directly to 't0':\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't0' (multiple rules: NT0 -> 't10', 't4', etc., but maybe other rules have 't0'?)\nWait, actually, I'm seeing:\n\nFrom the rules, NT0's productions:\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT10\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT1\n- NT0 -> NT13 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT7 NT10\n- etc.\n\nHmm, not seeing a direct 't0' from NT0. Unless I missed a rule.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rules. Let me reread the rules carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT6 -> 't3', 't9', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't0', 't9', 't10', 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't0', 't10', etc.\n- NT10 -> 't1', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, I think I see some rules:\n\nNT4 can produce 't0', 't5', 't7'.\nNT2 can produce 't0', 't5', 't7'.\nNT9: Let's check: NT9 -> 't0', 't10', etc. So 't0' is a terminal in NT9.\n\nSo possible sources for 't0':\n\n- NT4\n- NT2\n- NT9\n\nSo the string starts with 't0', which could come from NT4, NT2, or NT9.\n\nLet me try choosing S -> NT4 NT8 first.\n\nSo NT4 can produce 't0' (so that gives us the first token). Now, the second part of S is NT8. From NT8, as per the rules, it goes to NT6 NT3, which are non-terminals. Let's see if we can get 't8' from that.\n\nWait, but 't8' is a terminal. So perhaps NT8 must produce a sequence that includes 't8' along the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't8' can be derived from some other path. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the first 't0' could be from another non-terminal, which allows the rest of the production to follow.\n\nBut to make progress, let's go back to S -> NT4 NT8, leading to 't0' from NT4, then trying to produce 't8' from NT8.\n\nSince NT8's productions are all into non-terminals, perhaps I need to find a chain where NT8 eventually produces 't8' through some substitutions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a production for NT8 that ends up with 't8' eventually. Let me check the rules for NT8:\n\nNT8: NT6 NT3, NT1 NT5, NT6 NT13, NT7 NT11, etc. Hmm, none of these seem to directly produce 't8', but I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe through another path, NT6 or NT3 can produce 't8'. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 -> NT9 NT11, both non-terminals. NT9 can produce 't0', 't10', etc. NT11 -> NT3 NT11, which is recursive. Not sure if that leads to 't8'.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 -> 't2', 't7', etc. 't2' is a terminal. So NT3 -> 't2'.\n\nHmm, not helpful. Let's try another approach. Maybe the initial choice of S -> NT4 NT8 isn't the right one. Let me try S -> NT1 NT2 instead.\n\nSo first production is 't0' and the rest. Since the first token is 't0', we can consider S -> NT2 NT0 or S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, S's rules are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nS -> NT11 NT2\n\nWait, so if I choose S -> NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t5 t4 t4 t2 t3 t1 t10 t5 t9 t0 t7 t0 t9 t10 t2 t8 t5 t7 t2 t2 t9 t4 t9 t1 t0 t2 t9 t8 t9`. Hmm, that's a long string, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are parsed using either recursive descent, the CYK algorithm, or some other method. But since the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a specific form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all productions are in CNF, which is good. Each rule has either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. That helps because the CYK algorithm can efficiently parse strings in polynomial time.\n\nSo the plan is to apply the CYK algorithm to this string. But doing that manually for a string of length 30 might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can start by analyzing the structure of the grammar and see if the string fits the possible derivations.\n\nFirst, let's note that the grammar starts with non-terminals S, which can produce NT1 NT4 NT8 or other combinations, but looking at the grammar, S seems to have multiple possibilities. Wait, actually, the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but then other productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So S can generate different sequences based on these rules.\n\nBut each of these is followed by other rules, so perhaps the string needs to start with a combination that can be broken down into these rules. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t5 t4 t4. Wait, but looking at the grammar, t5 is a terminal, and we have productions that generate t5, like NT4 \u2192 t0, t4, t5. So maybe that's a clue.\n\nWait, let me look at the individual rules. Let me scan through the non-terminals and their productions to see which produce which terminals.\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n\nLooking at NT5, the productions are NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2 and NT5 \u2192 NT0 NT2. And t2 is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT10 \u2192 t1 and NT2 \u2192 t2.\n\nWait, let's get a list of all terminals in the grammar. From the production rules, we have terminals like t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11. So 11 terminals in total.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5. Let's see which NT can produce t5. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 t4, t0, t5. So NT4 can produce t5, among others. Also, NT5 \u2192 t0, t4, t5, but since t5 is a terminal, it's perhaps produced by NT5?\n\nWait, NT5's rules are NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT7 and NT5 \u2192 NT0 NT2. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each non-terminal and their productions:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5. Wait, that's two non-terminals on the right. So NT11 is a non-terminal that produces NT8 and NT5. But NT8 and NT5 are themselves non-terminals. So unless we look deeper, this isn't directly producing a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list all non-terminals and their immediate productions:\n\nLet me list each non-terminal and the rules it has:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, NT1 NT2\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13, NT11 NT11, NT6 NT3, NT8 NT8, NT0 NT10, other (there are more)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1, NT0 NT6, etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT2 NT4, NT12 NT8, etc.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4, NT3 NT12, etc.\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT11, NT6 NT10, NT13 NT5, etc.\n- NT7 has several rules, including NT11 NT6, etc.\n- NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT11 also has NT3 NT11\n- NT0 has multiple options: NT6 NT3, NT11 NT11, etc.\n- NT13 can produce t2, t4, t5, etc.\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Maybe instead of trying to match the entire string, I can look for possible ways the string can be generated, step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5 t4 t4 t2 t3 t1 t10 t5 t9 t0 t7 t0 t9 t10 t2 t8 t5 t7 t2 t2 t9 t4 t9 t1 t0 t2 t9 t8 t9.\n\nLooking at the beginning, it starts with t5. Which non-terminals can produce a terminal?\n\nFrom the rules, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (non-terminal) and NT5 \u2192 NT0 NT2 (non-terminals). So that can't directly produce t5. However, NT4 \u2192 t0, t4, t5. So NT4 can produce t5. So perhaps the string starts with NT4 producing t5. But NT4 is a non-terminal in the starting productions of S.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which is one possibility, then the first symbol is t5, which is the result of NT4 \u2192 t5. That could work.\n\nSo the string starts with t5, which comes from NT4.\n\nThen comes t4, t4. So after producing t5, the next part would be t4. Let's look at NT4's rules: it can produce t4, so perhaps NT4 again produces t4, but wait, NT4 is consuming two symbols, so perhaps NT4's first production is t5, then the next t4 would come from another NT4?\n\nWait, let me try to model this step by step.\n\nThe first part of the string is t5 t4 t4. Suppose the first rule is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then the first t5 comes from NT4's t5 rule. Then, the next symbols are t4, t4. So perhaps the second NT4 from S \u2192 NT4 NT8 produces t4, and the NT8 from S produces t4? Let's see.\n\nWait, S produces NT4 NT8, so after producing t5, the remaining symbols would be t4 t4 t2... etc. So if the first NT4 produces t5, then the NT8 would have to produce the rest. But NT8 can produce t6, t3, t1, t9, etc.\n\nWait, maybe this isn't the way to go. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Use the CYK algorithm. Let's identify the string length, which is 30. The CYK algorithm will take O(n) time where n is 30, but since it's manual, I'll have to see if there's a pattern that fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into parts that correspond to specific productions.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the string from the start using the grammar.\n\nLooking for a possible way the string can start:\n\nt5 t4 t4... So perhaps t5 is from NT4 \u2192 t5. Then t4 is another NT4 \u2192 t4. Then maybe another t4 from somewhere else. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be constructed by multiple NT4 rules. Let's see, but in the S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then after producing t5, the next would need to be t4 t4 something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with NT8, which can produce various terms. Looking at NT8's productions: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13, NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT12, NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think of the string as starting with NT8. Let me see.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5 t4 t4. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, the NT4 produces t5, and the NT8 produces t4 t4.\n\nBut let's see if that's possible. S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t5 (one production).\n\nNT8 can produce t4 if it has a rule that can produce t4.

Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.

Maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nWait, let me note that each rule is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation appends two new symbols. Wait, but the string is quite long, so perhaps I can try to parse it by looking for possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t10, so the first part must be derived from NT10. Let's see what NT10 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT10's productions:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT9 NT6\nBut NT9 \u2192 't10' (direct terminal), so NT9 would start with t10.\n\nThen, NT10 \u2192 't10' followed by NT6. So the string starts with 't10 t6 ...' or 't10 ...'. Looking at the string, after 't10' comes 't3', so perhaps NT10 is not the start here. Alternatively, maybe NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to start from the beginning.\n\nLet me consider the initial 't10'. So perhaps the first production is from NT10 \u2192 NT9 NT6, leading to 't10' (since NT9 \u2192 't10'). Then after 't10', the NT6 contributes another symbol. Let's see what NT6 can produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11 (from the rules). NT9 \u2192 't10', so NT6 would produce 't10' followed by NT11. So maybe after 't10', the next would be 't10' again? But in the string, after 't10' comes 't3', so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol 't10' is produced by NT10, and then we have to check its expansion.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the initial 't10' comes from NT10 \u2192 't10'...? No, looking at the rules, NT10 only has productions involving other non-terminals, except for NT10 \u2192 't6' (I think not, let me double-check).\n\nLooking back, for NT10: I see NT10 \u2192 NT9 NT6, and no direct production to 't10'. Wait, did I miss it?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT10 producing a single terminal 't10'. So the only way to get 't10' is via NT9, which directly outputs 't10'. But NT9 is a non-terminal that might be expanded from other symbols.\n\nSo perhaps the initial part of the string 't10 t3 t7 t3...' comes from a path where one of the NT9's expansions is involved.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the string starts with 't10', so the first production must be from a non-terminal that can derive 't10'.

Looking again, the non-terminals' productions: I don't see NT10 \u2192 't10' directly. Instead, NT9 \u2192 't10' is direct. So NT9 can produce 't10', and I need to see if NT9 can be part of the initial productions.\n\nWait, the start symbols are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT1 NT2, S \u2192 NT11 NT6. None of these directly produce 't10', so the first symbol must come from one of the non-terminals in these productions.\n\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8: The first symbol could be the first part of NT4 or NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 't4', 't5', 't7', etc. Let's see the productions for NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7, NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1, etc. So NT4 can produce multiple combinations, possibly leading to 't10' somehow later in the string.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT1 NT2: NT1 could produce 't1' or 't8', and NT2 can produce 't2', 't5', etc. Wait, perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT11 NT6, leading to the first symbol being part of NT11 or NT6.\n\nNT11's productions: NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, which might lead to more NT11's, but also NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11, etc. Hmm, this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol is part of NT4 or NT5, etc. I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nMaybe instead of trying to build the entire derivation, I can check if all tokens in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking through the string, the first token is 't10' which I think comes from NT9, as NT9 \u2192 't10'. Then the next token is 't3', which could come from NT3, which is a terminal. But let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT3 \u2192 't2' (from NT3 \u2192 't2'), but there's also NT3 \u2192 't2' and another path involving NT7's.

{"custom_id":"request-582","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. The grammar starts with S and has several production rules. Each rule seems to break down a symbol into two other symbols, which is typical for CNF. I see a lot of NT symbols, which I assume are non-terminals since they can be further broken down until they reach terminals, which are the actual words like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: t10, t6, t2, t5, t2, t7, t2, t6, t10, t2, t10, t9, t8, t0, t9, t9, t5, t8, t7, t9, t1, t5, t7, t1, t7, t7, t7, t1, t8, t5.\n\nI remember that for Chomsky normal form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I can see that each non-terminal eventually resolves into a terminal symbol, so this is indeed a proper CNF grammar.\n\nMy task is to determine if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. This means I need to trace backward from the string, checking if each step is valid by applying the reverse of the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can also use a top-down approach, starting from S and expanding it until I get the string. However, given the length of the string, doing it manually would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or sub-strings that are present in the grammar and see if they appear in the string.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules that directly produce terminal symbols. These will be the leaf nodes in the derivation tree.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that many non-terminals resolve directly to terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT8 \u2192 t0\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT10 \u2192 t6, t1, t3\n- NT13 \u2192 t4, t6, t2\n- NT0 \u2192 t10, t4, etc.\n\nWait, some of these are same: NT7 is t0 and NT8 is t0, so both resolve to the same terminal.\n\nSo the string has a lot of t0s and other terminals. Let's see if each of these terminals appears in the grammar as direct productions.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all direct terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT8 \u2192 t0\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT10 \u2192 t6, t1, t3\n- NT13 \u2192 t4, t6, t2\n\nSo the terminals we can get are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are all present except maybe t7, which is a non-terminal because the rule for NT7 is NT7 \u2192 t0. Wait, no\u2014wait, the rule for NT7 is actually \"NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\". So NT7 is a non-terminal that can only produce other symbols, but in the list above, I see that NT7 can also produce t0.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nWait, no, looking back, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of production rules. Let me recheck:\n\nLine 3 says S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nLine 4: S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n\nLine 5: S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nThen continues with more rules.\n\nWait, looking through, I see some production rules for non-terminals that result in terminals, like:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t2\n\nNT5 \u2192 t0\n\nNT7 \u2192 t0\n\nNT8 \u2192 t0\n\nNT1 \u2192 t8\n\nNT9 \u2192 t10\n\nNT10 \u2192 t6, t1, t3\n\nNT13 \u2192 t4, t6, t2\n\nSo, the direct terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 (wait, no: NT5 \u2192 t0), wait, NT5 is t0, NT9 is t10, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I confused some. Let me list all the direct productions to terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5 \u2192 which eventually can go to t0 and t0, so NT11 \u2192 t0 t0\n\nSimilarly, NT7 \u2192 t9 NT7, but I'm not sure if it can go to t0. Wait no, NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, but not directly t0. Wait, but in the list above, I have some direct productions where NT7 \u2192 t0. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the list of rules, I see:\n\nLine 25: NT7 \u2192 t0\n\nYes, under NT7\u2019s rules, there's NT7 \u2192 t0.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 \u2192 t6, t1, t3.\n\nNT13 \u2192 t4, t6, t2.\n\nAlso, NT5 \u2192 t0, NT8 \u2192 t0, NT1 \u2192 t8, NT9 \u2192 t10, NT3 \u2192 t2.\n\nSo the terminals in the string are all in t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10. Oh wait, t7 is a non-terminal because the only rule for NT7 is NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, but also NT7 can go directly to t0 and maybe other things if I missed it.\n\nWait no, looking back, I see NT7 has:\n\nLine 16: NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nLine 19: NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the list of rules, let's see where NT7 appears.\n\nNT7 is defined in lines:\n\nYes, line 19: NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nLine 20: NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up the lines. The user listed the rules as separate lines, so let me count:\n\nAfter S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nThen the rest are NT rules.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, let's find all NT7's rules:\n\nThe rules list goes up to line 40, with each line representing a new non-terminal and two possible rules.\n\nI see that:\n\nNT7 has a rule:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t0 (line 25?)\n\nWait, maybe I should go step by step.\n\nWait, it's a bit confusing, but perhaps a better approach is to note that each non-terminal either can be a terminal or can produce other non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to think that since all the non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals, the string must consist exclusively of these terminals, and each symbol must correspond to a production.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to parse the string from the terminals upwards, trying to match production rules in reverse.\n\nBut that might take time.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider if the string can be generated by the grammar by trying to split the string according to production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write down the entire string and see if it can be split into substrings that match the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the leftmost derivation, starting from S, and try to generate the string step by step.\n\nGiven the string: t10 t6 t2 t5 t2 t7 t2 t6 t10 t2 t10 t9 t8 t0 t9 t9 t5 t8 t7 t9 t1 t5 t7 t1 t7 t7 t1 t8 t5.\n\nLet's start from S, which is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo first, the string starts with t10 and t6. Let's see if 't10 t6' can be derived from NT4 NT8.\n\nWait, let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce. From the production rules:\n\nLooking at NT4:\n\nLine 14: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n\nLine 17: NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n\nSo NT4 can be split into NT14 NT7 or NT9 NT2.\n\nSimilarly, NT8:\n\nLooking at NT8: Line 16: NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nLine 29: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n\nOr perhaps others.\n\nWait, let's double-check.

{"custom_id":"request-585","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is quite long, so I need a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me list out the grammar rules and the terminals. The terminals are all the symbols that are not non-terminals, as per the grammar. The string is: t5 t6 t1 t9 t0 t1 t9 t4 t4 t6 t2 t7 t10 t10 t3 t5 t8 t2 t1 t4 t4 t0 t2 t9 t5 t9 t5 t6 t3 t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are: t5, t6, t1, t9, t0, t2, t7, t10, t3, t4, t8. So all the words in the string are terminals, which is good because if any were non-terminals, the string couldn't be in the language.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are two non-terminals. The problem is to derive the string starting from S, expanding according to the rules until only terminals are left.\n\nLet me list the production rules again, focusing on the non-terminals and how they expand.\n\nS can go to NT4 NT8, or NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nFor example, S->NT4 NT8. If I expand NT4 and NT8 into terminals, what do I get? Let me check the NT4 rule: NT4 can go to NT14 NT7. Then NT14 can go to NT3 NT4, and NT3 can go to NT7 NT1. Hmm, this seems recursive, but let's see if we can reach a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let's start with the start symbol S and see possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is t5, which comes from NT13 -> 't5' (wait, no, checking the grammar, I see NT4 has 't0' and 't5' as options). Wait, no, actually, for NT4, the terminals are 't0' and 't5' (looking back: NT4->'t0' and 't5'). Similarly, NT2 has 't2' and 't5'. So for the initial string, starting with t5, I think the first step should involve NT4 or something else.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar more carefully:\n\nNT4 appears in multiple places. The first rule is S->NT4 NT8. So S can be the start by expanding to NT4 and NT8. Then, each of these can be further expanded.\n\nI think a good approach is to look for patterns in the string. Let me see if I can split the string into parts that might correspond to the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t5. From the grammar, I see NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', so maybe the first production is S->NT4 NT8. Then, NT4 could expand to 't5' and NT8 could expand to 't6' perhaps? Let me check NT8's rules. Looking back, NT8 can go to NT6 NT3, or NT9 NT5, etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT8 has several productions:\n- NT8->'t6' (looking at the rules, under NT8: NT8->'t6' is not a production. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, under NT0->'t4', under NT4->'t0', 't5', etc. Wait, under NT8's rules, I don't see a direct terminal, so I need to check where NT8 leads.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT8's rules are:\n\n- NT8->'t0' (from NT3->'t2', but that's another node)\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n- NT0 -> 't10' (looking under NT9->'t10' and NT0->'t4', etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals and their productions, categorizing which produce terminals and which produce other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the entire string and find a possible derivation.\n\nWait, but this might be time-consuming. Maybe we can approach it as follows: the string starts with t5. Looking for a production that ends with t5. NT4 can produce 't5', as per the rule NT4->'t5'. So perhaps the first part of the string comes from NT4.\n\nThen, NT4 is derived from S via S->NT4 NT8. So after expanding S, we have NT4 NT8, which must produce the string. So the first symbol t5 would come from NT4, and the rest of the string comes from NT8.\n\nWait, but the full expansion is S->NT4 NT8, so after derivation, we have something like [t5][...] = t5 followed by t6 t1 t9... etc.\n\nSo let's see, from NT4, we can produce 't5' with one step, but wait, NT4 can produce 't5' directly, right? Let me check: looking at NT4's productions, one of them is NT4->'t0', another is 't5'. So yes, NT4 can directly produce 't5'. So in that case, S->NT4 NT8 can produce 't5' followed by whatever NT8 produces.\n\nNow, what about NT8? Let's see, NT8's productions are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT8:\n\n- NT8->'t0' ?\nWait, no. Let's see: the grammar rules, I need to check where NT8 is defined.\n\nLooking through, I don't see an NT8 -> 't6' immediately. Wait, under NT0->'t4', but I'm looking for NT8's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT8 is defined here: \"NT8->'t6' NT3\" No, wait, that can't be. Wait, let me look correctly.\n\nWait, I think I need to go through each production rule line by line.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the productions with the non-terminals and their possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find a way to split the string into parts that fit possible derivations.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5 t6 t1 t9 t0 t1 t9 t4 t4 t6 t2 t7 t10 t10 t3 t5 t8 t2 t1 t4 t4 t0 t2 t9 t5 t9 t5 t6 t3 t2.\n\nThat's a lot. Let's look for possible splits.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should be a power of 2 if the grammar uses only binary expansions, but in this case, it's more complex.\n\nWait, but the string's length is 34. Hmm, maybe not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t5 comes from NT4, as we thought. Then, the entire string is the expansion of NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the first part is t5, and the rest is t6 t1 t9 ... up to the end, which is t2.\n\nNow, after t5, the next symbol is t6. Let's see how t6 can be produced.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6's productions. Wait, wait: in the list of grammar rules, I see NT10->'t3', but that may not be relevant. Let me see what produces 't6'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think 't6' is produced by NT0->'t6' somewhere. Wait, checking the rules: \"NT0 -> 't4'\". Wait, let me go through each production and find where the terminals are.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0' | 't5' (so 't4' is not a terminal, but wait, no: NT4->'t0' and 't5' are terminals, not 't4'. I might have misread earlier.)\n\nWait, this is crucial. Let me check each non-terminal's productions.\n\nLet me list the terminal symbols: the terminal symbols are the ones that appear as 'word's in the grammar rules without being a non-terminal. So the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides are all pairs of non-terminals except when they produce terminals.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. In CNF, each production is either a terminal pair or a combination of two non-terminals. So, every production looks like A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t1 t4 t2 t5 t8 t3 t5 t2 t6 t1 t3 t10 t1 t4 t9 t4 t3 t9 t2 t1 t7 t0 t0 t3 t5 t4 t8 t0 t7 t5 t3`.\n\nHmm, that's quite a long string. Let me see how the non-terminals break down. Each non-terminal probably represents a part of the string that can be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol, which is 'S'. In the grammar, I see that S has several productions. Let me list them:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, S can expand into two NTs. Let's pick the first one: NT4 and NT8.\n\nWhat is NT4? Looking at the rules, NT4 can go to 't0' or 't5'. Oh, but wait, in the string, I have a 't4' early on. Hmm, maybe there's another NT for t4. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, that's right. NT4 is a non-terminal, and the productions for NT4 are to t0 and t5. So perhaps the string has 't4' which would require NT that expands to t4. Let me check other non-terminals.\n\nLooking for 't4', I see that NT6 has a production to 't9' and 't11' (from NT6 -> NT9 NT11), and NT11 has 't3'. NT5 has 't0' and 't2'. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make a list of each non-terminal and their possible productions to see if they include the required terminals.\n\nNT1: appears in several rules, but I don't see it expanding into any terminal. Hmm, is NT1 a terminal? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the list of productions, NT0 to NT13, but I don't see NT1 being replaced by a terminal. Actually, looking again, I see NT1 -> NT9 NT13, which are non-terminals. So NT1 is a non-terminal. So that would mean that 't1' must be produced from NT1 somehow. But I can't see any production for NT1 that leads to a terminal. So that's a problem. Similarly, NT2 is only in rules that start with NT2 -> NT0 NT0, etc., but no production for NT2 in terminals. So maybe NT2 can only produce 't2', but looking at the rules, I see NT2 -> 't2' only once? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't2' (once)\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT10 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT5 etc.\n\nWait, the production NT2 -> 't2' is there, so that means NT2 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Or is it? Wait, in CNF, non-terminals can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a production has a terminal, it's a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal.\n\nSo, looking at the rules, NT2 is a non-terminal because it has productions like NT2 -> NT0 NT0, etc. But the rule NT2 -> 't2' would suggest that NT2 can also directly produce the terminal 't2'. That seems contradictory. Because in CNF, a production can be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So if a non-terminal has a production that goes to two non-terminals and also to a terminal, that's acceptable.\n\nWait, so NT2 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't2'. So the problem is, when we have 't1' in the string, we might need to see how it can be produced. But in the rules, NT1 only can produce other non-terminals, no terminal. So that would be a problem because 't1' is in the string, but NT1 can't produce a terminal. So perhaps S can't generate the string because it requires NT1 to produce t1, which it can't.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm looking at all the rules correctly.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production for NT1 that leads to a terminal. For example, all the productions for NT1 go to other non-terminals. So if the string contains 't1', it's impossible because NT1 can't be a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string has 't1's which can't be generated by any production, so the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some production for NT1 that expands to a terminal. Let me check all the rules again for NT1.\n\nLooking through all the productions, NT1's productions are:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT1 -> NT13 NT11\n- NT1 -> NT11 NT10\n- NT1 -> NT10 NT1\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT1\n- NT1 isn't present in any terminal-producing rules.\n\nSo, no.

The string is: `t7 t1 t10 t9 t10 t0 t9 t9 t1 t2 t9 t8 t3 t4 t9 t5 t4 t1 t8 t2 t8 t5 t3 t0 t7 t9 t7 t7 t10 t5 t8`.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) have production rules that derive strings in a top-down manner, starting from the start symbol. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The initial productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the first step is to expand S using one of these. Let's choose the first one because the string starts with t7. Wait, let me check the string: it starts with t7, but the productions starting with NT4 or NT1 might not directly lead to t7. Hmm, perhaps I should see which non-terminals can derive 't7' or other terminal symbols first.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't10'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', 't9'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2', 't7'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT11 \u2192 't3', 't11'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't10'... Wait, maybe I need to see how each non-terminal can produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can reach the string.\n\nLet's try to see if the string starts with any of the possible branches. The string starts with t7. Let me look at the productions that can derive 't7'. From the terminal productions, I see that NT3 \u2192 t7. So, if I have a production that leads to NT3, that could be part of the string. Also, looking at the rules, NT3 might be derived from other non-terminals. Let me check the production rules for non-terminals that lead to NT3.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT3 can be derived from, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11, but wait, NT7 can be 't0' or 't10', not 't7'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look into the string and break it down into parts that correspond to the productions. Let me try to parse the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals as I go.\n\nThe string starts with t7. From the rules, only NT3 can produce t7. So, the first production must involve NT3. Looking at where NT3 appears, it's produced by, for example, NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11. Wait, that might not be helpful directly. Alternatively, maybe NT3 is derived from other non-terminals, like NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11.\n\nBut wait, if NT3 is only directly reachable from NT3's own production, which seems a bit circular. Alternatively, perhaps NT3 is derived from NT11, which is not helpful. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\nt7 \u2192 NT3\nt1 \u2192 NT10\nt10 \u2192 NT10\nt9 \u2192 NT9\nt0 \u2192 NT9, NT4, NT5, NT7, etc.\nt2 \u2192 NT2\nt5 \u2192 NT4, NT2\nt8 \u2192 NT8\nt3 \u2192 NT3\nt4 \u2192 NT13, NT4\nt6 \u2192 NT1, NT11, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can model the string as a series of terminals and see if each can be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree step by step would help. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol S can expand to S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let me check the string: it starts with t7, but NT4 is either t4, t5, or t7. Wait, looking at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7, or NT4 \u2192 't0', or NT4 \u2192 't5'. Hmm, but NT4 can't produce t7 directly. Wait, no, wait: In the terminal productions, NT4 has two options: 't0' and 't5'. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me recheck the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't1'\nNT7 \u2192 't0'\nNT7 \u2192 't10'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n\nWait, no. Looking again: In the terminal productions, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo NT4 can produce either 't0' or 't5', but not 't7'. So how does the string start with t7? If S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then perhaps NT1 can derive t7.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: Are there any terminal productions for NT1? I don't see any. All seem to be non-terminals. So NT1 only produces other non-terminals, so starting with NT1 might not help since t7 is a terminal.\n\nWait, so maybe the first expansion must be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but NT4 can't produce t7, so that path might not work. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is needed, but then NT1 can't produce t7 as per the given productions. So maybe the string doesn't start with NT1 or NT4, but instead through some other pathway.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar for NT3.\n\nIn the terminal productions, NT3 \u2192 't2', 't7'. Oh, wait! NT3 can produce 't7'. So if I have a production that leads to NT3, that can produce 't7'. So perhaps the string starts with NT3.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals that can produce NT3: I see NT3 is listed under NT3 \u2192 't2', 't7'. So NT3 is a terminal itself, meaning it's a leaf node. So, if the first part of the string is t7, then it's produced by NT3.\n\nNow, which non-terminal can derive NT3? Looking at the production rules, I see:\n\nNT3 can be derived from NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11. But NT7 can produce 't0' or 't10'. Wait, but for NT7's production, if it's NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11, then that would mean NT7 can derive a string that starts with NT3, which is t2 or t7, followed by NT11, which eventually can produce more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion should be from another non-terminal. Let's think: S has two main productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nLooking at the string, starting with t7, so perhaps via another path, but from S, the initial production must be one of these.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT3 NT7, but looking back, I don't see a production for S to NT3 NT7. Let me check the productions again. S's productions are only NT4 NT8 and NT1 NT2. So S cannot directly produce NT3. Therefore, unless there's a way for NT4 or NT1 to derive NT3, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed something. Let's look at the productions for non-terminals that lead to NT3 or t7.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 is a terminal, and its productions are 't2' and 't7'. Also, NT7 can produce 't0' or 't10', but that's not helpful for t7. Oh wait, no: NT7 is a non-terminal that can be expanded further. Let me look more carefully.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 or NT5 NT2. So, for example, NT7 can expand to NT5 NT2, then NT2 can expand further, etc. But since NT3 is a terminal, perhaps we can find a way to derive it through other non-terminals. Wait, no, NT3 is a terminal, so it must be produced directly.\n\nBut S can't produce NT3 directly. Therefore, maybe the string doesn't start with NT3, which would be a problem because the first symbol is t7, which is NT3 \u2192 't7'.

Each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly one terminal.

Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nLooking through the rule list, I see lines like:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT5 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT8 -> 't0'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT5 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so NT3 can produce 't2', NT5 can produce 't0', etc. But the string's first token is 't8', which is different. So is 't8' a terminal in the grammar? Looking back, I don't see any NT producing 't8' as a terminal. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT8 -> 't0' once, but I don't see 't8' as a terminal anywhere. So that's confusing because the string starts with 't8'.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. If the string starts with t8, but in the grammar, no non-terminal directly derives t8, so t8 cannot be a terminal. So this means the string cannot be generated by the grammar because 't8' is not present as a terminal.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the end of the rules:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT5 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT8 -> 't0'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT5 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT producing 't8' as a terminal. That must mean the production rules don't have 't8' as a terminal, so t8 cannot appear in any generated string. Therefore, if the string starts with t8, it's impossible because no rule produces 't8'.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. Because in the grammar, all the terminal rules are for t0, t2, t3, t4, t5, t10. So 't8' is not a terminal, meaning that the grammar can't produce any string containing 't8'. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, let me check. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there a way to derive 't8'? Let's see.\n\nLet's see if any non-terminal can produce 't8' via a chain. For example, if any production leads to 't8', but in the rules, I don't see any NT with 't8' as a terminal. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't8' is generated through some left or right derivation, but since it's not a terminal, it's only possible if some non-terminal produces it directly, which doesn't exist.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since the string starts with 't8', which the grammar can't produce because there's no rule for it, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The initial symbol is S, so I need to see if S can derive the string step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S has productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nI'll need to expand S using these. Let's choose the first production: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now, I'll need to derive the string starting with NT4 producing something and NT8 producing something else.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 has several options, all leading to terminals. For instance, NT4 can go directly to 't0' or 't5' or other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT8's productions are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT8 has several non-terminals, so we'll need to expand those.\n\nBut let's approach this systematically. I'll try to parse the string step by step, looking for a possible derivation.\n\nThe string starts with t5. So, I need to see if any of NT1 to NT13 can produce t5.\n\nLooking at the NT list:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 several options, including t0 or t5.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2, which could eventually produce t0 or other t's.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT12 NT9, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 several non-terminals and terminals.\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT0 has multiple productions, including t10, t4, etc.\n- NT10 \u2192 t1 and others.\n- NT11 \u2192 t3, etc.\n- NT13 \u2192 t2, etc.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t5, which must come from NT4, since NT4's production includes t5 (e.g., NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 \u2192 t5 t7). Wait, but NT4's production NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT4 would go to t5 t4, etc. Alternatively, NT4 \u2192 t5 is also a possibility.\n\nWait, from NT4's productions, one option is NT4 \u2192 t5 (if it's directly a terminal). Looking back, yes, in the NT4 productions: NT4 \u2192 t5. So, NT4 can directly produce 't5'.\n\nSo, the first part can be NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nNow, the remaining string after t5 is: t0 t9 t3 t5 t1 t9 t9 t2 t8 t7 t0 t7 t1 t8 t8 t7 t0 t0 t2 t2 t7 t8 t4 t7 t6 t5 t8 t4 t6 t0 t0.\n\nBut wait, after producing t5 from NT4, the next non-terminal is NT8 because the production was S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So the next symbol should be from NT8.\n\nLooking at the next symbol: t0, which is a terminal. So NT8 must produce 't0' as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, one of them is NT8 \u2192 t9 NT7. Alternatively, NT8 \u2192 t0? Wait, let's check NT8:\n\nWait, checking NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nWait, none of these directly produce a 't0'. Wait, but looking back at the NT8 productions, is there any that produce 't0'?\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, the NT entries have productions like NT9 \u2192 t0, but for NT8, looking through its productions, none seem to directly produce a terminal except maybe via expansion.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. The productions for NT8 are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nIs there any production for NT8 that leads directly to a terminal? Looking through, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps NT8 can produce 't0' via another path. Let's see: If NT8 can go to NT9 NT7, and NT9 goes to t0.\n\nSo, the possibilities for NT8 are multiple. So, for the second symbol, t0, we need to see if NT8 can produce 't0' as the next symbol.\n\nOne way is if NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and then NT9 produces t0, and NT7 \u2192 t0 or something leading to t0.\n\nBut the second symbol is t0, so NT8 must produce 't0' directly or via terminals in the next step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT8 has a production that directly leads to 't0', but I don't see such a production in the user's grammar. Looking through, NT8's direct productions are to non-terminals. So, the next symbol after NT8 must be produced by a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5 t0..., so after NT4 produces t5, NT8 must produce the next symbols. Since the next symbol is t0, perhaps NT8 produces 't0' through a chain. Let's see:\n\nLet me think: NT8 can produce NT6 NT13. Then, NT6 can produce NT9 NT11, and so on. Maybe through this expansion, t0 can appear directly.\n\nBut this could get complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to attempt a top-down parsing approach.\n\nStarting with S, which can go to NT4 NT8. So, first token is t5, which must come from NT4.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t5, so the next production would be NT8. Now, the next token after t5 is t0, so NT8 needs to produce t0 as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nOne option is NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7. So, if NT8 produces NT9 and NT7, then:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t0, which would give us t0 immediately.\n\nSo, that could work. So, NT8 can go to NT9 NT7, and NT9 \u2192 t0, giving us t0. That matches the second symbol.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are t5 t0, which are derived from S \u2192 NT4 (t5) followed by NT8 \u2192 NT9 (t0) and NT7.\n\nWait, but the NT7 needs to be followed by something else, but let's check:\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7 \u2192 t0 (from NT9) and then NT7 must produce something.\n\nBut in the string, after t0, the next symbol is t9, so we have t5 t0 t9...\n\nWait, this doesn't match, because after t0 from NT9, we have NT7. So after t0, the next symbol should be the next terminal produced by NT7.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT9 \u2192 t0, then NT7 must produce something that starts with t9. So, perhaps NT7 can produce t9 via one of its productions.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\nAnd other non-terminals. Wait, one of these productions could lead to 't9'.\n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9. So if NT7 expands to NT12 and NT9, and NT12 can produce t9.\n\nWait, looking at NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12\nNT12 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce a terminal except perhaps through further expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another path where NT8 can produce t0 after t5, leading to t0 t9 as the next symbols, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nMaybe I should try a different approach.

My task is to determine whether the string is generated by the given grammar. The string is pretty long, so I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has several productions, some of which are non-terminals leading to different variables or terminals. \n\nMy string starts with `t8 t3 t6 t5...` and ends with various terminals. Since the string is all terminals except a couple of non-terminals mixed in, I need to see if each non-terminal can be expanded into the string correctly.\n\nI notice that the string starts with `t8`. Looking at the grammar, I check which productions produce 't8'. I see several NT rules that end with 't8'. For example, NT12 -> NT8 NT9 and NT4 -> 't8'. Hmm, so whenever NT12 or NT4 expand, they might lead to 't8's.\n\nLet's think about the structure. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, to produce a string of terminals, it should be a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal except the leaves, which are terminals.\n\nThe string is: t8 t3 t6 t5 t7 t0 t3 t9 t3 t2 t3 t8 t0 t5 t2 t5 t8 t0 t6 t9 t5 t3 t9 t0 t7 t7 t3 t0 t4 t6 t4 t6 t5\n\nI'll try to parse this string from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at S, there are three possible productions: S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nIf I take S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then each of NT4 and NT8 should generate the respective parts.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or itself combined with something else? Wait, looking at NT4's productions, it's NT4 \u2192 't4', 't5', 't7', or maybe other combinations. Wait, according to the grammar:\n\nCheck all productions for NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nNT4 -> 't4' perhaps not, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the relevant ones are:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nNT4 -> 't4'? Or is that another non-terminal? Wait, no. Wait, earlier in the grammar, I see NT4 has multiple productions ending with 't4'? Wait, no, looking again, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with multiple rules. Let me search through the rules for NT4.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, here are some entries:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nHere are the rules for NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nAlso, a few others:\n\nWait, does NT4 appear elsewhere? Like in another production.\n\nWait, let me scan all the rules:\n\nNo, in the given grammar, NT4 only appears as the left-hand side in a rule where it produces different combinations. Wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, here is the grammar:\n\nThe rules include:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nAnd perhaps another where NT4 is part of a production, like maybe in another place?\n\nWait, perhaps not, so for NT4, the possible terminals are 't0', 't5', 't7'. So in the string, whenever NT4 appears, it should expand into one of these three.\n\nNow, back to the string. The first symbol is t8. So S would have to expand into NT4 and NT8. Let's go with that.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, the next symbols should be the expansion of NT4 and NT8.\n\nNT4 can be t0, t5, or t7.\n\nLooking at the string: after t8 comes t3, so if the first part was t8, the next symbols should come from NT4's expansion, but if S is NT4 and NT8, then the first part is NT4's expansion starting with t8? Wait, no. Wait, no: the entire string is the result of expanding S, so let's see.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the string would start with NT4's expansion, then NT8's.\n\nSo, the first symbol is NT4's expansion, which is one of t0, t5, t7.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. Hmm, this is a problem. Because S's first option is NT4 \u2192 t0, t5, or t7, but the string starts with t8. So, that can't come from S's first option via NT4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar allows NT4 to expand into some production that eventually leads to t8.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions for NT4.\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\nNT4 has rules:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nAnd another rule:\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example: NT8 -> NT6 NT3, and NT3 -> 't2', etc. So NT4 can only produce terminals, not non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nLine: NT4 -> 't0'\n\nAlso, NT4 -> 't5'\n\nAnd:\n\nLine: NT4 -> 't7'\n\nAdditionally, looking through, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nBut not NT4.\n\nSo, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', 't7'. There's no way for NT4 to produce 't8' directly. So if the first symbol is t8, and it comes from NT4, that's impossible because NT4 can't produce t8 directly.\n\nBut wait, maybe NT4 can expand into a combination that eventually leads to 't8' through some rules.\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, the productions for NT4 are all single terminals. So, NT4 cannot expand into non-terminals that produce 't8's. They can only expand into 't0', 't5', 't7'.\n\nTherefore, if the string starts with 't8', and S's expansion starts with NT4, which produces t0, t5, or t7, this is impossible. So the only other possibility is that maybe S is expanding via another production.\n\nWait, let's look at the other S productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8: we just saw that the first symbol would have to be t0, t5, or t7, but the string starts with t8, so that's impossible.\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11: similar problem, because NT4 can only produce t0, t5, t7.\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2: Then, the string would start with NT1's expansion, but according to the grammar, NT1 can produce things like t9, etc. Let's check NT1's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT1:\n\nNT1 has several rules, including:\n\nNT1 -> 't9'\n\nNT1 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> 't14'\n\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nWait, actually, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't9'\n\nNT1 -> 't13'\n\nAlso:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT1's rules:\n\nNT13 \u2192 ... but more importantly, in NT1, there's a production NT1 -> 't9', and another is NT1 -> 't13'. So 't9' and 't13'.\n\nBut does NT1 expand to 't8'?

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a set of production rules starting from the start symbol S and moving down to terminal symbols. Each non-terminal can be replaced by a sequence of two non-terminals or terminal symbols because the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t9 t2 t2 t6 t3 t6 t8 t7 t3 t9 t0 t7 t6 t2 t7 t8 t10 t5 t4 t8 t3 t10 t2 t4 t9 t10 t0 t4 t0 t3 t9 t8`.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string using the given grammar, trying to split the string into parts that match the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will replace a symbol with two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level rules for S. The S symbol in the grammar can be rewritten as NT4 NT8 or other combinations, but looking at the productions, the first option is S -> NT4 NT8. I don't know if it's the first step, but this could be a possible path.\n\nLet me list all the production rules for clarity:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- S -> NT4 NT11\n- S -> NT1 NT2\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT9\n- NT11 -> NT3 NT11\n- NT13 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT11\n- NT11 -> NT7 NT11\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12\n- NT7 -> NT1 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT10 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT4\n- NT12 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT7 NT14\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT10\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT10 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol, and I need to find a way to break down the string into these production rules.\n\nStarting with S, which can derive into two non-terminals. Let's say we start with S -> NT4 NT8. Then each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further.\n\nNT4: Let's see what NT4 can derive into. Looking at the productions, NT4 can be NT14 NT7, or perhaps other rules, but in the list, NT4 -> NT14 NT7 is one of its productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 in S's rule is S -> NT4 NT8. So NT4 becomes NT14 NT7, and NT8 can be further expanded. Let's try this path.\n\nSo, we have S -> NT4 NT8 -> NT14 NT7 NT8.\n\nNow, NT14 can be expanded. Looking at NT14's rules, it can be NT3 NT4, or other options, but in the list, NT14 is only defined as NT14 -> NT3 NT4.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the grammar production is NT14 -> NT3 NT4. So NT14 -> NT3 NT4.\n\nSo, S becomes NT14 NT7 NT8 -> NT3 NT4 NT7 NT8.\n\nNow, NT3 can be expanded. NT3 -> NT7 NT1. From the rules, NT3 can become NT7 NT1. So, NT3 -> NT7 NT1.\n\nSo now, S is NT3 NT4 NT7 NT8 -> NT7 NT1 NT4 NT7 NT8.\n\nNext, NT4 is NT14 NT7. So, we can continue expanding, but this seems to be getting more complex. Maybe this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. Looking at the string, it starts with t2 t9 t2 t2. Maybe I should see how the first symbols can be produced.\n\nLooking for t2: In the terminal symbols, NT2 can be t2. But where is NT2 defined? The productions include NT2 -> t2, which is one of the productions: NT2 -> 't2'.\n\nSo any occurrence of NT2 in the derivation can result in t2.\n\nWait, but NT2 is also part of other rules. For example, NT2 can derive into NT0 NT0 or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's see. If in the string, the first symbol is t2, it must come from a rule that produces t2, such as NT2 -> t2.\n\nBut if I'm starting with S -> NT4 NT8, then perhaps in the first step, NT4 or NT8 can produce a t2.\n\nLooking at the NT4 and NT8 production rules. NT4 -> t0, t5, or NT14 NT7. If NT4 can produce t0, t5, then perhaps it can produce those, but not t2. So t2 must come from NT2's rule.\n\nSo maybe S needs to derive to something that includes NT2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S has another production that can produce a t2.\n\nLooking at S's rules: None of them directly produce t2. So the first symbol in the string, t2, must come from a production rule that eventually leads to t2.\n\nSo perhaps S leads through multiple steps, and somewhere down the line, a rule produces t2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start from the beginning and try to parse the string.\n\nThe string is: t2 t9 t2 t2 t6 t3 t6 t8 t7 t3 t9 t0 t7 t6 t2 t7 t8 t10 t5 t4 t8 t3 t10 t2 t4 t9 t10 t0 t4 t0 t3 t9 t8.\n\nThis is 35 symbols long, so quite long. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step splits a symbol into two, so it's a binary tree. The length of the string corresponds to 2^n, so for n=5, 32 symbols. Wait, 35 is not 32. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem, but maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\n1. t2\n2. t9\n3. t2\n4. t2\n5. t6\n6. t3\n7. t6\n8. t8\n9. t7\n10. t3\n11. t9\n12. t0\n13. t7\n14. t6\n15. t2\n16. t7\n17. t8\n18. t10\n19. t5\n20. t4\n21. t8\n22. t3\n23. t10\n24. t2\n25. t4\n26. t9\n27. t10\n28. t0\n29. t4\n30. t0\n31. t3\n32. t9\n33. t8\n\nWait, only 33 symbols, so 33, which is not 2^5, so maybe the parse is not straightforward. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, CYK is applicable. However, I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find sequences in the string that match parts of the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-666","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string belongs to the language defined by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t4 t8 t2 t10 t4 t2 t5 t7 t5 t10 t5 t7 t1 t5 t0 t10 t6 t3 t8 t7 t6 t5 t5 t2 t5 t10 t7 t1 t3 t1 t2 t5 t3 t6`. That's quite a long string!\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS) produces exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS). The given grammar follows CNF, which is helpful because it simplifies some parsing methods, like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is long, maybe a parse tree approach would be better.\n\nBut since the grammar is given, maybe I can approach this by trying to trace the string through the grammar, seeing if each token can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the entire string, each token must be matched by the RHS of some production. Let's note that the grammar starts with S which branches into two non-terminals, so the first step is to split the string into two parts, which might correspond to NT1 and NT4, or some other combination, but looking at the grammar, S has three options:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nHmm, so S produces two non-terminals, so the entire string should be divided into two parts, each part generating one of the two non-terminals. So the first step is to split the string into two halves and see which pairs can be generated by these options.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be represented as a sequence of tokens, and each production rule can produce two tokens at a time, so we can parse the string step by step, always choosing a production that matches the current position.\n\nLet me try to see what the first token is. The string starts with 't4'. Let me check the productions for each symbol:\n\nLooking at the productions, for NT4 it produces 't0' and some other tokens. Let me check the productions for each symbol:\n\nWait, perhaps that's too time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to build a derivation starting from S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S:\n\nOption 1: S -> NT4 NT8\n\nSo the string would start with the tokens generated by NT4 and then NT8. Let's see what NT4 produces. Looking through the productions:\n\nWait, the grammar is quite extensive. Let me look for NT4. From the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\nAnd so on. Maybe it's easier to list all productions:\n\nLooking back, S has three initial options. Let me focus on the first option: S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nSo I can write NT4 as NT14 NT7. Let's look at NT14:\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\n\nSo NT14 can be NT3 NT4. Substituting back, NT4 becomes NT3 NT4 NT7.\n\nBut this seems like it could get complicated. Maybe I should look for symbols that produce 't's directly.\n\nLooking at the symbols, for example:\n\nNT3 -> 't7'\n\nNT7 -> 't0' (Wait no, in the given productions, NT7 is defined in a cycle but not directly as a terminal. Wait, let me check: \n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nWait, that's a recursive definition. It goes infinitely, so perhaps it doesn't directly terminate with a 't'. However, some other symbols do:\n\nFor example, NT9 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't0' or 't5'\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nNT5 -> 't0'\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\n\nNT13 -> 't2', 't4'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nNT0 -> 't4', 't5', etc.\n\nSo the string starts with t4. Let me see if any symbols produce 't4'.\n\nLooking for 't4' as direct terminals:\n\nNT4 produces 't0' and 't5' (wait, let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT4 can go to 't0' (via NT4 -> 't0'), or 't5' (via another production?), wait:\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT4: \n-> NT14 NT7\n-> NT14 NT7 (not helpful)\n-> NT8 NT4\n-> NT7 NT14\nWait, no 't4' is a direct terminal.\n\nWait, let me check again. Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't0' (from production NT4 -> 't0')? Wait, no, in the given productions, the only place 't4' appears is as NT13 -> 't4' and NT4 -> 't0' etc. Wait, let me actually check all the productions for direct terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0' (from NT4 production)\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5' (another production)\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT12-> etc.\n\nWait, but 't4' is a terminal, and looking for where it appears as a terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT13 -> 't4' (Yes, one production is NT13 -> 't4')\n- NT13 is a non-terminal that can produce 't4'\n\nAdditionally, other non-terminals like NT0 can produce 't4' (look at NT0: \n\nLooking back, NT0 -> 't10' and other things, but one production is NT0 -> 't4'\n\nWait, no, let's re-examine:\n\nThe productions for NT0 are:\n-> NT6 NT3\n-> NT11 NT11\n-> NT2 NT1\n-> NT8 NT8\n-> NT14 NT13\n-> NT13 -> 't4'? No, looking back, NT13 has productions like NT13 -> 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nYes, in the productions, I see:\n\nNT13 -> 't4'\n\nAnd another production for NT0: NT0 -> 't4' (from the first productions, line 22: NT0 -> 't4')\n\nWait, line 22: NT0 -> 't4' (from the given list of productions). So NT0 can directly produce 't4', and NT13 can produce 't4' as well.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is 't4'. Let's see how this can occur.\n\nLet me try to see through the productions to get 't4' as the first token.\n\nOption 1: If S is S -> NT4 NT8, then NT4 could produce the 't4' via NT4 -> 't0'? No, that would produce 't0'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up NT0 and NT4. NT0 can produce 't4' directly, whereas NT4 produces 't0' or other things.\n\nWait, but the initial productions for S have NT4 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce NT4 NT8. So 't4' must come from NT4. Let me see.\n\nFrom the productions, NT4 has a production that can produce 't0' and another that produces 't5'. Wait, but none directly produce 't4'. Wait, did I misread the productions?\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT4 as:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\nNT3 -> 't7'\n\nBut that doesn't produce 't4' right away. Alternatively, looking elsewhere:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe NT0 can produce 't4' as a terminal. Let's see: Looking back through the productions, I see NT0 has one option as 't4' as a terminal:\n\nYes, in the productions:\n\nNT0 -> 't4' (as per line 22: NT0 -> 't4').\n\nSo S -> NT4 NT8, which would involve NT4 and NT8 as symbols, but if we're starting with NT4, and the first token is 't4', perhaps NT4 can expand to 't4' somehow.\n\nBut looking at the productions for NT4, I don't see any that directly produce 't4'. Instead, NT4 seems to expand into non-terminals. So from NT4, we might generate 't4' only if a chain leads to a production that can produce 't4'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another initial production of S can lead to the start.\n\nLooking back, the initial S options are:\n\n1.

That's a problem because in CNF, the number of symbols in the derived string should be either 2^n if all productions are non-terminals, but in this case, the initial grammar probably has multiple productions, and it might not necessarily produce a string of length 2^n. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nInstead, I'll approach this by building the parse tree bottom-up, using the given productions to match the terminals step-by-step. Alternatively, I can see if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the productions and see if they can be reversed to map terminals to non-terminals. Each production is a rule that can be used in reverse to convert a terminal into a non-terminal.\n\nLet me reverse the grammar rules (since each A \u2192 BC can be read as BC can be replaced by A, but since I'm parsing from the string, I need to replace terminals with non-terminals where possible). Wait, actually, I can think of it as trying to reduce the string by matching substrings that match the RHS of the productions. Each step would replace a substring with a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the approach is to start with the given string and see if we can reduce it to the start symbol S by repeatedly applying the productions in reverse.\n\nLet's list all the reverse productions for clarity. Each original production A \u2192 BC becomes BC \u2192 A, and if there's a production A \u2192 a, then a can be replaced by A.\n\nSo, I'll create a dictionary mapping terminals to their possible non-terminals.\n\nFor the given grammar, the relevant reverse productions (where possible) are:\n\n- t9 \u2192 NT3\n- t10 \u2192 NT1\n (Wait, looking at the original productions, let me check. For NT3 \u2192 't2', wait, no.)\n\nWait, wait, original productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, etc., but the reverse would be NT4 NT8 \u2192 S. Similarly, for terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't2', so 't2' can be replaced by NT3.\n\nLet me list all the reverse mappings:\n\nI'll need to find all productions where a non-terminal is on the LHS, and see what terminals they produce.\n\nOriginal productions:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nThen the NT... productions:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13\nNT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\nNT13 \u2192 NT3 NT12\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\nNT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11\nNT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\nNT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT13 \u2192 NT6 NT10\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT5 \u2192 NT10 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\nNT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT1 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT1\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nNT0 \u2192 NT10 NT10\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nNT10 \u2192 't1'\nNT13 \u2192 't2'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT7 \u2192 't0'\nNT8 \u2192 't0'\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\nNT0 \u2192 't4'\nNT13 \u2192 't4'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT7 \u2192 't10'\nNT10 \u2192 't3'\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nNT11 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo the reverse mappings are:\n\nTerminals can be replaced by their respective non-terminals:\n\nt2 \u2192 NT3\nt1 \u2192 NT10\nt10 \u2192 NT1\nt2 \u2192 NT3\nt0 \u2192 NT5\nt0 \u2192 NT7\nt0 \u2192 NT8\nt10 \u2192 NT10\nt4 \u2192 NT13\nt3 \u2192 NT8\nt2 \u2192 NT3\nt1 \u2192 NT10\nt8 \u2192 NT8\nt7 \u2192 NT7 (but NT7 also can be in other contexts)\nt5 \u2192 NT5\nt3 \u2192 NT3 (wait, no: NT3 \u2192 t2, so 't2' can be replaced by NT3)\nWait, I think I might have confused the direction.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and the string is quite long. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar uses only two symbols: 't' followed by numbers and the end-of-string marker. From the rules, the terminals are t0, t1, t2, etc., up to t14. The non-terminals include S, NT1, NT2, up to NT14, and others like NT3-13, NT5, NT7-13, NT0, NT8, NT10, NT11, NT12, NT13, NT14.\n\nLooking at the string to parse: `t4 t0 t9 t2 t5 t5 t8 t1 t10 t8 t7 t8 t4 t2 t10 t8 t6 t1 t1 t1 t7 t9 t7 t5 t6 t9 t7 t1 t3 t2 t4 t3 t6 t3 t3`. \n\nI'll start by analyzing the structure of the grammar and identifying the derivation steps. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. The initial productions from S are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, S can only produce strings starting with NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's start by considering which production to use.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t4 t0... According to the grammar, looking at NT4, it can produce 't0' or 't5' (from NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5). Also, NT4 can produce other things, but starting with t4 is more promising because the string starts with t4.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT4. The rules are:\n\nNT4 -> t0\nNT4 -> t5\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 t0 or t5\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t4, which might be a typo? Because in the grammar, the only terminal starting with t is t0, t1, t2, etc., but I don't see a t4 terminal. Wait, checking the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t4 as a terminal. Only t0, t1, t2, etc., but no t4. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The grammar rules for NT4 are:\n\nNT4 -> t0\nNT4 -> t5\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nSo, NT4 only directly produces t0 or t5. No t4. Therefore, the string should not have a t4 as the first symbol if it's generated by the grammar. The first symbol is t4, which is not present in the grammar, so the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the production rules again. In the grammar, the only terminals are the ones that appear directly as a -> something. So NT4 only produces t0 or t5; there's no t4 terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol t4 is impossible to produce from NT4.\n\nSo, regardless of the rest of the string, the presence of t4 at the beginning makes the string invalid. But wait, maybe I misread the string. Let me check again. The string is: `t4 t0 t9 t2 t5 ...`. So the first symbol is indeed t4, which is not a terminal in the grammar except for when it's part of a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, could the first t4 come from some other non-terminal? Let me see. The only way to get t4 is through NT4, but NT4 doesn't produce t4 directly. Therefore, any string generated by this grammar cannot start with t4, so the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So I need to make sure all rules in this grammar fit that structure. Let me check a few:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S.

Other productions like NT7 \u2192 NT9NT7 and NT11 \u2192 NT3NT11 also fit, as they have two NTs on the right.\n\nNow, the terminals seem to be strings like 't0', 't1', etc. So once the non-terminals are reduced to terminals, they'll produce parts of the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t2 t4 t7 t1 t0 t9 t5 t8 t0 t3 t1 t3 t8 t3 t8 t1 t3 t9 t8 t6 t4 t6 t6 t2 t9 t8 t6 t5 t10 t5 t8 t6 t6 t2 t3.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's equivalent to a pushdown automaton, and we can parse the string greedily using a stack-based approach. Alternatively, we can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be too complex here. Another method is to see if the string can be split according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or seeing if the string can be broken down step by step using the given productions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe a better approach is to see if the grammar can generate this string by trying to match the productions from the start.\n\nBut first, let's see what non-terminals we have and their productions.\n\nLooking at the NT (non-terminal) definitions:\n\nNT1: NT9NT13\nNT2: NT0NT0, NT7NT11, NT5NT2\n\nWait, actually, the NT definitions might have multiple rules.

I wonder if these can be produced by S.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4NT8 or S \u2192 NT1NT2.\n\nIf I can see which non-terminals produce t2, t4, etc.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT9 NT13.\n\nBut let's try to see which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nWe can make a table of which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nFrom the NT productions:\n\nNT1: NT9NT13 \u2192 terminal combinations here may lead to t9, t13, etc. Wait, but 't13' isn't a terminal; perhaps it's another NT. Let me look:\n\nLooking at NT13, the productions I see are:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT5NT12, NT6 NT10, NT5 \u2192 ... Hmm, NT13 can produce other NTs, so it's probably an intermediate.\n\nMaybe instead, I should check the NTs that can directly expand to terminals. Let's look at each NT:\n\nLooking through all the productions, some NTs have rules that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at NT13: Not seeing any direct terminal. NT7 \u2192 NT10NT7, but t10 is a terminal? Let's check: Yes, 't7' is a terminal. Wait, NT7's production is NT7 \u2192 NT10NT7 or NT7 \u2192 NT0NT1. Wait, no: Looking back, NT7's productions are:\n\nWait, in the rules, NT7 has:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9NT7, NT7 \u2192 NT11NT6, NT7 \u2192 NT10NT2.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT7: NT9 NT7 and NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and NT7 \u2192 NT10 NT2.\n\nSo NT7 can produce other NTs, but none directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, some non-terminals have rules ending with terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking at NT2: NT0NT0, NT7 NT11, NT5 NT2.\n\nWait, among these, NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT2 and NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that directly gives a terminal:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT10 can produce 't1' and 't6'. Yes:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't1' and NT10 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT10 \u2192 t1 and NT10 \u2192 t6. So NT10 can produce 't1' or 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 \u2192 't2' is a production? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for productions where NT2 is \u2192 something including 't2'.\n\nLooking through NT2's rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT7 NT11, NT5 NT2.\n\nWait, I don't see any direct 't2' in NT2's productions. Wait, in the NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and NT5 \u2192 ... Hmm, perhaps NT2 can produce 't2' indirectly.\n\nWait, in the NT2's productions, there's NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Does NT5 ever produce a terminal?\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT2. So that ends with NT2 again. So not directly a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. For NT5, it's:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT10 NT2, but looking through the NT10 productions, NT10 \u2192 't1' or 't6'. So NT5's production could lead to 't1' or 't6' combined with 't2' or more NTs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think differently. Since the string is quite long, perhaps I can check if the grammar can generate the string by verifying each token with the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can split the string into parts and see if they can be generated.\n\nBut maybe it's better to model the possible derivation steps.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, we replace NT4 and NT8 with their respective productions.\n\nLooking at NT4: in the rules, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, and NT7 has multiple rules.\n\nWait, but let me focus on NT4: possible productions are NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT0.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, is there a NT4 \u2192 't4' or 't5'? Let me check.\n\nLooking for any rule where NT4 goes to a terminal.\n\nLooking through all rules, I see:\n\nNT4's productions are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT2 NT0, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT..., wait, looking again:\n\nIn the rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT4: \n  - \u2192 NT14 NT7\n  - \u2192 NT2 NT0\n  - \u2192 NT7 NT...? Wait, wait:\n\nLooking again, I'm missing some NT4 rules. Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nAh, here's NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT0\nWait, is there another? Looking through all rules, I don't see NT4 \u2192 anything else. So NT4 can only be replaced with NT14 NT7 or NT2 NT0.\n\nSo when S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is considered, the first step is to replace NT4 and NT8.\n\nLet me try to see what happens if I take the leftmost derivation.\n\nSo the string starts with 't2', which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-701","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t2 t9 t5 t4 t5 t4 t6 t10 t6 t5 t6 t10 t4 t4 t6 t3 t1 t5 t9 t8 t2 t10 t4 t8 t10 t0 t5 t6 t3 t7 t5 t2 t6 t0 t4 t2`.\n\nFirst, I should recall the rules of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the productions are already strings of terminals. For example, NT3 -> 't5', so when expanded, this would directly produce 't5'. But most of the grammar is in terms of non-terminals.\n\nI think the strategy here is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the given string. However, that might be complicated because the string is quite long. Maybe a better way is to parse the string using the grammar, checking each token from the start, using the productions to see if I can expand it step by step.\n\nI should note that the grammar's productions are recursive, so some symbols can generate long sequences. Also, the string starts with 't2'. Let me check the productions that start with 't2' or can derive to 't2'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules that directly assign to 't2' on some non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT8 -> 't2' (from NT8 -> 't2')\n- NT2 -> 't2' (from NT2 -> 't2')\n- NT2 also has NT2 -> NT2 NT4, which might allow for longer expansions.\n\nBut the string starts with 't2', so I need to see where 't2' can come from. The possible sources are NT8 or NT2. So let's say the first token is from NT8 or NT2.\n\nI'll try to see if I can match the string step by step. Let's break down the string into terms:\n\nt2 t9 t5 t4 t5 t4 t6 t10 t6 t5 t6 t10 t4 t4 t6 t3 t1 t5 t9 t8 t2 t10 t4 t8 t10 t0 t5 t6 t3 t7 t5 t2 t6 t0 t4 t2\n\nThat's 40 tokens. Let me see if each token corresponds to a production, starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with t2. Let me assume it's derived from NT2. So:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8 (but no, that's not directly producing t2). Alternatively, S can be divided into S \u2192 NT4 NT4 NT8 or other combinations, but let's see how the string starts. It starts with t2, which comes from NT2, so maybe the first part is generated by NT8 or NT2.\n\nWait, the first token is t2. So perhaps the first non-terminal is NT2, which directly produces t2. Then, the next steps follow.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal in the string must be the result of substituting the non-terminals in the derivation. So, for example, if the first part of the string is t2, that could come from NT2.\n\nBut NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't2' as well as NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4. Hmm. But in a typical leftmost derivation, the first non-symbol would expand. So if the string starts with t2, let's see which non-terminal can produce t2.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT2 \u2192 't2' directly. So the first symbol is likely from NT2. Now, we look at what's next.\n\nAfter t2, the next token is t9. So we need to see what comes after t2 in the derivation. Wait, since t2 is a terminal, the production for NT2 also includes other possibilities, but the first t2 must come from NT2's production.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT2 can directly produce 't2', or via other paths. But when we're deriving the string, each terminal in the string must be the result of directly expanding one non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, symbol by symbol, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is quite long, so maybe it's easier to break it down into parts. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t2 t9 t5 t4 t5 t4 t6 t10 t6 t5 t6 t10 t4 t4 t6 t3 t1 t5 t9 t8 t2 t10 t4 t8 t10 t0 t5 t6 t3 t7 t5 t2 t6 t0 t4 t2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can split the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to find a way to match this string by tracing the possible non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can create a parser. Since the entire string must be generated by the grammar, each symbol in the string must be produced by some non-terminal. So, for each tX, we can see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT1's production: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 (since the grammar uses uppercase letters for non-terminals, lowercase for terminals).\n\nWait, no, the grammar uses uppercase letters for non-terminals, and the terminals are lowercase letters. Each rule is either a production of a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is written with rules like:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't5', so NT3 is a non-terminal that can directly produce 't5'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The grammar is a bit complex, but I think I need to group all the rules and see which non-terminals map to which terminals.\n\nWait, for example, let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT0 can expand into several things, including 't10', 't4', etc.\n\nNT1 can produce 't8'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't7' (from some rules), 't2'\n\nWait, I need to list all the terminal symbols. The terminals are all lowercase 't's and numbers, for example: 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nNow, let's consider each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFor example, the first token is 't2'. Which non-terminals can produce 't2'? Looking at the grammar, NT2 \u2192 't2', NT8 \u2192 't2', NT3 \u2192 't2' (from NT3 \u2192 't2'). Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the initial rules, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 't2'. So yes.\n\nSo, the first token could come from NT2, NT8, or NT3.\n\nLet me see, the string starts with t2, t9, t5, t4, etc.\n\nLet me try to take the entire string and see if I can parse it step by step.\n\nThe first token is t2. Suppose it comes from NT2. So, in the derivation, the top-level non-terminal S would expand into something that starts with NT2. Let's check S's productions:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S has the following productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT4 NT8? Or wait, looking back, the initial S productions are:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- Wait, no, no, looking carefully:\n\nThe first few lines under the grammar:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4 NT8? No, wait, it's written as S -> NT4 NT8 etc. Wait, the initial given grammar:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\"\n\nWait, I think each line above the grammar heading is indented, indicating each production. So, S has the following productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n3. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nSo S can expand into NT4 NT11, NT1 NT2, or NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the initial step is to choose one of these productions for S, and then derive each symbol from those non-terminals.\n\nBut given that the string starts with t2, and the possible non-terminals that can produce t2 are NT2, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-704","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has specific structures that I can use to my advantage. The string to check is: \n\n`t9 t0 t9 t9 t2 t8 t1 t0 t4 t3 t6 t0 t9 t10 t9 t6 t8 t6 t6 t2 t7 t10 t5 t5 t6 t7 t7 t7 t0 t10 t2 t4 t7 t8 t10 t1`\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars use production rules to derive strings, starting from the start symbol and expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain. Since this grammar is in CNF, all the production rules are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the process because each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial productions from S are:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the first step is to expand S into either NT4 and NT8 or NT1 and NT2. I need to see if either of these options can lead to the target string.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens to see the sequence:\n\n`t9, t0, t9, t9, t2, t8, t1, t0, t4, t3, t6, t0, t9, t10, t9, t6, t8, t6, t6, t2, t7, t10, t5, t5, t6, t7, t7, t7, t0, t10, t2, t4, t7, t8, t10, t1`\n\nThat's 39 tokens. Since each production in CNF produces two things at a time, the number of steps in the derivation will be such that the number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) doubles each time until all are terminals. The length of the string is 39, which is an odd number, which might be a problem because in each step, the number of symbols could be 2^n. Hmm, maybe I can track the non-terminals and see if they can be reduced to the string.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is used to parse context-free grammars. But the CYK algorithm is for parsing strings and can determine whether a string is generated by a given grammar. However, I don't have the parse table here, so perhaps I can try to do this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be reduced using the productions. Starting from the string, if I can find pairs of symbols that match the right-hand side of some production, replacing them with the non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the grammar is given, and each production has a certain form. Let me list all the productions to see the possible replacements.\n\nFirst, list the productions where non-terminals are replaced:\n\nNon-terminals and their productions:\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13\nNT10 -> NT1 NT1\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\nNT11 -> NT3 NT11\nNT13 -> NT3 NT12\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT0 -> NT6 NT3\nNT0 -> NT11 NT11\nNT6 -> NT9 NT11\nNT11 -> NT7 NT11\nNT0 -> NT8 NT8\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\nNT7 -> NT1 NT13\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT5 -> NT10 NT2\nNT2 -> NT2 NT4\nNT12 -> NT3 NT12\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT0 -> NT2 NT1\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\nNT1 -> NT7 NT14\nNT0 -> NT10 NT10\nNT3 -> 't5'\nNT10 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't6'\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't2'\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't8'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't9'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT8 -> 't0'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT5 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, some of these productions have terminals, but in CNF, it's supposed to be two non-terminals or a terminal. But here, I see some productions that have more than one terminal on the right-hand side, like S -> NT4 NT8, which is fine because NT4 and NT8 themselves might be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut when replacing non-terminals, each time it should produce exactly two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. The string given has terminals only, so every terminal in the string must come from a production where a non-terminal can directly produce that terminal.\n\nLooking at the given string, the last token is 't1'. Looking at the productions, NT13 -> 't4' and 't6' is another terminal. NT10 -> 't1' and 't3' (but wait, NT10 -> 't3') because in the given productions, NT10 -> 't3'? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me check. In the productions, NT10 is:\n\nNT10 -> NT1 NT1\nBut also, looking at the later ones:\n\nNT10 -> 't3'? No, wait, no.

The grammar consists of a series of production rules where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) expands into two other symbols, which could be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce terminal tokens. For example, NT3 -> 't5', NT10 -> 't1', NT13->'t2', etc. So my approach should be to see if each 't' in the string matches any rule and if there's a way to construct the entire string step by step.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to use a parsing strategy, maybe recursive descent parsing. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent should work because it's designed for such grammars. But since the string is pretty long, I should find a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to write out the parse tree step by step. Starting with the start symbol S. The grammar's rules are:\n\nS can produce NT4 NT8, or NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, looking carefully, S has three possible productions:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nBut wait, in the initial description, there were only these three options, right? So the first step is to choose one of these.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t0. Let's see which production could lead to t0. Looking at the rules, NT9 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't0', and NT2 -> 't5' (but that's for NT2, not producing t0. Wait, let's check the rules carefully.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT symbols and their productions:\n\n- NT3 -> 't5', NT10 -> 't1', NT13->'t2', NT4->'t0', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, the NT symbols produce terminals, so each step in the parse tree will consume a terminal. So, starting from S, which can produce three options, each with two non-terminals or a mix.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the leftmost derivation. Let's attempt that.\n\nThe string starts with t0. So the first step is to see which non-terminal can produce a t0.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT10 -> 't1' (not t0), NT9 -> 't0'? Wait, does any NT produce t0?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT0 -> 't10', 't4', 't6', etc.\n- NT9 -> 't10', 't9'... Wait, I think I need to list each NT and their rules properly.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I realize that I might have misread some rules. Let me go through all the NT symbols and their possible rule sets more carefully.\n\nList of NTs and their productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't5', NT10 -> 't1', NT13->'t2', NT4 -> 't0', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a more comprehensive list. For each NT, list all the possible replacements.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5, NT7 -> NT9 NT7, NT5->NT9 NT2, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to create a dictionary where each key is an NT and the value is a list of possible productions (each production being a pair of NTs or terminals).\n\nBut given the time, maybe it's better to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t0. So, the first step is to find a production that starts with a t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs produce t0? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0', so S -> NT4 NT8 or S-> NT4 NT11; so if the first token is t0, S could use the rule S-> NT4 NT8 or S-> NT4 NT11, both starting with NT4, which can produce t0.\n\nSo, let's say we pick S-> NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, the first token is t0, which is the t0 from NT4. Then, the next symbol after t0 would come from NT8's expansion.\n\nSo, the string after S-> NT4 NT8 would start as t0 followed by the expansion of NT8, which is the second part.\n\nLooking at NT8's production: From the list, NT8's rules include:\n\nLooking back, at the top, the user provided a long list of productions. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT8 can produce:\n\n- NT6 NT3\n- NT1 NT5\n- NT6 NT3\n- NT1 NT5, and some others (I might have missed some). Wait, in the list provided, I see:\n\nLooking carefully, the user's grammar list includes:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- And in the latter part, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT11\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT7 -> NT1 NT13\n- Etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the NT8 rules:\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\n\nAnd others:\n\nLooking:\n\nLine by line, checking the productions:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- S -> NT4 NT11\n- S -> NT1 NT2\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT9\n- NT11 -> NT3 NT11\n- NT13 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT11\n- NT11 -> NT7 NT11\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12\n- NT7 -> NT1 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT7 -> NT1 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT7 NT14\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT10 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT4\n- NT12 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT1 -> NT7 NT14\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT10\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT10 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT10 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, that's quite a list.

{"custom_id":"request-728","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The task is to determine if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar provided, all the rules except for the terminals seem to fit this form. The terminals are 't0' to 't14', and there are a few single terminals like 't0', 't1', up to 't14'.\n\nThe string to verify is: `t7 t1 t6 t10 t1 t5 t0 t1 t1 t0 t8 t5 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t3 t6 t8 t0 t3 t6 t5 t0 t2 t4 t5 t1 t3 t7 t4 t9 t4 t3 t3 t6`.\n\nI'll need to parse this string using the grammar rules. Parsing in CNF can be done with a recursive descent parser, but since I'm just trying to figure this out manually, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by listing the rules I have for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, S has to start with either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Looking at the string, the first token is t7, which doesn't seem to match any of these. Wait, that can't be right. The first rule S \u2192 NT4 NT8\u2014what do NT4 and NT8 produce? Let me check the rules for NT4 and NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4:\n- NT4 can produce t0, t5, t7, or t9 (from rules: NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 't7', NT4 \u2192 't9').\n\nWait, no, from the rules given, it's more complex. Let me see:\n\nWait, the rules for NT4 are: \n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n- NT9 \u2192 NT9 NT9 (Wait, no, looking back, perhaps not.)\n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree, starting from S, and seeing how the string can be broken down into the symbols that S can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to process the string step by step, using the leftmost derivative.\n\nThe string starts with t7. So, from S, can we get a rule that starts with t7? Let's look at the options:\n\nS can produce NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11 or NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at the first symbols:\n\n- NT4 could produce t0, t5, t7, etc. From the rules:\n  NT4: \n  - NT4 \u2192 't0' (terminal)\n  - NT4 \u2192 't5' (terminal)\n  - NT4 \u2192 't7' (terminal)\n  - NT4 \u2192 't9' (terminal)\nSo, the terminal possibilities for NT4 are t0, t5, t7, t9.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT8:\n- NT8 may produce t6, t3, t0, etc. Looking at the rules for NT8:\n  From the given rules:\n  NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13, NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT4, NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT5, NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT12, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, NT8 only has productions that are two non-terminals, so to get to a terminal t7, I need to see if NT8 can produce t7 somewhere. Wait, perhaps not directly, so maybe the starting production can't be S \u2192 NT8 anything.\n\nWait a minute, the string starts with t7. Looking at the options for S, the first level productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, or S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nSo, if the start symbol S produces NT4 NT8, then the first symbols should be from NT4 and NT8. Let's see what NT4 can produce t7 as its first symbol. Indeed, NT4 can produce t7 directly, as per the rules:\n\nLooking at the given rules, directly from NT4:\n- NT4 \u2192 't7' \n\nYes, that's one of the rules. So, S \u2192 NT4 (which can produce t7) followed by NT8.\n\nSo, the string starts with t7, which would come from NT4 producing 't7'. So, now we have S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and the string starts with t7, which is produced by NT4. So, the next part would be NT8, which should start with some symbol that starts the next part of the string.\n\nWait, the string is t7 t1 t6 t10 t1 t5 t0 t1 t1 t0 t8 t5 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t3 t6 t8 t0 t3 t6 t5 t0 t2 t4 t5 t1 t3 t7 t4 t9 t4 t3 t3 t6.\n\nWait, after the initial t7 (from NT4), the next token is t1. So, after NT4 (which produces t7), the next symbol is t1, which should come from NT8. So, can NT8 produce t1 as its first symbol?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT8: I need to find if NT8 can produce t1. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT8, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't1' directly. Instead, from the rules given for NT8:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n\nWait, these are all two non-terminals, so to get t1, maybe the next step is to see if any of these can produce t1. But wait, let's hold on. Maybe NT8 produces t8 as a terminal, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the parse tree is more complex, and maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which leads to NT4 producing t7 and NT8 producing a sequence of symbols that starts with t1.\n\nWait, but NT8 is a non-terminal that can produce other non-terminals. So, perhaps after 't7' from NT4, the NT8 will produce t1 as part of a longer sequence. Alternatively, perhaps there's a production for NT8 that directly leads to t1, but looking at the given rules, I don't see that. So, maybe I need to see if any of the rules for NT8 can terminate with t1, but from the rules provided, all the productions for NT8 are into two non-terminals. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the rules for NT8. Let me check the rules again. The rules provided include:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nNT8 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT5 NT12\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n\nHmm, these don't include producing t1 directly. Wait, but maybe NT6 can produce t1? Let me check NT6's rules.\n\nLooking for NT6's rules:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT6 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT6 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT10 NT3\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n\nWait, I don't see any rule for NT6 that produces a terminal. Oh, but looking again, maybe I missed it. Let me look at the rules again:\n\nWait, here's one: NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4, which is a rule, but that's for NT2. For NT6, do any of the rules include a terminal? It doesn't seem so from the given rules.

{"custom_id":"request-748","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t10 t1 t6 t4 t1 t8 t6 t7 t5 t7 t2 t10 t0 t6 t8 t5 t6 t3 t1 t1 t3 t9 t4 t7 t1 t3 t5 t7`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals. Terminals are only single symbols, so any production that isn't like that would probably be in another form, but since the problem states it's in CNF, I can rely on that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several NTs (non-terminals) that eventually resolve to terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe first step is to look at the possible starting productions for S. The grammar starts with S producing combinations of two non-terminals:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT4\n- S -> NT4 NT11\n- S -> NT1 NT2\n\nI need to figure out which of these could lead to the provided string. Let's start by considering each production.\n\nStarting with S -> NT4 NT4: NT4 has two productions, one to 't0' and another to 't5'. So each NT4 would produce either 't0' or 't5'. The string starts with 't10', which isn't either, so this production isn't the way to go.\n\nNext, S -> NT4 NT11: NT4 could be 't0' or 't5', and NT11 has two productions, one to 't3' and another to NT8. So the string starts with 't10', which doesn't fit here either.\n\nNow, the remaining option is S -> NT1 NT2: NT1 has two options, 't8' or NT13, and NT2 has two options, 't5' or 't7'.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't10', so none of these seem to match either. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the NT productions.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, some of them resolve to 't's directly. Let me list the terminals:\n\nNT9 -> 't0', NT4->'t0', NT2->'t2', NT10->'t6', NT7->'t0', NT8->'t0', NT0->'t10', NT13->'t2', NT5->'t0', NT3->'t2', NT11->'t3', etc.\n\nWait, but the first symbol in the string is 't10', and looking at the NTs, NT0 is the only one directly producing 't10' (since NT0->'t10'), but how does that fit?\n\nSo, let me think: perhaps the initial derivation starts with S -> NT0 NT6, or another production? Wait, I thought the initial productions are only the three I listed, but maybe I need to see all the produce rules that have two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 -> 't10' (from the end, NT0 -> 't10'), yes.\n\n- NT1 -> 't8' (from NT1's production: NT1 -> 't8' or NT13).\n\nWait, no, let me check again.

Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's presented as a series of productions (->), and each production seems to generate two symbols, except when the right-hand side is a lowercase letter, which represents a terminal symbol. Most of the rules have two non-terminals on the right, except for some that directly include terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t6 t1 t7 t4 t5 t6 t1 t6 t9 t3 t7 t3 t9 t8 t5 t4 t1 t3 t5 t2 t1 t2 t10 t6 t7 t1 t2 t5 t6 t5 t10 t9 t7 t9 t2 t3 t1 t1.\n\nI notice that each word is separated by a space, so I need to process them one by one.\n\nMy approach will be to check each terminal symbol in the string against the possible derivation rules in the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal, I can attempt to parse the string by trying to reduce it according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut parsing such a large string directly might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can create a tree or a derivation path step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can reverse-engineer the process: starting from the start symbol S, and try to expand it to match the given string. Each step should expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S.

{"custom_id":"request-761","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). Hmm, okay, first, I remember that CNF has specific rules: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that it's a bit extensive with a lot of non-terminals and productions. Each production either has two non-terminals or ends with a terminal symbol. That's consistent with CNF, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. It's quite long, so parsing it might be time-consuming, but I can try breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the initial symbol in the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the productions, S can go to NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. So the start is a combination of two non-terminals, both of which produce terminals.\n\nMaybe I can start by trying to derive the string from the grammar. Alternatively, since the string is long, I might look for patterns or see if any part of the string can be tokenized or processed step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the string. If the entire string can be derived from S using the grammar rules, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, it's no.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few terminals. The string starts with t9, t5. Let me check the grammar production rules for NT9. Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't2'\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT1 -> 't8'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't9'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT8 -> 't0'\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT5 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nLooking through these, I find that NT9 -> 't9' is a production. So 't9' is directly derivable from NT9. That's helpful.\n\nBut how does that fit into the start symbol S? Since S is either NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2, I need to see if the first part of the string can be split into these options.\n\nWait, the string starts with t9, t5, t1, t9, t10, t8, etc. So maybe the first part isn't directly connected to S because S produces non-terminals that might expand to different terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I might look for a rightmost or leftmost derivation. But that could get complicated with 34 symbols.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string is covered by some production in the grammar. Since the string has t9, t5, t1, t0, t3, t4, t6, etc., I need to check if each of these terminals is a production from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t0: NT4, NT0, NT9\n- t1: NT9, NT1\n- t2: NT2, NT10, NT11, NT13\n- t3: NT3, NT11, NT9, NT7, NT10, NT8\n- t4: NT4, NT0, NT2\n- t5: NT4, NT2, NT7\n- t6: NT6, NT7, NT0, NT2\n- t7: NT7, NT10, NT8\n- t8: NT8, NT9, NT4, NT0\n- t9: NT9, NT13\n\nSo each symbol in the string is present as a terminal in some production. That's a good sign, but it doesn't necessarily mean the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nNow, perhaps I can try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done with a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since it's a CNF grammar, recursive descent parsing might be feasible, but I need to set up the production rules correctly.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing, which is efficient for CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by checking for possible productions at each step.\n\nGiven the string length is 34 terminals, using CYK would require a table of size 34x34, which is manageable but time-consuming to do manually.\n\nBut since I can't compute the entire CYK table here, maybe I can look for substrings that might correspond to possible productions.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nt9 t5 t1 t9 t10 t8 t7 t4 t3 t1 t0 t9 t2 t0 t5 t4 t10 t9 t3 t9 t0 t9 t4 t4 t6 t3 t4 t6 t0 t8 t1 t10 t3 t9 t6 t1 t7 t6 t8\n\nWait, maybe I can look for certain transitions. For example, looking at the initial part: t9 t5.\n\nI know NT9 can produce t9 or t3. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at NT9: It can produce 't9' or look further. Wait, in the given grammar, does NT9 have any productions besides 't9'?\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT10 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT10 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, I don't see any other productions for NT9 beyond the immediate 't9' and 't10' and 't9'.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I'm supposed to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what CNF is. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms more efficient.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's defined with non-terminals and terminals. Each rule on the left side of the arrow is a non-terminal, and the right side consists of other non-terminals and possibly terminals. My string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t5 t4 t1 t8 t10 t7 t5 t9 t3 t9 t8 t8 t6 t6 t5 t5 t10 t5 t8 t4 t3 t3 t7 t9 t9 t9 t0 t8 t6 t10 t10 t4 t8 t0 t8 t8 t4 t2 t2`.\n\nMy task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar. To do that, I might need to simulate the parsing process or check if each terminal in the string can be derived through the productions.\n\nAnother approach could be to construct a parse tree for the string and see if every step follows the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The possible productions for S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nI'll need to see if the string starts with the terminals that can come from these productions. Let's check the string: it starts with 't5 t4 t1 t8 t10...'.\n\nLooking at the productions, S can produce NT4 or NT1 on the left side. Let's see what NT4 can produce. Looking through the grammar, NT4 has several productions, including NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5', etc. But wait, since S is followed by two non-terminals (NT4 and NT8, etc.), the string after S should consist of two sequences of terminals generated from these non-terminals.\n\nSo, the process would be something like breaking the string into chunks that match the possible sequences from each production.\n\nLet me list out all the non-terminals and their productions to see if I can map them to the string.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n- The first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So, after S, the string should be a combination of sequences generated by NT4 and NT8.\n\nLooking at the string: the first few terminals are t5, t4, t1, t8... Let's see if t5 t4 can come from NT4 followed by NT8.\n\nWait, NT4's productions include:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT3\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, if S is using the production S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first part would be from NT4, and the second from NT8.\n\nLet me consider the first possibility:\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nSo, the first part is derived from NT4. Let's see what the initial part of the string is: 't5 t4 t1 t8...'\n\nLooking at NT4, the possible terminal symbols it can derive are 't0' and 't5', since some of its productions end in terminals. So, t5 is possible.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terminals are t5 and t4.\n\nBut wait, NT4 starts with 't5' (NT4 \u2192 't5'), so if we take t5 from NT4, the next part must come from NT8.\n\nSo, the second part is from NT8. Let's look at the rest of the string.\n\nAfter 't5', the next terminals are 't4 t1 t8 t10...'\n\nIf we take 't4' from NT8, then that's possible if NT8 can produce 't4'. Let's check NT8's productions. Looking at NT8, I don't see any production that directly ends with 't4'. NT8's productions include 't0' and 't5' as terminals. So, 't4' isn't directly possible. Therefore, this line of thought might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1, its productions include:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo, NT1 can produce 't8'. Let's check the string: the first terminal is 't5', so if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the first production would need to generate 't5...'.\n\nBut NT1 starts with 't8' or other. So, if NT1 produces 't8', but the string starts with 't5', then this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So NT4 could produce 't5', and NT8 could produce 't4' through some derivation. But I'm not sure if NT8 can produce 't4'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me instead try to look for parts of the string that match any production's terminal output.\n\nLooking at the entire string, let's split it into possible chunks that correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar. Since each production of a non-terminal can result in one or more terminals, I can break the string into tokens corresponding to each terminal.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt5 t4 t1 t8 t10 t7 t5 t9 t3 t9 t8 t8 t6 t6 t5 t5 t10 t5 t8 t4 t3 t3 t7 t9 t9 t9 t0 t8 t6 t10 t10 t4 t8 t0 t8 t8 t4 t2 t2\n\nLet me list all the terminals:\n\nt5, t4, t1, t8, t10, t7, t5, t9, t3, t9, t8, t8, t6, t6, t5, t5, t10, t5, t8, t4, t3, t3, t7, t9, t9, t9, t0, t8, t6, t10, t10, t4, t8, t0, t8, t8, t4, t2, t2\n\nNow, I can see that each terminal corresponds to specific non-terminals. For example, 't5' can come from NT4 or a few others. So perhaps the string is built by starting from S and expanding each non-terminal into its possible sequences.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal can be matched step by step in the string, ensuring that the productions are followed correctly.\n\nLet me try to parse the string starting from the beginning.\n\n1. The first terminal is 't5'. Looking at the grammar, 't5' can come from NT4 (NT4 \u2192 't5'). So, that's possible. So, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, the string is split into two parts: the first part from NT4 and the second from NT8.\n\nThe first part is 't5', which is directly produced by NT4.\n\nThe rest of the string is 't4 t1 t8 t10...'\n\nNow, the second non-terminal NT8 needs to produce the remaining string starting with 't4'.\n\nWait, but NT8 produces 't0' or 't5' as terminals. So, how can 't4' come from NT8?\n\nLooking back at NT8's productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3 (both non-terminals)\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, NT8 can't directly produce 't4'. Therefore, this path may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is different. Let's consider S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions, it can produce 't8' directly. So, the first terminal 't5' would not be possible if S is NT1 NT2. So, that path is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT4 NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm given is: `t6 t7 t3 t5 t9 t3 t3 t1 t6 t2 t2 t0 t6 t3 t0 t10 t10 t0 t6 t3 t1 t7 t8 t8 t2 t9 t5 t9 t0 t9 t8 t9 t5 t9 t3 t9 t1 t8 t2 t3`\n\nWow, that's quite a long string. Let me break it down and see if I can find a way to parse it according to the grammar rules.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT3 -> 't2', NT9 -> 't0', etc. So, I can check where these terminals appear in the string and see if they can be generated by the corresponding NTs.\n\nLet's start from the beginning of the string and see if I can expand each terminal using the grammar.\n\n1. The first symbol is `t6`. Looking for rules where `t6` is produced. I see that NT7 -> 't6'. So, we can replace t6 with NT7.\n\n2. Next, `t7` is the second symbol. Looking for NT7's production. From the rules:\n   - NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n   - NT7 -> NT12 NT9\n   - NT7 -> NT1 NT13\n   - NT7 -> NT7 NT7\n   I also see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, but I don't see a direct rule for NT7 -> 't7', so I have to see if any of these can lead to t7. Maybe through further expansion.\n\nWait, but in the string, the symbol after t6 is t7, so we have t6 followed by t7. Since t6 is from NT7, and t7 is the next symbol, I need to see how t7 comes after.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see a direct way for NT7 to produce 't7' in a single step. So maybe NT7 must expand into something that includes t7. Let's see:\n\nFrom NT7, one option is NT11 NT6. So I can write NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and then check the next symbols.\n\nBut let me list what I have so far: t6 is NT7, then t7 is the next symbol. So maybe I have NT7 (for t6) and the next symbol is t7. So that would imply that the next step is to see if the rule for NT7 can generate a t7. But looking at the rules, none of the productions for NT7 directly produce 't7', so I must find a way through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently. Perhaps I should try to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the grammar rules in possible ways.\n\nSo starting with the entire string:\n\nt6 t7 t3 t5 t9 t3 t3 t1 t6 t2 t2 t0 t6 t3 t0 t10 t10 t0 t6 t3 t1 t7 t8 t8 t2 t9 t5 t9 t0 t9 t8 t9 t5 t9 t3 t9 t1 t8 t2 t3\n\nI can start with possible non-terminals that produce t6. Looking at the grammar, NT0 -> NT8 NT8, and other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for t6 in the grammar. For NT0, there's a rule NT0 -> NT2 NT1. Looking at what NT2 and NT1 produce:\n\nLooking up NT2: NT2 -> NT0 NT0. So that's a possibility, but it's expanding into more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the rules, NT7 -> 't6' is a direct production, which is more helpful because that's a single terminal.\n\nSo, let's tentatively consider that t6 is generated by NT7. Then, the next symbol is t7. But NT7 can expand into NT11 NT6. Then, NT11 -> NT3 NT11 (from NT11 -> NT3 NT11). Let me see if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find a way to represent the string as a series of expansions according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be broken down into a valid sequence of expansions.\n\nBut another approach is to check if the string can be generated step by step using the given rules, starting with the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nBut none of these directly produce t6, so I need to see if any of these can be expanded to include t6 in the string.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, so perhaps I can see if any of these S productions can produce a substring that starts with t6. Let me check:\n\nFor S -> NT4 NT8, what do NT4 and NT8 produce?\n\nLooking at NT4:\n\nNT4 -> NT4 NT5,\nNT4 -> 't0',\nNT4 -> 't5',\nNT4 -> 't7'.\n\nSo NT4 can directly produce 't0', 't5', or 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 -> 't6', 't0', etc.\n\nIf I'm looking for the first symbol t6, maybe S must be expanded via S -> NT7 -> ... wait no, the S productions don't generate t6 directly.

Wait, NT4 has the productions: NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7', and others involving NT14, NT7, NT2, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT4:\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n- Also other productions like NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, which might lead to more t's.\n\nBut the string starts with t7, so perhaps NT4 expands to t7. Let's check if that's possible. Looking at NT4, there's a production NT4 \u2192 't7'. So yes, so the first part of the string could be from NT4. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and we focus on NT4 expanding to t7 and NT8.\n\nNow, looking at NT8's productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't9', etc. Specifically, looking at NT8's productions:\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't9', 't0', etc. Wait, more specifically.\nFrom the list, NT8 has:\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' \n- NT8 \u2192 't3' \n- NT8 \u2192 't9' \n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13 \n- Also, looking back, NT8 has other productions, like NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, but that's part of S's initial productions.\n\nSo the second symbol is t10. Wait, the string starts with t7 t10. Hmm, but if NT4 produces t7, then NT8 needs to produce t10. So looking at NT8's productions, does any lead to t10?\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT8, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6'\n- NT8 \u2192 't3'\n- NT8 \u2192 't9'\n- Also, other productions like NT8 \u2192 't0' (from NT0?), but no, looking at the grammar, I see NT8's productions are:\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't9', 't0' (from NT0?), but actually, looking at the list again:\n\nWait, the grammar for NT8 is in the list. Let me parse all the productions step by step.\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n\nNT8's productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- Wait, no, looking through all the NT8 productions.\n\nWait, the listing is:\n\nLooking for NT8:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' (once)\n- NT8 \u2192 't3' (once)\n- NT8 \u2192 't9' (once)\n- Other productions for NT8 are:\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT10\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT10\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT6\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT10\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT6\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n  - Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. It's a long list, and I need to find all NT8 productions.\n\nLooking back, the full list is:\n\nThe grammar is a long list. Let me find all lines starting with NT8.\n\nFrom the list, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' \n- NT8 \u2192 't3' \n- NT8 \u2192 't9' \n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT10\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n- NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- So I think these are all NT8's productions. So NT8 can go to 't6', 't3', 't9', or other combinations with non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, after t7 comes t10. So t7 is the first symbol, coming from NT4 \u2192 t7. Then, the second symbol is t10, which must come from NT8. So looking at NT8's productions, can NT8 produce 't10'? Looking through NT8's terminals, the only terminals are 't6', 't3', 't9'. So none of them produce 't10'. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because NT8 doesn't produce 't10'; it only produces those terminals. So the entire string cannot be accepted.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way through non-terminals. Let me think again. But in the string, the second symbol is t10, which would require NT8 to produce t10. But as per the grammar, NT8 doesn't have a production that directly gives t10. All NT8's productions either go to terminals like t6, t3, t9 or to combinations of non-terminals where expanding them would produce those t's.\n\nSo since the string starts with t7 t10, and the second symbol t10 can't be produced by NT8, the string is invalid. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal on the left, right? So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see many rules like S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which is good because it fits the CNF structure. The non-terminals are represented with letters like NT1, NT2, etc., and some terminals are mapped directly to letters like t5, t7, etc.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces: `t5 t7 t3 t6 t0 t9 t1 t4 t0 t5 t4 t10 t4 t8 t0 t0 t9 t9 t3 t7 t9 t9 t5 t1 t0 t0 t1 t7 t8 t1 t0 t8 t0 t10 t6 t1 t10 t2 t6 t5 t5`. \n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the grammar, working backward from the string to the start symbol S. This is like reconstructing the parse tree to see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into individual terminal symbols for clarity. Each word is a terminal, so I'll consider them one by one.\n\nI remember that inCNF, each production is either a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two non-terminals. So each step reduces the string by applying a production in reverse, which means replacing two non-terminals with their right-hand side terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you derive the string, you start from S and apply productions to get more non-terminals until you get to terminals. But since we're checking if the string is in the language, we can try to see if the string can be broken down into the productions of the grammar.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals. To check if it's generated, we can look for possible splits using the grammar rules. Let's start from the left and see if we can apply some production.\n\nLooking for possible splits, let's see if the string starts with any production's RHS. For example, the first symbol is t5. Looking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 t5. So if the first two symbols form the RHS of a production.\n\nWait, I need to be more systematic. Let's think of the string as a list and try to find possible splits where two non-terminals produce a pair of terminals. But this might get complex quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a top-down parsing approach, using a recursive descent parser with memoization, but since the grammar is given, I need to check each step whether a substring can be produced by a production.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to represent the string as a list and see if we can work backward by applying productions.\n\nWait, let's try to model this step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt5, t7, t3, t6, t0, t9, t1, t4, t0, t5, t4, t10, t4, t8, t0, t0, t9, t9, t3, t7, t9, t9, t5, t1, t0, t0, t1, t7, t8, t1, t0, t8, t0, t10, t6, t1, t10, t2, t6, t5, t5.\n\nWait, that's quite long, maybe I should look for the longest possible match from the start. Let's look at the first symbols: t5. From the grammar, NT13 \u2192 t5. So if the string starts with t5, and looking at the grammar, NT13 can produce t5 via a production like NT13 \u2192 t5. But in CNF, the productions for NT13 must be checked. Wait, checking the grammar for NT13, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, at the end, I see NT13 \u2192 t2 and NT13 \u2192 t4. Wait, no, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5, t7\n- NT10 \u2192 t1, t6\n- NT13 \u2192 t2, t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT7 \u2192 t0, t10, t10, t3\nWait, no, let me check if NT13 has a production that includes t5. Hmm, in the given rules, looking through all the NT13's:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t2\n- NT13 \u2192 t4\n- Also, in NT13, do I see any other productions? Let's check: searching for NT13...\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT13 \u2192 t5. Wait, but looking back, perhaps I missed it. Wait, the initial rules: \n\n- NT13 \u2192 t3 (in the first lines). Wait, yes: \"NT13 -> t3\"\n\nWait, that's in the first part: looking at the given rules:\n\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT13 rules.\n\nWait, the full list includes:\n\n\"NT13 -> t5\"\n\nNo, wait, looking back:\n\nWait, here's a list of all the NT13 rules:\n\n- NT13 -> t5 (I think I saw that in the provided list). Wait, let me check the full list.\n\nLooking through, yes, near the end:\n\n- NT13 -> t5\n- NT13 -> t6\n- Also, in the first part, looking further down, I see:\n\nWait, in the list:\n\n- \"NT13 -> t2\"\n- \"NT13 -> t4\"\n- \"NT13 -> t5\"\n- \"NT13 -> t6\"\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. So NT13 has productions to t5 and t6, among others.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, let me find:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT13 -> t5\n- NT13 -> t6\n\nYes, correct. So if I have 't5', perhaps the first production is NT13 \u2192 t5. But that's only a terminal, so that would need to be the start. Wait, but S is the start symbol. So to generate the string, the entire string must derive from S. So the first step would be S \u2192 some production that starts with a terminal. Looking back, the initial productions of S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S starts with either NT4 NT8, etc. So the string starts with 't5', which is derived from NT13 \u2192 t5. But since S doesn't directly produce 't5', but rather through intermediate non-terminals, I need to see how 't5' can be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by parsing the string, assuming that it's generated starting from S. So S must expand into the leftmost non-terminal, and each step produces more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nBut manually simulating this would take a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a way to split the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, we can recursively check if the string can be parsed.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach: for the given string, let's try to split it into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't5', which could be the result of NT13 \u2192 t5. So perhaps the first part is 't5', then the rest of the string is the result of expanding NT13.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT13's productions include:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t6\n- NT13 \u2192 t2\n- NT13 \u2192 t4\n\nSo if 't5' is produced by NT13 \u2192 t5, then the entire string would have to be exactly 't5', which it's not. So perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe 't5' is part of a larger production involving NT13 followed by other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire string must be a sentential form derived from S, ending in terminals.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe we can model this as looking for the entire string to be matched by the start symbol S's productions, possibly through expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-807","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is pretty complex with a lot of non-terminal symbols and production rules. The string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF is. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to generate strings step by step.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems like all the production rules do follow this structure\u2014each rule either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's good; the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to check if the given string can be generated by this grammar. The string is a series of tokens: t8, t7, t3, t4, t10, t7, t7, t9, t3, t10, t0, t2, t2, t2, t0, t5, t6, t9, t10, t5, t0, t9, t5, t7, t6, t3, t3, t8, t5, t7, t7, t2, t1, t3, t5, t9, t0, t10, t2, t8, t8.\n\nFirst, I'll try to map each token to the non-terminal symbols in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, many non-terminals have productions that include terminals, so each token should be reachable via one of these productions.\n\nI'll start by trying to find a production from the start symbol S that can generate parts of this string. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S has two productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\nS \u2192 NT11 NT2\n\nSo, S can produce a combination of two non-terminals. Let's look at the string and see if any of these can match the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t8. Looking at the productions of NT4 and NT8, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0 or t5 or t7\n\nNT8 \u2192 t0 or t5 or t6 or t3\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, for NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0, t5, t7, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for NT8:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t6, t3, etc.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t8. Let me check what the production for NT8 is. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\nLooking for NT8 \u2192 ... \n\nI find NT8 -> NT6 NT3, and also NT8 -> NT1 NT5, but that's not the same as t8. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the productions for NT8 are actually:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I find:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> NT0 NT8\nNT8 -> NT5 NT7\nNT8 -> NT2 NT1\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. Wait, the tokens are lowercase 't's followed by numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar rules. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the grammar, for NT8, the productions are:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT0 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n\nWait, none of these directly produce a terminal like t8. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the first token t8 is generated by one of the non-terminals that have a production with t8.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, are there any non-terminals that have t8 in their productions?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8, so NT1 can produce a t8.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 itself doesn't produce t8 directly, but it can produce combinations that include t8 via other non-terminals. So maybe the string starts with a production from NT1, which includes t8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but NT4 and NT8 might themselves generate sequences that include t8.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8, so maybe the first part of the string comes from a production that starts with t8. Looking at the grammar, the non-terminal NT1 and NT12 produce t8.\n\nLooking at NT1, it can produce t8 via NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8. So NT1 can generate a t8.\n\nBut how does the start symbol S relate to NT1? The S's productions don't directly go to NT1, but perhaps through other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can produce a sequence that includes t8 via another path.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step, trying to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step can only add one non-terminal at a time, which makes it recursive descent parseable. So maybe I can use a recursive approach, checking which non-terminals can produce certain parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by trying to see what S can produce. The S has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n3.

So NT4 cannot directly produce a t8, t7, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for NT8:\n\nNT8's productions are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8\nNT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7\nNT8 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n\nAgain, none of these directly produce terminals, except perhaps through recursion.\n\nWait, but looking for any non-terminals that have a production with a terminal that matches the token.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Are there any non-terminals that have a production with a terminal that's exactly 't8', 't7', etc.?\n\nLooking back through the grammar:\n\nFound these productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nAh, so NT1 can produce a t8.\n\nSimilarly, NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nSo NT12 can produce t8 via NT8.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t8, which is generated by NT12.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the string starts with t8. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce t8.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal's productions, I spot that NT1 can produce t8 via NT12 NT8, meaning that NT1 can generate a t8 by having NT12 produce a t8. But then, NT12 can produce t8 itself via NT8.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to build a table of non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nLet me list each non-terminal and see which terminals they can generate:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8, so if NT12 can generate t8, then NT1 can. But wait, NT12 can produce:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n\nNT8's productions are to NT6 NT3, NT1 NT5, etc., none of which produce terminals. So NT12 can't generate t8 on its own.\n\nWait, then how does NT1 generate t8? It must go through NT12 and NT8, but if NT12 and NT8 only produce non-terminals, that doesn't directly produce 't8'. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, the grammar entries:\n\nFor NT1:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\n\nSo to produce t8, NT12 must produce something that results in t8, which it can't, as NT12's productions are to NT8 NT4, which are non-terminals. So NT1 can't directly produce 't8'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the string and see if the grammar can generate it step by step. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t4, t3, t2, etc.`. Each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar, so I have to see how they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, which has two possible productions:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nI'll check if the string starts with either of the required sequences for these options. The first production would lead with NT4 and NT8. The second would lead with NT1 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens of the string: t4 followed by t3. Since NT4 and NT8 would produce a sequence ending with t4 and t8, but the string starts with t4 and t3, the first production doesn't seem to fit here. So maybe the second production is more likely. Let's see: the string starts with t4, which isn't the NT1 or NT2. Wait, NT1 might produce tokens that start with t8, and NT2 with t2 or others. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back, NT1 in the grammar can produce 't8'. Because the production for NT1 is:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nThen, NT9 is 't0', and NT13 is 't2'.

Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT3, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed NT9's own productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI don't see NT9 having any productions other than being a terminal in another production.

So NT9 can only produce t0. So NT1 produces t0 and t2 (from NT9 and NT13? Wait, no, wait, NT1 is NT9 NT13, which would produce t0 and t8, since NT9 is t0 and NT13 is 't2' for some productions.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if each token in the string is a terminal that appears in the grammar, and if so, see if the production chain can generate it.\n\nLooking at the string: t4, t3, t10, t9, t6, t3, t2, t7, t9, t5, t4, t5, t0, t4, t1, t8, t4, t4, t0, t0, t3, t6, t2, t10, t1, t0, t9, t1, t4, t4, t10, t0, t2, t5, t3, t4, t6, t10, t4, t1, t5, t9.\n\nEach token is present in the grammar's terminals: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t13, t14, t2, etc. So all tokens are present.\n\nNow, I need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence.

Looking in the grammar:\n\nNT4's productions are:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT4\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\nNo, wait: in the provided list, NT4 has:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nNT4 has:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT4\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5' directly, but also can go further into NT14 and NT7.\n\nSince the string starts with 't4', which is 't4', but in the grammar, is there a symbol that produces 't4'? Looking at the grammar, I see NT13 can produce 't4' (among other options like t6, t0, etc.). Wait, yes:\n\nNT13 has several productions:\n\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT13 -> 't0'\n- Also, seems like 't2' is possible.\n\nWait, but how to get 't4' as the start. The string starts with t4. So the first part would need to be derived from S to something that produces 't4'.\n\nLooking back, S can split into two non-terminals: S -> NT4 NT8 or S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me try both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT4 NT8\n\nThen, NT4 would need to produce 't4', but in its productions, does NT4 have a 't4' directly? Wait no, looking:\n\nNT4's productions are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT4\n\nSo NT4 doesn't directly produce 't4'. Thus, starting with S -> NT4 NT8 would require NT4 to generate t4, which isn't possible. So this path is out.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT1 NT2\n\nNow, NT1 and NT2 are the two non-terminals emitted by S.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT1 is:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n\nSo NT1 must be expanded first. Since the string starts with t4, which is 't4', but NT1 leads to NT9 and NT13.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: NT9 -> 't0' directly. And NT13 can produce 't4' directly.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\n\nThen, NT9 produces t0, and NT13 produces t4.\n\nSo the derived string would start with t0 t4.

{"custom_id":"request-826","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has certain regularities that can make parsing easier. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) that can produce strings of terminals or other non-terminals. The terminals here are represented by 't' followed by a number. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by applying the production rules starting from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n\nt2 t0 t9 t10 t8 t4 t3 t5 t8 t10 t0 t5 t1 t2 t5 t0 t6 t7 t5 t6 t8 t3 t7 t5 t3 t2 t2 t10 t5 t1 t4 t4 t7 t0 t4 t6 t6 t9 t1 t10 t0 t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce two NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11 or NT1 NT2. Since the string starts with t2, which is a terminal, I need to see which production rules directly lead to t2.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see several non-terminals that can directly produce t2:\n\nNT2 has a production rule NT2 -> t2. Similarly, NT2 can also produce other combinations, but since it's a terminal, it must be derived directly. So, somewhere in the derivation, there must be a rule that produces t2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t2, so in the parse tree, the start symbol S must directly or indirectly produce t2 as the leftmost symbol. From the grammar, S can produce NT1 NT2, so S -> NT1 NT2. Then NT1 and NT2 must produce strings that can lead to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but S can also produce NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11. If the first symbol is t2, which is in NT2's production, how would that fit into S's production? Because S's first part is either NT1 or NT4. So perhaps S's production is starting with NT1 or NT4, but the string starts with t2, which comes from NT2. That means the first production after S must include a way to produce t2 as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2 can be derived as t2, so maybe the S production is something that eventually can lead to t2 being the leftmost symbol in the string, but given that S's productions start with NT1, NT4, etc., how can that lead to the string starting with t2.\n\nWait, perhaps S is not the immediate ancestor of t2. Let me check the grammar again. S is the start symbol, so the entire string must be derived from S. S can produce either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT1 NT2. Then, the leftmost symbol is what NT1 produces. Let's see what NT1 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT1 -> NT9 NT13, and NT9 is either t0, so NT1 starts with NT9 NT13, which is t0 and something else. But the string starts with t2, so this case might not be the right path unless something reduces differently. Alternatively, maybe there are other rules for NT1?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT1, the production is NT1 -> NT9 NT13, and then I see NT9 -> t0. So NT1 must produce something starting with t0, but our string starts with t2. So this production path might not be suitable unless there's a way to get t2 elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's look again: S can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. If the string starts with t2, which is a terminal, it must be the case that the first part of S's derivation is something that can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the NT2 rules: NT2 has the production NT2 -> t2. So if S can be derived as something that first produces NT2, but the only S productions are NT1 NT2, NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11. So the first component must be NT4 or NT1.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the way to get t2 as the first symbol is not through S's first production, but maybe within the nested productions of S. Let's think about how that could happen.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the string step by step. The string starts with t2, so perhaps it's the result of an NT2 production. But in that case, how does S produce t2? Because none of the S's immediate productions directly yield t2. So maybe there's a way that S's NT1 or NT4 leads to something that produces t2 as part of a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try building the parse tree step by step. Let's consider that the string starts with t2, which comes from NT2 -> t2. Then, the previous symbol would be from NT1, since S can be NT1 NT2 or NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11. So for S -> NT1 NT2, the string would start with NT1->... and then NT2->t2.\n\nSo the first part would be NT1's derivation and then t2. Let's try that. So NT1 can produce NT9 NT13. NT9 can be t0, so NT9 -> t0. NT13 can produce t2? Let's look at NT13's productions.\n\nLooking at NT13's rules: NT13 can produce t2? Wait, in the grammar, NT13 has productions like NT13 -> t4, NT13 -> t6, etc. Wait, no, looking back, I think I might have missed that.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, let's check NT13:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT13 -> NT12 NT9\nNT13 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nSo NT13 can be t4 or t6, but we need t2. Wait, perhaps T2 isn't a value in NT13's productions. Then, maybe NT2 is only a terminal and not part of any larger production. That is, NT2 only has the rule NT2 -> t2, so it can't be further expanded. So if S produces NT1 NT2, then NT2 is just t2.\n\nSo the string starts with t2, which is produced by NT2. But then, how is S producing that? Because S's production would be, say, NT1, and then NT2, so the first symbol in the string would be NT1's production. So perhaps in the parse tree, the first part is NT1 generating something, and then NT2 generating t2.\n\nWait, but that would mean the first symbol in the string is part of NT1's production. So let's see: if the first symbol is t2, which comes from NT2, but NT2 is in the middle of a production from S. Let's try to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is not the top-level node, but that's not the case; the start symbol is S, so the entire string must come from S.\n\nLet me try to consider a possible parse. Starting with S -> NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, which is t2. So in the case of S -> NT1 NT2, the production would proceed as:\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo the leftmost symbol is NT1's production. Let's see what NT1 can expand to. NT1's productions are NT1 -> NT9 NT13.\n\nSo NT1 -> NT9 NT13. Then NT9 -> t0, so NT9 is 't0'. So the first part after S expands would be 't0' followed by what NT13 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions: NT13 -> t4, t6, etc. So the first symbol t2 can't come from here. Therefore, this path (S -> NT1 NT2) doesn't generate t2 as the first symbol because NT1's expansion starts with t0.\n\nSo that can't be the case. So does S have any production that starts with something that can lead to t2?\n\nLooking again, S can produce NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11. Let's check NT4's productions.\n\nNT4 can produce t0, t5, t3, t7, etc. For example:\n\nNT4 -> t0 (twice)\nNT4 -> t5 (twice)\nNT4 -> t7\nNT4 -> t5 again from another production.\n\nSo NT4 can produce t5. So if S -> NT4 NT8, then the leftmost symbol is t5 or t0, neither of which is t2.\n\nSimilarly, S -> NT4 NT11 would also start with T-something.

{"custom_id":"request-846","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like t0, t1, t2, etc. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and S has several productions, mostly splitting into NT segments. Most of these NTs then split further into other parts. I notice that some of the NTs have rules that lead to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. \n\nThe string starts with t5. So I need to see if t5 can come from any of the start production's paths. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT4 NT8. So let me consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8 as the starting point since it's the first option.\n\nNow, NT4 is a non-terminal. Its rules include things like NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'. So, can I get t5 from NT4? Yes, because one of NT4's rules is directly 't5'. \n\nSo if I use S \u2192 NT4 NT8 and then replace NT4 with 't5', then we have t5 followed by NT8. Now, the string starts with t5, so that matches. \n\nNext, we need to process NT8. Looking at NT8's rules: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which then can produce more rules. Let's break it down:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. \n\nNow, NT6: looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11. \n\nBut wait, does any of these lead to t0? Let's check NT9. NT9 has rules like \u2192 't0' and others. Oh, wait, NT9 has NT9 \u2192 't0' as a rule. So if we can get t0 from NT9, that might be useful.\n\nWait, but let's see. For NT6, it's NT9 NT11, and NT9 can produce 't0', but NT11 can produce other things. Let me see:\n\nNT11 can produce NT8 NT5 or 't3'. Wait, 't3' is a terminal. Since the string continues after t5, t0, etc., perhaps 't3' would fit later, but let's see more.\n\nSo, stepping back, after 't5', the next is NT8, which is NT6 NT3.\n\nLet's tackle NT3 next. Looking at NT3's rules, one is NT3 \u2192 't2' and another NT3 \u2192 't2', wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I think I misread. Looking back at the grammar, NT3 has two rules: NT3 \u2192 't2' and another NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. Wait, no, perhaps it's more precise to look:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNo, wait, actually, the production for NT3 is:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, that's two rules for NT3. So, from NT3, we can produce 't2' directly or go to NT7 NT1.\n\nIn the string, after t5, the next part is t0, t3, t1, etc. So, let's see the sequence. The string is:\n\nt5 t0 t3 t1 t9 t7 t4 t2 t1 t0 t1 t6 t0 t6 t5 t4 t6 t3 t7 t6 t3 t2 t10 t0 t5 t3 t10 t7 t5 t6 t6 t3 t10 t2 t0 t6 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t1 t10.\n\nAfter the initial t5 (from NT4), the next token is t0, then t3.\n\nSo after NT4 \u2192 t5, we have NT8. We chose NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3.\n\nNow, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and NT3. Let's see:\n\nTo get t0 after t5, we need NT8 to produce t0 somehow. Let's see, if we have NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, then what can NT6 and NT3 produce?\n\nNT6: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\n\nNT9: NT9 \u2192 't0' (among others), so that's a direct t0.\n\nBut NT11 can produce various things. Let's see the rules for NT11:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, or if it can be 't3' via NT3 \u2192 't2' or NT3 \u2192... Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, NT11's rule is: NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5. But how do we handle that? Or maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11.\n\nWait, that's a recursive rule: NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11. So it can keep going on. But it can also produce 't3' via NT3 \u2192 't2'? Wait, no, looking again, NT3 has two rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n\nand\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2' ?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me recheck:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT3, there are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nAh, so NT3 can go directly to 't2' or go to NT7 NT1.\n\nSo, if NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, then NT9 can go to 't0', and NT11 can produce more.\n\nBut if NT11 can go to 't3'... Wait, actually, earlier I think I made a mistake. Let me check NT3 again.\n\nLooking at the NT3 rules:\n\n\"NT3 -> NT7 NT1\nNT3 -> 't2'\"\n\nSo, NT3 produces 't2' directly, not 't3'. There's also an NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1, which can lead further down the chain.\n\nSo, back to NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0' is one rule.\n\nNT11, as per the rules, can produce NT8 NT5, or it's recursive as NT3 NT11.\n\nWait, no, NT11's rules are:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThere's:\n\n\"NT11 -> NT3 NT11\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT11 -> NT8 NT5\"\n\nSo, NT11 can produce two things: NT3 NT11 (which can go deeper) or NT8 NT5.\n\nHmm, but how do we handle that.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is better. Let's think about the parsing process. Starting from S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- S: NT4 NT8\n\nNow, NT4 can be 't5', so that's the first token. Then NT8 is processed.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3.\n\nSo, process NT6 and NT3.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\n\nSo, process NT9 and NT11.\n\nNT9 can be 't0', so that's the second token t0.\n\nThen NT11 needs to produce t3. How?\n\nFrom the rules, NT11 can produce NT8 NT5 or could it have a direct 't3'? Wait, looking back.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the grammar for NT11.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n\"NT11 -> NT8 NT5\"\n\n\"NT11 -> NT3 NT11\"\n\nSo, no, no 't3' directly from NT11. It can be 't3' only through NT3, but that's via NT3's rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to make NT11 produce 't3' through some other path.\n\nWait, perhaps in the string, after t5 and t0, the next token is t3. So we have t5, t0, t3.\n\nSo, given that, after NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT6 produces t0, and then NT3 can produce t3.\n\nBut wait, wait. NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\n\nNT9 can lead to t0, but then NT11 needs to produce t3.\n\nWait, but how can NT11 produce t3? If NT11 can't produce 't3' directly, maybe through recursion.\n\nWait, perhaps NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11 \u2192 (then NT3 can produce 't2' or go to NT7 NT1). But that would produce 't2's, which isn't matching the string.\n\nHmmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5 t0 t3 t1 t9 t7 t4 t2 t1 t0 t1 t6 t0 t6 t5 t4 t6 t3 t7 t6 t3 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-847","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to either say 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific type of CFG where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar seems to fit that because all the rules are two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t6 t2 t1 t10 t0 t0 t7 t9 t1 t10 t2 t6 t8 t8 t0 t8 t4 t1 t10 t7 t4 t8 t5 t3 t8 t4 t7 t7 t2 t5 t3 t9 t1 t10 t8 t1 t6 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4`. \n\nTo approach this, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar only starts with S, the string must be derived from S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has productions leading to NT4 followed by NT8, NT1 followed by NT2, or NT1 followed by NT11. So, the initial parts of the string will determine which production to use.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't5'. So, I check where 't5' comes from. Scanning through the production rules, I see that NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', and NT2 can produce 't2' or 't5' as well. Also, NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', or 't6'. So, 't5' could come from NT4 or NT2.\n\nGiven that the first production of S is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the first symbols should start with 't5' or 't0' or 't4' from NT4 on the left. Let's say S starts with S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So, the first symbol 't5' comes from NT4 \u2192 't5'. Then, the next part should come from NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't6', etc. Wait, the next symbol is 't6', so let's see where 't6' can come from.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, NT6 \u2192 't9', NT6 \u2192 't11', etc. Also, NT3 can produce 't2' or others. Hmm, maybe I should try to trace the possible derivations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string from the start, trying to match the symbols step by step, either from left to right or right to left. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a straight-line grammar, and in some cases, it might be possible to use a recursive descent approach, but with parsing.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is quite extensive, maybe it's better to see if each terminal can be reached through some chain of productions.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to build a top-down parse tree starting from S and see if the string matches the leftmost derivation. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each step can only produce two symbols, which are either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules and the string to see possible matches.\n\nThe string is: t5 t6 t2 t1 t10 t0 t0 t7 t9 t1 t10 t2 t6 t8 t8 t0 t8 t4 t1 t10 t7 t4 t8 t5 t3 t8 t4 t7 t7 t2 t5 t3 t9 t1 t10 t8 t1 t6 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4.\n\nLet me note that each step in the string must be a symbol generated by the grammar. So, perhaps the best way is to try to match each symbol, considering the possible productions.\n\nStarting with S. The first production options are S\u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, the first symbol is 't5'. Let's see NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 t0, t5, t4 from other rules. Wait, looking back, the rules for NT4 are multiple. Let me check:\n\nLooking back at the rules, NT4 has multiple productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 't7', and others via different NTs.\n\nSo, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or 't7', among others. Since the first symbol is 't5', let's choose NT4 \u2192 't5'. So, the first part is matched: 't5'.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't6'. So after 't5', we have 't6'. The NT4 production is done, so now we look at the next non-terminal, which is NT8. The initial productions for NT8 are: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't6', etc. So, NT8 can produce 't0' or 't6' directly, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't5', the next symbol is 't6', so we can check if NT8 can produce 't6'. Looking back, I see that NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 't6'? Or wait, in the grammar, looking back, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't6' directly. Let me check:\n\nThe rules for NT8:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't6' (wait, is that a rule? Let me check the provided rules again. Looking for NT8, I see NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't6'? Or is it 'NT0'? Hmm, not sure. Wait, looking in the provided rules:\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules provided, I spot lines like NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't6'? Or wait, looking again: I see \"NT8 -> 't6' NT3\", which would be NT8 \u2192 't6' followed by NT3. No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again for NT8. In the provided list:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't6' (wait, is there a production NT8 \u2192 't6'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT3\"\n\n\"Is there another rule for NT8?\" No, wait, I think all the NT8 rules are covered. So, in the provided rules, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't6' directly. So, perhaps 't6' is derived from another path.\n\nWait, maybe I took the wrong path. Let me try again.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8. NT4 is 't5', and now NT8 must produce 't6'. So, how can we get 't6' from NT8? Since NT8's rules don't directly give 't6', unless it's produced via another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps 't6' can be produced from another NT, like NT6, which produces 't6' as one of its options.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 has productions NT6 \u2192 't9', NT6 \u2192 't11', NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and others. So, 't6' isn't directly produced by NT6. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe after NT4 is 't5', then NT8 is 't6', which would mean NT8 must produce 't6'. But looking at the rules, I don't see NT8 having 't6' as a terminal production. So, perhaps that branch doesn't work, and I should choose a different production for S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try S \u2192 NT1 NT2. If S produces 't1' and 't2', but the first symbol is 't5', so that might not work. Or S \u2192 NT11 NT8. NT11 produces 't3' or others. Not directly, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach of S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is correct, but I may have missed a rule. Alternatively, maybe 't6' can be produced from NT8 via another path.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, 't6' must have a production that is either a single terminal or via two non-terminals that can eventually produce 't6'.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules for NT2. Wait, in the given rules, I see NT2's productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT1, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar looks like CNF since all non-terminals produce two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, which has several productions. Looking at the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce combinations of NTs that eventually lead to terminals or other non-terminals. I think it would help to parse the string from the start, trying to break it down into parts that match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with `t3 t3`, so looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 can produce 't2' and 't7' (since NT3 \u2192 't2' and NT3 \u2192 't7'). Wait, actually looking at the grammar, NT3 has two productions: NT3 \u2192 't2' and NT3 \u2192 't7'. But wait, no, let me check the grammar again:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nWait, no, I need to check each NT definition. Looking back, the productions for each NT. Let me list out the NTs and their productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8, ...etc.\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, etc.\n- NT7 has several productions: NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2, etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT2 \u2192 NT5, etc.\n- There are many NTs, so it's a bit complex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, trying to match the string from the start, breaking it down into non-terminals, and seeing if we can find a derivation.\n\nFirst, the string is a series of t's and numbers. Each production may produce a sequence of terminals or non-terminals. Given the grammar, each non-terminal could correspond to a certain terminal (like 't0', 't1', etc.), but some non-terminals don't directly produce terminals; instead, they produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo maybe the first step is to list all the NTs and the terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' and 't7' (Wait, let me check. The production says NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. Wait, no, looking at the given list, it's:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, each line starts with an arrow, e.g., `NTx -> ...`. So, let's identify which NTs produce terminals.\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n\nWait, that's a production of NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. So NT3 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Similarly, let's go through each:\n\n- NT0: several productions, some ending with 't10', 't4', etc.\n- NT1: production to 't8'.\n- NT2: 't2', 't5'.\n- NT3: 't2', 't7'.\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking through each NT production:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2', 't7'. Wait, no. For example:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nDoes any NT directly produce a terminal?\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 \u2192 NT13 \u2192 NT6 NT11 \u2192 NT11 \u2192 ... Hmm, perhaps looking for NTs that produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, looking at each NT's production:\n\nLooking at NT10 \u2192 't1' (from `NT10 -> 't1'`), so NT10 produces terminal 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't2' and 't7' perhaps? Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nI need to find NTs that have productions ending with a terminal like 't'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (from `NT7 -> NT9 NT7`? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the grammar uses leftmost derivation, or perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will have only binary branching. So the string should be a sequence of terminal symbols that can be obtained by expanding S through leftmost derivations.\n\nGiven the string is 46 symbols long, which is even, perhaps it's constructed by concatenating two parts. Alternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts starting from S and seeing if each part can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to simulate a parser, trying to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt3 t3 t7 t1 t4 t6 t7 t10 t10 t4 t3 t2 t8 t8 t5 t10 t5 t2 t7 t2 t5 t5 t0 t1 t2 t7 t10 t2 t3 t1 t10 t5 t6 t0 t6 t2 t4 t5 t9 t0 t4 t4 t3 t1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe first symbol is t3. Looking at the grammar, which NT starts with t3.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions. Wait, NT3 is a non-terminal. From the grammar, I don't see a production where NT3 directly produces 't' terminals. The given productions for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1.\n\nSo NT3 can only produce sequences of other NTs, not terminals. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, going back through the grammar, let's look for NTs that have direct terminal productions.\n\nLooking through each NT in the grammar, when is the production a terminal symbol.\n\nLet me scan each production to see if any production ends with a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `NT1 -> NT9 NT13` \u2192 no terminal.\n- `NT0 -> 't10'`? No, I think it's `NT0 -> NT14 NT13`, which then could produce 't10' via another NT0.\n\nWait, but from the given list, perhaps it's difficult to directly see which NT can produce 't' terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for NTs that have a production ending in a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead think about this: in a correct derivation, each step produces a sequence of two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals, because it's in CNF. So the string must be a result of expansions where each non-terminal is replaced by its two components.\n\nSo, perhaps I can parse the string step by step, building an expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to notice that the grammar might have certain structures that can be repeated or followed by certain patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t3 t3. Maybe this corresponds to S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but wait, S can produce NT4 NT8, but NT4's productions lead to 't0', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, building a Parse Tree manually.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt3 t3 t7 t1 t4 t6 t7 t10 t10 t4 t3 t2 t8 t8 t5 t10 t5 t2 t7 t2 t5 t5 t0 t1 t2 t7 t10 t2 t3 t1 t10 t5 t6 t0 t6 t2 t4 t5 t9 t0 t4 t4 t3 t1\n\nLet's number the tokens as positions 0 to 45.\n\nStarting at 0: t3\n\nFind which NT can derive t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1.\n\nBut both NT7 and NT1 are non-terminals, so that would require two symbols, t7 and t1.\n\nBut in the string, position 1 is t3, so perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is constructed by leftmost derivation. Let's try to match the string by expanding S:\n\nLeftmost derivation:\n\nStart with S.\n\nS expands to, say, NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0 or t5.\n\nWait, NT4 has productions: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 't0'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-864","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand what it can produce. The start symbol is S, and S directly produces either \"NT4 NT8\" or \"NT4 NT11\" or \"NT1 NT2\". So S starts with either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nNext, I'll examine the production rules more closely. NT1 can produce \"t9 NT13\", which seems to eventually produce \"t9 t13\" leading to \"t0\", as per the terminal productions. NT2 produces \"t2\" among other things, and NT4 can go to \"t0\", \"t5\", etc. NT7 and NT5 also have several paths leading to terminals like \"t0\", \"t5\", \"t6\", etc.\n\nThe string I need to test is: t2 t3 t0 t9 t5 t4 t2 t9 t4 t8 t0 t7 t9 t6 t9 t4 t9 t8 t6 t6 t6 t10 t3 t0 t3 t5 t8 t0 t10 t7 t7 t2 t1 t8 t10 t3 t6 t5 t3 t1 t10 t8 t4 t7.\n\nI notice that this string has \"t3\" appearing multiple times and some non-terminals like NT7. So I need to see if the grammar can derive this string, considering that non-terminals like NT4, NT1, etc., can lead to a series of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the start. The first symbol is t2. Looking at the grammar, NT2 can produce t2 directly. So S must expand to something that starts with NT1 NT2 or NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11, but here we have t2, which comes from NT2. So S must expand to NT1 NT2, which starts with NT1.\n\nWait, no. Because S can be NT1 NT2, which would produce NT1 followed by NT2. NT1 can go to t9 NT13, and NT13 can go to t5 or t6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, S can be NT4 NT8, which would give t0 or t5 from NT4 and t6 or t0 from NT8. So the first symbol being t2 doesn't come directly from S because S starts with NT1, NT4, or NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the productions again. The start symbol S has three productions: S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, S-> NT1 NT2.\n\nSo any derivation from S must start with either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So the first part of the string after S must start with NT4, NT4, or NT1, but the string starts with t2. That suggests that the first part of the string must come from NT2, but NT2 is only directly reachable from NT1. Because looking at the productions, NT1 can go to t9 NT13, and NT13 can produce t5 or t6, but not t2 directly. Wait, no. NT2 can produce t2 among other things.\n\nWait, so NT2 can produce t2 and also t5, t7, t9, etc. So when NT2 is expanded, it can directly produce t2. So to get t2 at the beginning, the S must be expanding to NT1 NT2, because NT1 can lead to NT2 somehow, but is that possible?\n\nWait, let's think: If S -> NT1 NT2, then we have two symbols: NT1 and NT2. So the first part of the string would be the expansion of NT1 followed by NT2. If NT1 can expand to something that starts with t9, then maybe NT1 could produce t9 NT13, which then can expand to t0, t10, etc., but how to get t2 after that? Hmm, perhaps that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, could S be expanding to NT4 NT8, which would produce two symbols. The first being NT4 and the next NT8. Let's see what NT4 can produce. Looking at NT4's productions: NT4 can go to NT14 NT7 or NT9 NT2, or directly to t0, t5. So from NT4, we could get t0 or t5, but also further non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, S could be NT4 NT11, which might produce more non-terminals. But the first symbol is t2, which isn't directly from NT4 or NT11 because the first part would need to come directly from NT4 or NT11, but t2 isn't a terminal that comes directly from those.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check NT1's production again. NT1 can produce t9 NT13. And NT13 can produce t5 or t6. So if S is NT1 NT2, then NT1 could be t9 NT13, so the first part would be t9, which is not the case in our string; the first symbol is t2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the non-terminals and their direct terminal productions to see where t2 comes from. From the list:\n\n- NT2: t2\n- NT1: t8\n- NT9: t10\n- NT4: t0, t5, t7\n- NT1: t9 NT13\n- NT0: t10, t14, etc.\n\nSo the only way to get t2 directly is through NT2. Since the first symbol is t2, S must expand to something that starts with NT2, but looking at S's productions, S starts with NT1, NT4, or NT1. None of these directly produce t2. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Let me see: S can be NT1 NT2, but if NT1 expands to something else, maybe that could lead to t2. For example, if NT1 can somehow produce something that starts with t2, but from the productions, NT1 directly produces t9 NT13, not t2. So the only way to get t2 is if NT2 is produced directly, but S doesn't start with NT2. Therefore, the string can't be derived from S because S's first part doesn't start with t2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string starts with t2. So maybe I've made a mistake in understanding the grammar. Wait, perhaps the start symbol S can be followed by other productions that allow for more flexibility. Or perhaps the string is a concatenation that can be derived by S through a different path.\n\nWait, maybe the S can be NT1 NT2, and then NT1 can be expanded to a series that eventually ends with NT2, which produces t2. Let me try that.\n\nIf S is NT1 NT2, then NT2 can directly produce t2. So perhaps the expansion is something like S -> NT1 NT2 -> ... -> t2. But for that, the NT1 would need to produce the rest of the string up to that point. Alternatively, perhaps there's another production where S can somehow get to NT2 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, looking again at S's productions:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce NT1 NT2. Now, if I have S -> NT1 NT2, then the first part is NT1, which can produce t9 NT13. Then, the expansion would look like: S -> NT1 NT2 -> t9 NT13 NT2. But NT13 can produce, say, t5 or t6, but then how do we get t2 next? It doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way that S could produce multiple symbols where one of them is t2, but none of S's direct productions start with t2. Therefore, it's impossible for the first symbol in the string to be t2 if S starts with NT1, NT4, or NT1.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the initial observation, because the user provided a string starting with t2. Therefore, perhaps my initial analysis is flawed, or maybe the grammar doesn't have a production that allows t2 as the first symbol. That would mean the string can't be derived, so the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a path where S can reach a production that starts with t2. Maybe S can be NT1 NT2, and then somehow the NT1 part can expand to something that starts with something else, and the NT2 part can be the first t2. But from NT1's productions, we have only t9 NT13, so the first symbol would be t9, which is not t2.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t2, and all the S's productions start with NT1, NT4, or NT1, which don't have t2 as"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

However, since this is a single string, I can think through each production step to see if the string can be derived.\n\nStarting with S, let's consider the possible initial productions and see if they can match the start of the string.\n\nFirst production: S \u2192 NT4 NT8\nNT4 has productions, and looking at them, the terminals in the string start with t8, t10, etc. Wait, no: the first symbol in the string is 't8'. \n\nWait, let's look at the production of NT4. From the grammar:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, and then NT7 can lead to 't0', 't10', etc. Hmm, this might be getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to trace the string step by step, checking whether each non-terminal can produce the necessary terminals.\n\nWait, another approach is to map the entire string through the grammar. Since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals except when a terminal is produced. But in the given grammar, each production either goes to two non-terminals or directly to a terminal. So, the string should be a sequence of terminals that results from applying the productions step by step.\n\nBut it's a bit tedious to map the entire string. Maybe I can look for potential reductions. Let's start at the beginning of the string and see which production could match first.\n\nThe string starts with t8. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces t8. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, and NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, etc. No production directly for t8 except maybe NT7 \u2192 t0 or NT8 \u2192 t0, but wait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, some NTx directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't1'\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'\nNT2 \u2192 't2' and 't5'\nNT9 \u2192 't0', 't10', and 't9'\nNT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc.\nNT8 \u2192 't0', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, but looking through all the NT rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't8' (from NT10 \u2192 't1' seems not, but wait: in the grammar, NT1 produces 't8'. Let me check the list:\n\nLooking for NTx \u2192 a where a is a terminal:\n\nYes, there are several:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' and others\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', 't10', and 't9'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0', 't6', etc.\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't5' (wait, looking back, for NT13: NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't5'? Or maybe it's more accurately that some NT13 productions lead to terminals. Wait, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't5' or something? Let me check.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't3' (from NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't3')\u2014no, wait, in the grammar it's:\n\nLooking through all the NTx productions, many lead to terminals or non-terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at NT10, it's defined as NT10 \u2192 't1'. NT9 is defined as NT9 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't9'. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't1', etc. Wait, this is getting a bit messy.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to map each part of the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. However, given the complexity and length of the string, it's time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for reductions: in the string, check if the substring can be represented as a production from a particular non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains some sequences that are impossible given the grammar. For example, if 't8' comes first and in the grammar, NT4 can produce 't5' but not 't8'. So let's look.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: t8.\n\nWhich non-terminals can produce t8? Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't8'? No, in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't3'.\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't1'.\n\n- Wait, in the grammar, looking for NT that directly produce t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules for each NT, I don't see any direct productions of NTx \u2192 t8 except maybe NT1 produces 't8'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar list:\n\nYes, NT1 is defined as NT1 \u2192 't8'. So NT1 produces t8.\n\nSo the first part: t8 comes from NT1. So in the context of the grammar, S can produce NT4 NT8, but in the initial step, perhaps the string starts with t8 which can come from NT1.\n\nBut the problem is S produces NT4 and NT8 as the first step. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals generated by the grammar, so it must be that each part is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has symbols that cannot be matched by any production. For example, let's look for sequences that must follow certain rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string doesn't match any possible derivation from S.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's better to note that some steps might not be possible. For instance, if in the string, after t8, something cannot follow.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to look for a conflict. For example, S can produce NT4 NT8, which might lead to certain symbols. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 produces certain symbols, and NT8 also. But looking at NT4, from the grammar, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. Then NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, etc. This might be a long chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's not necessary, but perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be divided into the productions of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to use memoization or recursive checks, but that would be too time-consuming manually.\n\nAlternatively, check for known conflicts. For example, in a grammar, if two productions for the same non-terminal have overlapping first symbols, it can cause conflicts.\n\nBut perhaps more straightforward: if a production in the grammar can generate the string, but given the time constraints, perhaps the string is not compatible with the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t8 comes from NT1, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So S produces two non-terminals initially. That would mean that the string generated starts with the first symbol of NT4's derivation and the second symbol of NT8's derivation. Therefore, t8 cannot come from NT1 if S starts with NT4 NT8, because NT4 and NT8 each produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, but if S produces NT4 NT8, then the first symbol of the string would be the first symbol produced by NT4, and the second would be the first symbol produced by NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. Then NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, and NT3 \u2192 't7'.\n\nWait, so starting with NT4, the first symbol would be 't7'.

The string is pretty long, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since the terminals are 't0' to 't7' and a few 't's with numbers, I'll need to parse the string accordingly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n`t7 t7 t10 t10 t5 t8 t2 t0 t4 t0 t9 t0 t3 t2 t6 t1 t10 t9 t10 t8 t5 t0 t8 t3 t4 t7 t9 t10 t1 t2 t0 t4 t10 t4 t1 t6 t10 t4 t4 t1 t2 t1 t9 t4 t0`.\n\nI remember that to check if a string is generated by a grammar using the CYK algorithm, which is usually for context-free grammars, but since this is a CNF, it should work.

So I need to see if 't7' can be generated by any production.\n\nFrom the productions, looking for anything that can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT7, which is a non-terminal. Let's see NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 | NT11 NT6 | NT12 NT9 | NT7 NT97 (wait, in the list above, NT7 has NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (second production), NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (third), NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9 (fourth), and later it's repeated perhaps. Wait, in the original grammar, NT7's productions are:\n\nLooking back, I think the user wrote NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, and NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9. There's also NT7 -> NT7 NT97? No, perhaps I miswrote.

Are any of the productions for NT7 producing 't7'?\n\nLooking at the list, the productions for NT7 are all non-terminals. So, maybe it can't produce 't7' directly. Wait, but I also need to check if any of the non-terminals derive to 't7'. Let's see if any NT can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT4 has productions to NT14 NT7. Wait, but NT14 is NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4. Let me see if any of these NTs can derive to 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's see which non-terminals can derive to 't7'. Maybe it's easier to parse from the root S.\n\nS can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nSo if the string starts with 't7', perhaps the first production is coming from S, but since S only starts with NT4 or NT1, let's see:\n\nIf the first part is NT4, then it needs to derive to 't7'. But NT4's productions are NT14 NT7. So let's see if NT14 can produce something. NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4. Then NT4 again would break down similarly, leading to NT14\u2192NT3 NT4, which again would produce NT3 and NT4, which could further expand. But does any of this produce 't7'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT7 can't produce 't7', so perhaps the start symbol S can't produce 't7' as the first symbol. That would mean the string is invalid, so answer is No.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT7's productions again.\n\nNT7 can be:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n\nNone of these immediately produce 't7' except that one of the productions for NT7 is NT14 NT7? Wait, no, in the productions for NT7, I don't see NT14. Let's check again.\n\nLooking back, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n\nNo, they don't mention NT14. So the only way NT7 can be a non-terminal is by using these.\n\nBut since none of these produce terminals, perhaps NT7 \u2192 't7' if any of the productions for NT7 somehow derive to 't7', but from the current productions, it doesn't seem possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again carefully.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 (so NT4 produces two non-terminals)\nNT4 \u2192 't0' (Ah, here it is! NT4 can directly produce 't0', and 't5', and 't7' as in NT4 \u2192 't7').\n\nWait, the NT4 production is:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT4 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo yes, NT4 can produce 't7'.

Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar again. Maybe I missed a rule for NT8.\n\nLooking through: \n\nAt the end of the rules, I see NT8 -> 't0' (from NT0 -> 't0')? No, wait, let me check the rules step by step.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT3 -> 't7' and others.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. The rules for t0, t4, etc., are in there. Let me see:\n\nLooking for 't8' in the terminals.\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't0' is under NT0's productions. Wait, no, NT0 has several productions, but NT8 is not an NT0. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, let's see: The rules are all in the left-hand side. So for NT8, are there any rules where it's on the left?\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNo, I don't see NT8 appearing as a left-hand side except in one case... Wait, no, I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between NT8 and T8 ( terminals ). Maybe NT8 is a non-terminal that produces 't8'. Hmm, checking the rules again.\n\nWait, from the given rules:\n\nLooking at NT8: There's a rule like NT8 -> 't6' 't3'? Or maybe I'm misremembering. Let's go through each line.\n\nFor example, line 29: NT8 -> 't6' 't3'? No, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the given grammar's lines are:\n\nLooking through each entry:\n\n- NT8 -> 't0' (line 48)\n- NT0 -> 't10' (line 45)\n- NT0 -> 't4' (line 46)\n- NT13 -> 't2' (line 47)\n- NT5 -> 't0' (line 26)\n- NT7 -> 't0' (line 37)\n- NT10 -> 't3' (line 38)\n- NT3 -> 't2' (line 39)\n- NT11 -> 't3' (line 40)\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking again at NT8:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\n- Line 8: NT10 -> 't1' (no)\n- Line 13: NT5 -> 't0'\n\nWait, looking through all lines, I don't see NT8 as a left-hand side except in S productions. So perhaps NT8 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string contains 't8'. If NT8 is a terminal, then in the grammar, there's a rule for NT8 being a terminal. Looking through, I see:\n\n- Line 48: NT0 -> 't0' but that's not NT8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through each rule, the left-hand sides (non-terminals) are:\n\nS, NT1, NT2, NT4, NT5, NT7, NT9, NT10, NT11, NT12, NT13, NT14, NT0, etc.\n\nNow, looking for 't8' in the productions, I see that NT8 is not a left-hand side but is perhaps a terminal. But wait, in the grammar, is there a production where NT8 is a terminal? Yes, line 48: NT0 -> 't0' and line 49: NT0 -> 't4', etc. So NT8 is not directly a terminal unless there's a rule like NT8 -> 't8'.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- Line 57: NT14 -> NT3 NT4\n\n- Line 25: NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n\n- Line 48: NT0 -> 't0'\n\n- Line 49: NT0 -> 't4'\n\n- Line 25: NT2 -> 't5'\n\nWait, I don't see a production for NT8 that leads directly to 't8' as a terminal. Hmm, this is confusing because the string has 't8's, so perhaps NT8 is a non-terminal that eventually produces 't8'.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, perhaps I missed a rule for NT8. Let me re-examine the given rules line by line.\n\nLooking for NT8 as a left-hand side:\n\n- Line 4: S -> NT4 NT8\n\nWait, no. That's S producing NT4 and NT8.\n\nWait, so when S produces NT8, that's S -> NT8, but in the rules, what's NT8's production? If NT8 is not on the left of any rule except in S, then perhaps NT8 is a non-terminal that can expand further. But without a production where NT8 is on the left, how does it terminate? That would mean NT8 can't be a non-terminal, but it's supposed to produce 't8'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go back.\n\nLooking at the rules, there are several lines where NT8 is on the left:\n\nWait no, I don't see it.

{"custom_id":"request-908","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down step by step. I'm going to take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of this.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's a bunch of productions, each starting with 'S' and then followed by various non-terminals that eventually lead to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. The string I need to evaluate is pretty long: \"t4 t9 t1 t1 t4 t1 t9 t3 t10 t6 t7 t2 t2 t2 t10 t7 t8 t5 t3 t5 t2 t7 t6 t3 t2 t3 t6 t0 t2 t4 t0 t4 t7 t1 t6 t8 t8 t9 t1 t4 t5 t4 t6 t9 t3 t2.\" That's 55 tokens in total. Wow, that's a long string!\n\nNow, the goal is to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. \n\nI remember that to check if a string is in the language, I can try to build a parse tree or use a parsing algorithm. But considering the size of the string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I could use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing context-free grammars. But I'm not sure if I can implement the CYK algorithm here, especially with all these non-terminals. Maybe I can simulate it mentally.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a top-down approach, like recursive descent parsing. But again, with 55 tokens, that's a lot of steps. Perhaps there's a pattern in the grammar that I can exploit. Let me look for terminals in the string and see how they can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't4'. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't4'. Looking through the productions:\n\n- S has some rules, but all start with NT11, NT4, etc., but the immediate productions don't produce 't4' directly. Instead, non-terminals like NT4, NT2, etc., do.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or 't0' again. NT2 can produce 't2', 't5', etc. NT13 can produce 't2' or 't6'. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, I see that NT4 can produce 't0' and 't5', and also has rules that involve non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to map out a way from the start symbol S to the string. Since S is the start, I can see the possible expansions of S. Let's see the production rules for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can split into three options, each involving NT4\/NT1 and NT8\/NT11 or NT2. Let's pick one branch. For example, let's take S \u2192 NT4 NT8 first. Now I need to see what NT4 and NT8 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, it has several options:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nWait, actually, NT4 can go to NT14 NT7, and NT14 can go to NT3 NT4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved. Alternatively, NT4 can also directly produce 't0', 't5', or via other rules like NT14.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't4'. 't4' is not a terminal in the grammar, but wait no, let me check. Looking back, I see that some non-terminals produce 't4'. Wait, does any non-terminal directly produce 't4'? Yes! Looking through the productions, I see that NT7 can produce 't0' or 't10', NT2 can produce 't2' or 't5', NT4 has 't0', 't5', etc. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, I see that NT2 can produce 't2' or 't5' directly.\n\nWait a moment, maybe I made a mistake earlier. The string starts with 't4', but 't4' is a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals can produce 't4'. Looking through the productions, yes, some non-terminals can produce 't4':\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' sometimes, but that's 't10', not 't4'.\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, I think I see that NT0 can produce 't10' or 't4' or 't5' etc. Wait, no, looking back, let me check all the productions for 't4':\n\nLooking at each production, I notice that NT12 has 't3' and 't12' can produce 't3 t12', but that's not 't4'. Wait, let me scan through all the rules again. Actually, I see that NT4 has rules leading to 't0' and 't5', but I don't see any rule that directly or indirectly produces 't4'.\n\nWait, let me check: NT7 can produce 't3', but that's 't3', not 't4'. NT13 can produce 't2' or 't6' or 't4'? Wait, looking back, I see that NT13 has NT6 \u2192 't3', but I don't see any production for 't4' directly from NT13. Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the only time 't4' appears is as a terminal in the right-hand side of a production. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking for where a terminal is written as a result, like 't5', 't0', etc.\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5' (from the lines: NT4->NT14 NT7 and others)\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't13', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't2', etc.\n- NT10 \u2192 't1', 't6', etc.\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6', etc. Wait, yes, NT13 has a production NT13 \u2192 't6' and another \u2192 't4'? Let me check: \n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't6' and NT13 \u2192 't4'. Wait, no, looking at the list, I see:\n\nLooking at the list of rules, yes, there's:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't2'\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n- NT13 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the list again, does NT13 ever produce 't4'? Let me look:\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT6 NT10\nNT13 \u2192 't6'\nNT13 \u2192 't4'\n\nYes, so NT13 can produce 't6', 't4', and 't4' again through that. So, NT13 can produce 't4'. \n\nSo, coming back, the string starts with 't4'. So, the first token is 't4', which must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't4', which is NT13. So, the first step in the parse would be to have NT13 produce 't4'.\n\nNow, looking at how NT13 is produced. From the rules, NT13 can be:\n\n1. NT13 \u2192 NT6 NT10\n2. NT13 \u2192 't6'\n3. NT13 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, the first token 't4' must come from the production NT13 \u2192 't4'. So, the first step is NT13 \u2192 't4'. \n\nNow, after that, we're left with other tokens. Wait, but in the original string, after 't4' comes 't9', 't1', etc. Wait, no: the string starts with 't4', 't9', 't1', etc. So, 't4' is the first token, which we've produced by NT13 \u2192 't4'. Now, we're at the second position, which is 't9'. So, after that 't4', the next token is 't9'.\n\nSo, we've used the first non-terminal (NT13) to produce 't4'. Now, the next symbol is 't9', which must come from some other non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-922","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is quite long, so I need a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar uses tokens 't0' to 't14' and 'NT1' to 'NT13', which I assume are all terminal symbols. The S starts with productions like NT1 NT4, NT11, etc. So, the entire string is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parsing tree or at least a derivation sequence. Since Chomsky normal form has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal and the right side is two terminals or non-terminals, each step can produce two symbols. So, the string length should be a power of 2 plus some, but let's check.\n\nThe string length is 38, which is not a power of 2. Wait, 2^n where n is steps. So, if it's 38, maybe it's possible through multiple splits. Alternatively, I might be miscalculating.\n\nBut maybe I should check the grammar for any possible issues. Since I don't have the rules for all T's, but assuming they're all covered.\n\nNext, I'll see if the first symbols can be produced by some S rule.\n\nThe first symbols are 't1', 't1', 't8', etc. Looking at the grammar, S can produce NT1 NT2. So, maybe the first two symbols come from NT1 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: one of them is 't8', another is NT9 NT13. So, if the first symbol is 't1', that might come from NT1 -> 't1' somehow.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT1 can produce 't1' as per one of the rules. Let me confirm: the user provided a list of rules, and under NT13, there's 't0', 't10', 't7', 't2', etc. Wait, NT1's rules:\n\nLooking back, the user listed several rules like NT1 -> NT9 NT13 and another NT1 -> 't8'. Also, under NT1, one production is 't1'. Yes, so NT1 can produce 't1'.\n\nSo, first 't1' could be derived directly from NT1.\n\nThen, the next symbol is 't1', so we need to see what NT1 can produce as the next symbol. Looking at NT1's rules, if it's already 't1', that's the end, but if we're expanding it, it can split into NT9 and NT13.\n\nSo, perhaps after the first 't1', we need to parse the next 't1' as another production from NT1 or from somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial two symbols don't come from S's direct productions. Let me check: S's first production is NT1 NT4. NT1 can produce 't1', and NT4 can produce, say, 't0' or 't5', etc.\n\nWait, the initial string is 't1 t1 t8 t0 t10 t8 t2 t0 t1 t10 t7 t2 t10 t0 t0 t3 t6 t9 t0 t5 t5 t10 t3 t3 t10 t8 t9 t6 t4 t5 t1 t6 t7 t0 t8 t3 t10 t1 t4 t9 t7 t10 t3 t7 t6 t5 t6'. So, it starts with two 't1's, then 't8', etc.\n\nLet me try building a parse tree.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT1 NT4\n\n2. NT1 can be 't1' or 'NT9 NT13'. Since the first symbol is 't1', that's a direct production.\n\n3. NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', 't4', etc. The next symbol after 't1' is 't1', so after 't1' from NT1, the next symbol is 't1', which must come from NT4 but if NT4 produces a non-terminal that can produce 't1', that's impossible because the next symbol is 't1', which would require NT4 to produce 't1', but looking at NT4's rules, none of them directly produce 't1'; they all produce combinations of terminals like 't0', 't5', or other tokens.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if the first two symbols are 't1' and 't1', then S's first rule (NT1 NT4) would have NT1 as 't1', and NT4 needs to produce another 't1', but looking at NT4's rules, none produce 't1' directly. All are combinations of terminals like t0, t5, t4, etc., but not 't1'.\n\nThat suggests that there's no way for NT4 to produce 't1' because 't1' is derived from NT1, and NT4 only produces combinations of 't0', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, but maybe NT4 is used to produce more tokens after that. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is supposed to be parsed through multiple steps, but after the first 't1', how do we get another 't1' as the second token? Maybe I'm missing some rules.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, maybe I missed a rule that allows NT4 to produce 't1'. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the NT4 rules: 't0', 't5', 't4', 't9', etc., but nothing for 't1'. So, NT4 can't produce 't1' directly. That means the production S -> NT1 NT4 can't produce two 't1's in a row because NT4 can't produce 't1'.\n\nSo that suggests that the string can't be generated because after the initial 't1' (from NT1), NT4 can't produce another 't1' directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another rule for S gives a different start, but the S rules are all starting with two non-terminals, so unless one of them directly starts with 't1', it's impossible. But in the S's, the first two non-terminals are NT1 and NT4, which generate 't1' and then something else.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the initial S production is using a different path. For example, S might have another production that starts differently, but looking at the user-provided grammar, S only has three initial productions, all involving two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the user's grammar starts S as:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\n\nS -> NT4 NT11\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the initial production depends on these three. So, for the first symbol 't1', maybe it's better to see if any of these S's can have a path leading to starting with 't1'.\n\nLooking at the S -> NT4 NT8: if NT4 is 't1', but as we saw, NT4 can't produce 't1' directly. So, that production can't start with 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, S -> NT4 NT11: NT4 can't be 't1', so that also can't start with 't1'.\n\nOnly the third option, S -> NT1 NT2, can possibly start with 't1' if NT1 is 't1' and NT2 provides the next symbol. Let's see.\n\nSo, S -> NT1 NT2. NT1 can be 't1' as a terminal symbol. Then NT2 must be able to produce 't1' as well.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions: one of them is 't2' and another is NT0 NT0. So, NT2 can produce 't2' or split into NT0 NT0.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is 't1' and the second is 't1', and NT2 is derived from NT0 NT0, perhaps we can have NT2 split into nt0 and nt0.\n\nBut wait, NT2's production is NT0 NT0, which is a pair of non-terminals. Then each NT0 can split further.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules: several options, like 't10', 't4', 't5', etc. So, perhaps each NT0 can produce 't1', but checking NT0's rules, I don't see 't1' as a terminal. So, NT0 can't produce 't1' directly, only combinations of other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me start over more carefully.\n\nThe string starts with 't1', 't1', 't8', etc. So, let's see which S production could start with two 't's or something like that.\n\nBut S only has the three initial productions: NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, and NT1 NT2.\n\nEach of these is two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-926","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t0 t10 t4 t6 t6 t3 t7 t9 t1 t5 t1 t3 t8 t1 t4 t6 t8 t3 t9 t10 t4 t8 t1 t1 t5 t8 t0 t2 t5 t4 t10 t1 t7 t0 t5 t9 t0 t5 t6 t1 t2 t1 t9 t0 t3 t8 t2`. Wow, that's a long one!\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The non-terminals here are labeled from NT0 to NT14 and S. But some of these non-terminals lead directly to terminals, which are the letters like t0, t1, etc., and others produce more non-terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to see how the string could be parsed using the grammar. Since the grammar isn't too complex, maybe I can work backwards from the string and see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0. I need to find which production rules can generate t0. Let's check the grammar.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', but also other options like NT0 \u2192 NT10 NT10 which would generate two t10's. Not relevant here.\n- NT10 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't13', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, so t0 can come from NT9, NT4, or NT7. So starting the string with t0 could come from any of these.\n\nLet me consider each possibility.\n\nCase 1: The first production is NT9 \u2192 't0'. Then, the rest of the string should be a result of expanding the other parts.\n\nCase 2: The first production is NT4 \u2192 't0'. Similarly, need to expand the rest.\n\nCase 3: The first production is NT7 \u2192 't0'. Then the remaining string must come from expanding the other parts.\n\nI need to pick one of these cases and see if the rest of the string can follow.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t10 t4 t6 t6 t3 t7 t9 t1 t5 t1 t3 t8 t1 t4 t6 t8 t3 t9 t10 t4 t8 t1 t1 t5 t8 t0 t2 t5 t4 t10 t1 t7 t0 t5 t9 t0 t5 t6 t1 t2 t1 t9 t0 t3 t8 t2.\n\nAfter t0, the next symbol is t10. Let me check the grammar:\n\n- NT10 can directly produce 't3', so t10 can't come from NT10 directly. But NT10 can have productions like NT0 \u2192 NT10 NT10, but that would generate t3 t3, not t10. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's check NT10. Looking at the rules, NT10 has:\n- NT10 \u2192 't3'\n- NT10 \u2192 NT7 NT10\n- NT10 \u2192 NT10 NT7\n- NT10 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n\nNone of these directly produce t10 except for the first one, which produces 't3'. But t10 is a different symbol. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules.\n\nWait, no: Let me check again. Looking through the list, I see NT10 \u2192 't3', NT10 \u2192 't6', but wait, no. Let me go through each non-terminal and their productions.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't13', 't14', etc.\n- NT7 has several productions, including NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't7' perhaps?\n\nWait, maybe I should systematically check each non-terminal's terminal productions.\n\nLet me list each non-terminal and its terminal productions:\n\n- NT0: NT10 NT13, NT11 NT11, NT10 NT10, NT6 NT3, NT8 NT8, NT5 NT5, etc. Wait, no, wait: Looking at the rules, NT0 has multiple NT productions.

So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nI need to parse the string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF can usually be done with a top-down approach, like using a stack or a recursive descent parser. Since this is a bit complex, maybe I can try to find a leftmost derivation starting from S and see if I can match the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two options initially: either S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8\nSo, NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5, based on the productions NT4 \u2192 t0 and NT4 \u2192 t5. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 t0, t0, or other terminals. Wait, looking at NT8's productions, it can expand into NT6 NT3 or other combinations. Hmm, maybe it's getting complicated.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT1 NT2\nNT1's productions include multiple rules. For example, NT1 can expand into NT9 NT13 or NT12 NT8. Similarly, NT2 has several options, like NT0 NT0, NT5 NT2, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start of the string and see which path the parser would take. The string starts with t2. So I need to see which non-terminal can directly produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, checking all productions to see if any produce t2 directly.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, NT2 is a non-terminal that can produce t2. Specifically, in the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 NT2, which is a non-terminal, but NT2 itself has a production that directly includes t2. Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT2, there's a rule: NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2? Or wait, looking more carefully, yes, one of the productions under NT2 is NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Hmm, but that might be cyclic. Alternatively, looking elsewhere, I see NT2 \u2192 t2 directly in some productions, like under NT2: nt2 \u2192 t5, t7, t9... No, I don't see t2 directly. Wait, under NT9: NT9 \u2192 t10, t0, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT2 can expand into NT5 NT2, but since NT5 can produce t0 or t5, and NT2 can ultimately produce t2 via these paths. This might be getting too tangled.\n\nMaybe it's better to try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t2 t4 t0 t0 t4 t5 t1 t10 t1 t10 t2 t4 t7 t1 t0 t8 t8 t7 t9 t6 t10 t4 t1 t0 t8 t4 t3 t1 t4 t7 t7 t9 t10 t9 t2 t0 t7 t0 t0 t1 t3 t5 t4 t2 t4 t4 t5 t10.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the first few tokens.\n\nThe first token is t2. Looking for NT2.\n\nOne of the productions is NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, and another is NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and another is NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc. Wait, is there a production that directly produces t2? Hmm, I might have missed it. Let me check all NT2 productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT2, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- Also, do I see any rule that directly expands to t2? Looking at NT2's rules:\n\nWait, I think in the grammar, under NT2, one of the rules is NT2 \u2192 t2. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2\nWait, yes, I do. Let me verify:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT2: \n\nYes, there's a rule: NT2 \u2192 t2\n\nSo NT2 is directly a terminal producing t2. Great, so the first part can be matched by NT2.\n\nSo after the first token t2, we can take NT2 as the first step.\n\nNow, after NT2, the next part is t4, t0, etc.\n\nBut wait, since NT2 is a single terminal, the next token after that would be t4, which is part of the next step.\n\nSo perhaps we need to see how after NT2, the subsequent production happens. Since in the grammar, we need to continue after NT2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, after matching t2 as NT2, the next thing is the next token, which is t4.\n\nLooking at the entire string, it's t2 followed by t4, then t0, etc.\n\nSo starting from the beginning, it's S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nSince the first token is t2, which is produced by NT2, let's see if the grammar allows S \u2192 NT1 NT2 or S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT1 NT2, which can be possible if the first part is NT2 followed by NT1 NT2. Wait, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, the entire derivation starts from S. So S can produce two things, each of two non-terminals, like NT4 and NT8, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nGiven that the first token is t2, which is produced directly by NT2, then we can consider that S must expand into NT1 NT2.\n\nBecause NT1 could produce t2 somewhere in its expansion? Or perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So S would first produce NT1, then NT2. We have t2 as the first token, so maybe NT2 is directly producing t2 as the first symbol. But then we'd have other symbols after that, which need to be produced by NT1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the initial step, but if the first symbol is t2, maybe that requires NT8 to produce t2. Let's check if NT8 can produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT8, the productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- other rules involve NT8 as left-hand side.\n\nWait, do any of these produce t2 directly? From the NT8's productions, I don't see any that directly produce t2. So perhaps the only way to get t2 is via NT2.\n\nSo going back, maybe the initial string starts with NT2, and the rest follows.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So S becomes NT1 followed by NT2. The first token is t2 from NT2.\n\nSo then, after NT2, we need to see how NT2 is expanded. But wait, NT2 is a terminal, so it just contributes a t2 to the string. So the next part of the string after that would be t4, t0, etc., which need to come from NT1.\n\nSo the question arises: can NT1 expand into the remaining sequence after t2?\n\nSo after matching t2 (from NT2), the next part is t4, which would be the next token.

{"custom_id":"request-948","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string, and I need to determine whether the string is generated by the given grammar. Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So, I should be able to parse the string using this grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, and the string given is \"t4 t10 t7 t2 t9 t10 t8 t2 t7 t3 t8 t0 t1 t7 t7 t3 t4 t10 t7 t6 t10 t8 t8 t5 t3 t5 t0 t4 t6 t7 t2 t8 t4 t6 t9 t10 t8 t9 t4 t0 t4 t9 t0 t10 t1 t5 t2 t5\". That's a lot of tokens, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nI should probably start by looking at the initial productions from S. The grammar has S \u2192 NT4 NT8 in some cases. So, the first part of the string should be t4 and t8. Let me check the string: the first token is t4, so that's good. The next is t10, which isn't t8. Wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me look again. Oh, wait, some productions have S \u2192 NT4 NT8, some may require different structures. Wait, actually, looking back, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, and S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So, S can produce different combinations. Hmm, maybe I need to see which production rule could generate the string starting with t4 and t10. Wait, no, because the initial production for S might not have NT4 followed by NT8 as the first step. Let me think.\n\nThe grammar's first rule is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So the first two symbols after applying this rule would be the first symbols of NT4 and NT8. Looking at the NT4 and NT8 productions: NT4 can be t0, t5, t7, t4, etc. Wait, no, looking at the NT4 production: it's always followed by more NTs until it terminalizes with something ending in 't4' or 't5' or 't7', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the entire string using the grammar's productions. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's a standard structure, and I can apply a recursive descent parser or some kind of top-down approach.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I might need to do this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the initial symbols in the string and see if they match any of the start symbols. The string starts with t4, so perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but NT8 in this case might be different. Wait, the string after S might not be NT4 NT8. Let me see the first tokens.\n\nThe first token is t4, so the next is t10. Let me see the possible productions that could explain that. Looking at NT4, its productions are: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14, NT4 \u2192 ... but wait, maybe I should see all the NT4 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nAnd others? Let me check:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nWait, maybe I should list all NT4 productions:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14\nBut looking deeper, maybe there are more. Oh, looking at NT4's productions:\n\n NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n NT7 -> NT3 NT1\n\nWait, no, I need to check all the positions where NT4 appears. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could help, but given the complexity, maybe a more manual approach is better.\n\nHmm, perhaps the string can be broken down into components. Let me consider the first few tokens: t4 t10. So, S must produce something that starts with t4 and t10. Looking back at the initial productions for S: S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first two symbols would be the first symbols of NT4 and NT8. So, what can NT4 and NT8 produce?\n\nLooking at NT8: its productions include:\n\n NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n And others, but I think I can list the immediate rules. Then, what about the first symbol of NT8? Let's say the next token after t4 is t10, but in this case, the next token after t4 is t10, which is not the first symbol of NT8.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be built using the rewrite rules.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to represent the grammar's structure. For example, the start symbol is S, which has several production rules. Each non-terminal (like NT4, NT8, NT7, etc.) has their own productions leading eventually to terminals like t0, t1, etc.\n\nI think a better approach is to see if I can parse the string using the grammar. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the entire string: \"t4 t10 t7 t2 t9 t10 t8 t2 t7 t3 t8 t0 t1 t7 t7 t3 t4 t10 t7 t6 t10 t8 t8 t5 t3 t5 t0 t4 t6 t7 t2 t8 t4 t6 t9 t10 t8 t9 t4 t0 t4 t9 t0 t10 t1 t5 t2 t5\".\n\nI need to find a way to split this into parts that fit the grammar. Since S can produce S \u2192 NT1 NT2, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, or S \u2192 NT4 NT11, I can consider which of these might fit.\n\nWait, the string starts with t4 and t10. Let's check if any of the production rules for NT4 would start with t4 and NT10 would start with t10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT4 can derive t4, so the first part of the string is 't4', and the second is 't10', which could come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a parse tree. Let me try to see possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So, the first part is NT4 generating 't4' and the second part is NT8 generating 't10'. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, looking at NT4's productions, one of them is NT4 \u2192 t7. So maybe NT4 can directly produce t7, but in our string, the first token is t4, which is different.\n\nWait, no. Looking at NT4's productions:\n\n NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14\n Then other options, but maybe it can also produce t4 directly. Wait, let me check all the terminals that NT4 leads to.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any direct production of NT4 to t4, t5, t7, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me list all NT4 productions that end in terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT4 \u2192 t0, t4, t5, t7, etc., but looking at the actual NT4 rules, they all go to non-terminals, except for cases where they end in more rules.\n\nWait, actually, from the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT4 \u2192 t4, t5, etc. Instead, NT4's productions all lead to two non-terminals:\n\n NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\nHmm, wait, is that correct? Let me check again:\n\nI think I misinterpreted earlier lines. Let me look more carefully:\n\nNT4's productions are:\n\n NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7,\n NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14,\n NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4,\n NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4,\n Oh, wait, perhaps I need to look for the end of these chain productions where they derive a terminal.\n\nWait, somewhere in the grammar, are there any productions that end in terminals? Let me scan through:\n\nLooking at NT14: It has NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, and NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT1.\n\nWait, so perhaps these lead to terminals.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT14,\n\nWhich then NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6,\n\nWhich then NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11,\n\nWait, this could go on"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-963","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with a lot of non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is long, so I need to think about an efficient way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the productions in the given grammar should fit this structure. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal, which is correct for CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: `t2 t9 t8 t1 t1 t5 t0 t2 t7 t0 t8 t7 t10 t0 t3 t7 t7 t9 t3 t10 t1 t8 t10 t4 t9 t5 t0 t2 t8 t7 t5 t4 t0 t0 t0 t5 t9 t1 t2 t2 t9 t7 t3 t9 t9 t1 t9 t10 t2`.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use a method similar to a top-down parsing approach, perhaps using a stack-based method or a recursive descent since the grammar is in CNF. Another idea is to represent the string and see if it can be constructed by starting from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. This suggests that the parse tree for any string will be a binary tree, and each terminal in the string must correspond to a production that directly produces that terminal. So each token in the string must be the result of a single production step, meaning the parse tree depth corresponds to the length of the string.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because each production can expand non-terminals, the string's length can vary depending on how non-terminals are expanded. For example, if a non-terminal A expands to B C, and B and C also expand to terminals, then A contributes three terminals (after two expansions), but since the grammar is in CNF, each step is just two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to model this as a recursive descent parser. Let's think about it: for each non-terminal, we can write a function that attempts to parse a part of the string. Each function will handle its corresponding production rule, recursively calling the functions for each non-terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the string must be a combination of two non-terminals expanded via one of these productions. Each of these non-terminals (NT4, NT8, NT11, NT1, NT2) will have their own production rules.\n\nFor example, NT4 has several productions, including terminal 't0', 't5', etc. So if S starts with NT4, which goes to 't0', then the next part must be NT8, which might produce more terminals and so on.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, it's a bit challenging to manually parse it. Maybe I can spot any patterns or inconsistencies early on. Let's see the first few tokens:\n\nThe string starts with `t2 t9 t8 t1 t1 t5 t0 ...`.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals have productions that produce other non-terminals and sometimes terminals. But in the first step, S produces two non-terminals. So the string must start with a series of terminals derived from the first production of S.\n\nLet's consider the possible first productions of S:\n1. NT4 NT8: Let's see what NT4 and NT8 could expand to.\n\nNT4 has productions:\n- \u2192 't0'\n- \u2192 't5'\n- \u2192 't7'\n- \u2192 't9'\n- \u2192 't4' (from rule NT4 \u2192 't4')\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, there's NT4\u2192't0', NT4\u2192't5', NT4\u2192't7', NT4\u2192't9', and NT4\u2192't4'.\n\nSo NT4 can produce any of those terminals. Similarly, NT8 has productions that include 't6', 't3', 't0', etc.\n\nSo the first production S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would mean the string starts with the first terminal of NT4's expansion, followed by the first terminal of NT8's expansion.\n\nSince the string starts with t2, let's see if t2 can come from NT4 or NT8.\n\nLooking for NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT4\u2192 't4'\n\nNone of these produce 't2'. So if S uses the production S\u2192NT4 NT8, then the first terminal cannot be t2, unless that production is split into multiple steps, but that would require the first terminal to come from NT4 or NT8's expansion beyond the initial step.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So in the first step, S\u2192NT4 NT8 would require both NT4 and NT8 to produce terminals, but it's possible that NT4 might expand into a sequence that includes t2.\n\nLooking more closely at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 can expand into 't0', 't5', 't7', 't9', or 't4'. So in the first step, NT4 cannot directly produce 't2'. Therefore, if the string starts with t2, that suggests that the first production might not be S\u2192NT4 NT8. Alternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is further split.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the parse tree depth. Since the string is quite long, perhaps it's better to think if the grammar allows such a long string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for possible ways the string could be generated. Another idea is to check if any of the non-terminals can produce the required sequence of terminals starting with 't2'.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT2 has several rules, including:\n- \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- \u2192 NT5 \u2192 't5'\n- \u2192 NT2 \u2192 't2'\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar shows:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT5\nLooking back, in the grammar, I see that NT2 has some rules that produce non-terminals and others that produce terminals. Specifically, in the list:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n- etc. Wait, actually, in the initial list, the grammar is a bit extensive, so I need to find NT2's rules.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT2's productions are:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5\nIs there any other? Let me list them from the given grammar:\n\nFrom the given data, under NT2, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n\nWait, wait, looking back: Yes, in the list under NT2, it has three production rules:\n1. NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n2. NT2 \u2192 NT5\n3. NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n\nSo that's important. So NT2 can expand into either two non-terminals (NT0 and NT0), a single non-terminal (NT5), or recursively as NT2 NT4.\n\nGiven that, if S uses the production S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and since NT1 has a production \u2192 't8', then the string must start with 't8' and then the expansion of NT2.\n\nBut the string starts with 't2', so if S uses S\u2192 NT4 NT8, the first symbol must come from NT4's expansion, which as we saw cannot be 't2'. But wait, maybe the expansion of NT4 can go deeper. For example, let's see if NT4 can expand into a combination that produces 't2'.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce 't4', but 't4' is not the terminal we're looking for. So perhaps if NT4 expands into another non-terminal, which in turn produces 't2'.\n\nWait, but how does 't2' get into the string? Let's see. Maybe another non-terminal can produce 't2'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n\nWait, perhaps a higher-level non-terminal can produce NT7, which then can produce 't2' if allowed.\n\nBut looking again, I don't see any"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-987","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is quite long. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has specific characteristics. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the grammar is in CNF, which is good because it might make parsing easier, though I don't know if that's directly relevant here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t0 t8 t8 t8 t9 t3 t8 t0 t9 t2 t1 t6 t5 t1 t5 t5 t2 t10 t4 t5 t2 t3 t5 t0 t5 t1 t6 t6 t4 t5 t9 t9 t2 t0 t1 t10 t9 t2 t3 t0 t5 t4 t9 t8 t10 t6 t5 t3 t9`.\n\nLet me break this down. It's a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar's rules.\n\nThe alphabet here includes t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14, but looking at the production rules, some non-terminals don't appear. Wait, no, actually, all terminals in the string must correspond to the terminals defined in the grammar. Let me check each terminal:\n\nLooking at the production rules, the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14. But wait, in the string, I see t7, t11, t12, etc. Wait, the given grammar has some NT11 and NT7, but in the string, I see 't7' too. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has production rules where the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. The terminals are when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Let me check the possible terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT13 can produce 't2', and NT5 can produce 't0', among others. So, any terminal in the string must be one of these. But the string has t7, which I don't see being produced as a terminal in the grammar. Wait, let me go through each production to see if any terminal is t7.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', NT5 \u2192 't0', NT2 \u2192 't2' or 't5', NT7 can produce NT8 NT3, which eventually would produce terminals. Wait, but is there a production that directly produces t7? Looking at the rules, I don't see any terminal being 't7'. So, any occurrence of 't7' in the string would immediately mean it's not part of the language, since there's no rule that produces it.\n\nWait, let me check the string again: the string is a series of t's and numbers. So, for example, the first part is t3, t0, t8, t8, t8, t9, etc. So, t7 is not present. Hmm, but is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me scan through the rules to see if any terminal is 't7'. Looking through each production rule, for example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8: both NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals.\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5: non-terminals.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7: non-terminals.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2: non-terminals.\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13: non-terminals.\n- NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1: non-terminals.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0: non-terminals.\n- And so on.\n\nI don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't7'. So, t7 isn't in the grammar. Therefore, any occurrence of 't7' in the string would make it invalid. Looking back at the string, I see several 't7's: like t7, t7, etc.\n\nWait, let me go through the string step by step to find any 't7's. The string is:\n\nt3 t0 t8 t8 t8 t9 t3 t8 t0 t9 t2 t1 t6 t5 t1 t5 t5 t2 t10 t4 t5 t2 t3 t5 t0 t5 t1 t6 t6 t4 t5 t9 t9 t2 t0 t1 t10 t9 t2 t3 t0 t5 t4 t9 t8 t10 t6 t5 t3 t9.\n\nI count a couple of 't7's here: I see 't7 t7' in the string. So, 't7' is present. Since the grammar doesn't have any production that directly results in 't7', this string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the production rules can derive 't7' indirectly? Let me check if any non-terminal can produce 't7'. Looking at the production rules, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 is a left recursion and not directly helpful. Wait, but how can I get 't7'?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the production rules. Let me look again. NT7 is defined as NT9 NT7, which is a recursive production. Then NT9 may produce other non-terminals. But looking at the rules, NT9 doesn't directly produce 't7' either. Wait, looking at the rules again, do any non-terminals eventually produce 't7'? Or is 't7' never a terminal in this grammar?\n\nI think in this grammar, 't7' can never be produced because there's no production for NT7 that directly outputs a terminal, except perhaps through a sequence of productions that lead to a terminal, but I don't see any way. So, the presence of 't7' in the string should invalidate it.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait no, NT3 is a nonterminal that produces 't2', so 't3' isn't a terminal in this grammar. That's a problem. \n\nWait, the string is \"t0 t3\", so the token is \"t3\", but in the grammar, NT3 produces 't2', not 't3'. So \"t3\" is not a terminal; perhaps the string has a typo? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe \"t3\" is a different nonterminal that I forgot. Wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (so t2 is a terminal)\n- NT11 \u2192 't3' as a terminal? Wait, no, because NT11 has a production to NT3 NT11, but some of its other productions end in 't3'\u2014like a few rules where NT3 is part of the production, but I don't see an explicit NT rule for, say, NT11 that ends with 't3' as a terminal.

Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nI see NT3 \u2192 't2' (so 't2' is terminal). Also, NT11 has a production \u2192 NT3 NT11, which doesn't end in 't3' as a terminal. Wait, but in the string, the token is \"t3\"\u2014does that correspond to an NT3 production? Or perhaps it's another nonterminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. Are there any NT terminals that produce 't3'? No, I don't think so. So \"t3\" must be a nonterminal. But that's a problem because in the grammar, all the terminals are defined as specific t's, and if \"t3\" is a nonterminal, then the string can't be derived because it includes \"t3\" as a terminal, which isn't present in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all NT productions to see if any explicitly produce t3. Scanning through:\n\n- NT0: No 't3' production.\n- NT1: All end in 't8', etc.\n- NT2: Ends in 't2', 't5'.\n- NT4: Ends in 't0', 't5'.\n- NT5: Ends in 't0', 't2' (because NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2 and NT2 \u2192 't2' and 't5').\n- NT7: Ends in 't0' (since NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT7 or others? Wait, NT7 has several rules, like NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9, etc. But does NT7 allow for 't3'? I don't see. NT11 has some rules, but NT11 \u2192 't3' directly. Wait no, NT11's rules are:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1\nSo, NT11 can produce 't3'? No, because NT3 is a nonterminal, so that would produce 't2' via NT3 \u2192 't2'. Wait, so if I have NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1, that would produce 't2' followed by whatever NT1 can produce. Wait, NT1's rule is NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. NT9 \u2192 't0', and NT13 \u2192 't4' (because it's in NT13 \u2192 't4'). So NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1 would be 't2' 't0' 't4'... but that's multiple tokens. So NT11 can produce 't3' as in a terminal? Wait, NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 't3'? No, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me go through all the NT11 rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nI see NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nAnd NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1\nBut I don't see any direct production where NT11 \u2192 't3'. So 't3' isn't a terminal in the grammar; it's a nonterminal. Therefore, the string \"t0 t3\" includes a token that isn't a terminal in the grammar. That would mean the string can't be derived because \"t3\" isn't part of the language's terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken\u2014maybe 't3' is a terminal elsewhere. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through all the rules again, NT3 only produces 't2' and is a nonterminal. There is no production where any NT directly ends in 't3' as a terminal. So \"t3\" isn't a terminal; it's a nonterminal produced by some NT. Therefore, any string with \"t3\" isn't part of the language, because it's impossible to derive a terminal \"t3\".\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the entire grammar for any NT that produces 't3' as a terminal. Going through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (nonterminal)\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, which doesn't directly produce 't3' as a terminal, but through NT8 \u2192 't6' and others\u2014no, seems not.\n- Any NT with a production ending in 't3'?\n\nI don't think there's any. So \"t3\" is a nonterminal, which means it can't appear as a terminal in the string. Therefore, the string \"t0 t3\" can't be generated by this grammar because of the \"t3\" token.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S. Let's see what S produces:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nEach of these will start the derivation. Let's try one. Maybe the first one: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 can be 't0' or 't5' as per:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5'.\n\nIf we choose NT4 \u2192 't0', then NT8 can produce 't6' or something else. But wait, NT8 \u2192 't6' is one option (NT8 \u2192 't6' NT3), but in the string, we have \"t0 t3\". So after NT4 \u2192 't0', the next symbol should be something that produces 't3'.\n\nBut NT4 is the first symbol, so the second symbol is NT8. Let's see what NT8 can produce. Looking at the rules for NT8:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which includes 't3' as a terminal? Wait, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3.\n\nWait, so NT8's production is to NT6 and NT3.\n\nBut NT3 is a nonterminal that produces 't2'. So NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3 becomes 'something' and then 't2'. So the production from NT8 would have to be 't6' and 't2', not 't3'.\n\nAlternatively, are there other productions for NT8? Let me check.\n\nNT8 has:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6' NT3\n\nand is there another rule for NT8?

{"custom_id":"request-17","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the string \"t0 t0\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let's start breaking it down.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar is a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a particular formal language. In this case, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. That should help because each production either combines two non-terminals or replaces a non-terminal with a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see it's a bit extensive, but I'll focus on the relevant parts that might help derive the string \"t0 t0\". Let me first list out the production rules for the terminals involved, since the string only contains 't0', 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nThe production rules for terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (multiple rules, but it's 't0' each time)\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT13 \u2192 't4' and 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (several rules)\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT3 \u2192 't7' also 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't6' and 't3'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (another rule)\n- NT12 \u2192 seems to go to 't3' or other terminals, but not relevant for this string.\n\nNow, the string we're trying to get is \"t0 t0\". That's two 't0's separated by a space, but in the context of the grammar, it's easier to think in terms of the production rules without considering the spaces. So effectively, we need to generate a string that is t0 followed by t0, which are both terminals from the grammar.\n\nLet's think about how t0 can be generated. Looking at the production rules, t0 is generated by several non-terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (multiple times)\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (in some rules)\n\nSo, the idea is that in the parse tree, somewhere down the line, these non-terminals will produce t0.\n\nNow, the string \"t0 t0\" has two t0's, which suggests that the start symbol S must produce something that can split into two t0's. Let's look at the top-level production rules for S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can go to three different options, each being a pair of NTs. Let's see each option:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8: Let's see what each of these NTs can produce. NT4 has multiple productions, including NT14 NT7. NT8 has productions like NT6 NT3, which can produce 't0's. Let me think: NT4 could lead to t0, NT8 could lead to t0, so maybe this path could produce t0 t0. Similarly, NT4's other routes could also lead to t0, and NT8's as well.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11: NT4 can produce t0, and NT11 can produce t0 as well. So this could also be a path.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2: NT1 has productions leading to t8 and other things, but NT2 has rules like 't2', 't5', etc. I don't immediately see how this could lead to t0 t0.\n\nSo it's likely that either the first or the second production for S is the one we need to follow.\n\nLet's take the first option: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nWhat can NT4 produce? Looking at the rules, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. NT14 can produce 't3 NT7', which then can produce 't7... or other things. Hmm, but another production for NT4 is NT14 NT7, but also NT14 can go to 't3' or 't4' in some rules? Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, under NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nWait, no, I might have misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules earlier. Let me list all the rules for NT4:\n\nLooking at the top, NT4 is defined as:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4 (Wait, that's under NT2, not NT4)\n\nWait, no, for NT4, only the following production:\n\nLooking through, I think:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2 (Wait, this is under NT2's rule, not NT4's)\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in listing all rules for NT4.

The string to check is `t0 t0 t3`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) generate languages through the derivation of strings from the start symbol using production rules. In Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I see that all the productions fit this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe grammar has a start symbol S, and I need to see if the string `t0 t0 t3` can be derived from S. The first thing I notice is that S can produce two different paths: NT4 NT8 and NT1 NT2. Let me check each one to see if either can lead to the string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then each of NT4 and NT8 needs to produce a combination of non-terminals that result in t0. Let's look at NT4's productions. NT4 can go to NT14 NT7. NT14 can produce 't3' or 't4' (from the rules NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, but wait, in the provided grammar, NT14 actually has two productions: one is NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, but wait, looking back, I see NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4 and another for NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT4 has several productions: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT5, and NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT7. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree. Let's first see what can produce 't0'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't0', and NT2 \u2192 't2' but that seems incorrect\u2014it's written as NT8 \u2192 't6' and NT4 has a production to 't5' and 't7', but let me confirm.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for NT4, the productions are several, including NT4 \u2192 't0' as per the line \"NT4 -> 't0'\". Similarly, NT4 \u2192 't5' is another line. Also, NT4 can produce 't5' via NT4 \u2192 't4', but wait, perhaps I need to check each non-terminal's terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- 't0' is produced by NT9, NT4, and perhaps others.\n- 't1' is produced by NT10.\n- 't2' is produced by NT2.\n- 't3' is produced by NT11 and NT7 under certain conditions.\n- 't4' is produced by NT7.\n- 't5' is produced by NT4 and others.\n- 't6' is produced by NT10 and some other rules.\n- 't7' is produced by NT7?\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all terminals and their sources.\n\nTerminals:\n- NT10 \u2192 't1' (line: NT10 -> 't1')\n- NT9 \u2192 't0' (line: NT9 -> 't0')\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (line: NT4 -> 't0') and 't5' (line: NT4 -> 't5') and others.\nWait, no, let's correct that. For each NT rule that ends with 'a', that's a terminal. So:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0' (line: NT9 -> 't0')\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (line: NT4 -> 't0')\n- NT4 \u2192 't5' (line: NT4 -> 't5')\n- NT2 \u2192 't2' (line: NT2 -> 't2')\n- NT10 \u2192 't1' (line: NT10 -> 't1')\n- NT11 \u2192 't3' (line: NT11 -> 't3')\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (line: NT7 -> 't0')\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (line: NT8 -> 't0')\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (line: NT0 -> 't4')\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (line: NT0 -> 't10')\n- NT13 \u2192 't2' (line: NT13 \u2192 't2')\n- NT5 \u2192 't0' (line: NT5 -> 't0')\n- NT7 \u2192 't10' (line: NT7 \u2192 't10')\n- NT1 \u2192 't8' (line: NT1 \u2192 't8')\n- NT9 \u2192 't9' (line: NT9 \u2192 't9')\n- NT14 \u2192 't3' (line: NT14 \u2192 't3')\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list each terminal as per each production.\n\nLooking at each production rule and see if the RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't7' (line: NT3 \u2192 't7')\n- NT10 \u2192 't1' (line: NT10 \u2192 't1')\n- NT13 \u2192 't2' (line: NT13 \u2192 't2')\n- NT11 \u2192 't3' (line: NT11 \u2192 't3')\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (line: NT7 \u2192 't0')\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (line: NT8 \u2192 't0')\n- NT0 \u2192 't4' (line: NT0 \u2192 't4')\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (line: NT0 \u2192 't10')\n- NT13 \u2192 't2' (line: NT13 \u2192 't2')\n- NT5 \u2192 't0' (line: NT5 \u2192 't0')\n- NT7 \u2192 't10' (line: NT7 \u2192 't10')\n\nSo the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t7, t8, t9, t10.\n\nWait, wait, but looking again, some productions have terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't7'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo those are the terminals.\n\nNow, the string is `t0 t0 t3`. So three terminals: t0, then t0, then t3.\n\nNow, to see if this can be derived from S, which can go to NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me first consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, the derivations would be NT4 \u2192 something and NT8 \u2192 something else.\n\nBut wait, the string has three t's, which suggests that each production might contribute one terminal. But inCNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, to get three terminals, the derivation would need to have two splits, resulting in a total of three terminals.\n\nWait, or maybe it's a case where S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 \u2192 a terminal and NT8 \u2192 a non-terminal, which then splits again. Hmm, perhaps I should sketch a possible parse tree.\n\nLet me consider possible sequences.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT1 NT2. Let's see what NT1 and NT2 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 (line: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13)\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8 (line: NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8)\nNT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12 (line: NT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12)\nNT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12 (line: NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12)\nAnd other rules that may lead to terminals, but it's possible that NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8 could eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, if I proceed with S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then let's see what NT2 can produce.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it mostly fits this structure, except for some rules that might need a closer look. But I'll assume it's properly in CNF for now.\n\nThe string to check is `t0 t4 t5`. Since this is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string through a series of productions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S can produce:\n\n1. NT4 NT8\n2. NT1 NT2\n3. NT11 NT6\n\nI need to see if any of these sequences can lead to `t0 t4 t5`. Let's consider each option.\n\nFirst, option 1: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then NT4 can produce various things. Looking at the productions for NT4, I see entries like NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2, etc. But in the string, the first terminal is t0, so maybe if NT4 can produce t0? Let's check NT4's productions for terminal symbols. I spot NT4 \u2192 't0' (twice), and also NT4 \u2192 't5'. So NT4 can produce either t0 or t5. \n\nIf we take S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and then NT4 produces t0, then we have t0, and then NT8 needs to produce 't4 t5'. Let's look at NT8's productions. NT8 can produce NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0' (twice), and also NT8 \u2192 't6' in some cases. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT8 rules: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't6', NT8 \u2192 't0', etc. So to get 't4 t5' after t0, let's see how.\n\nWait, the string is t0 t4 t5. So after t0 from NT4, we have to produce 't4 t5'. So let's see what NT8 can generate. NT8 can produce 't0', but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, NT8 can produce 't4'? Wait, looking at the grammar: No, I don't see NT8 having a rule that directly produces 't4'. Looking through all NT8 productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2' (I think not, wait NT2's rules produce t2 but NT8's rules don't directly produce t2. Hmm.)\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that after NT4 produces t0, the remaining part is t4 t5, so the next symbol produced by NT8 would have to eventually produce t4 t5. But checking the grammar, it seems NT8 doesn't directly produce t4 or t5. So maybe option 1 isn't the right path.\n\nNext, option 2: S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Let's see. NT1 and NT2 can produce various things. I need to see if NT1 and NT2 can collectively produce t4 t5 when followed by any necessary symbols. But let's see NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, NT1 \u2192 NT8 NT15 (wait, no, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT1 having a production for t15. Let me check again. Oh, the last few lines have:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't2'\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\nNT4 \u2192 't7'\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\nSo maybe NT1 can produce t8. If NT1 produces t8, then NT2 needs to produce t4 t5. Let's look at NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT2 \u2192 't2', NT2 \u2192 't5', etc. Wait, NT2 can produce 't5' and 't2'. So if NT1 produces 't8' and NT2 produces 't5', that would give us 't8 t5', but the string we need is 't4 t5'. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if NT2 could produce t4, but I don't see NT2 having a rule that directly produces t4. So option 2 might not work.\n\nOption 3: S \u2192 NT11 NT6. So NT11 and NT6. Let's see what NT11 can produce. NT11 has rules like NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, NT11 \u2192 't3', etc. So possibly NT11 can produce 't3'. Then NT6's rules include NT6 \u2192 't9', etc. Let me check NT11 and NT6 productions:\n\nNT11 can produce 't3' and through recursive NT3 production. Let's see if we can get 't4' from somewhere. Wait, but our string is t0 t4 t5. So maybe starting differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT11 can produce a sequence that eventually gives t4, but I don't see NT11 directly producing 't4'. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider each part step by step.\n\nLet me map out the string and see how each part can be derived.\n\nThe string is t0 t4 t5.\n\nLooking at the terminals, t0 is produced by NT4 and some others. So maybe we can find a way to get t0 from one part and t4 t5 from the other.\n\nWait, let's think of the string as three steps: first produce t0, then from S, the remaining would need to produce t4 t5. But in the grammar, the productions for S are always two non-terminals, so we have to split the string into two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the string could be split into 't0' and 't4 t5', so using S \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 produces t0, and NT8 produces t4 t5. But as I saw before, NT8 doesn't produce t4. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to find a path where S \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT4 \u2192 t0, and NT8 \u2192 t4 t5. But how?\n\nLooking at NT8, do any of its productions can lead to t4 followed by t5? Let's consider NT8's rules again.

Looking through all NT8 productions:\n\nNo, NT8 isn't directly producing 't4' terminals. It's producing things like NT6 NT3, nt6, or 't0'. So how can we get t4 and t5?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let's think again. Maybe starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 \u2192 t0, and then NT8 needs to produce t4 t5. So how does NT8 produce these? \n\nLooking at NT8 again: It can produce NT6 NT3, or 't0', or 't2', etc. Wait, NT8 has a production to NT6 NT7, right? Let me check: I see NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 and NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, but not directly seeing NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT7.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t5 t5 t3`, and the grammar is quite complex with a lot of non-terminals and productions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how CNF works. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing because it avoids more complex productions with more than two non-terminals or variables on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce two non-terminals followed by another non-terminal depending on the rule. The goal is to see if the string can be derived from S using these productions. \n\nThe string given is `t5 t5 t5 t3`. So, breaking it down, each token is a terminal. I'll need to see how these terminals can be generated from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string. The first token is `t5`. Looking at the grammar, `t5` is directly produced by NT4 and NT2. So, I can try each of these.\n\nIf the first production is NT4, then I need to see how the remaining string can be built. NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1 (from the initial rules). But looking further, NT4 can also directly produce 't0' and 't5' in some rules. Wait, I should double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT4, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 (among others, but not relevant here)\n\nWait, actually, looking back: the initial rules for S are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, etc. But the direct productions for NT4 are:\n\nLooking at all the productions, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nYes, because in the list, NT4 has:\n\n- \"NT4 -> NT14 NT7\"\n- \"NT4 -> NT7 NT1\"\n- \"NT4 -> t0\"\n- \"NT4 -> t5\"\n\nSo, NT4 can directly produce 't4'? Wait, no. Looking again: there's \"NT4 -> t0\" and \"NT4 -> t5\". So, yes, NT4 can produce 't0' and 't5'.\n\nSo the first 't5' can come from NT4 \u2192 't5'. Then, we have the next part, which is NT4 producing the next 't5', and the third 't5', and finally, how to get 't3' at the end.\n\nWait, let's think step by step. Let's try to parse the string `t5 t5 t5 t3` using the CFG.\n\nSince the first symbol is 't5', which is produced by NT4. So, S can expand to NT4 NT8 (one of its rules). But wait, no. Actually, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 and other similar rules. So, let's see:\n\nIf the string starts with 't5', then S \u2192 NT4... So, the expansion would be S \u2192 NT4 NT8. But wait, no, because the first production from S is NT4 NT8, but that requires the entire string to be covered by that production. So perhaps I need to proceed differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think about the recursive nature of the grammar. Since each production is in CNF, each step can handle one terminal or one non-trivial production. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the leftmost symbol 't5', which must come from NT4, since that's the only way to produce 't5'. So, the first terminal is 't5', which comes from NT4.\n\nSo, step 1: NT4 \u2192 't5' (using the production NT4 \u2192 't5').\n\nNow, the remaining string after 't5' is 't5 t5 t3'. I need to get this from the next part, which was 'NT4' in the S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Wait, no: S can produce NT4 NT8, but in the context of the entire string, the first 't5' came from NT4. So after producing 't5', the next step would require the next production from NT4. But NT4 can produce either a non-terminal or a terminal. So if we've already used a terminal, now the other part of NT4 NT8 must be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the parser would start at the beginning.\n\nPerhaps, to make this manageable, I should create a parsing tree or see if each 't5' and 't3' can come from specific non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst 't5' can come from NT4 or NT2, both of which have a production to 't5'. Let's say we take NT4 first. Then, the next 't5' would come from NT4 again, and the third 't5' as well, but then the last 't3' needs to come from somewhere else.\n\nWait, but NT4 can't directly produce 't3'. Let me check the grammar: do any non-terminals produce 't3'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT3 \u2192 't2', NT7 \u2192 't0', etc. Wait, no, I think 't3' is actually an output of some NT production.\n\nWait, let's look again. In the productions, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT13 \u2192 't6' (Wait, under NT13, I see \"NT13 -> 't6)\")\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT that can produce 't3', I see:\n\nUnder NT11, there's \"NT11 -> 't3'\", yes.\n\nSo, to get 't3' at the end, I need a non-terminal that produces 't3' directly. That's NT11. So the last 't3' must come from NT11, which can be produced by \"NT11 -> 't3'\".\n\nNow, the string is `t5, t5, t5, t3`. Let's parse right to left because the last symbol is 't3'.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string from right to left.\n\n1. 't3' \u2192 comes from NT11 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo, the last part is NT11. Now, moving to the left, we have the third 't5'. Let's see how that 't5' can come.\n\nLooking at NT11's parent, which would be something that produces NT11 and another non-terminal. In the grammar, for example, NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (from \"NT2 \u2192 NT11 NT6\"), but we have 't5's in the front. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the third 't5' comes from NT4 again. Let's try.\n\nThe second 't5' could come from NT4 \u2192 't5' as well. So, each 't5' comes from NT4.\n\nSo, the grammar structure would be something like S \u2192 NT4 NT8 (from one of the initial productions). But wait, the first symbol is 't5', so that 't5' comes from NT4, then perhaps NT8 is producing some other non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of each 't5' as coming from NT4, and the 't3' from NT11.\n\nSo, the structure would be something like:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8 -> 't5' (from NT4) NT8.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure about the order. Maybe the string is parsed as:\n\n- First 't5' from NT4\n- Then, the NT4 can still produce another terminal or non-terminal. But since we're already using terminal 't5', the next part of S's production (which is NT8) would need to produce the rest of the string: 't5 t5 t3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of how the string can be generated. Each 't5' comes from NT4, and the 't3' comes from NT11. \n\nSo, the string is four symbols: 't5', 't5', 't5', 't3'.\n\nEach 't5' is NT4 \u2192 't5'. The 't3' is NT11 \u2192 't3'. Now, we need to see how this can be generated from S.\n\nS can produce NT4 NT8, so let's see how NT8 can produce the remaining symbols after the first 't5'.\n\nWait, but after the first 't5', the next two 't5's and the 't3'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, each token is a terminal symbol, so the string is four terminals: t8, t7, t7, t0.\n\nNow, the approach is to see if this string can be derived starting from S by applying the productions.\n\nFirst, let's see the possibilities from S. S has the productions:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, to derive the string, we'll have to see if any of these can produce the string.\n\nLet's take each production of S and see if either can yield the target string.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, we have to see if NT4 can produce a string that, when combined with NT8's output, results in \"t8 t7 t7 t0\".\n\nWait, but NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, NT4 can directly produce 't0' or 't5'. But in our string, the first symbol is 't8', which is not 't0' or 't5', so S \u2192 NT4... can't start with 't8'.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nSo, let's take N1 and N2. So, N1 and N2 each must produce a part of the string.\n\nOur string is \"t8 t7 t7 t0\", which is four tokens. Let's think about splitting this string into two parts where the first part comes from NT1 and the second from NT2.\n\nPossible decompositions could be:\n\n1. NT1 \u2192 t8 and NT2 \u2192 t7 t7 t0\nBut wait, NT1 is a non-terminal, so it would have to produce a string. Let me see what NT1 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- Is there any other production for NT1? Let's check the provided rules again.\n\nFrom above, NT1 has:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n\nSo, NT1 can produce 't8' or a combination. If NT1 is to produce 't8', then the first token is 't8'. That leaves NT2 to produce \"t7 t7 t0\".\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nFirst token is 't8' (from NT1 \u2192 't8').

{"custom_id":"request-73","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t8 t2 t10 t2 t4\" can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a way to structure grammars where each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string has spaces between the tokens, so I think each token like 't8' is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar productions and see how they can derive the given string step by step. The string is t8, t2, t10, t2, t4. Let me try to break it down.\n\nI notice that the grammar has non-terminals like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals like 't0', 't1', up to 't13'. Each of these terminals corresponds to specific strings from the input.\n\nLet me check the initial productions for S:\n\nS can be broken down into two parts: NT4 followed by NT8, or NT4 followed by NT11, or NT1 followed by NT2.\n\nWait, the string starts with t8, so looking at the terminal symbols, let's see which non-terminals can produce t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT8 -> NT6 NT3, but that's just the production.

I see that NT11 has a rule that ends in 't3', but perhaps I should look if any non-terminal directly produces 't8'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that produces 't8' directly except maybe NT12. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT12 is 't4' or 't3' in some cases.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to find the sequence of productions that can reduce the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t8, t2, t10, t2, t4.\n\nLet's consider the first token 't8'. Looking at the grammar, we need to find which non-terminals can produce 't8'. Looking at the rules, I see NT12 -> NT8 NT4, but NT8 itself is being split here. Hmm, perhaps I should look deeper.\n\nWait, maybe 't8' can be produced by some NT leading to it. Looking at the right-hand sides, I notice that NT8 -> NT6 NT3. So if NT6 is 't0' and NT3 is something else.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to work backwards. Let's try to see how the string can be produced.\n\nLet me start from the entire string and see if it can be matched by a single production.\n\nWait, looking at the initial S productions: S can go to NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. \n\nLooking at the given string, perhaps S can produce the whole string through these sequences.\n\nLet's try the first option: S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 can produce t0, t5, or t7, since looking through the rules:\n\nNT4 has rules:\n-> NT14 NT7\n-> NT4 NT2\n-> NT2 NT4\n-> NT14 NT4\n-> etc., but some of these result in terminals.\n\nWait, let me look for what NT4 can produce directly. Oh, wait, the NT4's productions are:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't0' (from NT4 -> NT14 NT7 and then perhaps NT7 -> 't0'?)\nWait, no, let me find exactly what NT4 can produce. Oh, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, no, looking back: \n\nActually, looking through the rules, I see that NT4 has:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'?\n\nWait, I need to check each rule.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't4' (Wait, that's two production rules for NT13: -> 't4' and -> 't2'? Or is it that there are two separate production rules? Probably, NT13 can produce 't2' or 't4', but that seems conflicting unless it's a typo. Hmm, but perhaps each rule has a unique RHS, so maybe it's either 't4' or 't2' or both.\n\nWait no, in the grammar, each NT has a certain set of production rules. Let me go through each rule step by step to see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal's productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't9 't13' ? No, wait:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT1: \n- NT9 -> 't0'\nSo wait, NT9 -> 't0'. Similarly, other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to identify which non-terminals directly produce each terminal.\n\nLet's list the possible non-terminals that directly produce each terminal:\n\nt0:\n\nLooking through:\n- NT4 -> 't0' (once)\n- NT5 -> 't0' (twice)\n- NT9 -> 't0' (twice)\n- NT10 -> 't0'? No, wait, looking at the rules earlier: no, I see NT10 has rules like -> 't6'.\n- Wait, looking again, NT9 has NT9 -> 't0', yes.\n- Similarly, NT5 -> 't0' (twice)\n- NT10 -> 't1' (nt10's rules: -> 't1'?)\nWait, looking at the NT10 rules:\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\n\nWait, no: the rule says NT10 -> 't6' somewhere, but maybe others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list.\n\nLet me try to go through each non-terminal and their direct terminal productions.\n\nNT0:\nLooking through its rules:\n- NT0 -> 't4' (yes, from NT13's rule, but wait, let me see: no, in the rules, NT0's productions are:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT0: \"NT0 -> 't10'\", \"NT0 -> 't4'\", etc.\n\nWait, for example, NT0 -> 't4' is one production.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 -> 't10' is another.\n\nSo directly, NT0 can produce 't4' and 't10'.\n\nNT1: looking through, NT1 -> 't8' is a production.\n\nYes, indeed: NT1 -> 't8'.\n\nSo 't8' can be directly produced by NT1.\n\nSimilarly, NT2: looking through its rules:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see \"NT2 -> 't2'\", \"NT2 -> 't5'\", and \"NT2 -> 't7'\". Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT2 has multiple production rules. Wait, looking at each line:\n\nYes, for example, one line is: NT2 -> 't2'.\n\nAnother is: NT2 -> 't5'.\n\nAnd another is: NT2 -> 't7', but I need to see exactly. Wait, in the grammar, looking for NT2's rules:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT2 -> 't2'\", \"NT2 -> 't5'\", and later: \"NT2 -> 't7'\".\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through the list, I find:\n\n\"NT2 -> 't5'\", \"NT2 -> 't7'\", and other rules involving NT2.\n\nSo NT2 can produce 't2', 't5', 't7'.\n\nSimilarly for NT4:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't7'.\n\nSo NT4 can directly produce 't0', 't5', or 't7'.\n\nNT5:\n\nLooking through NT5's rules:\n\n\"NT5 -> 't0'\", etc.\n\nSo 't0'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 can produce 't0', 't1', 't6', 't7' etc.\n\nBut I think the key here is that some non-terminals directly produce each terminal.\n\nSo let's start by considering that 't8' is produced by NT1 in one step. So the initial symbol S can derive NT1 and NT2, perhaps? Wait, no, S can derive sequences like NT4 and NT8, but in the string, we have 't8' as the first token.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire string. The string starts with 't8', so the first symbol is 't8'.

S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, to get t5, t9, etc., I need to see if any of these can derive to parts of the string. Let's start by trying the first production, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4: Looking at the productions for NT4, there are multiple:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n\nSimilarly, NT8: Let's check its productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't6'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n\nHmm, but our string starts with t5. So, for the first symbol, we can choose either NT4 or NT8 to produce t5. Let's first consider NT4 producing t5. So, NT4 \u2192 't5'.\n\nThat gives us t5, then we need to get the next symbols from NT8. Let's see what NT8 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, one of them is NT8 \u2192 't5'. So if NT8 \u2192 't5', the next symbol would be t5. But the next symbol in the string is t9, so that won't work. So maybe another path for NT8.\n\nNT8 can also be NT6 NT3, which means we need to derive NT6 and NT3. Let's see what those can produce.\n\nNT6: Looking at its productions, one is NT6 \u2192 't3'. So NT6 \u2192 't3'.\n\nNT3: Checking NT3's productions, we have NT3 \u2192 't2' and other non-terminals. Also, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1, which is deeper. Wait, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should walk through the entire derivation step by step.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nAssuming NT4 \u2192 't5' (so taking the direct production), that's our first symbol.\n\nNext, NT8 needs to derive the rest: t9 t2 t10 t5 t5. But NT8's production is either NT6 NT3 or other terminals. Let's try NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3.\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 't3' (direct production), giving us 't3' after 't5', so far t5 t3.\n\nBut our string after t5 is t9, not t3, so that's a problem. So maybe NT8 can't produce NT6 right away. Let's see other options for NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, another option is NT8 \u2192 't6'. So if NT8 \u2192 't6', that's another approach.\n\nBut our target string is t5, then t9. So 't6' wouldn't match 't9', so that's no good.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong to take NT4 \u2192 't5' first. Maybe I should take another path for NT4. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, what if we take S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and instead of NT4 \u2192 't5', we take NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7.\n\nNT14: Looking at NT14's production, it's 't3' or 't4'.\n\nSo NT14 \u2192 't3' gives us t3, then NT7. Wait, but our target starts with t5, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, NT14 can be 't4', giving us 't4' and then NT7. Again, not matching t5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and then NT7 \u2192 't0' could give 't4', but that won't help.\n\nHmm, maybe this path isn't getting us anywhere. Let's try another initial production for S.\n\nWhat about S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me see. NT1's productions include NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, which might get complex, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT1's productions, other options are NT1 \u2192 't8' or NT1 \u2192 ... Let's see: NT1 can also be 't8' directly.\n\nSo, if NT1 \u2192 't8', then the first symbol is t8, but our string starts with t5, so that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, what about S \u2192 NT5 NT8?\n\nWait, there's an S production S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT5 NT8? No, I think I misread. Looking back at the grammar, the initial S productions are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT4\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nNo, S doesn't have a production with NT5 directly. Wait, checking again: No, the initial productions are as listed. So I don't think I can take another S production.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial S productions are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, no, S doesn't produce NT5 NT8. So maybe that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider a different approach. Let's think about the string: t5, t9, t2, t10, t5, t5.\n\nLet's look at each symbol and see what possible NTs can produce them.\n\nt5 can come from NT4 \u2192 't5', NT2 \u2192 't2'? Wait, NT2's production is 't2' or other non-terminals. Wait, no. Wait, the terminals:\n\nLet me list the terminals in the NT productions:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT14 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't7'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't5', 't10'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT2 (another instance) has a production 't5' as well.\nWait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that I can exploit. The string to check is `t0 t8 t9 t5 t3 t2`.\n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. CNF has productions where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure is useful for parsing because it simplifies the process into a series of steps where each production contributes to the string by either breaking down non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's extensive with many non-terminals and productions. However, the string we're evaluating is `t0 t8 t9 t5 t3 t2`. I notice that each part of the string is a terminal, so I need to see if a series of productions starting from S can derive this sequence.\n\nLet me start by writing down the grammar rules for clarity. The start symbol is S, and the productions from S are:\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSince the string starts with `t0`, I should check which of the NT symbols can produce `t0`. Scanning through the rules, I see NT0 has several productions, including NT0 -> 't0', so that's one possibility. Also, NT10 and NT9 have 't1', 't0', etc.\n\nGiven that the string starts with `t0`, perhaps the first production from S is S -> NT4 NT8. Because NT4 and NT8 both have 't4' and 't0' or 't8' among their terminals. Wait, but looking at the rules, NT4 has multiple options including 't0' and 't5'. NT8 has 't0' as well.\n\nWait, let me check the rules more carefully. NT4 has:\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n- NT4 -> 't4'\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has:\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't6'\n- NT8 -> 't3'\n\nSo if we choose S -> NT4 NT8, the first part of the string would be the terminals from NT4 and then NT8. Let's say NT4 produces 't0' and NT8 produces 't8', giving us 't0 t8', which matches the beginning of our string.\n\nSo the initial step could be:\nS -> NT4 NT8\n\nThen, we need to explore how NT4 and NT8 can generate their respective parts of the string. Starting with NT4, it can be 't0', so we're good. Then NT8 must generate 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2'.\n\nWait, but the string continues as 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2', so we now need to see if NT8 can produce that sequence. Let's look at the productions of NT8:\n\nNT8 -> 't0' (but that's already used)\nNT8 -> 't6'\nNT8 -> 't3'\nAlso, NT8 could derive other strings through intermediate non-terminals. For example, perhaps NT8 -> NT12 NT9, which then needs to break down further.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this step by step, considering each non-terminal and their possible productions.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the first option is S -> NT4 NT8. So let's take that path. Now, NT4 must produce 't0', and NT8 must produce the remaining part of the string 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2'.\n\nSo NT8 needs to derive 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2'. Let's see the productions for NT8. NT8 can go to NT12 NT9, which would require NT12 and NT9 to produce 't8' and then the rest. Looking at NT12, the productions are:\nNT12 -> NT3 NT12\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4\nNT12 -> NT5 NT10\nNT12 -> NT8 NT13\nNT12 -> NT9 NT12\n\nHmm, that seems complex. Alternatively, maybe NT8 can directly produce some sequence, but looking at the rules, NT8 only has direct terminal productions 't0', 't6', 't3'. So perhaps it's better to see if through non-terminals, NT8 can reach the needed string.\n\nWait, maybe I should break down NT8:\n\nIf NT8 -> NT12 NT9, then let's see what NT12 and NT9 can produce.\n\nNT9 has productions like NT9 -> 't0', and others leading to other non-terminals. But in this case, we need 't8' to come from NT12. So NT12 could produce 't8' via a production? Looking back, NT12 has NT12 -> NT8 NT4. Wait, no, that's another production. Let me check:\n\nNT12 productions:\n- NT12 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT12 -> NT5 NT10\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT13\n- NT12 -> NT9 NT12\n\nSo, if NT12 produces 't8', it would need to go through NT8. But that's a cycle, so perhaps another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT12 can produce a terminal, but looking at NT12's productions, they only lead to other non-terminals or combinations, so NT12 will eventually have to derive a terminal. Maybe through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The string we're trying to derive is 't0 t8 t9 t5 t3 t2'. So S -> NT4 NT8, with NT4 -> 't0' and NT8 -> 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2'.\n\nWait, but the string is given as 't0 t8 t9 t5 t3 t2', so after NT4 gives 't0', NT8 must derive the rest: t8 t9 t5 t3 t2.\n\nHmm, perhaps NT8 can't directly do that because its terminal options are 't6', 't3', 't0'. So maybe we need to look at non-terminals that can lead to 't8' as a part of their derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to construct a parse tree that starts with S and applies productions step by step to generate the string.\n\nLet's try this:\n\nStep 1: S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, we have two symbols to derive: NT4 and NT8.\n\nWe need NT4 to produce 't0' and NT8 to produce 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2'.\n\nNT4's production can lead to 't0', so let's take that. Now, the string so far is 't0', and we need to derive 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2' from NT8.\n\nSo NT8 needs to produce the rest. Let's see if NT8 can derive 't8 t9 t5 t3 t2'.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, the only terminals are 't0', 't6', and 't3'. So maybe we need a path where NT8 goes through NT12 or other non-terminals to reach those terminals.\n\nWait, maybe through NT8 -> NT12 NT9.\n\nThen, NT12 needs to produce 't8', and NT9 needs to produce 't9 t5 t3 t2'.\n\nWait, but NT12 can derive 't8' via NT12 -> NT8 NT4, but that creates a cycle. Alternatively, maybe NT12 can go to NT5 NT10.\n\nWait, let me try to map this out.\n\nSo:\n\nNT8 -> NT12 NT9\n\nNow, NT12 must produce 't8'. How?\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4: If NT12 uses this production, it's NT8 followed by NT4, but both can produce 't0's or other sequences, which doesn't get us 't8' directly. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking for other productions in NT12 that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, looking at NT12's productions again, there's no direct production to a terminal, only combinations. So perhaps we're stuck here. Another approach is to see if NT8 can derive 't8' through another path.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, there's NT8 -> NT13 NT5. Hmm, NT13 has several options, including 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should backtrack and consider a different initial production from S.\n\nS has other options: S -> NT4 NT11 or S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me explore S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nNT1 can produce 't8', as per its productions, including NT1 -> 't8'. So if we take NT1 -> 't8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the string `t8 t2 t2 t5 t9 t6 t4` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be a bit tricky, especially with so many non-terminals. But let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form has production rules where each rule produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar has a bunch of rules like S -> NT4 NT8, and so on. At the end, some of the non-terminals resolve to terminals with specific letters like 't0', 't1', etc. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of seven terms: t8, t2, t2, t5, t9, t6, t4. My first thought is to see if these terminals are produced by any of the start symbols or derived from the non-terminals.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, I see that S can produce NT4 and NT8. Both NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals, so each of them must expand into more non-terminals before we get to the terminals. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT4 has two options: NT4 -> NT14 NT7 and NT4 -> NT7 NT11. Let's pick one. Maybe NT4 -> NT7 NT11. Then each of NT7 and NT11 would need to produce the required terminals.\n\nWait, looking further, NT7 has multiple options. For example, NT7 -> NT9 NT7 or NT7 -> NT11 NT6. I'm getting a bit lost here. Maybe I should visualize this as a parsing tree.\n\nLet's try to construct a possible derivation for the string. The string is seven terminals, so with the Chomsky normal form, which uses two symbols per production (except for the terminals), the string length should be 2^(n-1) where n is 7. That's 2^6 = 64, which is much longer than 7. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, no, that's when building a leftmost derivation. But maybe we're just trying to see if the string is a possible result, regardless of the derivation steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the CYK algorithm or something, but I'm not too familiar with that. Maybe another approach is to see what possible sequences of non-terminals the string could come from.\n\nLooking back, the string has t8 at the beginning. So from S, it can go to NT4 NT8, which would generate t8 at the end. So the string ends with t4, so perhaps NT8 is connected to t4.\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT8, I see NT8 -> NT6 NT3 and also NT8 -> NT1 NT5. Also, NT8 -> NT6 NT3 again. Hmm. Let's see which of these can lead to t8.\n\nWait, t8 is a terminal. So let's look at the production rules for NT8. The possible rules are:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3 again.\n\nWait, that seems redundant, maybe a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nSo, if NT8 is expanded into NT6 NT3, then I need to find how NT6 and NT3 are derived. Or, if it's NT1 NT5.\n\nLooking at NT8 again, another option is NT8 -> NT6 NT3. Let's check NT6. From the rules, NT6 -> NT9 NT11, NT7 -> NT11 NT6, etc. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can find a path from S to t8 t2 t2 t5 t9 t6 t4.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see what each non-terminal can produce. Let's list out the terminals each non-terminal can produce:\n\n- NT3 -> t7\n- NT5 -> t0, t5, t0 (from NT5 -> NT9 NT2)\n- NT7 can produce t0, t10, t9, etc.\n- NT9 -> t10, t0\n- NT4 -> t0, t5, t7\n- NT2 -> t2, t5, t7\n- NT1 -> t8, t13, t14\n- NT10 -> t1, t6, t10\n- etc.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to try to write possible production sequences that could generate this string.\n\nLet me consider the string: t8, t2, t2, t5, t9, t6, t4.\n\nLooking at the last part, t4. From the rules, t4 is produced by NT4 -> 't4' in one rule, and others like NT4 -> t0, t5, etc. Wait, looking at NT4's rules, I see NT4 can go to t0, t5, t7, etc., but also directly produce 't4' when NT4 -> 't4'. Wait, no. Looking back, the rules are all in terms of non-terminals; the terminals are resolved at the bottom. For example, looking at NT3 -> 't7', which is terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT4 can go to 't0', 't5', and 't7', or to other non-terminals like NT7 and NT11. So 't4' is only directly produced by NT4 when NT4's rule is S-> NT4 NT8, which results in two terminals if both NT4 and NT8 produce 't4', but that's not the case here. The string ends with t4, so perhaps NT4 is producing 't4', but I need to check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, the rules for the non-terminals don't include a production for NT4 -> 't4'; instead, 't4' is the result of a non-terminal production elsewhere, possibly via NT7 or NT13. Wait, looking back, I have:\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\nWait, but more importantly, some of these non-terminals may combine to produce the terminals.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look for a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string `t8 t2 t2 t5 t9 t6 t4` into possible subterms that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's see what each terminal can be generated from. Let's consider where t8 comes from. From the rules, t8 is only produced by NT8 -> 't8'? Or maybe through some other path.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the rules, NT8 can be expanded into NT6 NT3 or other combinations. Then, the t8 would come from somewhere in the expansion.\n\nWait, for example, if NT8 is written as NT8 -> NT6 NT3, then NT6 is NT9 NT11, and NT3 is NT7 NT1. Then NT7 is t0, and so on. Hmm, but I'm not getting t8 as a terminal in that path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t8 is generated through a different path. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT8, the production rules are:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3 again.\n\nWait, so the first option is NT8 -> NT6 NT3.\n\nNow, if I expand NT6 and NT3:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT11 (among others)\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\n\nNow, NT7 can expand further, perhaps leading to t0 or other terminals.\n\nWait, this doesn't seem to get us to t8. Alternatively, using the second rule NT8 -> NT1 NT5.\n\nLet's expand NT1 and NT5:\n\nNT1 has productions like NT1 -> NT9 NT13, NT1 -> NT12 NT8, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 -> NT10 NT2, etc.\n\nI'm not seeing how this would get to t8 immediately. Maybe the initial approach is wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps t8 is produced by NT8 -> 't8', but I don't see a direct rule for NT8 -> 't8' in the given rules. Wait, looking again at the NT8 rules, none of them directly produce 't8'; the productions for NT8 all produce two non-terminals. So t8 must come from another expansion.\n\nAh, maybe the string starts with t8, so that t8 must come from the second part of NT8's production, like NT8 -> NT1 NT5, but then one of those must produce t8. Let me see:\n\nIf NT8 -> NT1 NT5, then perhaps NT1 produces t8. Let's check NT1's rules: NT1 can go to NT9 NT13, NT9 NT1, etc. Alternatively, NT1 can produce NT12 NT8.\n\nWait, NT12 can go to NT8 NT4, and NT8 could go to t8 through another production.

{"custom_id":"request-112","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t5 t5 t5 t0 t10 t0 t3` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that might make parsing easier, but in this case, with the complexity of the rules, maybe a bottom-up approach or recursive descent would work. But since I don't have to write a parser, I'll try to analyze step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The non-terminals are S, NT1, NT2, ..., NT14, and the terminals are t0, t1, ..., t13, as well as 't5', 't0', 't2', etc. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: t5 followed by t5, then t5, t0, t10, t0, t3. Let me write this as [t5, t5, t5, t0, t10, t0, t3].\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and the right side, except for the starting symbol which can have two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production on the right side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo the start symbol S has productions that go to NT4 NT5, etc. I'll need to see how the string can be generated from S. Let's see possible paths.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t5. Let me check if there's a production that generates t5. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 t5 and NT2 \u2192 t5. So t5 can be generated by NT4 or NT2.\n\nThe string starts with three t5s: t5 t5 t5. Let me build that part first. I can generate t5 from NT4 or NT2. Let's say the first t5 comes from NT4. Then, the second step is another t5, which again comes from NT4 or NT2. Let's assume it's another NT4. The third t5: again from NT4. So, the first three tokens are generated by NT4 \u2192 t5 three times. Alternatively, the first t5 could come from NT2, but I don't know yet. So far, I can see that the first three t5s are possible, but I need to see if the rest can be built.\n\nNext, the fourth token is t0. Where does t0 come from? Looking at the grammar, several non-terminals produce t0. For example, NT0 \u2192 t10, but that's not t0. Wait, let's check. Checking all rules, NT9 \u2192 t9, but I don't see any rules producing t0 except NT7 \u2192 t0, NT0 \u2192 t10, wait no. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the rules for terminals:\n- NT0 \u2192 t10\n- NT0 \u2192 t4\n- NT10 \u2192 t6\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT8 \u2192 t0\n- NT9 \u2192 t9\n- NT4 \u2192 t5 and t7?\nWait I need to check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT0 \u2192 't10' and 't4'. Wait, no, let me re-express the rules correctly.\n\nWait the grammar has these terminal productions:\n- NT0 \u2192 t10\n- NT0 \u2192 t4\n- NT10 \u2192 t6\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT8 \u2192 t0\n- NT9 \u2192 t9\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\n- NT2 \u2192 t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t9\n\nWait, looking for any non-terminals that produce 't0'. The only ones are NT5, NT7, and NT8, each producing t0. So the fourth token t0 can come from any of those.\n\nSo after the three t5s, we have a t0. Let's say the fourth t0 comes from NT5. Then, we move on to the fifth token t10. Where does t10 come from? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT10 produces t6 and NT0 produces t10. So t10 can come from NT10 or NT0. But wait, NT0 produces 't10' and 't4'. So t10 is generated by NT0.\n\nSo if the fifth token is t10, it would have to come from NT0, which can be generated by NT0 using the rule NT0 \u2192 't10'. Alternatively, NT0 can be produced from other non-terminals, but if we need t10 as a terminal, then the production is NT0 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo the string is t5 t5 t5 t0 t10 t0 t3.\n\nWait, after t10, the next token is t0. So after t10, we have t0 again. Let's see, t0 comes from NT5, NT7, or NT8.\n\nThen, the next token is t0 again. So from which non-terminal is that t0 produced? It can be any of NT5, NT7, or NT8.\n\nFinally, the last token is t3. So t3 is produced by which non-terminals? Let's check the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t3 occurs in a production, as NT7 \u2192 NT3 t7? Wait no, looking back.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT3 is 't2', but looking at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for where t3 appears as a terminal. Check each rule.\n\nI see NT3 \u2192 't2', so t3 is 't2'? No, wait that might be a misread. Let's look at the rules again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n\nWait, no.

Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where each non-terminal (A) is rewritten into either two non-terminals (BC) or a terminal (a). The given grammar seems to fit that structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe string to analyze is `t10 t8 t4 t2 t5 t7 t0 t0`. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would expand non-terminals step by step until we reach terminals. I should consider how each terminal corresponds to a rule.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t10`. I'll check which rule produces `t10`.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT0 -> NT10 NT10, but NT10 has multiple rules. Wait, let me check the individual terminals:\n\nFrom the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't7', 't0', 't10', 't11', etc.\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking at `NT13 -> 't2'`, `NT5 -> 't0'`, `NT9 -> 't0'`, `NT8 -> 't0'`, `NT0 -> 't10'`, `NT4 -> 't0'`, `NT4 -> 't5'`, `NT2 -> 't2'`, etc.\n\nWait, let me make a list of the terminals as per the given NT rules:\n\nFrom the NT0 rules:\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT0 -> 't1'\n\nFrom NT9:\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\nFrom NT4:\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\nFrom NT2:\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n\nFrom NT7:\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't7'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't11'\n\nFrom NT11:\n- NT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, that's how the terminals work. Each NT rule can produce specific terminals.\n\nSo the string is `t10 t8 t4 t2 t5 t7 t0 t0`.\n\nLet's break this down into each symbol and see if they can be generated by some rule in the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is `t10`. Looking at the NT rules, which NT can produce `t10`? Let's see.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't10'\n\nSo `t10` can be produced by either NT0 or NT7.\n\nAssuming we start with S, which can be rewritten into NT4 NT8, as per the first rule of S.\n\nWait, S has these options:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo the string starts with `t10`, but `t10` is derived from NT0 or NT7. So to get `t10` as the first symbol, perhaps we need a production that starts with NT0 or NT7.\n\nWait, but the leftmost symbol in the string is `t10`, which is a terminal. So for it to be the leftmost, it must come from a rule that starts with a terminal. Looking through the NT rules:\n\nNT0 -> 't10' (so T0 is a terminal here)\nNT7 -> 't10'\n\nSo the start symbol S must first produce either NT0 or NT7, which then produce `t10` at the beginning.\n\nLooking at S, let's see if S can derive something that starts with NT0 or NT7.\n\nLooking at S's rules:\n\nS has three options:\n\n1. NT4 followed by NT8\n2. NT4 followed by NT11\n3. NT1 followed by NT2\n\nSo we can model each possibility and see if the string can be generated.\n\nLet's try each possibility.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT4 NT8. So the first symbols would be derived from NT4 and NT8, which might produce `t2` and `t0`, etc. But the string starts with `t10`, which would require that one of these NTs (NT4 or NT8) produces `t10`, but looking at NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 has rules:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT4 can't produce `t10`. Let's check NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules, I don't immediately see NT8 having a rule that includes `t10`. Let's double-check:\n\n- NT8's rules, from the given list: `NT8 -> 't0', 't6', 't3', 't7', etc. Wait, actually:\n\nLooking through the given NT rules:\n\nNT8 has the following productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT6 NT2\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> NT9 NT7\nNT8 -> NT0 NT5\nNT8 -> NT0 NT3\nNT8 -> NT7 NT2\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\nNT8 -> NT1 NT8\nNT8 -> NT9 NT8\nNT8 -> NT0 NT8\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nWait, none of these produce `t10` directly. So if S is expanding to NT4 NT8, the first symbol would come from NT4 or NT8.\n\nNT4 can't produce `t10`, and NT8's rules only produce terminals like `t0`, `t6`, etc. So in this case, the first symbol `t10` can't be generated by S -> NT4 NT8 because neither NT4 nor NT8 can produce `t10`.\n\nSo let's move to the second option for S.\n\nCase 2: S -> NT4 NT11. Again, let's see.\n\nNT4 can't produce `t10`, so the first symbol of the string must come from NT11.\n\nBut looking at NT11's rules, does it produce `t10`? Let me check the rules for NT11:\n\nFrom the given list:\n\nNT11 has the following:\n\n- NT11 -> NT3 NT11\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n\nWait, so NT11 can produce `t3` (since NT3 is a terminal in another rule), but does it produce `t10`? Looking at NT11's rules, I don't see a rule that directly produces `t10`. Let me confirm if any of NT11's rules lead to `t10` downstream.\n\nWait, perhaps not directly, so in the string, the first symbol is `t10`, which would require either NT0 or NT7 to produce it. But in this case, S is expanding to NT4 NT11, so the first symbols would be from NT4 and NT11. But NT4 can't produce `t10`, so this case won't produce the wanted string.\n\nCase 3: S -> NT1 NT2. So S starts with NT1 and NT2, which might produce `t8` and something else.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t10`, so perhaps S needs to expand through NT0 or NT7. But in this case, S expands to NT1 and NT2.

{"custom_id":"request-131","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this question where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t7 t0 t3 t9 t3 t1 t3 t7`. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammars provided. The grammar starts with S, and the productions are a bit tangled. Each production seems to break down into non-terminals (NT) and terminals. I need to find a way to derive the string starting from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it's eight tokens long, all of which are terminals except for the ones that might be part of the non-terminals. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, all productions have two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, except for the base cases where they produce terminals. So each production can either produce a terminal or split into two non-terminals.\n\nThe string is `t7 t0 t3 t9 t3 t1 t3 t7`. I notice that each \"t\" is a terminal, so each token must result from a terminal production. Let me see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I spot lines like:\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT10 -> 't3'\n- etc. So I can start by mapping each terminal to its corresponding production.\n\nLet me break down the string step by step. Starting with the entire string, it's eight tokens, so I need to split it into parts that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a more systematic approach would help. I can try to work backwards, starting from the end of the string and seeing if I can find a sequence of productions that can reduce to S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to find a derivation path from S to the given string. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nLet me check if any of these can lead to a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t7, which comes from NT3. So perhaps somewhere in the derivation, NT3 is used. Let's see where NT3 appears.\n\nIn the grammar, NT3 is defined as:\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\nNT7 -> 't0'\nand other productions like NT3 -> NT11 NT6, etc. So I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start by trying to see which production rules can generate the given string.\n\nEach step in the derivation will double the number of symbols, except for when a terminal is produced. So let's think about the length of the string. It's 8 tokens, so perhaps the derivation involves four steps where each step splits symbols into two, leading to 16, but then some of those are terminals.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best approach. Let me instead map each token back to a possible production.\n\nThe string is:\n1: t7\n2: t0\n3: t3\n4: t9\n5: t3\n6: t1\n7: t3\n8: t7\n\nSo starting from the end, the last token is t7, which comes from NT3.\n\nSo the last production would be NT3 \u2192 't7', which requires NT3 \u2192 't7'. Looking at the grammar, there is a production NT3 \u2192 't7', which is correct.\n\nSo the last symbol is NT3 on the left, and it's generating 't7'. So the penultimate symbol in the string would have to be the symbol before NT3 in the production. But wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nSo if the last production was NT3 \u2192 't7', then the part before NT3 would be whatever generated the string up to that point.\n\nHmm, perhaps a recursive descent approach would be better, but maybe I can try to break the string into parts.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be generated by S. Let's consider the first few symbols.\n\nThe first symbol is t7. Looking at the grammar, to get t7, NT7 must be involved. So perhaps the first part of the string is generated by NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\nNT7 \u2192 NT10 NT7\nOther NT7\u2192... but maybe the relevant ones are early in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the string can be split into chunks that correspond to parts of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I can build parse trees. Let me see.\n\nThe string is eight tokens. Let me count the positions:\n\n1: t7\n2: t0\n3: t3\n4: t9\n5: t3\n6: t1\n7: t3\n8: t7\n\nLet me see if I can group these into a possible leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S.\n\nS can go to NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me try NT1 NT2 first since the string starts with t7 and t0.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT1 NT2. NT1 is a non-terminal, and NT2 is another.\n\nLooking at NT1's production: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. So maybe NT1 produces something that can give t0 and t something.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Perhaps I should list the possible ways each token can be generated.\n\nLet's list all possible sources:\n\nt7 can come from NT3.\n\nt0 can come from NT9, NT14, NT4, etc. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't10' again, etc. So NT0 can produce t10, t4, etc.\n\nWait, for t0: NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nt3 comes from NT3's production.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try building a derivation step by step.\n\nLet's try to build the string step by step, starting from S and expanding non-terminals into terminals where possible.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, NT4 and NT8. Let's see what they produce.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nAnd also, several other terminals:\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'.\n\nSo to get 't7' as the first token, maybe we need NT7's production. Let's see.\n\nBut in the starting S \u2192 NT4 NT8, both NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals. So we need to expand them.\n\nWait, let's suppose S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let's expand NT4 first.\n\nNT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', or split into non-terminals. If we're aiming for t7, maybe we need to expand into non-terminals that can produce t7.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: let's look into the string and see which symbols can be generated in which order.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt7 t0 t3 t9 t3 t1 t3 t7\n\nLet me list the tokens with their positions:\n\n1: t7\n2: t0\n3: t3\n4: t9\n5: t3\n6: t1\n7: t3\n8: t7\n\nLet me see if this can be derived by working backwards.\n\nThe last symbol is t7, which comes from NT3 \u21d2 't7'. So the last part must be NT3. Before that, perhaps the part before NT3 in the string would depend on the production that gave rise to NT3.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1 (among others). So if the production is NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1, then before NT3, we'd have NT7 NT1.\n\nLet me consider that the last two symbols are NT3 and NT1. Wait, no: NT3 would produce 't7', and the production that leads to it could involve NT7 and NT1. So maybe the string ends with 't7', which comes from NT3, which was produced by NT7 and NT1.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of the rightmost derivation, where each step appends a terminal or a non-terminal. But perhaps leftmost is easier for me.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about how the string can be split into parts by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, positions 1-8: perhaps we can split it into chunks that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother thought: Let's see which non-terminals can generate sequences starting with t7, t0, etc.\n\nLooking at t7: comes from NT3, which can split into NT7 NT1.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent it as the string being built from the bottom up.\n\nLet me try to start from the leaves and work up."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-150","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar seems pretty complex with a lot of non-terminals and production rules. The string I need to check is \"t10 t10 t3 t6 t2 t0 t8 t5 t0\".\n\nSince I'm new to this, I need to break it down step by step. First, I should understand the grammar structure and see if I can parse the string backwards, which is a common strategy when dealing with CNF grammars because each production in CNF produces either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has productions like S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, and S -> NT1 NT2. So, S is the root, and from there, the string must be built up.\n\nThe string starts with \"t10 t10\". I need to see if these terminals can be derived from some non-terminals. Let's look at the productions for terminals:\n\n- NT0 -> 't10', 't4', 't5', 't9', 't10'\n- NT3 -> 't2', 't7'\n- NT1 -> 't8', 't13'\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5', 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't0', 't10', 't11', 't12', 't7', etc.\n- NT8 -> 't0', 't6', 't8'\n- NT11 -> 't3', 't5', etc.\n- NT13 -> 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nSo, starting with the first \"t10\": looking for a non-terminal that produces 't10'. From the rules, NT0, NT7, NT9, etc., produce 't10'. Also, NT10 (wait, no, NT10 is one of the terminals, right? Wait, looking at the grammar again: Oh wait, in the end, there's NT10 -> 't6' and NT10 -> 't10'? Or is it that NT10 is always a terminal? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals and others don't. For example, NT3 -> 't2' or 't7', so NT3 is a non-terminal that directly produces terminals. Similarly, NT10 has productions -> 't6' and -> 't10'.\n\nWait, but wait, in the given grammar, some NT... are shown with arrows leading to terminals. So, for NT10, it's defined as NT10 -> 't6' and NT10 -> 't10'. So, NT10 is a non-terminal that can produce 't6' or 't10'. Similarly, NT3 is a non-terminal that can directly produce 't2' or 't7'.\n\nBut in the string, I have \"t10 t10\". So each 't10' must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't10'. So, each 't10' could come from NT0, NT7, or NT10. Let me see.\n\nLooking for production rules where the right-hand side is two non-terminals leading to 't10'. For example, if a production is A -> B C where B and C are non-terminals, and B can produce a terminal and C can produce 't10' or vice versa.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the way to generate 't10 t10' would be that each 't10' is a terminal, meaning that each 't10' must be produced directly by a non-terminal that has a production rule to that terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have two 't10's. So, the derivation would involve something like S -> ... -> NT10 NT10, and then NT10 -> 't10' each time. Or maybe via other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't10's come from NT7, as NT7 can be 't10'. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to see the string structure. The string is t10 t10 t3 t6 t2 t0 t8 t5 t0.\n\nI'll approach this by parsing the string from the end, trying to see if the grammar can generate it by successively combining non-terminals into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parsing tree starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the first part: S starts with NT... Maybe S -> NT4 NT11 or S -> NT4 NT8 or S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at the first two characters, t10 t10. So, the first part is t10, which could come from NT10 or NT7, and the second part is also t10.\n\nAssuming that the grammar's S starts with S -> NT1 NT2. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me step back.\n\nAnother approach: For the string to be generated by S, the entire string must be a combination of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for the sequence of terminals and see if there's a way to break them down according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence that matches the productions.\n\nStarting from the left, let's see:\n\nt10 t10: These would need to be generated by two NT10 non-terminals, each producing 't10' via their production rules.\n\nNext, t3: Looking for a production that can produce 't3'. Looking at the rules, NT0 has NT0 -> 't0' and NT0 can also be broken down further. Wait, but 't3' is only directly produced by NT3 and NT11.\n\nWait, looking at NT3, it can produce 't2' or 't7'. But in the string, there is 't3', so we need a non-terminal that can produce 't3', but from the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't3'. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't8', 't13'\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5', 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't2', 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT7 -> 't0', 't10', 't11', etc.\n- NT13 -> 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nAh, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't3'. So that would be a problem. Because if 't3' is in the string, it must have come from a non-terminal that can produce it, but it doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me look again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking through all the production rules for non-terminals, it seems that NT3 is the only one that produces 't2' and 't7', and no non-terminal directly produces 't3'. That's a problem because the string contains 't3' as part of it. So, unless there's a production that I'm missing which could derive 't3', the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar. Are there any productions that can yield 't3'? Let me check each non-terminal:\n\nNT0: can produce 't10', 't4', etc., but not 't3'.\nNT1: produces 't8' and 't13'.\nNT2: produces 't2', 't5', 't7'.\nNT3: produces 't2', 't7'.\nNT4: produces 't0', 't5'.\nNT5: produces 't0'.\nNT7: produces 't0', 't10', 't11', and others.\nNT8: produces 't0', 't6'.\nNT10: produces 't6' and 't10'.\nNT11: produces 't3' in some cases.\nNT13: produces 't2', 't4'.\n\nWait, looking for 't3' as a terminal. Looking again, I see in the grammar, NT11 -> NT3 NT11 is one rule. So NT11 has some paths, but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't3'. Wait, actually, looking at NT11, it's broken down into NT3 and NT11, which are non-terminals, so NT11 could produce 't3' indirectly if NT3 produces a terminal.\n\nWait, but in NT11's rules, I see NT11 -> NT3 NT11 as a production, but I also see other rules for NT11, like NT11 -> NT8 NT5, which are both non-terminals. However, I don't see a rule where NT11 or any other non-terminal directly produces 't3'. So, that suggests that 't3' cannot be derived from any non-terminal, so the string cannot be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This sounds a bit intimidating because the grammar is quite large, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the problem. The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token must be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Each non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the production rules are in Chomsky normal form, meaning each production is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a non-terminal to a terminal. This will help because each step in the derivation will produce exactly two symbols, non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNow, the target string is `t7 t2 t3 t10 t0 t5 t3 t0 t0`. Let's list the tokens: t7, t2, t3, t10, t0, t5, t3, t0, t0. So that's nine tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each application of a production rule doubles the number of symbols. Since the grammar probably starts with S which likely produces two symbols, the derivation tree is binary, and the number of leaves (symbols) should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied.\n\nWait, but the string has 9 symbols. Hmm, 9 is an odd number, which in a binary tree would require that not all leaves have been expanded, which might not be the case. Wait, maybe I should check the actual grammar to see the starting symbol and the possible starting productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see S appears on the right-hand side of multiple productions. Let me check all S productions:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo S is one of the starting symbols because it's the top-level. So the grammar starts with one of these S productions.\n\nEach production of S is of the form NT x NT y, and since NT x and NT y are non-terminals, the first step will produce four tokens, each from NT x and NT y. Because each NT production is either to a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Since each production is from a non-terminal to two symbols. So each NT production is either a terminal or another non-terminal, so the first step from S will produce two NT symbols, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nBut wait, each production is to two symbols. So from S, each of the options is NT something, so S -> NT4 NT8, for example, would expand to two non-terminals NT4 and NT8. Each of those can themselves expand either to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo the string in the problem consists of nine 't' terms. Let's map those tokens to their corresponding NT rules. Looking through the grammar, each NT rule eventually points to some 't' term or a non-terminal. But wait, some NT rules have 't' as a terminal, like NT3 -> 't5', etc.\n\nWait, but for the string, all the tokens are 't's except for NT1, etc., but in the string, it's t7, t2, etc. So I need to see if each 't' in the string corresponds to an NT rule that produces that 't'.\n\nLet me first list the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at each rule, the NT rules that produce terminals are:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\n...\nWait, let's list all terminal productions:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't4'\nNT7 -> 't0'\nNT8 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT2 -> 't2'\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT2 -> 't5' (again)\nNT1 -> 't8'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't9'\nNT7 -> 't10'\nNT10 -> 't3'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nSo the terminals 't0' to 't11' are covered by these rules. Now, each 't' in the string must be matched by one of these terminal productions.\n\nBut wait, in the string, I have t7, t2, t3, t10, t0, t5, t3, t0, t0. So each of these 't's must correspond to a terminal produced by the NT rules.\n\nSo first, let's map each 't' in the string to the NT that produces it:\n\nt7: Looking at the rules, NT4 -> 't7', NT4 can produce t7.\n\nt2: NT2 -> 't2', so NT2 produces t2.\n\nt3: NT11 -> 't3'.\n\nt10: NT7 -> 't10', NT10 -> 't10'.\n\nt0: NT7 -> 't0', NT0 -> 't10', but wait, NT0 also can produce t4, t10, t0, etc. Hmm, but in the string, one t0 comes.\n\nt5: Looking at the rules, where is t5 produced? NT4 -> 't5' and NT5 -> 't0'. So t5 is produced by NT4.\n\nt3 again: same as the first t3, another NT11.\n\nt0: again.\n\nt0: again.\n\nSo the string is a series of t's that have to be produced by the NT rules.\n\nNow, the problem is to trace a derivation path from S, expanding each non-terminal using the productions until we end up with exactly these t's.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF and each step doubles the number of symbols, the number of steps needed would correspond to the depth of the derivation. The number of terminal symbols in the string is 9, which is 2^3 +1, which is not a power of two, which suggests something's wrong because the number of terminals after n steps should be 2^n.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe my understanding is flawed. Because in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). So starting from S, each expansion adds one more level. So the number of leaves (terminals) after k expansions is 2^k. So the initial S is one symbol, then after first expansion, two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, etc. But the string has 9 terminals, which is not a power of two. So this suggests that the string is not in the language because the number of terminals must be 2^n, where n is the number of production steps.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm miscounting. The production steps might include some non-terminals not being expanded yet, so maybe the number of terminals can vary depending on how far the derivation goes. Wait, no\u2014each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols. So starting with S, each step increases the number of symbols by the number of non-terminals being replaced by their productions. For example:\n\nStep 0: S \u2192 1 symbol.\n\nStep 1: S could expand to two symbols (e.g., NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2). So two symbols.\n\nStep 2: Each of those two symbols could expand into two, so four symbols.\n\nStep 3: Each of the four expands into two, so eight.\n\nStep 4: 16, etc.\n\nBut the given string has nine symbols. 2^3=8, 2^4=16. So nine is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated because it can't be produced from a binary tree with exactly nine leaves. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string has nine symbols, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the number of terminal symbols after each production step must be a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-173","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because all the rules start with a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t7 t10 t5 t0 t0 t9 t5 t7 t10 t7`. So it's a sequence of terminals, which suggests that the derivation should consist of expanding non-terminals into terminals, eventually matching this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some NT symbols directly correspond to terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't7', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT7 \u2192 't10', NT5 \u2192 't0', NT10 \u2192 't6', etc. So, perhaps the strategy is to trace back from the string to the start symbol S, seeing if each step can be matched by a production rule.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parse the string using the grammar, deriving from S down to the string. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from S, the grammar allows S to derive NT4 NT8 or other options, but looking at S's rules:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, S produces two non-terminals. Let's see which options can lead to the string. The string starts with t7. Looking at the productions, do any non-terminals produce 't7'?\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't10', 'nt10' \u2192 't6' and 't0' somewhere, but I'm not sure if any NT directly produces 't7'.\n\nWait, no, let's check:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't8' (NT1 \u2192 't8'), but in the string, the first symbol is 't7', so maybe I'm mistaken. Or perhaps I need to see how 't7' is derived.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't0', NT7 \u2192 't10', NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', NT2 \u2192 't5', etc. Let's see:\n\nIs there a production that directly leads to 't7'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NT rules: I see NT13 \u2192 't4' and 't6', NT11 \u2192 't7'? No, wait:\n\nWait, the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't7', that's right. So NT3 \u2192 't7'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't10', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT5 \u2192 't0' etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is 't7', so that must come from a production of NT3, because NT3 is the only non-terminal that directly produces 't7' (looking at the rules, NT13 \u2192 't4' and 't6', but wait, in the given rules, I see for NT3, it's written as NT3 \u2192 't7', yes.\n\nSo the string starts with 't7', which is produced by NT3. So in the derivation, somewhere along the way, we have a NT3 that becomes 't7'.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT3 being expanded to 't7'. But how does NT3 get generated?\n\nLooking at the grammar, what produces NT3? Let's check the productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't7', which is a terminal symbol, so no production for NT3 besides that. So how does NT3 get generated? It can't be derived from other symbols because nothing produces NT3 as a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because NT3 is a non-terminal, it has to be derived from other non-terminals. But in the given rules, I don't see any production for NT3 where it's on the left side. The only rule is NT3 \u2192 't7', which is a terminal. That suggests that NT3 cannot be derived further; it's a terminal. But in the string, 't7' is the first symbol, so it must be the start of the string.\n\nWait, that can't be because S starts with NT4 or NT1, but in the rules, S is producing non-terminals that are not necessarily terminal. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. For NT3, is there a production? The rule is NT3 \u2192 't7', so that's a terminal. But how can NT3 be derived from other symbols? Because S is on the left side of the productions, so S can only produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce symbols.\n\nBut if NT3 can't be derived from other symbols, then 't7' can only appear in the string if it's derived directly from S's productions, but looking at S's rules, S's productions all involve two non-terminals, not a terminal. So perhaps 't7' can't be the first symbol in any string derived from S, unless S somehow produces NT3 directly, but from the start symbol S, can it produce 't7'?\n\nWait, no. Because the start symbol S is a non-terminal, and its productions only derive non-terminals that combine to produce terminals. So perhaps 't7' can't be the first symbol unless there's a production like S \u2192 NT3 something.\n\nBut looking at the production rules for S, S can only go to combinations of non-terminals. So S's first step must be something like S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which then each NT can be expanded, possibly into terminals. But in that case, the first symbol would be whatever NT4 expands to.\n\nSo, let's see: the string starts with 't7', which is produced by NT3. If the derivation starts with S, which can only expand into NTs, then the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', and NT8 \u2192 't6' or 't3' etc. But none of those seem to produce 't7' as the first symbol. Alternatively, perhaps another S production could lead to NT3 being part of the derivation.\n\nWait, is there any S production that produces NT3? Looking at the rules, no S production includes NT3. So perhaps 't7' can't be the first symbol in any string generated by this grammar, making the string 't7...' invalid.\n\nBut wait, the first production for S is NT4 and NT8. So starting from S, the first expansion would involve NT4 and NT8, each of which has their own rules. Let's see if any of these can lead to the string.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. NT4 can be 't0' or 't5', and NT8 can be 't6' or 't3'. So the first two symbols would be, for example, 't0 t6', but the given string starts with 't7', so maybe 't7' isn't possible. Alternatively, if S somehow produces NT3, but S doesn't have such a production.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Let me recheck: the grammar is in CNF, which allows each production to have two non-terminals or a terminal. So, maybe a non-terminal can generate a terminal directly, and in the process, how does it get generated?\n\nWait, but NT3 is only defined as producing 't7'. There's no rule that allows a rule involving NT3, so unless another production's expansion includes NT3 as a step, but in this case, to get 't7' as the first symbol, the entire string would have to start with NT3, which is only possible if the production S somehow leads to NT3, but in the given rules, S's productions don't involve NT3.\n\nSo, if S can't produce 't7' as the first symbol, then the string starting with 't7' can't be generated by this grammar, hence the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe the string is longer, and 't7' isn't the first symbol. Wait, the string given is `t7 t10 t5 t0 t0 t9 t5 t7 t10 t7`, which is 10 symbols long.\n\nSo, to have the first symbol as 't7', which is NT3, we need the first step to involve NT3. But S can't produce NT3 directly because there's no production for S that includes NT3 on the left. So how could NT3 appear in the first position?\n\nWait, perhaps through a more complex derivation where another non-terminal produces NT3 as part of a larger tree. For example, maybe some production leads to NT3 as part of the expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking for where NT3 is used in production rules. The only rule for NT3 is NT3 \u2192 't7'. So no, nowhere else.

Alright, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier to parse strings, especially using methods like CYK parsing. But since I'm a bit rusty, maybe I can approach this by looking for a leftmost derivation or trying to see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSince the string starts with `t5`, I need to see if any of S's productions can lead to this. Let's check each option:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8: The first symbols are NT4 and NT8. Let's see what those can produce.\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11: Similarly, NT4 and NT11.\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2: NT1 and NT2.\n\nSince the string starts with `t5`, let's see if any of NT4 or NT8 can produce `t5`. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT4 has productions: \u2192 t0, t5, t7.\n- NT8 has: \u2192 t6, t0, t1.\n- NT1: \u2192 t8, t9, t10.\n- NT2: \u2192 t2, t5, t7.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce `t5`, so maybe the first part of the string is generated by NT4. The string starts with `t5`, which would correspond to NT4 \u2192 t5. That would leave the rest of the string to be generated by NT8 since after NT4 comes NT8 as per S's production.\n\nSo, let's assume the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now, NT4 produces `t5`, so the next symbol is `t7`. Does NT4 produce `t7`? Yes, looking at NT4's productions, there's NT4 \u2192 t7. So after `t5`, we have `t7`.\n\nWait, but after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT4 is the first non-terminal to produce `t5`, then NT8 should produce the remaining string. But let me see the string: after `t5`, the next is `t7`, which is the output of NT4, but then the rest continues. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I need to see if NT8 can produce the remaining symbols after NT4's production.\n\nWait, maybe I got it wrong. Let's clarify: When S \u2192 NT4 NT8, both NT4 and NT8 need to generate parts of the string. So if NT4 produces `t5`, then NT8 should produce the rest, which starts with `t7 t9 t4 t0 t10 t3 t6 t5 t3`.\n\nBut looking at NT8's productions, I don't see `t7` directly. NT8 can produce `t6`, `t0`, or `t1`. So maybe NT8 can't produce `t7` directly. That seems like a problem because NT4 is already producing `t5`, which is the first symbol, but then NT8 can't produce `t7` as its own production. So perhaps this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production should be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and after NT4 produces `t5`, then NT8 produces something else, but the next symbol is `t7`, which isn't directly available in NT8. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nLet me look elsewhere. Maybe the string could be derived differently. Let's look at the initial options again.\n\nAnother approach: Break down the string into parts that match each production. The string is `t5 t7 t9 t4 t0 t10 t3 t6 t5 t3`.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has three productions. Let's see if starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT2 could work. NT1 has productions to `t8`, `t9`, `t10`. The first symbol is `t5`, which is not among NT1's productions, so that's not possible.\n\nWhat about S \u2192 NT4 NT8? The first symbol is `t5`, which NT4 can produce. Then after NT4, we need NT8 to produce the rest of the symbols starting with `t7`.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of more steps. Let me try to construct a possible derivation.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8 (from the first production)\n2. NT4 \u2192 t5 (so first symbol is `t5`)\n3. Now, NT8 needs to generate `t7 t9 t4 t0 t10 t3 t6 t5 t3`\n\nBut looking at NT8's productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- ... lots of other productions.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different starting point.\n\nWait, another option: Let's consider that S can produce NT4 and NT8. NT4 can produce `t5` as before, but maybe NT8 can produce the rest. So:\n\nAfter NT4 \u2192 `t5`, NT8 needs to generate `t7 t9 t4 t0 t10 t3 t6 t5 t3`.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, maybe it can split into NT6 NT3. Then, NT6 can produce `t7` or something else.\n\nWait, NT6's production is NT9 NT11. So `t7` might come from NT9 or NT11.\n\nLooking at NT9: \u2192 NT7 NT9 | NT5 NT2 | NT4 NT (something). Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT (not listed, maybe it's broken down further?)\nWait, no, actually, looking through the provided rules, I see:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT (looking at the provided rules, there is no direct production for NT9 \u2192 NT4... but wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan again. Yes, I think there's a NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT? Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9, NT5 NT2, but not NT4 anything. So actually, in the given rules, NT9 only has those two productions.\n\nWait, so maybe NT9 can produce `t7` through NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9, which would mean it can produce `t7` followed by another NT9, potentially leading to more `t7`s. Alternatively, NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2 would produce `t5` and `t2`. But the next symbol after `t5` is `t7`, so NT9 would need to produce a `t7` in this context.\n\nHmm, let me think again.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 \u2192 `t5`, and NT8 \u2192 the rest of the string.\n\nBut NT8's rules are:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9 or NT5 NT2\n- Let's see: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Then, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11. So `t6` would be the result of NT9 and NT11.\n\nWait, but NT9 can produce NT7 NT9, which could be `t7` followed by NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-191","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way to structure CFGs where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This makes the grammar easier to handle for certain parsing techniques, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll need a different approach.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several production rules that generate combinations of non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually ends up producing a string of terminals. My task is to see if the string `t7 t0 t10 t2 t2 t10 t2 t8 t1 t5 t0` can be produced by this grammar.\n\nI'll start by listing all the non-terminals and see how they derive into terminals. Let's go through each rule step by step.\n\n1. The start symbol is S. Looking at the production rules for S, S can produce:\n   - NT4 NT8\n   - NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the first step is to see which of these can help generate the given string. The string starts with t7, so let's check the rules that produce t7.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' (twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't14', 't13', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't3', or others?\nWait, looking at the NT7 rules:\nNT7 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT11\nWait, in the NT7 rules, I see NT7 can produce 't0' as in NT7 \u2192 't0', but looking at the given NT7 rules, I think I might have missed some. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the NT7 rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n\nWait, that's all. So, does any of these produce 't7'? No, it seems NT7 can only produce combinations that lead to other NTs. So 't7' must come from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, are there any rules that produce 't7'?\n\nLooking through each NT rule, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. So NT3 produces 't7' as part of its derivation, but NT3 is a non-terminal. So to get 't7' in the string, we must have a path from some NT to 't7'.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, in the rules, looking for where a terminal is directly produced. So, for example, NT10 \u2192 't1', and NT3 \u2192 't2', and NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', and NT2 \u2192 't2' or 't5', etc.\n\nSo, to get 't7' in the string, some non-terminal must produce NT7, but looking back at the NT7 rules, they all involve combinations of other NTs, not directly 't7'. So 't7' can't be directly produced by NT7. Therefore, perhaps 't7' must come from another NT in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check all the NTs to see if any produce 't7'. Looking through each rule:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' twice\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't14', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT3 \u2192 't7', 't2', etc. Oh, wait! Look at NT3's rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 NT11 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 NT9 NT12\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT3\nWait, so in the rules for NT3, there's a production NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. But NT7 can then produce other NTs, and NT1 can also produce other NTs, but when does 't7' come in?\n\nWait, no, because NT7's rules don't produce 't7' directly. So perhaps 't7' comes from the derivation of NT3. Let's see.\n\nIf NT3 can eventually produce 't7', but looking at the rules, NT3's production NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1 would require both NT7 and NT1 to derive into terminal symbols. But NT7 doesn't produce a terminal; it produces combinations of NTs. So, unless 't7' is produced by another path, this might not be possible.\n\nWait, but in NT3's rules, there's NT3 \u2192 NT9 NT12. Let's look at NT9 and NT12.\n\nNT9 has rules:\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT9 \u2192 't4' (Wait, looking at the rules: NT9 appears in NT0's rules as NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT10. And other NTs like NT13, etc.)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the NTs and their rules step by step to see if any can derive 't7'.\n\nLet me note down each NT and their rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8 | NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce NT4 and NT8, or NT1 and NT2.\n\n2. NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n\n3. NT7 \u2192 NT8 NT5 | NT11 NT6 | NT12 NT9 | NT11 NT11\n\n4. NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n\n5. NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13 | NT6 NT3 | NT11 NT11 | NT8 NT8 | NT10 NT10 | NT13 NT3 | NT12 NT12 | NT14 NT4 | NT9 NT10 | NT4 NT NT... (Wait, wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each rule properly.)\n\nWait, better approach: List each NT with their production rules in the order given, without worrying about other productions for now.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to proceed step by step, looking at each non-terminal and seeing if any can produce a terminal symbol, or lead us toward the target string.\n\nBut maybe starting from the start symbol S, which can produce NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2.\n\nGiven that the target string starts with t7, let's see if any of these lead to t7.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5' (appears in several rules, like NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', and so on). So NT4 produces t0 or t5.\n\nLooking back, the production S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So if S leads to NT1 NT2, could that lead to a derivation that includes t7?\n\nLet me check NT1's rules.\n\nNT1 has rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 | NT12 NT8 | NT14 NT1 | NT9 NT1 | NT13 NT | NT1 ... wait, let me check carefully:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT1 -> NT14 NT1\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT1\n- NT1 -> NT13 NT\nWait, but looking more carefully, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, looking back, I think the actual rules for NT1 are:\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\n\nNT7 -> NT8 NT5 | NT11 NT6 | NT12 NT9 | NT11 NT11\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2 | NT10 NT2\n\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13 | NT6 NT3 | NT11 NT11 | NT8 NT8 | NT10 NT10 | NT13 NT3 | NT12 NT12 | NT14 NT4 | NT9 NT10 | NT4 NT ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complex. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t7, perhaps I can backtrack from the string to see if the last symbols can be formed by the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach is to try to parse the string backward or look for possible splits.\n\nBut maybe that's not the most straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a derivation path for the string.\n\nThe string is t7 t0 t10 t2 t2 t10 t2 t8 t1 t5 t0.\n\nLet me count the symbols: 11 symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-198","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one non-terminal on the right. The non-terminals consist of rules like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and the terminals are t0 to t14, and some other terminals like t1 to t6, etc.\n\nThe target string is: `t8 t10 t9 t6 t0 t9 t3 t0 t3 t6 t0`.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the start symbol S. The initial S has two production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the first step is that S will derive into a combination of two non-terminals. I need to see which of these can lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the options, I'll consider both paths.\n\nFirst, the production S -> NT4 NT8. So, I need to check if NT4 and NT8 can derive to parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> t0\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT4 -> t7\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has productions:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> t0 (from the end rules, I think. Wait, looking back, NT8 has a rule NT8 -> t0? Or does it have multiple? No, from the grammar, I don't see a direct terminal production for NT8 except for in other rules. Wait, in the end, there are NT8 -> t0? Let me check the grammar again. Yes, in the terminal productions, NT8 -> nt(t8 t0). So, actually, in the terminal symbols, NT8 can produce 't8' and 't0'. Wait, but in the end, the string has t8, t10, t9, etc. So, for the first part, considering NT4, it can produce a terminal like t0, t5, or t7, depending on the path.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps using a parsing approach, like recursive descent, or bottom-up parsing, to see if the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side when expanded, so the parse tree will be a binary tree, with the string's symbols corresponding to the leaves of the tree.\n\nThe string length is 11 symbols. Since the grammar starts with S as two symbols, the derivation will require 10 splits, resulting in a binary tree of depth log2(11), but since it's not a power of two, there will be leaves at different levels.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to try to split the string into two parts at each step, corresponding to the non-terminals in the production rules of S.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by choosing possible splits.\n\nThe string is: t8 t10 t9 t6 t0 t9 t3 t0 t3 t6 t0\n\nLet's look at the start: it's S -> NT4 NT8, so the first step is to split the string into a left part derived by NT4 and the right part by NT8. Alternatively, the other production is S -> NT1 NT2, but I don't think that's needed unless the string can't be split into the first option.\n\nLet me try S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the left side would be a substring thatNT4 can produce, and the right side a substring that NT8 can produce. Let's try to see possible splits.\n\nThe entire string is 11 symbols. So, if we split into two parts, the left could be from position 1 to k, and the right from k+1 to 11.\n\nWe need to find a k such that the left part can be generated by NT4 and the right part by NT8.\n\nAlternatively, since NT4 could produce terminals, maybe we can look for t0, t5, or t7 in the left part, and similarly for NT8.\n\nWait, but NT4 can also derive further into other non-terminals. It might be better to look for the leaves of the tree, so the terminal symbols.\n\nLet me try to see if any of the NT4's production rules can directly generate a terminal, which is one of the symbols in the string.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT4 -> t0\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT4 -> t7\n\nSo, NT4 can directly derive to t0, t5, or t7. Those are in the string: t8, t10, t9, t6, t0, t9, etc. So, t0 is present.\n\nSo, perhaps the left part ends with t0. Let's look for that.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nWe have t8 followed by t10, t9, t6, t0, etc. So the fifth symbol is t0, which is a terminal that NT4 could produce. So, maybe the left part is up to t0, which is position 5, meaning the left part is the first 5 symbols: t8 t10 t9 t6 t0.\n\nWait, but that's 5 symbols, and NT4 can produce 3 symbols? No, wait, NT4's direct productions are terminals: so the left part must end exactly at a symbol that NT4 can produce.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that NT4 itself can only produce a single terminal at a time, but in the grammar, since it's in CNF, each production is two symbols, so to produce a single terminal, other non-terminals must decompose into that terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me consider the entire string and see if it can be split into a combination of the NT4 and NT8.\n\nFirst, let's see what NT8 can produce. From the grammar, NT8's rules are:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> t0\n\nSo, NT8 can produce a single t0, or further into other non-terminals. In our string, after some steps, we have a t0 at position 5, and another t0 at the end.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts where the left part can be produced by NT4 and the right by NT8.\n\nThe string is: [t8 t10 t9 t6 t0 t9 t3 t0 t3 t6 t0] (11 symbols)\n\nLet me see possible splits where the left is produced by NT4 and the right by NT8.\n\nLet's try to find where NT4 can split the string. Since NT4 can directly produce t0, t5, or t7, I can look for these terminals in the string.\n\nLooking through the string, we have t0 at position 5, t6, etc. Let's see:\n\nAssuming the left part is the first k symbols, which must be something that NT4 can derive. Since NT4's terminals are t0, t5, or t7, I can check if any of these appear early in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, t0 appears at position 5. So, perhaps the left part ends with t0 after 5 symbols: t8 t10 t9 t6 t0.\n\nThen, the left part would be \"t8 t10 t9 t6 t0\", which would be 5 symbols, which is an issue because NT4 can only produce a single terminal or two non-terminals, but wait, each non-terminal expansion is two symbols. So maybe the left part has to be split into multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for a split where the left part is produced by NT4, which could involve multiple levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see what each non-terminal can produce beyond their immediate productions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to attempt to parse the string step by step, choosing non-terminals and terminals accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can attempt to build the parse tree from the top down, trying to match the string step by step.\n\nGiven that S->NT4 NT8, the parse starts with NT4 and NT8.\n\nLet's consider NT4 first. NT4 can produce t0, so let's see if that's a possibility.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t8. Wait, but if NT4 directly produces t0, how can the first symbol be t8?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If NT4 is supposed to produce t0, but the string starts with t8, that can't be.\n\nSo, perhaps that path is wrong. Maybe S->NT1 NT2 is the correct production.\n\nLet me check NT1 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT1 -> t8\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, let me check the productions.\n\nWait, let me go through each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nThe string is: t0, t5, t10, t9, t10, t5, t0, t10, t3, t6, t0, t7.\n\nLet's go through each in order:\n\n1. t0: Looking for non-terminals that produce 't0'. Checking the productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (from NT7 productions: NT7 \u2192 't0' is one of the productions. So NT7 can produce t0.\n\n2. t5: Non-terminals that can produce t5 include:\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't5' (wait, looking back, let me check. Oh, in NT0: NT0 \u2192 NT13 NT13, but looking for NT5\u2192t5? Let me check the productions carefully. Yes, look at NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't4', etc. Wait, the user provided a lot of productions. Let me make sure. Yes, in NT4, there are 't0' and 't5' as terminals, so yes, NT4 can produce t5.\n\n3. t10: Looking for 't10' productions. Checking each non-terminal:\n\nFrom NT1's productions: NT1 \u2192 't8' directly, but does any NT produce t10? Looking at the productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10'? Let me check. Yes, in NT0, there's NT0 \u2192 't10', so NT0 can produce t10. Wait, but in the string, the third symbol is t10, but where would that come from? Maybe from an NT that produces 't10', but looking, I think NT10 has a production NT10 \u2192 't1', but that's t1, not t10. Wait, perhaps I need to check all possibilities. Alternatively, perhaps some NT that can reach t10.\n\nWait, perhaps NT10 can produce t10 through a chain. Wait, looking for 't10' in the productions, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't1' (from NT10 productions: NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1, but that's non-terminal. Wait, looking through all NT10's productions: I see NT10 \u2192 't3' and NT10 \u2192 't6' via NT2 and other paths, but no direct 't10'. Wait, maybe I need to check other NTs. Wait, perhaps NT4 can produce 't5', but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that directly expands to 't10'. Checking each NT:\n\nLooking at NT10: its productions are NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1, NT10 \u2192 't3', NT10 \u2192 't6', NT10 \u2192 't1', NT10 \u2192 't2', etc. So direct 't10'? Wait, no, in NT10's productions, the terminals are 't3', 't6', 't1', 't2', 't7', etc. Wait, no 't10' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps through a chain? Let's look for non-terminals that can derive to t10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe NT3 can derive t3, etc. Let me check if any NT leads to t10. For example, NT10 expands to 't1', which is a terminal, but that's t1. Alternatively, perhaps through another NT.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me check each terminal in the string and see the possible NTs producing them.\n\nWait, perhaps 't10' comes from an NT that produces t10. Let me look for NTs where a production is A \u2192 't10'.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals are from 't0' up to 't13's. Let me see if any NT has a production resulting in 't10'.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't immediately see an NT that has a production leading to 't10' directly. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps through other NTs. For example, maybe NT10 can produce t1, but maybe other NTs can reach t10 via other productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should move on and see if I can at least get a part.\n\n4. t9: Looking for non-terminals that produce t9. Looking through:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't9'? Checking NT0's productions: looking at the user's list, yes, NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 't9' as one of the terminals. So, if I have t9, that could come from NT0.\n\n5. t10 again: So, after t9, another t10. So if t9 comes from NT0, then the next t10 would come from another NT0 or perhaps a different NT producing t10.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to try to see if each symbol can be matched step by step, perhaps using a top-down approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the CYK algorithm, but given the time, I'll try to approach it with a top-down parse.\n\nThe string is t0 t5 t10 t9 t10 t5 t0 t10 t3 t6 t0 t7.\n\nI'll try to break it down into possible non-terminals:\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT1 NT4 NT8 (wait, looking at the grammar, the initial productions for S are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc. So S can produce different combinations. But since the first symbol is t0, perhaps S expands to something that starts with t0.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\n\nLooking at NT4: its productions include 't0', 't5', 't4', etc. So if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first t0 could come from NT4.\n\nSo let's say the first part: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t0, which could come from NT4, and the second symbol is t5, which would need to come from NT4's non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: yes, one of them is 't5'. So perhaps this way:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0', and NT8 in S expansion.\n\nWait, but in the expansion S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the first NT4 would produce 't0', and the NT8 would produce the rest of the string starting with t5, t10, etc.\n\nSo let's structure the parse as:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, the first t0 from NT4, and the rest would come from NT8.\n\nSo after processing t0, we have the remaining string as t5 t10 t9 t10 t5 t0 t10 t3 t6 t0 t7.\n\nNow, focusing on NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, let's see which have terminals in the right sequence.\n\nNT8 has several productions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6' NT13, 't1' NT2, 't0' NT10, etc. Hmm, the first symbol after t0 is t5, which would have to come from NT8's production.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions for 't5':\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6' NT13?

{"custom_id":"request-210","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because CNF has a specific structure that makes it easier to parse or generate strings.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that each production either results in two non-terminals or a single terminal. Also, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and there are no empty productions.\n\nThe problem gives me a set of production rules, which are quite extensive. I notice that several symbols like NT1, NT2, etc., are defined, but in the end, the terminals are 't5', 't10', 't9', 't8', 't7', 't6', 't4', and 't3' among others. But for the string, we have t5, t10, t9, t0, t2, t7, etc.\n\nWait, looking back at the production rules, I should check if some non-terminals directly produce terminals or if they require going through multiple steps. Also, the string to evaluate is `t5 t10 t10 t9 t0 t0 t9 t3 t0 t2 t0 t7`. That's a sequence of 12 tokens. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation approach is typically used, or perhaps the CYK parsing algorithm could be considered, but since the string is small, maybe I can attempt to construct the derivation step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce different combinations of NTs. Looking at S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, or S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. Let's check the possible productions that result in 't5'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5' (twice), and NT2 \u2192 't2' or 't5'. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT4 has two rules: NT4 \u2192 't0' and NT4 \u2192 't5'. So from NT4, we can produce 't0' or 't5'. Similarly, NT2 can produce 't2' or 't5'.\n\nIf the first symbol is 't5', then the production could be either NT4 \u2192 't5' or NT2 \u2192 't5'. So, for S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S starts with NT4, which can produce 't5'. So let's explore that path.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now, we need to produce the rest of the string after 't5', which is 't10 t10 t9 t0 t0 t9 t3 t0 t2 t0 t7'. \n\nWait, but after S, we have two non-terminals: NT4 and NT8. Each of these needs to produce their respective parts.\n\nSo, NT4 can be 't5', or 't0'. Since 't5' is the first symbol, we choose NT4 \u2192 't5'.\n\nNow, we have 't5' produced, and the remaining string is 't10 t10 t9 t0 t0 t9 t3 t0 t2 t0 t7'.\n\nNext, we need to produce the rest after NT4: so the second part is NT8. Let's check what NT8 can produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT8: NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't1', etc. Wait, looking here:\n\nNT8 has several rules: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which are non-terminals, and rules like NT8 \u2192 't0' (multiple times), NT8 \u2192 't6', etc.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6' (I think that was one of the rules; let me check the list more carefully.)\n\nLooking at the given rules, yes, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't6' (from NT8 rules, yes, like NT8 -> NC?

Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nSo, the terminals are 't5', 't10', 't9', 't0', 't2', etc.\n\nSo, the given string is 't5 t10 t10 t9 t0 t0 t9 t3 t0 t2 t0 t7'.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't5'. Let's see possible derivations:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 \u2192 't5' (as one of the rules), so that would give the first symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-235","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar and a string to check whether the string is generated by this grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to have a lot of production rules involving various non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals. The terminals used in the string are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, and t7. Wait, actually, in the string, I see t0, t5, t9, t10, etc. Let me check the grammar again to make sure I'm not missing any non-terminals that resolve to these.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't7', NT9 \u2192 't10', etc. So, to generate the string, each terminal in the string must be produced by one of these rules.\n\nThe string given is: `t5 t0 t9 t10 t9 t3 t8 t6 t0 t6 t0 t5 t5`. Let's split it into individual terms: t5, t0, t9, t10, t9, t3, t8, t6, t0, t6, t0, t5, t5.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I'll try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules, making sure each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The grammar has three options for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nI'll take the string and try to match it starting with the first symbols. Let's see what each option starts with:\n\n1. NT4 \u2192 t4 (from NT4 \u2192 t4) or maybe more, but let's check NT4's productions.\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n- NT4 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\nWait, in the given grammar, NT4 is a non-terminal that directly produces terminals like t4, t5, t7.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT4 \u2192 t4, t5, t7, and more complex productions like NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, etc. Wait, but the start symbol S uses NT4, so perhaps the initial step is to resolve S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or another.\n\nWait, let's see. The string starts with t5. So, looking at NT4, does it have a production that starts with t5? Looking at the productions for NT4:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\nSo, yes, NT4 can produce t5. So the first symbol t5 could come from NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nNow, after t5, the next symbol is t0. So, after producing t5 from NT4, the next non-terminal to produce is t0. But looking at NT4's productions, after t4, t5, t7, it has more complex rules like NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. So perhaps t0 is produced by another non-terminal downstream.\n\nWait, but the string after t5 is t0, t9, etc. Let me see if there's a non-terminal that can produce t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT0 has several productions, one of which is NT0 \u2192 t10. Also, NT0 can be derived from other non-terminals, but perhaps the main point is that t0 is produced by NT0 in some way.\n\nBut wait, the string after t5 is t0. So, to get t5 first, then t0, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT1 NT2 can be used, since S has S \u2192 NT1 NT2 as an option.\n\nWait, let's try that. Let's assume S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Now, NT1 and NT2 are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\n- NT1 \u2192 NT13 NT14\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT1\n- NT1 has several rules.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT9 \u2192 t0\nWait, so NT9 can directly produce t10 or t0.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the first symbol would be from NT1. So, from NT1, what can produce t5? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules, all of them involve other non-terminals. So, for example, NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, which would produce two terminals. Let's see what NT9 and NT13 can produce.\n\nNT9 can produce t10 and t0. So, if NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, then the first symbol would be from NT9. If NT9 produces t0, and NT13 can produce other things.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first symbol is t5, which is produced by NT4 \u2192 t5. So perhaps using S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is a better starting point.\n\nYes, let's try that. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8. The first symbol is t5, produced by NT4 \u2192 t5. The next symbol is t0.\n\nSo after producing t5 from NT4, the next symbol is t0, which must come from NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 t6\n- NT8 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 can also produce other combinations.\n\nWait, so if NT8 \u2192 t6, then the next symbol after t5 would be t6, but ours is t0. So that's not matching. Alternatively, if NT8 can produce other non-terminals, perhaps there's a path where NT8 can produce t0 through some other rules.\n\nWait, looking deeper, NT8 can be a non-terminal that produces other non-terminals. For example, looking at NT8's productions, there's NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Then, NT6 and NT3 are non-terminals. Let's see what they can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT6 can also produce NT9 NT11, which are non-terminals that can produce t0, etc.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\n2. NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\n3. Now, NT8 needs to produce t0. Let's see how.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 (but that would give t6, not t0)\n- NT8 \u2192 t3 (which is 't3')\n- Other rules for NT8: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which would produce two symbols.\n\nWait, but in our string, after t5 is t0. So perhaps NT8 produces t0 somehow. But looking at NT8's productions, does any of them produce t0 directly?\n\nLooking through all the NT8 productions, I see:\n- NT8 \u2192 t6\n- NT8 \u2192 t3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- Also, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but that's the start.\n\nIs there any rule where NT8 produces t0? Hmm, I don't see a direct production of t0 from NT8. It seems that t0 is more associated with NT0 and some other non-terminals, like NT9.\n\nWait, but maybe through other paths. Let me check all NT8 rules to see if any lead to t0.\n\nWait, I can see that NT9 can produce t0 (NT9 \u2192 t0). Maybe there's a way for NT8 to produce NT9, which then produces t0.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules again. One of them is NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Then, looking at NT6's production:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\n\nSo, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and NT9 can produce t0.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT8,\n\n- nt4 produces t5.\n\n- Then, nt8 \u2192 NT6 NT3.\n\n- Now, nt6 produces NT9 NT11.\n\nBut wait, this seems to be expanding without producing terminals. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, let's try that. Maybe starting with S \u2192 NT1 NT2, which could produce t5 and something else.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is t5. So if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then NT1 has to produce t5. But looking at NT1's rules, do any of them reach t5?\n\nWait, NT1 has these rules:\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\n- NT1 \u2192 NT13 NT14"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-237","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t5 t2 t5 t0 t7 t0 t3 t0 t5 t9 t0 t3 t3\". The grammar provided looks pretty complex with a lot of rules and non-terminals. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. So all the production rules here are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if I can derive it from the start symbol S. The string consists of a sequence of terminals, so I need to find a sequence of productions that will consume all these terminals in order.\n\nLet me list out the string again: t5, t2, t5, t0, t7, t0, t3, t0, t5, t9, t0, t3, t3. That's 13 tokens. Since each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, each step in the derivation should consume either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to work backwards from the start symbol S and try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's rules. Alternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree from the string upwards, but that might be complicated given the number of rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I see that S can produce either NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. So the first thing to check is whether the first few tokens of the string can be matched by either of these options.\n\nThe string starts with t5. Let's see what NT4 produces. Looking at the production rules, NT4 -> t0, t5, or t7. Wait, actually, from the rules, NT4 -> NT14 NT7. NT14 can produce t3 or NT7 (which can produce t0, t7, etc.). Hmm, that's recursive and might take a while to resolve. Alternatively, NT4 also directly produces \"t0\", \"t5\", or \"t7\". Wait, looking back at the given rules, I see NT4 -> NT14 NT7, which means to reach a terminal, NT14 and NT7 must both resolve to terminals.\n\nLooking at NT14, the rules are NT14 -> NT3 NT4 and NT3 -> t2. So NT14 could eventually produce t2 followed by something else, but let me see: NT14 can be broken down into NT3 and NT4. NT3 -> t2, NT4 can go on to produce more. Wait, but from NT4, it goes to NT14 and NT7. So NT14 -> NT3 NT4, which means each NT14 can lead to a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, since NT14 can produce t3 or NT7, maybe I should look elsewhere for t5. Wait, from NT4, is there a rule that produces t5? Looking at the rules: HT44, I see NT4 -> t0, t5, or t7. Wait, actually, looking at the given rules, is there a way for NT4 to produce t5 directly? Let me check:\n\nNT4: the rules are NT4 -> NT14 NT7, then NT14 can produce NT3 NT4, and NT3 is t2, which doesn't help. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, NT14 -> t3 directly. So perhaps NT4 -> NT14 NT7 can be resolved to t3 and\/or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the first token t5, if the first production starts with S -> NT4 NT8, then let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce t0, t5, or t7, but through NT14 and NT7. Let's say NT4 could produce t5, then NT8... what does NT8 produce?\n\nLooking at NT8, the rules say NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT3 -> t2, but that's if we take the direct rule. Wait, no: NT8 can directly produce t0, t1, t2, etc. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT8 can go to NT6 NT3, and NT6 goes to NT9 NT11, and so on. Alternatively, NT8 can directly produce t0, t1, t2, etc., as per the rules listed.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT8 -> t0, t1, t2, t3, t5, t6, t7, t9, t10. So NT8 directly can produce any of those terminals. So if the second token is t2, then maybe S->NT1 NT2. Let's check that possibility.\n\nAlternatively, if the first rule is S->NT4 NT8, which starts with NT4 and NT8, but given that the first token is t5, let's see if NT4 can produce t5. From the rules, NT4 can go to t5 directly if there's such a production. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT4's rules: NT4 -> t0, t5, t7. So yes, NT4 can produce t5 directly. Wait, no: looking at the given rules, is there a production where NT4 -> t5? Wait, no, NT4's productions are:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nThen, looking through, NT4 doesn't directly produce t5; instead, NT14 can produce t3, and NT7 can produce t0, t5, or t7. Wait, no, looking again, the given rules for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nFrom the list, NT4 is defined as:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nThen, NT7 can be NT9 NT7 or NT11 NT6, or others? Alternatively, looking further, NT7 can also be NT1 NT13, which would eventually produce more.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach this differently. The string starts with t5. Let's see if any of the non-terminals directly produce t5.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, are there any rules where a non-terminal directly goes to t5? Yes, I believe so. For example:\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6. Hmm, not t5. NT5 -> NT9 NT2. Not t5. Wait, let's look for t5 as a direct production from any NT.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT4 can go to t0, t5, or t7 via rules. Wait, no, NT4's direct rules are to NT14 NT7, so it can't go directly to t5. Hmm, perhaps through another path.\n\nAlternatively, NT3 -> t2, NT5->t0, NT2->t2, etc. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the arrows; are these all right-hand sides?\n\nWait, let's see: NT4 can be NT14 NT7, but looking for a way to get t5. Alternatively, maybe NT9 can produce t5.\n\nLooking through, NT9: looking for NT9's rules. Hmm, not seeing NT9 directly go to t5, but perhaps through other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all non-terminals that directly produce t5 as terminals.\n\nLooking through the given rules, the ones that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13 (no)\n- NT2 -> t2 (yes)\n- NT3 -> t2 (yes)\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7 (but not t5)\n- NT5 -> t0 (no)\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT11 (no)\n- NT7 -> ... (no)\n- NT8 -> various, including t0, t1, t2, t3, t5, etc.\n\nWait, I see: NT8 -> t5 is directly one possibility. Yes, in the given rules, under NT8: NT8 -> t5 is a direct production.\n\nSo, S -> NT8 NT... Wait, S can produce NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, to get the first token as t5, perhaps S->NT4 NT8, but is there a way for NT4 to produce t5 and NT8 to produce something else? Or maybe S->NT1 NT2, where NT1 could produce t5 and NT2 could produce the next token.\n\nWait, let me check NT1's productions. NT1 can go to NT9 NT13, so perhaps not directly t5. Alternatively, perhaps NT1 can go via other rules. Wait, let me check all rules for NT1:\n\nNT1 can go to NT9 NT13 or NT12 NT8. Hmm, not directly t5.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT1 -> something that leads to t5.

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t0 t4 t4 t1 t9 t6 t0 t0 t8 t9 t7 t5 t0 t0`, which looks a bit complex with all these tokens. Let me break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by these production rules where each non-terminal can produce a sequence of terminals or non-terminals. Chomsky normal form usually means that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Some of the rules here might have more than two symbols on the right side, but looking at them again, I think they're all in CNG form. For example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is two non-terminals, which is okay. The right-hand sides don't have more than two symbols except maybe some rules like NT7 -> NT11 NT6, but I think those are still two non-terminals. So I think the grammar is correctly in Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe string given has all terminals, so I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNG, the parsing can be done with a pushdown automaton, but maybe I'll try a different approach. I think I can build a parse tree by seeing if each part of the string can be derived from the rules.\n\nLet me list all the productions and see if they can be used to construct the given string. But with so many productions, it's a bit overwhelming. Maybe I'll start by looking at the start symbol S and see which productions can generate sequences that match the string.\n\nLooking at the first few steps, the string starts with `t0 t4 t4`. So the first part is `t0`, then `t4`, then another `t4`. I need to check if these can come from some non-terminal. Let's look at the possible ways to get t0 and t4.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT4 can produce t0 or t5, because NT4 has rules like \u2192 t0 and \u2192 t5. So if the first part is t0, maybe the first step is S \u2192 something involving NT4. The production S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is one of the options. So perhaps the first part comes from NT4 and NT8.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0, so when I derive t0, that's one possibility. But wait, in this production, we have NT4 and NT8 after S. So S would become t0 and something else. But let me see what NT8 does.\n\nLooking at NT8, it can produce t0 or t6. For example, NT8 \u2192 t0 and NT8 \u2192 t6. Since the string starts with t0, maybe the first t0 comes from NT8. But wait, the production S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would produce t0 and t6 if NT8 uses its first production, or t0 and t0 if NT4 uses t0 and NT8 uses t0.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t0 comes t4, so perhaps after t0, there's a t4. So maybe NT8 can produce t4 somehow. Or maybe I'm confusing NT8 with NT4. Let me check NT8's productions.\n\nLooking at NT8, the productions are:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 t0\n- Also, I see NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which breaks down into more steps. So NT8 can lead to sequences. If NT8 leads to t6 and then t3, which might be t6, t7, t5, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that S can split into other parts. Let me try to think recursively. The string is t0 t4 t4 t1 t9 t6 t0 t0 t8 t9 t7 t5 t0 t0. So let's break it into parts:\n\n- The first token is t0, which could come from NT4 or NT9, etc. Looking at the productions, NT4 can produce t0. Similarly, NT2 can produce t2, but that's not needed here. So maybe it starts with NT4.\n\nIf I start with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first part is t0 (from NT4). Then, what comes after? The next token is t4, so maybe the NT8 part is producing t4. Wait, NT8 can be t0 or t6, so how do we get t4 from NT8?\n\nMaybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT8's rules again. Oh, I see that NT8 can produce NT6 NT3, which could be more complex. But perhaps I'm missing other ways. Wait, looking deeper, there's another rule: NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4. But that might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Let me check. NT1 has a production \u2192 t8, according to the rules, because I see NT1 \u2192 t8. So if I have NT1 \u2192 t8, that's a terminal and could be part of the string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t0, so S \u2192 NT1 NS would start with t8, which doesn't match. So the first production can't be S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Therefore, the first production must be S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which gives us t0 (from NT4) and then NT8. Now, what does NT8 produce? Let's see. NT8 has rules like NT8 \u2192 t0 and NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, etc. Since the next token is t4, which isn't a terminal in NT8's rules, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misremembered. Let me check NT8's productions again. Looking at the grammar, NT8 can produce NT6 NT3 or t0. So t4 isn't directly produced by NT8. That suggests that maybe the initial assumptions are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part isn't S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let me check the other possible initial productions for S. The other S productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2, S \u2192 NT11 NT6, etc. Let's check if any of these can produce t0 as the first token.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT4 NT11: NT4 can produce t0, so that could start with t0. Then NT11 can produce... Let's see the rules for NT11. NT11 has rules like \u2192 NT8 NT5, \u2192 NT3 NT11, etc. So from NT11, in one production, we can get NT8 and NT5. Let's explore this path.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT11:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- Then NT11 needs to produce the next part. From NT11, we can go to NT8 NT5.\n\nSo S becomes t0 \u2192 NT4 and \u2192 NT11. Now, NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5. So after NT4 comes NT11, which becomes NT8 NT5.\n\nNow, let's think about what NT8 and NT5 produce.\n\nNT8 can be t0 or NT6 NT3. The next token after t0 is t4, so NT8 cannot be t0 here because the next is t4. So NT8 must produce NT6 NT3.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 is a non-terminal. Let's check NT5's productions. NT5 has rules like \u2192 t0, \u2192 NT9 NT2, etc. So it can produce t0 or more steps.\n\nLet me try to map this path:\n\n- Start with S \u2192 NT4 NT11 \u2192 t0 NT11.\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5.\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3.\n- NT5 \u2192 t0 or other options.\n\nSo after t0, we have NT8 NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT3 NT5.\n\nNow, the string is t0 t4. But what is the next token? Let me think: NT6 is a non-terminal. Let me check what NT6 can produce. NT6 has rules like \u2192 t9 NT11, \u2192 t3 NT11, etc. So NT6 can produce t9 followed by NT11 or t3 followed by NT11.\n\nSince the next token in the string is t4, which isn't produced by NT6 directly. Hmm, this seems off. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that S could produce differently. Let's try S \u2192 NT1 NT2. NT1 can produce t8, but the string starts with t0, so that can't be right. So perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT4, because that would start with t0 t0 or t0 t5, etc.\n\nWait, no, the initial S productions are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc. So maybe I should double-check the first step.\n\nPerhaps starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is correct. Then, from NT4 \u2192 t0, the string starts with t0.

{"custom_id":"request-253","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is pretty complicated with a lot of non-terminals, which are represented by all the uppercase letters like NT1, NT2, etc. The string I need to evaluate is `t7 t3 t9 t5 t3 t0 t2 t7 t9 t10 t3 t5 t9 t2`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So all the rules given here fit that form. The string is produced by terminals, so I need to trace back the productions that would generate this string step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the given grammar and see which non-terminals can directly produce the terminals in the string. For example, looking at the rules, I can see that NT3 \u2192 't2'. So 't2' is straightforward. But in the string, the last part is 't2', so that must come from NT3. Let me check the grammar to confirm: Yes, NT3 \u2192 't2' is indeed a rule.\n\nNow, moving backwards. The string ends with t2, which is derived from NT3. The next part after that is the ninth element, which is 't9 t10' before that another 't9', etc. Let's go step by step, perhaps building a parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by seeing how the string can be divided into substrings that correspond to the left-hand sides of the grammar rules. Let me try to group the string into parts that fit the rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t7 t3 t9 t5 t3 t0 t2 t7 t9 t10 t3 t5 t9 t2.\n\nI notice that the first two tokens are 't7 t3'. So maybe the start symbol S can produce something starting with t7 t3. Looking at the rules for S: S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or S \u2192 NT1 NT2. But in the grammar given, the rules for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the rules are all in CNF, so each production has two non-terminals on the left. But in the string, I'm seeing a pair of terminals at the beginning: t7 t3. I need to see if any of the productions for NT4 or NT1 produce these.\n\nLooking at NT4: Its productions include NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7', 't9'? Wait, checking the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT4 \u2192 't7'\nNT4 \u2192 't9'\n\nSo NT4 can directly produce 't0', 't5', 't7', 't9'. So the first part of the string is 't7 t3'. Hmm, so perhaps NT4 \u2192 't7' and then NT14 NT7 would produce something else. Wait, maybe I should consider that the first two symbols 't7 t3' could come from a production where the first symbol is t7, which could be from NT4.\n\nWait, but NT4 can produce 't7' directly, so if the first part is 't7 t3', maybe the leftmost symbol is 't7', followed by 't3'. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT1, 't3' could come from NT13 because NT13 \u2192 't3'. Wait, no. From the grammar, NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't9', 't10', etc. Wait, actually, looking again, I think I see that NT13 has several rules, some leading to terminals. For instance, NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, more specifically, in the given grammar, NT13 has these rules:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12\nNT13 \u2192 't2'\nNT13 \u2192 't4'\nNT13 \u2192 't6'\n\nNo, wait, the given grammar has:\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nWait, no, checking the user-provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nWait, but in the initial grammar, NT13 has several rules:\n\nYes:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\nNT13 -> 't2'\nNT13 -> 't4'\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial grammar provided by the user shows:\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\n\nWait, no, checking the initial problem, the grammar rules for NT13 are:\n\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n\nWait, no, looking back: the user wrote:\n\nHere are the grammar rules:\n\n...\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\n...\n\nSo NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', or 't6' directly. So, the third token in the string is 't9', which comes after 't7 t3'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string and see if I can build a parse tree from the top down or bottom up.\n\nThe string is: t7 t3 t9 t5 t3 t0 t2 t7 t9 t10 t3 t5 t9 t2\n\nLength is 14 symbols.\n\nLooking at this, the first symbol is 't7', which could come from NT1, NT4, or NT7, etc. For instance:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSo 't7' is directly produced by NT4.\n\nSo the first symbol could be 't7', which is NT4 producing 't7'. So S starts with NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11 or NT1 NT2.\n\nIf the first part is 't7', then NT4 \u2192 't7', so the next non-terminal would be NT8 or NT11 or NT2. But the next token is 't3', so let's see if NT8 or NT11 can produce 't3'.\n\nLooking at NT8:\n\nNT8 has several rules, including NT6 NT3, and itself can also produce 't6', 't3', 't0', etc.\n\nWait, let me see specific rules for NT8:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8's rules are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check all rules for NT8:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT8 is defined as:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n\n- NT8 \u2192 nt4 nt5.\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's grammar, the lines under S are multiple, but for clarity, I need to list the entire grammar.\n\nWait, the user's grammar is written in a list format, where each line is a production rule. So the rules are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\n\nS -> NT4 NT11\n\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13\n\nNT10 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\n\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\n\nNT11 -> NT3 NT11\n\nNT13 -> NT3 NT12\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT0 -> NT11 NT11\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT11\n\nNT11 -> NT7 NT11\n\nNT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\n\nNT7 -> NT1 NT13\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\n\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\n\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT5\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT2 -> NT2 NT4\n\n...\n\nWait, it's a bit messy, but I can proceed.\n\nLooking at NT13: from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-274","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t0 t10 t3 t9 t0 t3 t6 t2 t5 t5 t0 t3 t2 t7 t8`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the rules on the left side of the arrow have two non-terminals or one terminal on the right.\n\nI see that the start symbol is S. The initial productions from S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, any derivation starting from S must use one of these. I'll have to explore the possible derivation steps to see if the string can be formed.\n\nLet me first list all the terminals:\n\n- t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14\n\nAnd the non-terminals are: NT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT10, NT11, NT12, NT13, NT14\n\nNow, looking at the string, we start with t0. Let me see how t0 is generated. From the non-terminals, let's see:\n\nFrom the rules, NT4 \u2192 't0', NT2 \u2192 't2', NT0 \u2192 't9' or others, and NT7 \u2192 't0'. Wait, but looking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13 | NT5 NT1 | NT11 NT11 | NT2 NT1 | NT8 NT8 | NT0 NT10 | NT0 NT6 | NT0 NT3 | etc. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, there are multiple productions for NT0. Let me check:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13 | NT5 NT1 | NT11 NT11 | NT2 NT1 | NT8 NT8 | NT0 NT10 | NT0 NT6 | NT0 NT3 | NT10 \u2192 ...

Looking through the productions of non-terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (so if NT4 can be derived, it can produce t0)\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0' (direct production)\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't9' (but t9 is a terminal, so if NT0 can produce t9, that's another way)\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t0. So, in the derivation, the first step must produce t0 through NT4 or NT7.\n\nLet me explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Then, NT4 needs to produce a string that starts with t0, and NT8 needs to produce the remaining part.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 | NT4 NT7 | NT9 NT2 | NT2 NT | ... Wait, the rules for NT4:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT4's rules are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 | NT4 NT7 | NT9 NT2 | NT2 NT4 | NT14 NT14 | ... Wait, perhaps I should list all NT4 rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 | NT4 NT7 | NT9 NT2 | NT2 NT4 | NT14 NT14 | NT9 NT2 | NT2 NT5 | NT10 NT2 | NT4 NT5 | NT13 NT2 | NT5 NT1 | NT7 NT1?\n\nWait, it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm might be helpful, but since the string is given, maybe a top-down approach with backtracking would work.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the non-terminals' productions.\n\nThe string is: t0 t10 t3 t9 t0 t3 t6 t2 t5 t5 t0 t3 t2 t7 t8\n\nLet me list the indices and see if I can parse them step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start at the beginning and see possible ways.\n\nFirst token: t0. So, the first non-terminal must be NT4 or NT7.\n\nLet's assume we start with NT4 first.\n\nThen, the string after t0 is t10 t3 t9 t0 t3 t6 t2 t5 t5 t0 t3 t2 t7 t8\n\nNow, the next part after t0 should come from NT8, since the first production for S is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, NT4 produces t0, and NT8 produces the remaining string: t10 t3 t9 t0 t3 t6 t2 t5 t5 t0 t3 t2 t7 t8.\n\nNow, let's look at NT8's productions. The rules for NT8 are:\n\nLooking back, NT8 has rules like:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3 | NT3 NT1 | NT1 NT5 | NT5 NT5 | NT7 NT8 | others. Hmm, perhaps it's too many to list.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

For NT4, there are multiple rules:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nWait, actually, looking back, some of the rules might be duplicates or similar. Maybe I should list all NT4's rules properly.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The user input might have some formatting issues, but from the given rules, NT4 has:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- etc. Hmm, I might need a better way to list all rules, but perhaps it's easier to note that each rule for NT4 is broken down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut maybe instead of going through each non-terminal, I should try to work backwards from the string, trying to find how it could be derived from the start symbol S. That often helps in such cases.\n\nThe string is: `t9 t0 t3 t4 t1 t4 t4 t5 t0 t9 t0 t0 t4 t0 t2`.\n\nI need to map each 't' symbol to a terminal, which probably corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. From the rules, I can see some terminals: 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't9' are all terminals, as some rules have these.\n\nSo, each segment of the string is a terminal symbol. Let's note each step.\n\nThe string has length 15, so I'll have to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce three different initial combinations: NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, NT1 NT2.\n\nLet's try each possibility.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce.\n\nFrom NT8's rules:\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 can be broken down into terms like NT6 NT3, NT1 NE5, etc. Let's see. For example:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- And so on.\n\nLet's consider each production.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try to see if the string can be generated by this grammar through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm might be the way to go, but with such a huge grammar, that's going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe looking for direct derivations.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a path from S to the string. Let's start with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, we have to generate the string starting with NT4 NT8. So, first, NT4 and NT8 will have to derive sequences that when combined produce the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t is t9, so perhaps NT4 produces t9 when expanded, or maybe NT8 does. Or perhaps there's a way for both to contribute to the beginning.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t9. So perhaps the first part of NT4 or NT8 must produce t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check each non-terminal's possible terminal symbols. For NT4, one of the rules is NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT1, and I'm not sure that leads directly to t9. Perhaps looking deeper.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each t is a terminal, so perhaps the productions for NT9 produce t9, NT10 produce t10, etc. So, for example, looking at the NT rules, some end with \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFrom the given rules, let's see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t2\n- NT10 \u2192 t6\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT10 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT8 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t9, t10\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT6 \u2192 t9, t11, etc. Wait, no, looking at rules:\n\nLet me create a list of all rules to see which NTs produce terminals.\n\nFrom the rules, the terminals used are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't9', and perhaps others.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t6\n- NT10 \u2192 t3\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t9\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5 (from multiple rules)\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT12 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nSo the terminals in the grammar are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't9'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let's list all the rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't6'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- So, the other NTs I see may have their own rules that have terminals, like:\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, NT0 \u2192 't4', 't5', 't6', etc. Let's check.\n\nIn the main rules, for example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't6'\n- And others.\n\nWait, I think I'm seeing that several NT symbols directly produce terminals, but in the grammar given, each production for an NT is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, some NTs produce other NTs, and others produce terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT5 has a rule \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo, to generate a string starting with 't9', I need to see if any NT symbol can produce 't9' perhaps directly, or through a chain.\n\nLooking through the rules, 't9' appears as a terminal in two places:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t9\n- And perhaps others, but from the given rules, only NT9 has 't9' and 't10' as its terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, looking back:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', etc. Hmm.\n\nSo, the only NT that directly produces 't9' is NT9. So, to derive 't9' in the string, the first symbol, we must have a production that starts with NT9 expanding into 't9' possibly.\n\nSo, looking back at the possible initial productions from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, NT1 NT2.\n\nNone of those initial NTs directly produce 't9'; S is the start, and it's producing combinations of NT4 and NT8, for example.\n\nWait, but maybe through other productions, one of NT4 or NT8 can produce 't9'.

{"custom_id":"request-295","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the string `t5 t5 t5 t10 t5 t8 t3 t7 t5 t1 t7 t2 t9 t1 t3 t4` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, that's a long string, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the productions here look like that except maybe some might have more, but I think in CNF they only have two on the right. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most productions have two non-terminals on the right, like S -> NT4 NT8, which is perfect for CNF. Some do have terminals, like NT3 -> 't5'. So that's all good.\n\nNow, I think the strategy is to use the CYK algorithm. I remember CYK is used to parse strings for context-free grammars. But I'm not too familiar with the exact steps. Let me recall. CYK involves creating a table where for each position, you look at possible non-terminals that can derive the substring.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a simpler way since I'm just trying to determine if the string is in the language, not actually parse it. Alternatively, I could see if the string can be divided into segments that match the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a sequence of terminals, all lowercase letters. Each production terminates with a terminal, except for some non-terminals. So the string must be built up by concatenating these terminals in a way that follows the grammar.\n\nLooking at each production, the start symbol S branches into a combination of NTs that produce multiple t's. Maybe the string can be split into parts that correspond to the different productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, every step of the derivation will split the string into smaller parts, each of which is generated by the grammar. So, the string should be possible to divide into two parts at every step until we get down to leaves that are directly in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break the string into possible chunks.\n\nThe string is: t5 t5 t5 t10 t5 t8 t3 t7 t5 t1 t7 t2 t9 t1 t3 t4.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens: 16. So, any parse tree must have depth corresponding to the number of productions needed. Starting with S, which according to the grammar is producing two NTs, each of which may produce more NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by seeing which parts of the string can be matched directly by the grammar terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are assigned specific terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't5'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nNT5 -> 't0'\n\nNT7 -> 't0'\n\nNT8 -> 't0'\n\nNT9 -> 't9'\n\nNT10 -> 't6'\n\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nNT13 -> 't2', 't4'\n\nNT1 -> 't8' (but wait, seems like it could be 't8' from NT1 or other productions)\n\nWait, let me make a list of the non-terminals and their terminals:\n\nNT3: 't5'\n\nNT0: 't10'\n\nNT1: 't8'\n\nNT2: 't2'\n\nNT5: 't0'\n\nNT7: 't0'\n\nNT8: 't0'\n\nNT9: 't9'\n\nNT10: 't6'\n\nNT11: 't3'\n\nNT13: 't4'\n\nOther NTs produce other non-terminals, like NT4 -> 't7', but wait, in the grammar, some have multiple rules. For example, NT0 has several productions to other NTs, but none directly to a terminal except for 't10' and 't4' via NT13.\n\nWait, looking again, for example:\n\nNT13 -> 't2' and 't4'\n\nSimilarly, NT10 -> 't3', etc.\n\nHmm, so the string has a lot of 't5', 't10', 't8', etc. Maybe the string can be split starting from 't5 t5 t5' as part of a production that leads to t5.\n\nWait, let me look for non-terminals that can derive 't5' or 't10', etc.\n\nLooking at NT1: 't8'\n\nBut in the string, 't8' appears later. Maybe the initial steps involve breaking the string into parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start with the start symbol S, which produces two non-terminals each time.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to try to see what possible strings can be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if the string can be formed by combining the terminals assigned to non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, trying to match the grammar.\n\nLet me consider that CYK is a dynamic programming approach. Each cell in the table represents a substring and what non-terminals can generate it.\n\nBut this might take a while, but since I need to just determine yes or no, perhaps I can find if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see:\n\nThe first part is 't5 t5 t5'. Maybe these come from NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 produces 't5', but wait, I'm not sure. Let me look at the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 -> 't5', and NT4 -> 't7'. Hmm, but where does 't5' come from? Oh, NT3 is 't5'. So if a production ends with NT3, that would give 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 is a non-terminal that can produce 't7' (since NT4 -> 't7' in one of its productions). Wait, but wait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar's 'NT4' productions, the first rule is NT4 -> 't0', second is 't5', third is 't7', etc. Wait, no, actually in the grammar:\n\n- NT4 is defined by several rules, some produce terminals like 't0' and others don't. Wait, more accurately, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nWait, yes, because in the grammar, NT4 is defined as:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT4 -> 't7'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, but looking back, the grammar for NT4 has several productions:\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n\nSo NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or 't7'. So if I have 't5' in the string, that might come from NT4.\n\nBut then, in the string, the first 't5's could be from NT4.\n\nBut wait, let me check: the string starts with 't5 t5 t5', so maybe S -> NT4 NT4 or something like that.\n\nWait, S can produce NT4 followed by NT8, or other combinations. For example, S can produce NT4 and NT8, which would give us two terminal sequences.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't5', which could be from NT4. Then, if S -> NT4 NT8, then NT4 could produce 't5', and NT8 would produce a series of terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the string is composed only of certain terminals, and check if those terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t5, t5, t10, t5, t8, t3, t7, t5, t1, t7, t2, t9, t1, t3, t4.\n\nThat's 16 tokens. Let me see how they can be split into parts that match non-terminals.\n\nEach split must have parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nPerhaps the first three 't5's can come from a sub-production that generates 't5' three times. But I don't see a rule that does that. Each non-terminal can only produce two symbols or a terminal.\n\nSo, maybe the first 't5' is from NT4, the next from another NT4, but that's not part of the same split because S expands to two NTs each time.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure the string as a concatenation of two parts, each generated by NTs.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider that any string in the language is a concatenation of terminals that can be generated by a chain of productions starting from S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the grammar is in CNF, each production results in one or two terminals, so the string should be split into units that match the productions. I'll need to check if there's a way to derive the string by following the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it into components based on the grammar.

None of these directly produce 't5', but their right-hand sides consist of non-terminals like NT4, NT8, etc., which then produce the terminals.\n\nLet me see the productions for each NT:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, which eventually might lead to 't8' or other terminals. Let's see if there's a way to get 't5' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, there's NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', and 't7'. NT2 \u2192 't2', and NT9 \u2192 't10', 't0', etc. So maybe the first 't5' comes from NT4, since NT4 has a production to 't5'. So the first part could be S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nThen NT4 \u2192 't5', so that's good. Now the next symbol is 't0', so after NT4, we have NT8. Let me look at NT8's productions: NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't0', etc. Let's see if we can get 't0' from NT8. Checking the productions, NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't0'. Yes, 't0' is one of the productions.

The string is: t5 t0 t0 t2 t0 t5 t0 t2 t2 t0 t6 t0 t0 t4 t5 t7.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So the first symbol would come from NT4, which could produce 't5' as we saw. So the first part is 't5'.\n\nThen the next part is NT8, which can produce 't6', 't3', or 't0'. The next symbol is 't0', so let's take NT8 \u2192 't0'.

Let me list all the terminal productions.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7'\nNT2 \u2192 't2', 't7'\nNT9 \u2192 't0', 't10'\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\nNT10 \u2192 't1', 't3', 't6'\nNT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', etc. Wait, looking back, I need to list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT1 \u2192 't8', NT9 \u2192 't10', NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7', NT2 \u2192 't2', 't7', NT10 \u2192 't1', 't3', 't6', NT5 \u2192 't0', NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', NT3 \u2192 't2', 't7', etc. But wait, I think I missed some. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7'\nNT2 \u2192 't2', 't7'\nNT9 \u2192 't10', 't0'\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\nNT10 \u2192 't1', 't3', 't6'\nNT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', etc. Wait, does NT13 produce 't2' and 't4' as per some rule?\n\nWait, I think I need to list all the terminal symbols. From the rules, the terminals are 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', 't10' as per the terminal productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, for example, NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7', so those are terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 't8', NT9 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc.\n\nSo, to produce the string, each terminal must come from a production of a non-terminal to that terminal.\n\nNow, looking back at the string: t5 t0 t0 t2 t0 t5 t0 t2 t2 t0 t6 t0 t0 t4 t5 t7.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n1. t5\n2. t0\n3. t0\n4. t2\n5. t0\n6. t5\n7. t0\n8. t2\n9. t2\n10. t0\n11. t6\n12. t0\n13. t0\n14. t4\n15. t5\n16. t7\n\nLet me try to see how each can be generated.\n\nStarting with t5. NT4 can produce t5, so let's assume the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now, NT4 \u2192 t5, so the first symbol is accounted for.\n\nNext, the production after NT4 is NT8. So NT8 can be expanded into t0 (since that's the next symbol), so NT8 \u2192 t0.\n\nNow, we have t5 t0. Next symbol is t0, so we need to see what can come after NT8. NT8 can produce t6, t3, or t0. So perhaps NT8 \u2192 t0 again, giving us t5 t0 t0.\n\nNow the next symbol is t2. So what can produce t2? Looking at non-terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2, so that's possible. So next non-terminal is NT2, which produces t2.\n\nNow, the next symbol after t2 is t0. So after NT2 \u2192 t2, the next is NT8 again (since the string is about to be split again). So NT8 \u2192 t0.\n\nBut wait, the current string up to this point is t5 t0 t0 t2 t0, so now we have to continue.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, keeping track of the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to split the string into units that match the production rules. Since each production is either two terminals or a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal, etc., maybe it's better to split the string into possible units that can be generated by the productions.\n\nWait, let's see.

{"custom_id":"request-316","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t5 t2 t9 t0 t10 t0 t10 t8 t0 t0 t10 t0 t5 t2 t7 t10 t0\". Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All productions are in the form where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce several combinations. The first thing I notice is that S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so any derivation starting with S must first expand to a combination of NT4 and NT8, or other options if S has alternatives. Wait, the given grammar for S seems to have multiple options: S\u2192NT4 NT8, S\u2192NT4 NT11, S\u2192NT1 NT2. So the initial production varies depending on which variant we take.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar again, it lists S's productions as:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo the grammar starts with S, which can produce either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Therefore, the string must be a concatenation of these non-terminals, each of which may further expand into more tokens.\n\nThe string given is a series of terminals: t5, t2, t9, t0, t10, t0, t10, t8, t0, t0, t10, t0, t5, t2, t7, t10, t0. So, let's break it down into tokens: t5, t2, t9, t0, t10, t0, t10, t8, t0, t0, t10, t0, t5, t2, t7, t10, t0.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for a top-down parsing approach like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent, but perhaps a simpler way is to model possible substitutions step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to simulate the process of expanding the start symbol S and see if the string can be built by combining the productions.\n\nLet's first consider the initial step: S can expand to NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's see if the first option makes sense with the string.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the next step would be to produce terms from NT4 and NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: From the grammar, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, and NT4 also has other options like NT0 NT4, but perhaps let's start with the given ones.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar for NT4 is:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nSo NT4 can split into various combinations. Similarly, NT8's productions are:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT8 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's instead look at the terminal symbols in the string and see if each can be produced by a terminal rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n- t5 appears multiple times. In the grammar, t5 is a terminal in NT4 (NT4 \u2192 't5') and also in NT2 (NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', etc.). Wait, in the grammar, NT4 has productions to 't0' and 't5', etc.\n\nWait, let's check all the nullable symbols. Actually, since the grammar is in CNF, some symbols may be nullable. Let's see:\n\nBut actually, in this case, it's not about nullable, but about which terminals are present. Let's look for each terminal in the string and see if the grammar allows it.\n\nWait, the string has t0, t1, t2, t5, t7, t9, t10, t13. Let's check each:\n\n- t5: appears in NT4's productions, and in NT9 (maybe not, since NT9's productions end with 't9'? Let's check the grammar. Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce 't0', 't9', NT5, etc. Wait, actually, in the rules, NT9 is present, but let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' and 't2' (from the grammar: NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', etc.)\nWait, in the grammar, NT2 can produce 't2' and 't5'. Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT2 rule is listed as:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2' (from NT2 rules as per the user's input):\n\nChecking:\n\nIn the user's grammar definitions, under NT2:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't2' (I think this is correct). Also, looking elsewhere, there's an NT2 \u2192 't5', but that might be a typo or not. Wait, the user's initial description lists:\n\nUnder the grammar:\n\nNT2 has rules like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2', but then later under NT2:\n\nWait, looking back, the user's grammar has:\n\nWait, under NT2:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT1\n- NT1 has some rules, but perhaps let's focus on terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's grammar has NT2 \u2192 't2' and 't5' as in:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, under NT2:\n\nYes, it's listed as:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT1\nNT1 has rule \u2192 t8, et cetera. But wait, actually, for the grammar provided:\n\nUnder NT2, the relevant productions are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- And others? Let me check:\n\nNo, in the user's grammar, under NT2, the productions include:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT1\n...\nBut perhaps 't2' is in NT2 \u2192 't2', and 't5' in another rule. So NT2 can produce 't2' directly, as well as 't5' directly.\n\nSo, for the string:\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t5: yes, produced by NT4 and NT2 directly.\n\n- t2: yes, produced by NT2 and some other non-terminals.\n\n- t9: Wait, t9 is a terminal. Let's check if t9 is present in any rule.\n\nYes, NT9 has productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0', 't9', and others. So t9 is allowed by NT9.\n\n- t0: Looking for 't0' terminal. From the grammar, NT0 can produce 't10', 't4', 't5', etc. Wait, but in the user's grammar, NT0 has multiple productions that include terminals and non-terminals. Specifically, under NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't7'\n- etc. So, 't0' is not directly a terminal, but perhaps 't0' is represented in another non-terminal? Wait, actually, looking back, in the user's grammar, under NT4, we have NT4 \u2192 't0' and 't5'. So 't0' is a terminal in NT4.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's make a table:\n\nTerminals in the grammar (a terminals being those that don't appear on the left side of any production):\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions, when it's a single terminal, that's a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me list all right-hand sides that are terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (from 't0's listed under NT4's rules)\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT1 has NT9 NT1 as"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the string is `t5 t0 t8 t2 t0 t2 t5 t9 t4 t0 t2 t0 t10 t3 t6 t6 t3`, and the grammar is pretty complex. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be parsed using methods like CYK or recursive descent. But maybe with this string, I can try to walk through possible derivations step by step. Alternatively, I can see if the string fits the structure of the grammar by looking for patterns or key rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't2', NT7 \u2192 't0', etc. So perhaps I can track how these terminals could appear in the string.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for S:\n\nS can produce:\n- NT4 NT8\n- NT4 NT11\n- NT1 NT2\n\nSo the string starts with S, which branches into two NTs. The first symbol is 't5', so I need to see which NT can produce 't5'. Looking at the rules, NT4 has two options: \u2192 't0' or 't5'. Also, NT5 can produce 't0', but that's not 't5'.

The first symbol is 't5'. Looking for what non-terminals produce 't5':\n\nFrom the NT4 rules: NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5'.\nFrom NT2: NT2 has several rules, but I don't see any that directly produce 't5'.\nFrom NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, but that's more complex.\n\nSo the first symbol 't5' must come from NT4 \u2192 't5'. So the first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which gives 't5' as the first symbol.\n\nNow, the remaining part of the string is:\n\nt0 t8 t2 t0 t2 t5 t9 t4 t0 t2 t0 t10 t3 t6 t6 t3.\n\nAfter 't5', we have to produce this substring: t0 t8..., etc.\n\nSo the second part comes from NT4 production and then NT8.\n\nWait, no.

Let me clarify:\n\nWhen we choose S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the 't5' comes from NT4, so the first symbol is 't5'.

Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which has rules with two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Each production rule has two symbols on the right side.\n\nThe string is: `t7 t0 t10 t3 t5 t1 t2 t5 t0 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t5 t10 t9 t2`.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the string. It looks like each word (like t7, t0, etc.) is a terminal symbol. So each step in the derivation should produce these terminals.\n\nI'll start with the start symbol S. The grammar has three options for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n3. S \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nI need to find a derivation path from S that can produce the string. Let me look for the initial parts of the string in the possible expansions.\n\nThe string starts with t7. Looking at the rules, t7 appears as a terminal in NT7. So somewhere in the derivation, one of the NT7 rules must produce t7.\n\nLooking at NT7, I see rules like:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (repeated)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n- NT7 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n\nHmm, that last rule could be useful because it can help in producing loops of t0 (since NT7 \u2192 t7, and maybe another t7). Also, another rule is NT7 \u2192 t0, which I think is from NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT11 or something, but maybe I'm looking at the wrong rules.\n\nWait, actually, let's see: looking at the rules, NT7 can go to t7 directly? No, looking at the provided rules, the only terminal in NT7 is t7 in the start?\n\nWait no, let me list all the terminals from the non-terminals:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2', 't5', 't7'?\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n\nWait no, let's go through each terminal:\n\nNT13 can go to t2, t4, t6.\n\nNT9 can go to t0, t10.\n\nNT4 can go to t0, t5.\n\nNT2 can go to t2, t5.\n\nNT1 can go to t8.\n\nNT0 can go to t10, t4.\n\nNT7 can go directly to t7, maybe?\n\nWait no, looking at the rules, NT7 is a non-terminal. The specific rule where a terminal is on the right is:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (duplicate)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n- NT7 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n\nWait, so none of the NT7 rules directly produce a terminal except NT7 \u2192 NT8 NT7, which could produce t7, but wait, does NT8 produce t7?\n\nLooking at NT8 rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT7\nNT8 \u2192 NT0 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT0 NT2\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nWait, so none of the NT8 rules produce t7. Only NT7 can produce t7 via which rule? Let's check the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I see that:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t7? No, that's not the case. It seems like the only place t7 is a terminal is in the NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1 rule, perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, looking through all the rules, most of them are combinations of non-terminals. I might have missed.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again. For example, looking at NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2. But I don't see a rule where a terminal comes from NT3, except in the case of NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. So that would produce t7 when NT7 is t7.\n\nWait, but NT3 is a non-terminal. So when NT3 is derived, it would produce NT7 NT1, which then could produce t7.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with S, which can go to NT11 NT6 or NT1 NT2, etc.\n\nGiven the string starts with t7, I think it's more likely that the first step is part of the NT7 expansion because t7 is in NT7.\n\nWait, but to get t7 in the string, let's look at the string again: the first three words are t7, t0, t10.\n\nHmm. So the first symbol is t7, but all the grammar rules for S produce two non-terminals. So perhaps after expanding, the t7 comes from NT7's expansion.\n\nBut wait, how do I connect the string to the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree, but given the length of the string, it's time-consuming. Maybe I can start by analyzing the string.\n\nThe string is: t7 t0 t10 t3 t5 t1 t2 t5 t0 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t5 t10 t9 t2.\n\nWait, let's split it into tokens:\n\nt7, t0, t10, t3, t5, t1, t2, t5, t0, t5, t5, t5, t3, t2, t5, t10, t9, t2.\n\nThat's 18 tokens.\n\nLooking for the beginning, the first token is t7. So in the derivation, some rule must produce t7 as the first symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, do any rules directly produce t7? Looking at the provided rules, I don't see any rule where a single terminal is on the RHS. Instead, t7 is only part of the middle of a rule.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the rules, is there a rule where a component produces t7? Let's check:\n\nYes! Look at NT7 \u2192 t7? Wait no. Let me look:\n\nFrom NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13: that's for producing t8?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no. Let me go through all the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking for any rule where one of the non-terminals produces a terminal directly.

{"custom_id":"request-336","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the grammar rules carefully. It looks like all the rules are in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing the string a bit manageable.\n\nThe string to check is: `t9 t5 t5 t10 t0 t10 t7 t10 t3 t3 t10 t2 t2 t10 t2 t7 t5 t7`. Wait, no, the original string was: `t9 t5 t9 t10 t0 t10 t7 t10 t3 t3 t10 t2 t2 t10 t2 t7 t5 t7`. I'll correct that.\n\nNow, the goal is to see if we can derive this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a simple recursive descent approach or maybe even a parser that builds a parse tree. Alternatively, I can simulate the process by breaking down the string into parts that match the non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, S. The S rules are:\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT1 NT2\nSo S can be broken into two non-terminals, each of which must produce parts of the string.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be divided into parts that match these S alternatives.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t9`. So I need to see which rules produce t9. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nThe terminals are:\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t13.\n\nSo t9 is a terminal. Now, looking through the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t9?\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't9' (I think that's correct from the given rules)\nWait, let me double-check. The rules for NT9 are in the string. Looking back:\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some non-terminals are defined with ->:\n\nFor example, NT13 -> NT6 NT12, etc., and some like NT9 -> 't0', NT7->'t0', etc. Let me list all the terminals.\n\nIt looks like NT9 is a non-terminal, and in the rules provided, there is:\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT9 appears in other productions, like S using NT9?\n\nWait, no, the S rules don't have NT9. Looking again: the S rules are S->NT4 NT8, etc. So S is made of two non-terminals. So, for S to produce the string, each part must come from one of the S's rules.\n\nSo the string must be divided into two parts, each part being the result of one of the S rules.\n\nSo, let's consider the first S rule: NT4 NT8. So, let's see if the start can be divided into that.\n\nIf the first part is produced by NT4 and the second by NT8, or vice versa.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t9`. But in the first S rule, NT4 is a non-terminal. So which of NT4's productions produce a terminal?\n\nLooking at NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT4 can produce t0, t5, or another NT4 which then breaks down further.\n\nSimilarly, NT8's rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT8 has several rules:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't7'\n\nSo NT8 can produce t0, t7, and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t9, which isn't directly produced by S because S uses NT4 and NT8, which need to produce more non-terminals.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that the string starts with t9, which can be produced by NT9, but S doesn't directly produce NT9.\n\nWait, S is made up of NT4 and NT8, so the string should be split into two parts each of which can be derived from NT4 and NT8, respectively, or vice versa.\n\nLet me check if the string can be divided into two parts at some point where each part is derived from either NT4 or NT8.\n\nBut the string is 19 tokens long, which is odd. Each S production is two non-terminals, so the entire string should have even length, because each NT production would contribute either 1 terminal or 2 non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string has 19 tokens\u201419 is odd. So if S is made up of two non-terminals, then each of those would have to derive into a string of even length, but 19 is odd, which would require one part to be of even length and the other odd, but each NT can only produce strings of even length or some combination? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, each S production is two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can produce either one terminal or two non-terminals. So the total length derived from each S symbol is 1 (if it produces a terminal) or 2 (if it produces another two non-terminals, each of which can contribute further). So the total length would always be even, because for each S symbol, it's 1 + 1 = 2, or 2 + 2 = 4, etc. So if the string is 19 tokens, which is odd, then S cannot generate it, because the total number of terminals would be even.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. S produces two non-terminals, but each of those can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each non-terminal can generate a string that is either length 1 or 2 (if it breaks down further). So for example, NT4 could produce t0 (length 1) or two NTs, each of which could produce more.\n\nBut if you have two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can contribute 1 or 2, then the total length can vary. For example, if both produce terminals: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nIf one produces a terminal and the other a two, it would be 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nIf both produce two, it's 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo the total number of terminals can be even or odd, depending on how the non-terminals break down.\n\nWait, wait, maybe that's a mistake. Each non-terminal contributes exactly one terminal or two non-terminals. But each of those non-terminals would themselves contribute either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the total length is determined by the breakdown.\n\nBut in our case, the string is 19 tokens long. Let me see if 19 can be achieved from S.\n\nSuppose S is NT4 NT8. Let's see what each contributes.\n\nNT4 can produce a terminal (e.g., t0, t5) or two non-terminals. Similarly, NT8 can produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\nIf NT4 produces a terminal, say t0, and NT8 produces a terminal, say t7, then together it's two tokens.\n\nIf NT4 is two non-terminals and NT8 is two, then it's four.\n\nIf NT4 is two and NT8 is one, it's three tokens.\n\nWait, but the total could be anything, but perhaps 19 being odd could still be possible. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me instead approach this by trying to parse the string.\n\nBut 19 tokens is a lot, so perhaps I can look for shorter substrings and see if they fit into the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a way to divide the string into parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t9 t5 t9 t10 t0 t10 t7 t10 t3 t3 t10 t2 t2 t10 t2 t7 t5 t7.\n\nI think it would be helpful to look at the grammar and see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFirst, let's note the terminals:\n\nTerminal symbols: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t13.\n\nSo t9 is only in NT9. Let's check NT9's production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT9 is a non-terminal with:\n\nWait, I think I need to list all the production rules for each non-terminal to see what's possible.\n\nStarting from NT9: NT9 -> t9.\n\nSo the only way to produce t9 is through NT9.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is a big set of productions. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) can produce combinations of other symbols until we reach the terminals (like 't0', 't1', etc.). The goal is to see if the string `t10 t3 t6 t5 t0 t2 t1 t10 t10 t10 t9 t6 t5 t10 t9 t2 t0 t0 t5` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nChomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each step only replaces one non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the grammar, starting from S. Maybe using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is relatively short, I can try to find the breakdown manually.\n\nLet me start by looking for parts of the string that might match the right-hand sides of some productions. The string starts with t10, so maybe we can see if any non-terminal directly produces t10. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the terminals:\n\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't4'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't10', which isn't one of the terminals. So perhaps I should look for non-terminals that produce 't10'. Checking the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't10'. Hmm, that might be a problem because if the string starts with 't10', and the grammar doesn't have a rule where a non-terminal goes directly to 't10', then maybe it's impossible, right? Or did I miss a rule?\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar rules for non-terminals ending with 't10' would be helpful, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any where NTx produces 't10' directly. Only NT10 produces 't1' and maybe via some other path.\n\nBut wait, if the grammar doesn't produce 't10' directly from any non-terminal, then starting with 't10' as the first symbol would be impossible. That would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Did I check all the rules correctly? Let me go through each symbol:\n\nLooking through NT11's rules, it can produce 't3' as a terminal. NT10 -> 't1' as before. I don't see any NT producing 't10' directly. So unless 't10' is somehow part of a production chain that includes other terminals, but that's unlikely because the string starts with it.\n\nSo, for example, if a non-terminal A produces B followed by C, and B produces 't10', then it's possible. But unless the grammar has A \u2192 B C where B is a non-terminal that can produce 't10', then the string wouldn't start with 't10' unless that's possible.\n\nSo in this case, since there's no production where a non-terminal directly goes to 't10', the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT10 -> 't1', which is 't1', not 't10'. Similarly, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't10'. So the string starts with 't10', which would require that some non-terminal produces 't10' directly, but the grammar doesn't have that rule.\n\nSo that would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar, right? Because the very first symbol is 't10', but none of the non-terminals can produce 't10' directly.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps 't10' is a terminal that's derived from some non-terminal, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal A would produce 't10' as the result of a series of productions. For example, perhaps A \u2192 B C, and B produces something that can lead to 't10', but looking at the right-hand sides, I don't see any that produce 't10' at the start.\n\nSo to generate the string, the process would have to start with S and produce a structure that eventually leads to 't10' as the first symbol. But since no non-terminal directly leads to 't10', this seems impossible.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it starts with 't10', and none of the non-terminals produce 't10' directly or via other productions that would allow 't10' to be the first symbol.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, many non-terminals produce specific terminals. Let me see which terminals are present in the string.

Looking at the string, the first few tokens are t3, t9, t10, t10. I need to see how these could be produced.\n\nLooking at the productions, some non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't0', NT3 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\u2014so multiple options.\n\nWait, but when I see a terminal like 't3', it's produced by NT3 directly, right? But looking at the rules, NT3 \u2192 't2' in the last rule. Wait no: in the rules, the last NT3 \u2192 't2' is correct, but earlier there is NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1. So, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, no, wait\u2014I need to check all the NT3 rules. There are lines:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n\nWait, I think earlier I was looking at the NT3 rule as 't5', but that's more elsewhere. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back: The productions for NT3 are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nAh, okay, so NT3 can produce 't2' or NT7 NT1. So in the string, when I have a 't3', is that a typo? Because 't3' is a terminal, but in the grammar, are there any non-terminals that produce 't3'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT11 \u2192 't3', NT3 \u2192 't2', NT7 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 't0', etc. There's no production for any non-terminal to produce 't3'. Except in the initial problem, the first string has a 't3' as the first token. That's confusing because none of the rules seem to have 't3' as a terminal.\n\nWait, am I looking at this correctly? Let me see the string again: `t3 t9 t10 t10 t3...`. So the first token is t3. But according to the grammar, there's no rule that NT produces 't3' except nowhere\u2014NT11 produces 't3', but in the first token, it's 't3' without any preceding NT11. Hmm. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the NT11 rules. Oh, in the rules, NT11 \u2192 't3' is one of the possibilities? Wait, I'm looking through the rules, and I don't see any NT production where a non-terminal leads directly to 't3'. Oh, wait\u2014no, looking again: the grammar provided in the initial block does not have any NT that produce 't3'. The only NT that produce terminals are NT3 \u2192 't2', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', etc. So 't3' isn't directly produced by any rule.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the initial string starts with t3. I must have made a mistake. Perhaps I misread a production. Let me check again: looking through all the NT productions, there's no production for any non-terminal to 't3', except perhaps the first line I wrote. Wait, the initial production for NT3 is NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1, which is a bnon-terminal, so that's not a terminal. So, perhaps the first token 't3' is a terminal that's not covered by the grammar, meaning the string cannot be derived.\n\nWait, but that can't be. Or maybe I'm missing 't3' somewhere. Let me look again at the production list: I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't3' apart from where?\n\nWait, the first production line says NT3 \u2192 't5', as in:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- First few lines:\n  - NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n  - NT3 \u2192 't2' (Wait, no, that was under NT2)\nWait, no, in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking here:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT13 \u2192 't2' (Wait, that's under NT13)\n- NT9 \u2192 't0' and 't9', etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't3', I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly leads to 't3' as a terminal. So in that case, the string starts with 't3', which is not produced by any production. So the whole string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that seems too quick. Maybe I missed a production. Let me re-express all the rules:\n\nFrom the initial code block:\n\n- NT3: \u2192 NT7 NT1\n\n- Any other rules? No, I don't see 't3' being a terminal.

Let me start by understanding what the grammar does.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, N, T, etc.) produces two other non-terminals or terminals. The string given is a series of terminals (t0, t1, etc.), so I need to see if applying the production rules can lead to this string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial production rules from S are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce combinations of NT4 and NT8, or NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2. I'll need to explore these options and see if any of them can derive the given string.\n\nLet me pick the first option: S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, NT4 can produce according to its rules.

So that's one option.\n\nAnd NT8 has production rules, including NT8 -> NT6 NT3 and NT8 -> NT1 NT5, etc.\n\nSo let me try to see if the string can be derived by expanding S and its components step by step. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to perform a parsing approach, like checking if the string can be split according to the grammar's rules.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm for parsing, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a two-symbol rule, which is compatible with CYK. But implementing CYK would be time-consuming here, especially for a human.\n\nWait, maybe I should try working through the string step by step, seeing if each step can be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t7 t10 t0 t9 t7 t0 t0 t3 t10 t3 t10 t0 t9 t4 t3 t2 t3 t10 t2 t5\n\nLet me list these tokens in a list for clarity: [t7, t10, t0, t9, t7, t0, t0, t3, t10, t3, t10, t0, t9, t4, t3, t2, t3, t10, t2, t5]\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a non-terminal that can expand into two non-terminals. Terminals are leaves. So to derive the string, the string must consist of the sequence of terminals generated by expanding the productions step by step.\n\nFirst, let's check the possible start symbol S. It can expand into three possibilities: NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, NT1 NT2.\n\nLet's pick NT4 and NT8. Because if the start symbol is S, the first two symbols generated should be NT4 and NT8, or NT4 and NT11, etc.\n\nLooking at the first token of the string, which is t7. So in NT4, what can produce t7? Let's see NT4's production rules. NT4 can produce NT14 NT7, which ends with NT7. So in that case, NT7 must produce t7.\n\nWait, looking at the NT7 productions, one of them is NT7 -> 't7'. Yes, in the given grammar, NT7 is a terminal rule: NT7 -> 't7'. So from NT7, we can directly get t7.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT4: NT4 can produce NT14 NT7, so if in the production S -> NT4 NT8, and the first part is NT4, which can produce NT14 NT7, then the first part would start with NT14 NT7. But the first token of the string is t7, which is the terminal form of NT7.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine. If S expands into NT4 NT8, then the first step is to produce NT4 and NT8, which are separate derivations. So to generate the entire string, both NT4 and NT8 must produce sequences of terminals that combine to form the entire string.\n\nBut wait, the string has 21 tokens. Since each production step combines two non-terminals, the number of steps would be such that the derivation length aligns with the string length. The initial S is one non-terminal. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the number of non-terminals increases until we reach all terminals. Each step adds one token because each production adds two tokens, but the number depends on how they expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for whether the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar rules, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet's see. The first symbol is t7. Looking at the possible terminals that can be produced by NT4 and NT8:\n\nLooking at NT4's first production, it can produce NT14 NT7, which ends with NT7. So if we choose this production for NT4, the first token would be t7, which is what we have. Then the next non-terminal would be NT14, which needs to produce the next part.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the first production of NT4 is NT14 NT7, so the first part would generate t7, and the second part would be the production for NT14. Let's check NT14: from the grammar, NT14 has rules like NT14 -> NT3 NT4, etc. One of its productions is NT14 -> 't14' as a terminal? No, I don't see a terminal rule for NT14. Wait, looking back, no. Let's look:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, only some NTs have terminal rules. Let me check:\n\n- NT13: has several productions leading to terminals, like NT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6', etc.\n\n- NT7 -> 't7' is a terminal rule.\n\n- NT8 -> 't8'.\n\n- NT5 -> 't5'.\n\n- NT9 -> 't9'.\n\n- NT4 has some terminal rules, but looking at the list:\n\nWait, let me look for any NT that is directly matched by the string.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see that some have terminal rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't7' (position 7)\n- NT8 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT4 -> 't4' (position 13)\n- NT4 -> 't5' (position 2? Wait, looking back: is there a rule that produces a terminal for NT4? Let me check:\n\nYes, lines like NT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't7', etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nLine: NT4 -> 't0'\nLine: NT4 -> 't5'\nLine: NT4 -> 't7'\nLine: NT4 -> 't2'\n\nSo NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', 't7', or 't2' as terminals. Similarly, NT14 has a production NT14 -> 't3'? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT13's rules, I see NT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6' as terminal options. Wait, but I'm more interested in which NT can produce which terminal.\n\nLooking for which NTs can produce the terminals in our string: t7, t10, t0, t9, etc.\n\nLooking at the NTs, some have direct terminal outputs:\n\n- NT4 can produce t0, t5, t7, t2.\n\n- NT7 can produce t7.\n\n- NT8 can produce t8.\n\n- NT9 can produce t9.\n\n- NT5 can produce t5.\n\n- NT2 can produce t2.\n\n- NT10 can produce t10.\n\n- NT1 can produce t8.\n\n- NT9 can produce t9.\n\nSo in the given string, we can check if each part can be generated by some NT.\n\nLet's consider the string again: t7, t10, t0, t9, t7, t0, t0, t3, t10, t3, t10, t0, t9, t4, t3, t2, t3, t10, t2, t5.\n\nWe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-374","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing the string a bit easier since there are no other forms.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t5 t0 t1 t1 t7 t0 t7 t0 t0 t8 t5 t7 t10 t9 t5 t0 t5 t5 t0`.\n\nWait, but the initial grammar starts with S and has productions that start with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. All right.\n\nMy approach is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S. To do this, I might need to perform a derivation or a leftmost parse, ensuring that each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nBut manually expanding all possible rules could get complicated, especially since there are a lot of rules. So maybe I can approach this by looking for the first few symbols and see which production they match.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t0 t5`. Let's check the grammar for any production that starts with t0.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 t10 (I think I saw something like that)\n- NT13 \u2192 t4, t6, t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT0 \u2192 t10, t4, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 t7\n- NT8 \u2192 t0 t7\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4\n- NT13 \u2192 t6, t2\n- NT3 \u2192 t7, t1\n- NT10 \u2192 t6, etc.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think more clearly.\n\nThe string starts with t0 t5 t0 t1 t1 t7 t0... So the first symbols are t0, t5, t0, etc.\n\nLooking at NT4, it can produce t0 or t5. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let's see: NT4 can produce t0 or t5, and NT8 can produce t0 or t7.\n\nWait, but S can be derived as NT4 followed by NT8. So if the string starts with t0 t5, then NT4 could produce t0, but then NT8 produces t5. But NT8's productions are t0 t7 or t8? Wait, looking back: Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT8 seems to have several productions, like NT8 \u2192 t6 t3, NT8 \u2192 t0 t7, NT8 \u2192 t6 t3, etc. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 t6 NT11\nNT8 \u2192 t0 t7\nNT8 \u2192 t6 NT13\nWait, looking at the initial production for NT8:\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has production NT8 \u2192 t0 t7? Or is that a terminal?\n\nWait, looking through the list again:\n\nLooking for NT8:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t0 t7?\nWait, let me check. The user listed:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 t6 NT11\nNT8 \u2192 t0 t7\nNT8 \u2192 t6 NT13\nWait, looking at the user's initial message, they have:\n\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> t6 NT11\nNT8 -> t0 t7\nNT8 -> t6 NT13\nNT8 -> t1 NT5\nNT8 -> t5 NT0\"\n\nNo, wait, actually, in the user's grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nStarting with NT8:\n\n- NT8 -> t0 t7\n\nYes, because in the grammar line: NT8 \u2192 t0 t7 exists. So NT8 can produce t0 t7 directly.\n\nSo, back to the string: starting with t0 t5... So let's try to see:\n\nS can be derivated as NT4 followed by NT8.\n\nIf NT4 produces t0, and NT8 produces t7, that would be t0 t7, which is different from the string's first two symbols, t0 t5.\n\nAlternatively, could NT4 produce t5, and NT8 produce t0? But wait, NT8 can produce t0 t7, which is 't0 t7', but the string's first two symbols are 't0 t5'.\n\nHmm, is there another way?\n\nWait, maybe NT8 can produce t5 through a different path.\n\nWait, let me re-examine NT8's productions. Actually, in the list, NT8 is listed as:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 t0 t7\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 t1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5 NT0\n\nSo NT8 can produce t5 followed by t0, right? Because the production NT8 \u2192 t5 NT0 means that NT8 can produce t5, and then NT0 can produce t0. So t5 t0 is a possible output of NT8.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can produce t0 t7, or t5 t0, and other combinations involving NT6, NT11, etc.\n\nSo, given that, let's consider that NT4 could produce t5, and NT8 could produce t5 t0... but wait, no, because NT8 can produce t5 followed by t0. So if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT4 produces t5 and NT8 produces t5 t0, which would make the first three symbols t5 t5 t0. But the string starts with t0 t5 t0, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, if NT4 produces t0 and NT8 produces t5 something. Wait, but NT8 can produce t5 followed by t0, which is t5 t0. So the sequence t0 t5 t0 could be achieved if the first symbol is t0, and the second is t5.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8, with NT4 producing t0 and NT8 producing t5 t0. But let's see the productions for NT8:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT8 can produce t5 followed by NT0. So the first symbol would be t5, the next could be t0. So the substring for NT8 would be t5 t0.\n\nBut in the string, the first two symbols are t0 t5. So that would require the first symbol to be t0, which would come from NT4 (since NT4 can produce t0 or t5).\n\nSo, if NT4 produces t0, and NT8 produces t5 followed by t0, then the combination would be t0 t5 t0, which matches the first three symbols of the string. Hmm, that seems promising.\n\nBut then, after that, how do we continue? Let's track the derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nNT4 \u2192 t0\nNT8 \u2192 t5 (via NT8 \u2192 t5 NT0)\n\nSo after S, it's t0 t5 NT0. Wait, no, because NT8 is derived into t5 and NT0. So the first two symbols are t0 and t5, then we need to see what NT0 produces.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t10\nNT0 \u2192 t4\nNT0 \u2192 t5\nNT0 \u2192 t0\nNT0 \u2192 t10\nNT0 \u2192 t4\nNT0 \u2192 t1\nNT0 \u2192 t3\nWait, let me check the list again:\n\nIn the grammar, NT0 can produce:\n\nLooking at lines:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT10 NT13\n- NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT0's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n\n- NT0-> NT10 NT13\n- NT0-> NT4 NT3\n- NT0-> NT11 NT11\n- NT0-> NT8 NT8\n- NT0-> NT14 NT13\n- NT0-> NT2 NT1\n- NT0-> NT8 NT8\nWait, it seems a bit redundant, maybe.\n\nBut in any case,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals, but I'll try to map out some of the key productions. Notably, I see that several non-terminals produce terminal 't' symbols, which will be part of the generated string. For example, NT4 -> 't0', NT1 -> 't8', NT9 -> 't9', etc. Some also produce other 't's like NT11 -> 't3', etc.\n\nThe string starts with `t0 t0 t0`, so I need to track how these 't0's are generated. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. The string is a sequence of t's and some other symbols, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production must expand to two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Wait, in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So, in this grammar, a non-terminal can expand into two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\n2. Starting with the entire string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I'll need to find a way to derive this from the start symbol S. S has several production rules: S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nI need to see which of these could generate the string.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT4 NT8: NT4 and NT8. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 produce.\n\nNT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 't7'.\n\nFrom the string, the first t0 comes from nt4 being t0. So let's take S \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 \u2192 t0.\n\nThen, NT8 has several productions: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 't0', NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, etc.\n\nThe second t0 could come from NT8 \u2192 t0. So let's use that.\n\nSo far, we have t0 (from NT4 \u2192 t0) and t0 (from NT8 \u2192 t0). That's the first two t0s.\n\nNext, the third t0: Maybe NT8 can still produce another t0. Or perhaps another production is used.\n\nWait, let me think about this. The string is long, so I'll have to map out each step carefully.\n\nIt might be easier to parse the string from the beginning, trying to find possible productions at each step.\n\nBreaking down the string: t0, t0, t0, t1, t5, t0, t2, t8, t6, t7, t0, t10, t10, t0, t5, t0, t2, t3, t0, t3, t8.\n\nLet me note that after the initial three t0s, we have t1, then t5, etc.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So the first symbol is t0 from NT4, so NT4 must produce t0. Then NT8 produces the next symbol. Wait, no: S is NT4 and NT8, which produces two symbols. So the first two t0s could come from NT4 and NT8.\n\nBut looking at S \u2192 NT4 NT8, that would produce two symbols, but the string starts with three t0s. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no: S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would expand into two non-terminals, each of which can expand into multiple symbols.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production expands into two non-terminals, except terminals in the case of A \u2192 a. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would mean the string starts with whatever NT4 produces followed by whatever NT8 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with three t0's. So perhaps S isn't the top-level start here.\n\nWait, maybe S has a chain of productions leading to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t0, which could come from various non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check which non-terminals can produce t0. Looking at the rules, NT4 \u2192 't0', NT9 \u2192 't9' (but t9 isn't in our string), NT5 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nSo NT4, NT5, etc., can produce t0.\n\nThe first t0 in the string could come from, say, NT4 \u2192 t0. Then the next t0 could come from another production, and so on.\n\nBut the initial group S \u2192 NT4 NT8 expands into two non-terminals, which would produce two terminals each. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would give two symbols, but our string has a lot more.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt0, t0, t0, t1, t5, t0, t2, t8, t6, t7, t0, t10, t10, t0, t5, t0, t2, t3, t0, t3, t8.\n\nI'll start by trying to find a way to parse this using the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, after the initial t0, there's another t0. Let's see if the first t0 can come from a production that produces a single t0, then the second t0 from another production.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider that each production in CNF can only generate a small part. So perhaps the string is built by a series of steps where each non-terminal expands into two parts, eventually leading to the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the string is too long and not derivable from the grammar, but I need to check.\n\nWait, another approach: the given grammar has a start symbol S, which might be part of a longer chain of productions. The string doesn't contain S, so perhaps it's derived from expanding a non-terminal at some point.\n\nWait, I notice that in the string, the terminal 't1' appears. Looking at the grammar, only NT7 \u2192 't1'. So 't1' must come from NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which is a recursive production. Also, NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6, etc. Wait, no, looking back, I think I may have misread.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT11 -> NT3 NT11\n\nSo NT7 can be something that leads to 't1' via NT3.\n\nSo, when 't1' appears, it must come from NT7 \u2192 't1', but looking back, I don't see a production for NT7 \u2192 't1'. So wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me check: in the list of grammar rules, I see NT7 has:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7 (I thought that was possible, but then looking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7 (from earlier lines). So that's an expansion where NT7 can produce NT9 and another NT7. And also, NT7 -> NT11 NT6, etc. So where does t1 come from?\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rules do not include NT7 \u2192 't1'. The list includes:\n\nLooking for 't1' in the rules: I see NT1 -> 't8', NT9 -> 't9', etc. There's no production that directly gives 't1' except for NT7 \u2192 't1' in some earlier lines. Wait, in the initial list, does any rule produce 't1'?\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't1'. The only way to get 't1' is through NT7's production NT7 \u2192 't1' somewhere. Wait, no, in the list, NT7's productions are:\n\nFrom the list provided, looking carefully, the rules for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nWait, that's one, and another line: NT7 -> NT11 NT6 (is that correct?), and also the lines:\n\nNT7 -> NT3 NT11\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\n\nSo, wait, does any of the NT7's rules produce a terminal? I think I'm missing something. Maybe I made a mistake in reading. Let me list all NT7's productions again.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's see:\n\nWait, in the initial part, the user wrote down the grammar rules, but in the list, I need to find NT7's rules.\n\nLooking through:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT4 NT4, then various rules.

{"custom_id":"request-398","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string to check is: `t5 t0 t7 t9 t8 t3 t5 t5 t10 t2 t2 t5 t9 t2 t3 t6 t5 t5 t0 t7 t7`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S. In CNF, each step either consumes two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to find which productions end with terminals, as the string is composed of terminals only. I'll list the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0 t2 \u2192 but looking into NT2's productions, I think I need to see which NT2's go to terminals. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, let me check the productions correctly. Each production should be either two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking through the grammar, each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal:\n\nLooking at NT2: I see NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, but that's not a terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, wait, no, perhaps I need to parse using the symbols correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string has 21 elements. Each step in the parse will use a production to replace parts of the string.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8. So the start is using S to produce NT4 and NT8. Each of these can be non-terminals that further split.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: I see NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1, NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT5, etc. None of these directly produce a terminal yet.\n\nWait, but let me check if any NT directly produce 't's. Yes, some terminals are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', 't9', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't7', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't1'\n- NT6 \u2192 't9'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1', 't6'\n- NT11 \u2192 't3'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n\nSo each terminal is a single 't' followed by a number. For example, t5, t0, etc.\n\nI need to see if the string can be parsed step by step.\n\nStarting with the string: t5 t0 t7 t9 t8 t3 t5 t5 t10 t2 t2 t5 t9 t2 t3 t6 t5 t5 t0 t7 t7\n\nThat's a list of 21 tokens. Let me write them as a list for easier reference:\n\nIndex: 0: t5, 1: t0, 2: t7, 3: t9, 4: t8, 5: t3, 6: t5, 7: t5, 8: t10, 9: t2,10: t2,11: t5,12: t9,13: t2,14: t3,15: t6,16: t5,17: t5,18: t0,19: t7,20:t7\n\nThe start symbol S expands into NT4 and NT8. So the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, we have two parts: NT4 and NT8. Each of these will be processed as non-terminals, expanding into other parts until we reach the terminals that match the string.\n\nFirst, NT4:\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n\nSo first, NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7.\n\nNow, NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4.\n\nWait, so that's still a non-terminal. Let's try to expand further.\n\nNT3 \u2192 't5' (terminal). So NT14 \u2192 t5 NT4.\n\nSo overall, NT4 \u2192 t5 NT4 NT7.\n\nBut now, NT4 is appearing on both sides, which suggests recursion, but let's keep expanding.\n\nNow, after NT4 \u2192 t5 NT4 NT7, the next step would be to process NT4 and NT7.\n\nNT7 has productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n\nSo NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT11 NT6.\n\nNT3 is 't5', so NT7 \u2192 t5 NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, let me clarify each expansion step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if any of these NTs can produce terminals quickly.\n\nWait, maybe let's go back and see if I can find a better approach. Alternatively, maybe it's better to try to see if each token in the string can be matched step by step.\n\nBut perhaps I should try to construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to map the string to a sequence of symbols that must be generated.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that each rule in the grammar consists of two non-terminals except some that produce terminals. So each application of a production reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT4 and NT8. Then each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet me try to proceed step by step, building the list as we expand.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 21 tokens. Let's try to model this.\n\nLet's represent the current nodes as a list, starting with [S].\n\n1. S expands to NT4 and NT8 \u2192 list is [NT4, NT8]\n\nNow, process NT4 and NT8 from left to right.\n\nFirst, process NT4:\n\nNT4 can expand to several options. Let's try the first option: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7.\n\nSo after expanding, the list becomes [NT14, NT7].\n\nNow, process NT14 and NT7.\n\nNT14 has option: NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4.\n\nSo expanding NT14: [NT3, NT4].\n\nNT3 is a terminal 't5'. So now, NT3 \u2192 t5 \u2192 add t5.\n\nNow, list becomes [t5, NT4].\n\nProcess NT4 (the second one):\n\nNT4 can expand again to NT14 NT7 \u2192 [NT14, NT7].\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4 \u2192 [NT3, NT4]. NT3 \u2192 t5, so [t5, NT4].\n\nWait, this seems like an infinite loop. Maybe I need to pick a different expansion path.\n\nAlternatively, let's see what happens with NT7.\n\nAfter NT14 expands, list is [t5, NT4, NT7].\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me attempt to see what other expansions are possible.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals can produce the first token in the string: the first token is t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar for terminal t5:\n\nWhich non-terminals produce t5?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t5 (from NT4 \u2192 t5 ...)\n- NT0 \u2192 t5\n- NT14 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t9 but no t5\n- Others like NT10, NT7, etc., may not have t5.\n\nSo t5 can be produced by NT2, NT4, NT14, NT0, or any other NT that directly produces t5.\n\nIn the current string, the first token is t5. So we need to find a production where the first symbol is t5.\n\nIn our previous expansion, after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, we had [NT4, NT8]. So NT4 produces t5 via NT4 \u2192 t5 ... ?\n\nWait, let's go back. Maybe earlier I missed a production.\n\nLooking for NT4 productions that lead to t5:\n\nLooking through NT4's rules, I don't immediately see a production for NT4 \u2192 t5. So perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all possible expansions again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token is 't5' in the string. So in the parse tree, the first symbol must be produced by an NT that directly produces 't5'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t5 via NT4 \u2192t5 NT2? Wait, no. Wait, checking the given grammar:\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar as provided:\n\nThe productions for NT are listed as:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (not t5)\nNT4 \u2192 NT0 NT5 (not t5)"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-414","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t5 t10 t10 t0 t3 t9 t3 t0 t5 t0 t0 t7 t0 t0 t10 t3 t5 t0 t9 t3 t6 t0`.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That simplifies things a bit because reduction strategies in CNF might be more straightforward.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the start symbol S can derive exactly this string through a series of productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S and its productions. The grammar has three initial productions for S:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nI'll consider each possibility separately.\n\nLet me look at the first production: S -> NT4 NT8. So from S, we can expand to NT4 followed by NT8. Each of these non-terminals can then produce other non-terminals or terminals. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 produce.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see that it can branch into several options, some leading to terminals like 't0', 't5', etc. Similarly, NT8 can produce various non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut instead of getting lost in all possibilities, maybe I can approach this by working backwards from the string and see if it matches any of the productions in reverse. Alternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces a non-terminal to exactly two non-terminals. The string has 21 tokens, so if each production step reduces a non-terminal into two, then the number of steps required should be related to the structure.\n\nLet me consider the first token in the string: t5. I need to see which non-terminal can produce t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't5', and NT2 has NT2 -> 't5' as well. Also, NT9 -> 't9' but not 't5'. NT4 also has NT4 -> 't0' and 't7', so maybe NT4 can produce t5 directly.\n\nWait, let me check all non-terminals to see which can produce t5:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5', and also NT2 -> 't5' because of NT2 -> NT9 NT7, which might produce t5 if NT9 or NT7 has a production for it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals that can produce t5:\n\n1. NT4: NT4 can directly produce 't5'\n2. NT2: NT2 can produce 't5' directly through the production NT2 -> 't5' (since NT2 has a production NT2 -> 't5').\n3. NT7: Looking at NT7 -> 't7' is not 't5'; any other productions for NT7? Oh, NT7 has NT7 -> NT9 NT7, but that's a chain production that eventually can produce terms. Let me check if any of its expansions can result in 't5'. But from NT7's productions, I don't see a direct 't5'. Let me think again.\n\nWait, looking at NT7's rules:\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n- Could NT9 lead to something? NT9's productions include 't9', so perhaps NT7 might eventually produce 't9' followed by more, but not 't5'.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me list all non-terminals that can produce each terminal once.\n\nt5: produced by NT4, NT2, NT13 (since looking at the grammar, NT13 has NT13 -> 't5').\n\nWait, let me check each non-terminal:\n\n- NT4: has 't5' as a production\n- NT2: has 't5' as a production\n- NT13: looking at the rules, NT13 has NT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6', etc., but wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the production rules for NT13 are: NT13 -> NT6 NT12 and NT13 -> NT5 NT12 and NT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6'. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar provided:\n\nFor NT13, the rules are:\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n\nSo, yes, NT13 can produce t2, t4, t6 directly. But where does 't5' come from NT13?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. The initial user message shows the grammar rules:\n\nLooking again, for NT13, the rules are:\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't6'\n\nAlso, NT13's other productions are:\n\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12\n\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT10\n\nSo, NT13 doesn't have any directly producing t5. Therefore, 't5' must come from NT4, NT2, or another non-terminal that can produce t5.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first token is t5. Let's see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nNow, I need to see if the entire string can be generated by expanding S's productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the string. Let's try that.\n\nLet me start with the entire string:\n\nt5 t10 t10 t0 t3 t9 t3 t0 t5 t0 t0 t7 t0 t0 t10 t3 t5 t0 t9 t3 t6 t0\n\nWe need to split this string into pairs that match the productions.\n\nBut since it's a context-free grammar, each step can split a non-terminal into two parts, each of which must be matched by the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the reduction process. Let's try that.\n\nStart with S, which can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet's see if any of these options can lead to the string.\n\nFirst, try S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, we need to see what NT4 and NT8 can produce.\n\nIf NT4 -> t4_part and NT8 -> t8_part, then their concatenation should form the string.\n\nBut the string starts with t5, and NT4 can produce t5, but NT8 would need to start next with t10. Wait, but NT8's productions need to produce 't10'.\n\nLet me look at NT8's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8's productions are:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3 (which could produce t0 or other)\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5 (which could be t1 and t5)\n- NT8 -> 't0' and other combinations.\n\nWait, but in the first position, we have t5, which is from NT4. Then, the next token is t10, which would have to come from NT8. Let me check if NT8 can produce t10.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, do any of them produce t10?\n\nLooking at NT8's production rules:\n\n- NT8 has a production to 't0'. Wait, that's 't0', not 't10'. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT8's productions:\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar has for NT8:\n\n- NT8 -> 't6'\n- NT8 -> 't3'\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nHmm, so 't10' isn't a production for NT8 as per the given rules. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me check the initial grammar provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look again for NT8's productions. The grammar provided is:\n\n- NT8 -> 't8' [Wait, no, looking back, the user's grammar has for example:\n\nWait, the user provided a list of rules, and in the first part of the grammar, at the end, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nHere's the grammar as provided:\n\nGrammar:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13\nNT10 -> NT1 NT1\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\nNT11 -> NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

My task is to determine whether the string is generated by the given grammar and respond with 'Yes' or 'No'. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, each production indeed seems to fit this structure. For example, the production S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is straightforward. The productions like NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5 also fit because they're non-terminals on both sides of the arrow.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t5 t9 t3 t0 t2 t5 t10 t3 t1 t5 t10 t2 t3 t4 t0 t0 t0 t10 t3 t5 t0 t2`. My goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given CFG.\n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a parsing process, trying to derive the string step by step using the available grammar rules. If I can successfully parse the entire string without getting stuck, then the answer is 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.\n\nLet me start by examining the string. It's a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must consume all these tokens from left to right.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions, many of them are non-terminals that eventually derive into terminal strings. For example, NT3 \u2192 't2', NT9 \u2192 't0', etc. So, some non-terminals immediately produce a single terminal. Others have longer derivations.\n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, and the grammar has two rules for S:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n3. S \u2192 NT11 NT6 (Wait, is this correct? Let me check: the original grammar lists S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Wait, the original user input says S has three productions: S->NT4 NT8, S->NT4 NT11, S->NT1 NT2. Hmm, that's a typo in the initial problem description, but perhaps just a list of multiple options.)\n\nWait, no, in the problem description, the grammar has three S productions:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo the first step is to choose which production to apply. Since the string starts with t5, I need to see which production can derive into t5.\n\nLooking at the productions from N terminals, I see NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', etc. Specifically:\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, possible ways to get t5.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5, so let's see which non-terminal can produce it. Since our options are S \u2192 NT4 NT8, or S \u2192 NT1 NT2, etc., but the string starts with t5, so I need to see which non-terminals can generate t5.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT4 can produce t5 via NT4 \u2192 t5. Similarly, NT4 can produce t0. Also, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 t2, but that doesn't help here. \n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to use S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the NT4 can produce t5, and NT8 can produce something else.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully.\n\nLet me outline the process step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t5. So we need a production that starts with NT4 \u2192 t5, but how do we connect that into the rest of the string?\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the right path, as NT4 can produce t5, and NT8 can produce t0.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT8 has the production NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which further splits. So the path might be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Then NT6 can produce 't9', NT3 can produce 't2', but wait, in the string, after t5, the next token is t9, so maybe that's a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a parsing problem where each step of the string must match a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to construct the parse tree and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nBut considering the length of the string and the complexity, it's time-consuming, but manageable.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in CNF, any string must have a derivation whose length is 2n, where n is the number of terminal symbols, because each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, and so on, until all are terminals. Let's check.\n\nThe string has 21 terminal symbols. So if it were possible, the derivation should have 41 steps (since 1 step produces 2, 2 steps 4, etc., so for 21, it's 2*21 -1 = 41. But wait, no: in CNF, each production is binary, so each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one until you get to the start symbol, but the number of steps is equal to the number of terminals minus 1. So for 21 terminals, it's 20 steps. I'm not sure, perhaps that's a detour.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the possible reductions and see if I can match the string.\n\nLet me consider the first symbol t5. So we need the string to start with a production that generates t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can derive into t5? Let's see:\n\n- NT4 can derive t5 because NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is applicable, because S can produce NT4 NT8.\n\nSo first, apply S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo NT4 will produce t5, and NT8 will produce t0, as the next symbol is t9, but wait, after t5 is t9, so perhaps I have to consider the next symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to write down the steps.\n\nWait, the string is: t5 t9 t3 t0 t2 t5 t10 t3 t1 t5 t10 t2 t3 t4 t0 t0 t0 t10 t3 t5 t0 t2.\n\nHmm. Let me number them from 0 to 20.\n\n0: t5\n\n1: t9\n\n2: t3\n\n3: t0\n\n4: t2\n\n5: t5\n\n6: t10\n\n7: t3\n\n8: t1\n\n9: t5\n\n10: t10\n\n11: t2\n\n12: t3\n\n13: t4\n\n14: t0\n\n15: t0\n\n16: t0\n\n17: t10\n\n18: t3\n\n19: t5\n\n20: t0\n\n21: t2\n\nWait, let me count that: 22 symbols, so from 0 to 21. So 22 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted: the string provided is:\n\nt5, t9, t3, t0, t2, t5, t10, t3, t1, t5, t10, t2, t3, t4, t0, t0, t0, t10, t3, t5, t0, t2.\n\nThat's 22 symbols, indexes 0 to 21.\n\nSo, to parse this, we start with the entire string and reduce it down step by step.\n\nBut since it's time-consuming, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if any parts of the string are incompatible with the grammar.\n\nWait, one initial issue: t0 appears multiple times, but the grammar has certain rules. For example, NT9 \u2192 t0. Maybe there's a structure that allows t0 to be in the middle.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check each step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the options in the grammar will not allow certain sequences.\n\nWait, looking at the NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, which becomes, perhaps, t0 (from NT9) and t2 (from NT13 \u2192 't2')? Or maybe others.\n\nAnother thought: Let's look at the start symbol S, which can produce nt4 nt8, or other possibilities. The string starts with t5, which NT4 can produce, so perhaps that's the first step.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, NT4 can either be a terminal (if it has a production to a single terminal) or a further expansion. Looking at the productions for NT4:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nAh, so NT4 can produce either t0 or t5 as a single terminal. Since the string starts with t5, that's the choice.

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex with many productions, and the string is quite long. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar to keep track of all the productions and the string to be checked. The string is: `t10 t10 t5 t5 t5 t5 t2 t0 t5 t0 t0 t7 t9 t0 t0 t0 t0 t6 t0 t0 t0 t5 t2`. I notice that each token is separated by a space, so each 't' followed by a number represents a single symbol, right? So, for example, 't10' is one symbol, not 't' repeated 10 times.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I see that it's in CNF, meaning each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string consists of terminals (like 't0', 't1', etc.) and non-terminals. \n\nThe goal is to derive the string using these productions. Since the string is made up of terminals, I'll need to find a way to apply productions that eventually produce these terminals. The strategy here is probably to start from the start symbol S and see if we can reach the given string through a series of derivations.\n\nThe grammar has S as the start symbol. The first step is to see what S can produce. From the grammar, S can be NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but wait, in the given string, the first few tokens are 't10 t10 t5...', which don't match S directly because S's immediate productions don't start with t10. \n\nWait, let me correct that. The string starts with 't10 t10', but the S productions don't directly produce t10. Let me check the productions again. Looking for NT10, since 't10' appears twice at the start, so maybe NT10 can produce 't10'? Let's look at NT10's productions. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT10 can produce 't1' (from NT10-> 't1'), but that's for 't1', not 't10'. Wait, no. Looking at the NT10 productions, I see NT10 -> 't1' and NT10-> 't6'. So that doesn't produce 't10' directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar.\n\nLet me look again: NT10's productions are NT10 -> 't1' and NT10 -> 't6'. So how does 't10' get into the string? That seems confusing because NT10 and NT1 are different non-terminals. That suggests that maybe 't10' is produced by another non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some NTs produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT3 -> 't2', NT5->'t0', etc. Perhaps 't10' is produced by another non-terminal, but I don't see any directly. Let me check the grammar again for all productions that have 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT7 -> 't0', NT8->'t0', NT9->'t0', NT5->'t0', NT4->'t0', NT2->'t2', NT1->'t8', NT10->'t1', NT7->'t10'\u2014wait, no, in the grammar, NT7 has a production NT7-> 't0', but where is 't10'?

Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for where NT13 is defined. Here's the relevant part:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\n\nWait, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Let me list them:\n\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n\n- NT2->'t2'\n\n- NT1->'t8'\n\n- NT10->'t1'\n\n- NT13->'t6'\n\nWait, wait, no.

All the 't' terms are up to 't5', except possibly I missed something.\n\nWait, in NT8: NT8->'t6'NT3, but that is a production with a terminal and another non-terminal. Wait, no, in the production NT8->'t6' is not present. Wait, looking at the grammar, I think I might have made a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, let's list all the 't' productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n\n- NT13->'t2', 't4', 't5', 't6'\n\n- NT12-> not a terminal, I think it's a non-terminal because NT12 has multiple productions.\n\n- NT7->'t0'\n\n- NT8->'t0'\n\n- NT9->'t0'\n\n- NT4->'t0'\n\n- NT2->'t2'\n\n- NT1->'t8'\n\n- NT10->'t1'\n\n- Other NTs might have 't' in their productions.\n\nWait, looking again, I think maybe NT13 can produce 't10'? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the grammar:\n\nNT13 has productions:\n\n- NT13-> 't2'\n\n- NT13-> 't4'\n\n- NT13-> 't5'\n\n- NT13-> 't6'\n\nSo that's it. No 't10' production from NT13. Similarly, let's check NT7: NT7->'t0', so no.\n\nWait, where is 't10' coming from?

The string is: `t7 t0 t5 t0 t3 t7 t7 t0 t5 t9 t0 t5 t8 t6 t9 t9 t9 t10 t3 t4 t7 t10 t7`.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), so each production has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. The grammar starts with S and has various non-terminals that eventually produce terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nMy approach will be to work backward from the string, trying to see if I can derive it using the grammar rules. I'll group the string into parts that correspond to the possible rules and check if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's start by splitting the string into manageable parts:\n\n1. The entire string is a sequence of 't's and 't8's, etc. Looking at the starts, S can produce NT4 NT8, or other combinations. The start symbol S goes to either NT4 NT8 or other options. Since the string starts with t7, which is produced by NT7, I should look for rules that produce t7.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT10\n- NT13 -> 't4', 't6', 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't0', 't10', 't9'\n- NT7 -> 't0', 't7', etc.\n\nWait, looking more closely, NT7 has a production NT7 -> NT7 NT9, which suggests recursion because NT7 can produce itself. Also, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't0', 't5', or 't7'.\n\nSo, the first token is t7. The rule that produces t7 is NT7 -> 't7'. So, the first part of the string could be produced by NT7.\n\nNow, NT7 has the productions:\n\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT7 -> 't7'\n- Also, earlier in the list, NT7 -> NT11 NT6, NT7 -> NT12 NT9, etc.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe NT7 productions are:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\n\nAnd also later:\n\nNT7 -> NT7 NT9\n\nWait, I see in the list:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\n\nAlso, there are more rules:\n\nLooking at the full list, I see:\n\nYes, several NT7 rules:\n\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT9\n\nWait, but the first token is t7, so either NT7 -> 't7' or via recursion. But looking back, in the grammar, the only terminal for NT7 is 't7', so to produce 't7', it's directly that production. So the string must start with NT7 -> 't7', so the first token is t7.\n\nNow, after t7, what follows? The next token is t0, which is produced by NT0. Let's see, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT0 can produce:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT0 has several productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT10\n\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT1\n\n- Also, NT10 is defined as 't1' (NT10 -> 't1')\n\nSo, if the first part is t7, then the next part is t0. So, NT0 must be responsible for that t0, which could come from NT0 -> 't0' or from a production that eventually leads to t0. But looking at the grammar, do we have a rule that produces t0 directly?\n\nLooking through the terminals, NT9 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't0' and 't5', etc. Wait, for NT0, let's see:\n\nWait, NT0's productions are:\n\nWT8 -> NT14 NT7 \u2192 no, that's not NT0.\n\nLooking back, let me list the non-terminals and their productions correctly:\n\nLooking for NT0 in the grammar:\n\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT13\n\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT1\n\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n\n- NT8 -> 't6', 't3'\n\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n\nWait, earlier analysis might have been off.

Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nFirst, S can go to NT4 NT8 or various other combinations.\n\nLooking for NT0, scrolling through:\n\nYes, here's NT0:\n\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT1\n\nWait, but there's more:\n\nWait, no, I think the original grammar has:\n\nNT0 is part of several productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, here are the lines starting with NT0:\n\n- NT0-> NT14 NT13\n\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\n- NT0-> NT3 NT1\n\nWait, but that's not correct because when I look through all 87 lines, I see several lines for NT0, but perhaps I miscounted.

For example, looking at the user's transcription:\n\nIt's better to perhaps list all NT0 productions as there are several. Wait, the user's grammar is long, but let me check.\n\nHere's the full list of NT0 rules:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nLine 1: S-> Nt4 Nt8\nLine 2: S-> NT4 NT11\nLine 3: S-> NT1 NT2\n\nThen, lines 4-35 are various NTx productions, including NT0:\n\n- Line 16: NT0-> NT14 NT13\n- Line 17: NT0-> NT8 NT8\n- Line 18: NT0-> NT3 NT1\n- Line 20: NT0-> NT2 NT1\nWait, no, line 20 is NT10-> 't1'.\n\nWait, line 20 is NT10-> 't1', so looking for NT0 lines:\n\nHere are the NT0 lines:\n\n1. NT0-> NT14 NT13\n2. NT0-> NT8 NT8\n3. NT0-> NT3 NT1\n4. NT0-> NT10 NT10\n5. NT0-> NT13 NT2\n6. NT0-> NT5 NT10\n7. NT0-> NT2 NT1\n8. ... Wait, no, perhaps more.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, most of them seem to follow this pattern, especially since every left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But I notice some have three symbols, like NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 NT11, wait no, actually looking again, maybe I misread. Wait, no, in the grammar given, the productions like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 and others have only two symbols on the RHS. So it's in CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: t5 t5 t5 t0 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t3 t5 t0 t0 t7 t0 t5 t9 t3 t2 t7 t0 t2 t0.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the string correctly: \"t5 t5 t5 t0 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3 t0 t3 t5 t0 t0 t7 t0 t5 t9 t3 t2 t7 t0 t2 t0\". Yes, that's 21 tokens separated by spaces. So the string is 21 symbols, all terminals.\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, note that S can be rewritten in a few ways:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nEach production leads to two non-terminals, and these non-terminals eventually derive to terminal symbols or other non-terminals. So, the string must be formed by expanding these non-terminals step by step until all are terminals, matching the given string.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the string is quite long, maybe I can split it into parts and see if each part can be derived from one of the productions.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t5 t5 t5 t0...\n\nI wonder if these could come from the productions leading to t5. Let's look at all the productions that result in t5. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n- NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6 (wait, that's not ending in a terminal)\n- Wait, some of these have two terminals. Let me check the productions that generate terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n- NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT7 \u2192 NT10 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5, t7\n- NT1 \u2192 t8, t14, t13, t9\n- NT0 \u2192 t10, t4, t13, etc.\n- So, t5 comes from NT4 or NT1 or NT2, etc.\n\nWait, looking carefully, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5, t7\n- NT1 \u2192 t8, etc.\n\nSo, for the first symbol t5, could it come from NT4 or NT1 or NT2.\n\nLet me check the possible productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo the entire string must be a combination of paths starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the first production S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so the string must start with whatever NT4 and NT8 derive to.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT4 NT11 would start with NT4 and then NT11.\n\nAnd S \u2192 NT1 NT2 would start with NT1 and NT2.\n\nSo the first symbol is t5, which comes from NT4 \u2192 t5, or from NT2 \u2192 t5.\n\nIf the first token is t5, it could be via NT4 or NT2.\n\nLet's explore both options.\n\nFirst, assuming the first symbol comes from NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo NT4 can be t5, and then we have to see what's next. But to get t5, NT4 could be either using the production NT4 \u2192 t5 or NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT7.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- Also, NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT7.\n\nSo, if we choose NT4 \u2192 t5, that's t5, and then the next symbol is t5 again, so we need to see how the next symbols can be generated.\n\nWait, the string after the first t5 is another t5, so maybe the next part is also t5 from another production.\n\nAlternatively, if the first symbol comes from NT2 \u2192 t5, but let's first see if we can use NT4 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo let me consider the first part as S \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 \u2192 t5, and then NT8.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t5, but then the next is another t5, so maybe the production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 \u2192 t5, and then NT8 needs to generate the rest of the string starting with another t5.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nI think a better approach is to model this as a tree and see if the symbols can be derived. But since I may get lost, let me try a recursive approach.\n\nFirst, check if the entire string can be generated by S.\n\nThe first symbol is t5, so let's look at which productions can derive t5.\n\nAs per the grammar:\n\n- NT4 can produce t5 via NT4 \u2192 t5 (1 production). Alternatively, it can produce t0, or go further to other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 can produce t5 via NT2 \u2192 t5 (another production). Wait, looking back, yes, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t5 (wait, no, looking back: it's defined as NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT1, etc.). Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT2 has several rules, but I don't see one directly ending with t5. Wait, let me check:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 something? Wait, no. Let me go through the NT2 productions:\n\nWait, looking carefully:\n\nNT2 has productions like:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 Wait, no, that's NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2. So maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT2 productions are as follows:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 No, but wait, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 No, that's another production.\nWait, I might be confused. Let me list all NT2 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, here are the NT2 rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 Hmm, no, that's NT5.\nWait, looking again: actually, the NT2 rules are defined as:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 Wait, no, NT5 is a non-terminal, not NT2. Let me check all the NT2 rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me scan through all the production rules and list the ones starting with NT2:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 No, but looking at NT5's rules, that's a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up because the grammar has overlapping non-terminals. Maybe I should structure the grammar's non-terminals properly.\n\nSo, the NT2 (Non-Terminal 2) has the following productions:\n\nLooking again, here are all the production rules that start with NT2:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 ... wait, does NT2 have a production leading to t5?

{"custom_id":"request-453","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminal symbols directly. All right, so first, I need to look at the grammar and the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t10 t0 t10 t5 t0 t7 t0 t10 t5 t0 t4 t8 t2 t5 t8 t0 t7 t10 t10 t3 t2 t10 t4`.\n\nLet me see if I can parse this string by following the rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is given, I can try to break down the string into parts that match the rules.\n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S, which can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So, S -> NT4 NT8 or S -> NT4 NT11 or S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0. I need to find a production that can generate t0. Looking at the productions, I see that NT9 -> 't0' and NT10 -> 't1', but t1 is not the start.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminals. So, NT3 -> 't5', NT10 -> 't1', NT13 -> 't4', NT13 -> 't6', NT9 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't5', NT2 -> 't2', NT10 -> 't6', etc.\n\nSo, to get t0, possible NTs that generate t0 are NT9 and NT4. Let me look at S again. S can generate NT4 followed by another term. If S starts with NT4, then the first symbol could be t0 if NT4 produces t0 or t5. Wait, NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5'. So, the first production from S might involve NT4.\n\nThe string starts with t0. Let's assume the first component is NT4 -> 't0'. So, the next part of the string should start with the second part of S's production. S can produce NT8, NT11, or NT2.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t10 ... So after t0, the next is t10. So, if the first S production is NT4 -> 't0', then the second part should be either NT8, NT11, or NT2.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t0 is t10. So, the second part should be something that generates t10. Let me see which NTs produce t10.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT13 -> 't6' and 't4'; NT10 -> 't1' and 't6'; what about NT12? Wait, looking at the productions, I don't see NT12 directly linked to t10. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's see. Wait, no. Let me check all the productions again. The NTs that can produce t10 are NT9 -> 't10' and NT10 -> 't1' and 't6'. Oh, so NT9 produces t10, and NT10 produces t1 and t6. So, to get t10, we can have NT9 or perhaps other NTs that produce t10 via intermediate steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, starting with S.\n\nSo, the string is:\n\nt0 t10 t0 t10 t5 t0 t7 t0 t10 t5 t0 t4 t8 t2 t5 t8 t0 t7 t10 t10 t3 t2 t10 t4.\n\nLet me try to find a possible breakdown.\n\nStarting with S, which can be NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nSuppose S is NT4 NT8.\n\nThen, the first symbol should be t0, which is produced by NT4 as either 't0' or 't5'. So, NT4 is 't0', taking the first t0.\n\nThen, the next part should be the result of NT8.\n\nLooking at the next symbol, after t0 is t10, so next is t10. So, NT8 must produce t10 or something that can lead to it. Wait, looking at NT8's productions: NT8 -> NT6 NT3, and NT8 also appears in other productions, maybe.\n\nWait, let me look for NT8 productions. Yes, in the grammar, S can produce NT8, and in one production of NT8, it's NT6 NT3.\n\nWait, but NT6's productions: looking at the grammar, NT6 -> NT9 NT11. Hmm, so that's getting more complex.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by working backwards, starting from the right of the string and see if I can find a derivation.\n\nBut maybe let's try a different approach. Let's consider that each step of the derivation produces two symbols at a time, since every production is from a non-terminal to two non-terminals, except for the terminals.\n\nBut that might complicate things because the string has 24 symbols, so 24 steps? No, that's unclear.\n\nPerhaps I should try to see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see which non-terminals can produce the starting symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t0.\n\nSo, looking for NTs that can produce t0: NT9 and NT4.\n\nIf I take S -> NT4 NT8, then NT4 produces t0, so the first symbol is t0, and then the second part is NT8.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t10. So, NT8 must generate t10 or something that can generate t10.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 also appears in other productions like NT0 -> NT8 NT8, but wait, looking again, I don't see NT8 with other symbols; checking, no, in the grammar S is the start, and NT8's productions are mainly NT6 NT3.\n\nSo, NT8 -> NT6 NT3.\n\nThen, NT6 can produce NT9 NT11.\n\nSo, NT8 would expand into NT6 NT3, which would then expand into NT9 NT11 NT3.\n\nThen, NT9 can produce 't0' or others. Wait, NT9 -> 't0', 't10', or other.\n\nWait, so after S -> NT4 NT8, then NT8 becomes NT6 NT3.\n\nSo, the sequence would be t0 (from NT4), then NT6, which is t9, then NT11, which is?\n\nWait, but actually, the string is t0 t10 t0 t10 t5 t0 t7 t0 t10 t5 t0 t4 t8 t2 t5 t8 t0 t7 t10 t10 t3 t2 t10 t4.\n\nSo, after the initial t0 (from NT4), what's next is t10. So, perhaps I'm wrong in choosing S -> NT4 NT8. Maybe it's better to try a different production.\n\nWait, another production of S is S -> NT1 NT2. Let me see. If S is NT1 NT2, then NT1 produces perhaps 't8' and NT2 can produce t2. So, t8 t2, but the string starts with t0, so that's not matching the first symbol. So, that's out.\n\nAnother production of S is NT4 NT11. So, NT4 -> 't0' and NT11. So, the first symbol is t0, then NT11. Now, NT11's productions: looking back, NT11 can produce NT8 NT5 or NT3 NT11.\n\nSo, NT11 -> NT8 NT5 or NT3 NT11.\n\nNow, the second symbol in the string is t10, so NT11 needs to produce t10 as part of its expansion.\n\nLet me see: if NT11 is NT8 NT5, then NT8 can produce t6 NT3, and NT5 can produce t9 or other. Hmm, this seems getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if I can parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see which non-terminals can generate the string.\n\nThe first symbol is t0, which can come from NT4 or NT9. Let me assume it's NT4.\n\nSo, S -> NT4 NT8. NT4 -> 't0', so the first symbol is t0.\n\nNow, the next symbols are t10 t0 ...\n\nSo, the second part is the result of NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: NT8 -> NT6 NT3.\n\nSo, the next part will be t6 t3. But the next symbol is t10, so that's not matching.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-477","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t5 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t0 t10 t10 t10 t10 t5 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t9 t2 t5 t5`. That's a lot of tokens, over 21 tokens. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S. Looking at the start productions:\n\nS can go to NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So S is broken down into combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nEach of those non-terminals (NT1, NT4, NT8, NT11, etc.) eventually produce terminal symbols like 't5', 't0', etc. Each non-terminal has a series of productions that lead to combinations of other non-terminals, which in the end produce the terminals.\n\nMy approach is to try to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, it can be broken into two non-terminals. Looking at the string, which is a series of tokens, each separated by spaces. So the string is a concatenation of these tokens, meaning the derivation must result in each token being produced exactly once.\n\nI'm wondering if the string is long enough and whether the grammar can handle generating it. Let's see the steps:\n\n1. Start with S. S can split into NT4 NT8. Let's try that first. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now we have two parts, NT4 and NT8. \n\nNext, I need to see how NT4 and NT8 can be expanded. Looking at NT4, let's check its productions. From the grammar, NT4 can produce NT7 NT14, NT14 NT7, or 't0', or 't5', or 't5' again. Wait, in the list of NT4, there are multiple productions: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4, etc. Oh, also, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5'.\n\nHmm, but in the string, the first token is 't5', so maybe NT4 produces 't5' and NT8 produces the rest.\n\nWait, let's try to see: The string starts with t5, so maybe NT4 produces 't5' and the rest of the string is produced by NT8. \n\nWait, but NT4 has production rules, let's list them:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT4 has:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT14 \u2192 NT4 NT14\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT1\nAnd also, in NT4, there are terminal productions:\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, from NT4, it can produce directly 't0', 't5', or continue further.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't5', so perhaps NT4 \u2192 't5', which would match, leaving the rest of the string to be generated by NT8.\n\nSo that's promising. So now we need to see if NT8 can generate the rest of the string: t0 t10 t4 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t0 t10 t10 t10 t10 t5 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t9 t2 t5.\n\nWait, but after 't5', the next token would be 't0', but the remaining string would be t0 t10... etc., which needs to be generated by NT8.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, S can also produce NT4 NT11 and NT1 NT2. But since S is the start symbol, if it's using S \u2192 NT4 NT8, that's the path we're taking.\n\nSo NT8 now has to generate the next part of the string starting after 't5'. But wait, actually, the entire left side is NT4 and the right side is NT8. So after NT4 produces 't5', NT8 needs to generate the entire remaining part of the string: t0 t10 t4 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t0 t10 t10 t10 t10 t5 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t9 t2 t5.\n\nWait, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The entire string is the concatenation of the symbols produced by S. So when we have S \u2192 NT4 NT8, each of NT4 and NT8 must produce a sequence of terminals, and the concatenation of those sequences must match the given string.\n\nSo if NT4 produces 't5', then NT8 must produce the remaining tokens: t0 t10 t4 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t0 t10 t10 t10 t10 t5 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t9 t2 t5.\n\nWait, but that's 21 tokens? Let me count:\n\nThe string is: t5 t0 t10 t4 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t0 t10 t10 t10 t10 t5 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t9 t2 t5.\n\nWait, no, I'm counting the number of tokens: let's see, it's separated into 21 tokens. So the first token is 't5', second 't0', third 't10', etc., up to 21 tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount: \n\n1: t5\n\n2: t0\n\n3: t10\n\n4: t4\n\n5: t0\n\n6: t0\n\n7: t0\n\n8: t1\n\n9: t3\n\n10: t4\n\n11: t0\n\n12: t10\n\n13: t10\n\n14: t10\n\n15: t10\n\n16: t5\n\n17: t5\n\n18: t8\n\n19: t0\n\n20: t7\n\n21: t0\n\n22: t9\n\n23: t2\n\n24: t5\n\nWait, that's 24 tokens. Hmm, I must have miscounted earlier. But the string seems to have 24 tokens. So S divides into NT4 and NT8, with each producing some sequence of terminals.\n\nBut perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the production to use.\n\nSo let's try this path: Start with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNT4 produces 't5' (a terminal), so that's one token. Now we need NT8 to produce the next 23 tokens.\n\nSo the remaining string is: t0 t10 t4 t0 t0 t0 t1 t3 t4 t0 t10 t10 t10 t10 t5 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t9 t2 t5.\n\nLooking at NT8, what can it produce? Looking back at the grammar, NT8 can produce NT6 NT3, NT5 NT2, etc. Let's see:\n\nFrom the list, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13, and others.\n\nBut wait, let's look for NT8's production rules in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nI think I might have listed all the NT8 rules:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT10 NT10\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n\nSo multiple options for NT8. \n\nLet's see the next token after 't5' is 't0', which is the second token in the entire string. But in the left part, S is broken into NT4 (which produced 't5') and NT8, which needs to produce all the remaining tokens. So the first token is 't5' from NT4, then NT8's first token is 't0', which is the second in the string.\n\nLooking at NT8's possible first steps: for NT8, can it produce 't0'? Let's check the productions.\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't2', and other NT3 rules: Let's look at NT3.\n\nLooking up NT3's productions: NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1, NT3 \u2192 't2', and others. So NT3 can produce 't2' directly.\n\nWait, maybe we should track the entire derivation step by step, trying to see if we can match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach or constructing a parse tree would help, but that's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. Each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t7 t0 t0 t5 t2 t0 t10 t5 t3 t5 t0 t6 t0 t9 t0 t2 t10 t3 t1 t5 t0 t7 t0 t9 t7`.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S can produce a combination of NTs leading to terminals. From the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S consists of two NTs. The string starts with t7, which is a terminal. I'll need to see which production leads to t7.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I notice NT13 \u2192 't2', NT7 \u2192 't10', etc. Specifically, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 t2. So if the string starts with t7, which might be from NT7 \u2192 t7. Let me check NT7 productions.\n\nLooking at NT7, one of its productions is NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT10, but elsewhere, there's NT7 \u2192 't10' and another NT7 \u2192 't0' via some other routes. Wait, no\u2014the productions for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\nNT7 -> NT3 NT11\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the full grammar, I see NT7 has some rules. Hmm, and also, NT4 \u2192 t7 is a direct production. So from NT4, you can directly get t7 or t0 or t5 via other rules.\n\nWait, let me look again. The user's grammar has several NTs with terminal productions.\n\nWait, checking NTs:\n\nNT4's productions include:\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has:\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- Also, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4, but the strings are getting longer, but since we have t2 in the string, maybe this is the path.\n\nBut the string starts with t7, which could come from NT4's t7.\n\nSo, first, the string starts with t7. So the first part of the string is generated by S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and NT4 \u2192 t7.\n\nSo, so far, the string begins with t7, which is matched by NT4 \u2192 t7.\n\nNow, after that, we need to match the rest of the string with the second part of S's production. So S can be NT4 and NT8. So after t7, the next part is generated by NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8, the productions are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t6 t3\nNT8 \u2192 t0 t5\nNT8 \u2192 t6 t3\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t6 t3\nNT8 \u2192 nt6 \u2192 't6'\nWait, the actual productions are:\n\nWait, the user's grammar lists:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 nt6 nt3\n- NT8 \u2192 nt6 nt3\n- NT8 \u2192 nt6 nt3\nAnd others? Let me verify.\n\nWait, the user's grammar section includes:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t6 nt3\nNT8 \u2192 t0 nt5\nNT8 \u2192 t6 nt3\nWait, in the user's message, under NT8:\n\nNT8 -> t6 nt3\nNT8 -> t0 t5\nNT8 -> t6 nt3\nPlus any others? Let me check.\n\nYes:\n\nNT8 has:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 nt3\n- NT8 \u2192 t0 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t6 nt3\nAnd more, perhaps via other NTs. So for NT8, the direct terminals are t6 t3 or t0 t5.\n\nLooking at the string after t7, the next token is t0, then t0, t5, etc.\n\nSo after t7, the next part is NT8. But NT8 must produce a sequence that starts with t0 t5 or t6 t3.\n\nWait, the second part of the string after t7 is t0. So if NT8 is generating t0, that would be from a production like NT8 \u2192 t0 t5, which would produce t0 followed by t5. But in the string, after t7 comes t0, so perhaps that's the path.\n\nSo let's assume that after t7, we have t0, which could come from NT8 \u2192 t0 t5.\n\nSo the next in the string is t0, then t0, t5, etc.\n\nWait, the string is: t7 t0 t0 t5 t2 t0 t10 t5 t3 t5 t0 t6 t0 t9 t0 t2 t10 t3 t1 t5 t0 t7 t0 t9 t7.\n\nSo after t7, t0, t0, t5, t2, etc.\n\nSo let's see.\n\nAssume S \u2192 NT4 NT8, so first t7, then NT8.\n\nSo after t7, the NT8 production must generate the rest of the string starting from t0.\n\nAssuming NT8 \u2192 t0 t5 would generate t0 t5. Let's see:\n\nt7 (from NT4 \u2192 t7)\n\nThen, NT8 \u2192 t0 t5, so next tokens would be t0 t5.\n\nBut the string has t7 followed by t0, t0, t5, which is t0, then t0, then t5.\n\nWait, that's not matching. If NT8 \u2192 t0 t5, the first token after t7 would be t0, but that's correct. Then the next token would be t5 if NT8 \u2192 t0 t5 leads to t5 after t0. But the next token after that is t0 again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The first token is t7. This must come from NT4 \u2192 t7.\n\n2. The second token is t0. Now, NT8 must produce t0. Looking at NT8's productions, is there a production that starts with t0?\n\nYes: NT8 \u2192 t0 t5. So when NT8 uses this production, the first terminal is t0.\n\nSo after t7, the next token is t0, which is the t0 in t0 t5.\n\n3. Next, the string has t0 again. So after t0, we need another t0. But NT8's production t0 t5 produces t0 followed by t5. So the next token should be t5, but here after t0 that is the second token, the next is another t0.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that perhaps NT8 isn't the right path after t7, because after t0 comes t0, not t5. Alternatively, maybe there's a different production for NT8 that leads to something else.\n\nWait, looking at NT8's other productions: Also, NT8 can generate t6 nt3 (t6 t3) and other times nt6 nt3 (same as t6 t3), and t0 t5.\n\nSo if NT8 \u2192 t0 t5, then the first token would be t0, the second t5.\n\nIn our string, after the first t7, the next token is t0, then another t0, then t5. So after t0 comes another t0, which isn't consistent with NT8 \u2192 t0 t5, which would produce t0 followed by t5, but here we have t0 followed by t0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second part of S could be NT8 producing something else. Wait, maybe there's a way after t7, the next token is t0, then t0 is from another NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong, and S isn't S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Or perhaps after the first t7, the next non-terminal leads to the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that S could produce NT1 NT2 as well. So let's see.\n\nSo after t7, perhaps the next part is t0, t0, t5,..., but that might not fit NT2.\n\nLooking at NT2, which is a non-terminal. Its productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2\nNT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n\nSo NT2 can directly produce t2 or recursively produce more NT2s.\n\nLooking at the string, after t7, the next token is t0, then another t0, then t5. So perhaps after t7, the next is t0, which could come from NT4 \u2192 t0 via NT4 \u2192 t0 nt5.

Let me see which non-terminals produce 't2'. Scanning through the productions, I see NT2 has multiple 't2' productions: NT2 -> 't2', NT2->'t4', NT2->'t5', and others. Specifically, NT2 -> 't2' is the one we need to look at for the initial 't2'.\n\nSo, the first production must be S -> NT4 NT8 or S-> NT4 NT11 or etc. Wait, let me check what leads to 't2'. Looking at the grammar, 't2' is a terminal, so the derivation should end at that point. Let me think about the paths that can lead to 't2'.\n\nSince the string starts with t2, let's see if it can come from NT2. So, the derivation would start with S \u2192 NT2 NT2 or something else. Wait, what are the productions for S? The initial productions are S -> NT4 NT8, S-> NT4 NT11, S-> NT1 NT2. So S can't produce NT2 directly. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the grammar again. Yes, the only S productions are the ones I mentioned. So S can't become NT2 NT2 directly. Therefore, the string can't start with 't2' because S can't produce 't2' on its own. So the string starts with t2, which requires the first step to produce something that can terminate into t2, but S can't do that. So that's a red flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the first step is S -> NT1 NT2, and then NT1 and NT2 can produce something else. But wait, NT1 can produce NT9 NT13, which then can produce more things. But how do we get t2 from there?\n\nWait, let me try to see. If S starts with NT1 NT2, then NT1 -> NT9 NT13 and NT2 -> 't2'. That might work. But then how does NT9 and NT13 derive into t0, t9, etc. Let me map this out.\n\nLet's say the first step is S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Then, NT2 immediately produces 't2', which is good. Now, NT1 needs to be derived into the rest of the string. So after 't2', we have 't0 t9 t10 ...'. So the next part is 't0', which must come from NT1's derivation.\n\nLooking at NT1, its productions are NT11 NT6, NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, and NT1 also has NT9 NT13 and others. Wait, wait, looking back, NT1 has productions like NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13, NT1 -> NT12 NT8, etc. So maybe NT1 can produce a sequence that starts with 't0'.\n\nLooking closer, NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. NT9 is a non-terminal. Its production includes 't0' as one option: NT9 -> 't0'. But wait, looking back, NT9 -> 't0' is correct. So if NT9 produces 't0', that's good.\n\nSo let's say NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13. Then, NT9 produces 't0', and NT13 can produce 't9' or other things. Wait, but the next element after 't0' is 't9', so perhaps NT13 produces 't9' or a sequence that gets us to 't9'.\n\nWait, let me think more clearly. The string after 't2' is 't0 t9 t10 t0 ...'. So after 't2', we have 't0', then 't9', etc. So maybe the sequence is after 't2' comes 't0' and then 't9 t10...'.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible derivation path:\n\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2 (from S's production)\nNT2 \u2192 't2' (so that's the first token in the string)\nNow, we need to derive the remaining string: 't0 t9 t10 t0 ...'\n\nSo NT1 needs to expand into something that produces 't0' followed by the rest. From NT1's productions:\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\n\nThat gives us 't0' from NT1. Now, what's left is NT13. So after 't0', we need to derive 't9 t10 t0 ...'\n\nSo NT13's production paths: looking at the grammar, NT13 has several options. For example, NT13 \u2192 NT6 NT10, or NT5 NT12, or others. Hmm, not sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking deeper, NT13 has the following productions:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT13 -> NT9 NT7\nOther possibilities might be more complex, but these are some options.\n\nSo after NT13, let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12.\n\nNT5's productions: NT5 -> NT10 NT2, etc. But wait, looking at the grammar, NT5 -> NT10 NT2 is not exactly correct, it's NT5 -> NT9 NT2. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT5:\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\nYes. So NT5 can be NT9 NT2 or other things?\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\nYes.\n\nSo NT5 produces NT9 NT2. So if NT5 -> NT9 NT2, then NT9 is a terminal (as per NT9 -> 't0' and others). But wait, in the remaining string after 't0' is 't9', so maybe this is the path.\n\nAlternatively, NT13 could produce NT6 NT10. Let's see NT6.\n\nNT6's productions: NT6 -> NT9 NT11, NT6 -> NT11 NT6, etc. This might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nAfter the first 't2', NT1 expands to NT9 NT13.\n\n- NT9 produces 't0' (so that's the second token).\n- Now, NT13 needs to produce a string starting with 't9 t10 ...'.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions, perhaps NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12. Let's track that.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12.\n\nNow, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2. So NT5 becomes 't0' (since NT9 \u2192 't0') and NT2 \u2192 't2'. So after NT5, we get 't0 t2', but in the string after 't0' it's 't9 t10 ...', not 't2', so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT13 \u2192 NT6 NT10.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11. So that would produce 't0' (from NT9) and NT11. Then NT11 has productions like NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, and so on.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should use a top-down parsing method with the given string and see if it can be reduced step by step.\n\nLet's represent the string as a list: ['t2', 't0', 't9', 't10', 't0', 't2', 't0', 't9', 't4', 't9', 't0', 't10', 't0', 't6', 't0', 't2', 't7', 't0', 't2', 't0', 't6', 't7', 't10', 't0', 't1', 't2']\n\nStart with the entire string. Let's see which parts can be matched by any production rule starting with terminals.\n\nThe first symbol is 't2', which we can get from NT2. So the first production is possibly S \u2192 NT1 NT2, since NT2 can produce 't2'.\n\nSo we can take S and expand"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar and a string that I need to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to understand how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. CNF means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So each production is a binary split or a terminal. This makes the grammar suitable for a recursive descent parser, which is helpful but maybe not the quickest way for this.\n\nThe string to check is: `t2 t5 t0 t3 t9 t2 t0 t10 t5 t5 t7 t10 t2 t8 t10 t4 t6 t6 t0 t1 t10 t0 t0 t8 t0 t7`.\n\nWow, that's a lot of terminals. I need to see if the grammar can derive this string.\n\nI think the best way is to try and parse the string using the grammar. That might be tedious, but perhaps manageable. Alternatively, maybe I can look for patterns in the grammar that might help me.\n\nLet me list out the productions and terminals to see if there's any pattern.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce two NT symbols followed by another NT and a number. Wait, looking again, S has three productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S is the top-level symbol, and each production is two NTs followed by some. Then each NT symbol can produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nLet me list all the NTs:\n\nNT1, NT2, NT4, NT5, NT7, NT9, NT10, NT11, NT12, NT13, NT14, NT0, NT3, NT6, NT8\n\nEach of these have productions that either split into two NTs or into a terminal.\n\nI need to check if the given string can be generated by expanding S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if it can be covered by the grammar's derivations.\n\nLet me try to write the string without spaces for clarity: t2 t5 t0 t3 t9 t2 t0 t10 t5 t5 t7 t10 t2 t8 t10 t4 t6 t6 t0 t1 t10 t0 t0 t8 t0 t7.\n\nHmm, I think it would be better to break down the string into components and see which part of the grammar they correspond to.\n\nLet me think about what's at the top level. The string starts with t2. Looking at the productions, I see that NT1 \u2192 't8', but maybe other NTs produce t2. Let me check which NTs can produce t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2: NT2 \u2192 NT4 NT2 or NT0 NT0 or NT5 NT1 or NT5 NT5 or NT2 NT4 or NT1 \u2192 not directly, but NT2 is on both sides. Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let me make a table of NT \u2192 terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 several options: 't1', 't4', etc.\n- NT0 also has a production where it splits into NT10 NT10, which might lead to more terminals, but perhaps not directly.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first token is t2. So that would have to come from NT3. So let me see if I can see a path from S down to NT3 and then produce t2.\n\nLooking back, S can produce NT1 NT2, so maybe:\n\nIf I can get S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and then NT2 eventually leads to t2.\n\nBut wait, NT2's production is NT0 NT0 or NT5 NT1, which might not lead to t2. Alternatively, maybe NT1 leads to t8, which is a different path.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think differently.\n\nThe string starts with t2, so perhaps it's coming from NT3.\n\nLet me see what NT3 can produce:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2' OR 't7' ?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let's find NT3\u2019s production:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nYes, in the top, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\n\nBut then also, looking deeper.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2' is one option, another is NT7 NT1.\n\nSo NT3 can produce 't2' directly or via NT7 and NT1. So t2 can come from NT3 \u2192 't2'.\n\nThus, the first token t2 must come from NT3, so in the parse, the top-level S must derive to something that can include NT3.\n\nLooking back at S's productions, none directly produce NT3, so perhaps S produces NT1 NT2, and somehow that leads to NT3 somewhere down the line.\n\nWait, but S can produce NT4 NT8 as well, so perhaps I should see if the string can be split accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to write the string in terms of NT symbols and see if it can be split into the start symbols' productions. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, and each step in the grammar splits into two, the parse tree should expand in such a way that the string is generated.\n\nLet me try starting from the string and trying to group tokens into possible NT productions.\n\nBut the string has 29 tokens. Since each production in CNF splits a symbol into two, the parse tree would have a depth of about log2(29), which is about 5 levels deep, but maybe more.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, seeing if each token in the string can be matched to an NT, and then see how they can be grouped into productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a tree and see if each step corresponds to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me write down the string:\n\nt2, t5, t0, t3, t9, t2, t0, t10, t5, t5, t7, t10, t2, t8, t10, t4, t6, t6, t0, t1, t10, t0, t0, t8, t0, t7.\n\nThis is 29 tokens, which is an odd number, but 29 is odd, but in a binary parse tree, the number of leaves should be 2^ depth -1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: Starting from S, which has two symbols, each level splits into two, so for a binary tree of height n, the number of leaves is 2^n. But 2^n would be a power of two. 29 is not a power of two, so perhaps it's not possible to generate this string because the number of symbols would not match, but I'm not sure because the initial productions might have two symbols, but each split increases the count by one each time, so the total number of symbols would be (n-1)*2 + 1. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, for a context-free grammar in CNF, each production has two symbols. So when you start with one symbol (S), on the first expansion, you get two symbols. Each subsequent expansion will replace one non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time.\n\nSo, starting with 1 symbol, then 2, then 3, etc.\n\nThe string has 29 symbols, which is an odd number. So starting from 1, each step adds 1 symbol, so after k steps, the number of symbols is 1 + k. So 29 = 1 + k \u2192 k=28 steps, so 28 non-derivations? Wait, not sure.\n\nBut that might not be the issue here. The problem is whether the specific sequence can be generated by the grammar, not the length. But perhaps some nodes in the parse tree cannot combine into the given sequence.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to check if the overall structure of the grammar can even produce a string that starts with t2, t5, t0, etc. Let me look back at the grammar.\n\nLet me see the production chain that starts with t2. It seems that t2 is produced by NT3 \u2192 't2' or via NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1.\n\nFrom the start symbol S, let me see possible paths.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nThen, NT1 can produce 't8' or other terminals. Wait, let me check NT1's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't8' OR NT9 NT13 OR NT12 NT8 OR NT14 NT1 OR NT7 NT14 OR NT1 \u2192 no, actually, looking at the grammar, the more precise list:\n\nLooking through the grammar list, under NT1:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't8' OR 't9' (if any) or others.\n\nWait, I think I need to look through all the productions again accurately.\n\nWait, from the initial problem, I have the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t0 t10 t0 t0 t0 t9 t5 t9 t0 t0 t6 t5 t0 t5 t5 t3 t0 t8 t6 t2 t0 t9 t10 t5 t5 t5 t10\". \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This structure is helpful because there's a standard way to parse strings using CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsers. Since the grammar is given in CNF, I can try to apply the CYK algorithm to check if the string is derivable.\n\nLet's list out all the production rules to have an overview. The start symbol is S, and it has productions like S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, etc. The non-terminals seem to be various NT followed by numbers, and eventually some terminals (t0, t1, etc.).\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. So, to apply the CYK algorithm, I need to construct a parse table where rows represent positions in the string, and columns represent the length of the substring. The algorithm checks for the possibility of the substring being derived from the grammar.\n\nHowever, manually applying CYK might be time-consuming, especially for a long string of 27 tokens. Alternatively, I can think in terms of parse trees and see if the string can be broken down into the non-terminals based on the productions.\n\nLooking at the production S, the start symbol, it has two non-terminals. Each production for S is either NT followed by another NT. So S's productions result in two NT symbols, which then need to be expanded into more symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nWait a second, but in the given grammar, all the productions are between non-terminals. The right-hand sides never produce terminals except in the specific rules where non-terminals directly map to terminals. So each production is of the form NT -> NT NT. The only terminals appear as results of these NT productions. For example, NT3 -> 't5' or NT9 -> 't10' etc.\n\nSo the problem is to see if the given string can be represented by the non-terminals' sequences through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to construct a leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation and see if it can produce the string. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe string is: t0 t10 t0 t0 t0 t9 t5 t9 t0 t0 t6 t5 t0 t5 t5 t3 t0 t8 t6 t2 t0 t9 t10 t5 t5 t5 t10\n\nFirst, I have to find the entire string in the grammar. Let's see how each terminal can be generated.\n\nLooking at the productions, each NT eventually resolves to a terminal via two steps. For example, NT3 -> NT7 NT1. Then, each of those needs to be broken down further.\n\nI think it would be easier to map the string into a sequence of non-terminals and see if that leads back to S.\n\nBut considering that, perhaps it's better to write down the sequence and see.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols: 27 symbols. Each production S starts with two non-terminals. Each non-terminal may lead to two non-terminals, except when it's a terminal.\n\nBut it's a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to simplify by looking for the start symbol and see if the given string can be covered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start from the beginning of the string.\n\nThe first symbol is t0. I need to find a production for a non-terminal that starts with t0. Looking at the NT definitions, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12\n- NT12 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT10 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT5 -> NT10 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT4\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n\nAh, here's an important point: NT9 can produce t0. So if the string starts with t0, maybe the first NT can be NT9.\n\nWait, so if I can have the first part of the string be generated by NT9, which is 't0'. Then, after that, the next symbols would follow.\n\nBut how does NT9 get to the beginning?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the top-level production is S -> NT4 NT8. So S would produce two non-terminals, say NT4 and NT8.\n\nWait, but NT4 could be expanded, right? Wait, the productions for NT4 include some that produce terminals, like NT4 -> 't0' or 't5' etc. So perhaps S can produce a sequence starting with t0, t0, etc.\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider each step of the string and see if each symbol can be matched.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps using the CYK algorithm is the systematic way. Let's outline how that works.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by creating a table where each cell (i, j) represents the substring from the ith symbol to the jth symbol (1-based). For each cell, we check which non-terminals can generate the substring starting at i, ending at j.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Initialize the table with all diagonal cells (i, i) containing the possible non-terminals that can produce the single symbol at position i.\n2. For each length from 2 to n (total symbols), and for each starting index i, compute the possible non-terminals that can generate the substring from i to i + length - 1.\n3. Fill the table by considering all possible splits of the substring into two parts, each of which can be generated by some non-terminals.\n\nThis process can be time-consuming manually, but perhaps I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into sequences covered by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nStarting from the left, the string begins with t0. So perhaps the first symbol is generated by NT9, since NT9 -> 't0'. Therefore, the first symbol is covered by NT9.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t10. So, I need to see if t10 can be generated by NT9 or if some other NT can produce t10 followed by t0.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is only for non-terminals. So t0 is produced by NT9, t10 is produced by NT10.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see NT10 -> 't1'. But I need t10, so that's a problem. Wait, is there any NT that produces 't10'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT10 is defined as NT10 -> NT3 NT10. And NT10 -> 't1'?\n\nWait, no, let me recheck. Looking at the provided productions:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see a production for NT10 that produces a terminal other than 't1'. So how can t10 appear in the string?\n\nWait, here's something: NT10 can be produced by NT10 -> NT3 NT10, which is a recursive production. Then, from NT3, which can be expanded into NT7 NT1, and so on. So perhaps t10 isn't directly produced, but it's part of a longer production.\n\nWait, in the string, after t0, the second symbol is t10. So to get t10, perhaps NT9 can produce a longer sequence that includes t10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe that's not possible, implying that the string contains a symbol (t10) that cannot be generated by any NT.\n\nWait, in the given productions, does any NT produce t10?\n\nLooking at each NT rule, I don't see any NT directly producing 't10', except possibly NT10, but looking at NT10:\n\nNT10 has rules like NT10 -> NT3 NT10 and NT10 -> 't1'. So NT10 can't produce 't10' directly. Therefore, t10 may not be present in the string, which contradicts the given string.\n\nWait, but let's look through all the NT productions to see if any produces 't10':\n\nChecking NT9: does NT9 produce 't10'? Looking at NT9:\n\nNT9 is defined as:\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n\nAh, yes! Wait, let me check: Yes, looking at the grammar, under NT9, one of the productions is -> 't10'. So NT9 can produce 't10'.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can produce 't0' and 't5', etc.\n\nSo wait, in the given string, the first symbol is t0, which is generated by NT9.

{"custom_id":"request-514","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let's try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It looks like a set of production rules for non-terminals (like S, S, NT1, etc.) that can derive strings of terminals. The string I'm given is a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, for example: `t2 t5 t8 t9 t5 t7 t9 t10 t0 t0 t9 t2 t10 t0 t0 t0 t3 t6 t0 t0 t0 t10 t3 t3 t10 t2 t2`. My task is to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. This simplifies the parsing process because it doesn't involve more complex productions.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the way strings are generated is a sequence of binary trees where each internal node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal. So, the string's length must match the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given string, it has 28 tokens. Let me count the tokens:\n\nt2, t5, t8, t9, t5, t7, t9, t10, t0, t0, t9, t2, t10, t0, t0, t0, t3, t6, t0, t0, t0, t10, t3, t3, t10, t2, t2.\n\nThat's 28 tokens. \n\nNow, the start symbol is S. From the first rule, S can be NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11 or NT1 NT2. Let's consider each possibility:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8: Then NT4 and NT8 would each need to derive something that eventually leads to the string.\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11: Similar approach.\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2: Again, NT1 and NT2 would need to produce each part.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT4, it can go to various combinations, including terminals. For example, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', etc. Similarly, NT8 can produce 't6', 't0', etc.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to start from the string and see if we can reduce it to the start symbol S, working backwards using the reverse of the productions. This is called a parse tree method, but since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation would consist of a series of splits that ultimately lead to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down according to the rules. Each production in CNF has exactly two symbols in the body, so each step of the derivation adds one token at a time, but in this case, the string is 28 tokens long, which might suggest a certain depth of derivation.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is a single step where a non-terminal is replaced by exactly two symbols. So, starting from S, each step increases the number of symbols by one. For example, if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then NT1 might be replaced in the next steps. \n\nTo parse the string, I can try to split it into parts that match the productions of the grammar. This might be a bit time-consuming, but let's try.\n\nThe first token is t2. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t2.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT2 \u2192 t2 (from the rules: NT2 \u2192 t2, etc.)\n- NT10 \u2192 t6, but that's not relevant here.\n- NT2 also can go to NT0 NT0, but that's a two-symbol production, so to get t2, it must be that NT2 directly produces t2.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, yes, NT2 \u2192 t2 is present. So, the first step could be that NT2 produces t2.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT2 \u2192 t2 is present. So, the first token t2 could be produced by NT2. Then, looking at the string: t2, t5, t8, t9, t5, t7, t9, t10, t0, t0, t9, t2, t10, t0, t0, t0, t3, t6, t0, t0, t0, t10, t3, t3, t10, t2, t2.\n\nWait, but NT2 can produce t2, but in CNF, that's a single symbol, so in a production, it's part of NT2 \u2192 something, but in the string, each step would produce a single symbol. Wait, but in this grammar, the productions either split into two non-terminals or produce a single terminal. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: Each production is either U \u2192 VW or U \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, and V, W are non-terminals. So in the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so during derivation, each production that produces a terminal contributes a single symbol in the string. \n\nSo, starting from S, and each step of the derivation adds symbols equal to the production. For example, if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then each of NT4 and NT8 can produce terminals or split further.\n\nBut the string given has 28 symbols, which suggests that the derivation must have gone through enough steps to reach that many symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree in reverse would help. Let's try that.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: the last three tokens are t2, t2. So, at the last step, a non-terminal must have produced t2 t2. But looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce two t2's?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT2 can produce t2 directly. But since in CNF, the productions are only two symbols, so if NT2 is on the left side, it can't produce two t2s. Instead, it can only produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, perhaps it's more likely that a non-terminal splits into NT2 and something else, but that doesn't directly produce two t2s.\n\nWait, but in the string, the last two tokens are t2 and t2. That suggests that some non-terminal on the left side of the production must split into NT2 and something that produces the next token, but since t2 is a terminal, that would mean the next step after that would have another split or a single t2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last t2 comes from NT2 \u2192 t2, and the previous symbol is t2 as well, which would mean that before that, the non-terminal must have split into NT2 and something that can produce t2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can produce t2 as their left-hand side. \n\nFrom the rules, NT2 \u2192 t2 is present. So, a production where a non-terminal (like NT1 or NT2) splits into NT2 and something else that allows the next t2. But then, since we have two t2s in a row, that would require that NT2 can split into t2 and something that can produce another t2, but I don't think that's possible because NT2 only can produce a terminal on its own, not as part of a split.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check: in CNF, a production is either U \u2192 VW or U \u2192 a, where V, W are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, if a non-terminal produces a terminal, that's one symbol. But in the string, we have consecutive t2s, so perhaps that's the result of two different productions each producing t2, but then that would require the same as having two separate t2s in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to map the string backwards, using the reverse of the productions, to see if we can reduce it to S.\n\nSo, the string is: t2, t5, t8, t9, t5, t7, t9, t10, t0, t0, t9, t2, t10, t0, t0, t0, t3, t6, t0, t0, t0, t10, t3, t3, t10, t2, t2.\n\nLet me list all the tokens in order: t2, t5, t8, t9, t5, t7, t9, t10, t0, t0, t9, t2, t10, t0, t0, t0, t3, t6, t0, t0, t0, t10, t3, t3, t10, t2, t2.\n\nI'll start from the end and try to reduce.\n\nThe last token is t2. To reduce, I can look for a non-terminal that can produce t2 as its left-hand side.

{"custom_id":"request-531","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t0 t10 t8 t5 t0 t0 t9 t2 t5 t0 t0 t2 t3 t2 t0 t0 t2 t0 t10 t8 t5 t9 t3 t10 t3 t0 t10 t2`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and all other non-terminals can be rewritten with the given rules until terminals are produced. So, the process involves checking if the string can be derived by expanding S into non-terminals and eventually terminals.\n\nThe grammar provided has a lot of non-terminals, so I need to see how they relate to the terminals in the string. Let me list the non-terminals and their productions to get a better idea. The non-terminals are S, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT10, NT11, NT13, NT14, NT0, NT12, NT6, and NT1. Each of these has productions that either break them down into other non-terminals or, in some cases, directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminals: several 't's with numbers. I notice that some of these 't's are 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. From the grammar, I can see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFor instance, NT3 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't7', NT2 \u2192 't2', NT10 \u2192 't6', and so on. So, the first step is to figure out how each terminal in the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into individual terminals:\n\nt0, t10, t8, t5, t0, t0, t9, t2, t5, t0, t0, t2, t3, t2, t0, t0, t2, t0, t10, t8, t5, t9, t3, t10, t3, t0, t10, t2.\n\nNow, I need to see if these terminals can be produced by expanding S using the grammar. Since S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the start symbol expands into two non-terminals, NT4 and NT8. So, both NT4 and NT8 must derive a sequence of terminals that, when combined, match the given string.\n\nLooking at NT4, its productions are:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n\nSimilarly, NT8 has several productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6 NT3' (Wait, no, the last one is NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13.

The string is \"t5 t10 t9 t2 t9 t0 t3 t0 t2 t5 t3 t6 t7 t0 t8 t3 t2 t7 t0 t10 t0 t0 t3 t0 t6 t5 t6 t5\". Hmm, that's a lot of symbols.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Alternatively, some sources include the form A \u2192 B where A is a non-terminal and B is a string of terminals and non-terminals, but Chomsky Normal Form typically excludes such cases, so I think all rules are two symbols on the right. Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, each production seems to either split into two non-terminals or a terminal. So yes, it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Good. So each rule is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal.\n\nThe given string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if following the rules, the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to work backwards, starting from the string and trying to match the rules to see if I can reduce the string step by step until I reach the start symbol S. This is like a parsing approach, similar to how parsers work for context-free grammars.\n\nLet me write out the string, each token separated by a space for clarity:\n\nt5, t10, t9, t2, t9, t0, t3, t0, t2, t5, t3, t6, t7, t0, t8, t3, t2, t7, t0, t10, t0, t0, t3, t0, t6, t5, t6, t5.\n\nI need to see if this can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I know that the start symbol is S, and the grammar rules for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, S can split into either NT4 and NT8, NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nMy string is a series of 28 tokens. Since each production for S splits into two parts, the top-level production must produce two parts. So, the string should be divided into two halves, each half corresponding to one of the parts after S's production.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long. Let me check: 28 tokens, so each half would be 14 tokens each if S is split into two. Let me see if I can split the string into two parts of 14 tokens each and see if each part can be derived from one of the right-hand sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look from the end, trying to match the end symbols with the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the last token, t5. Let's see what rules produce t5. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't7', 't11', etc.\n- Others: for example, NT3 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see NT13 has multiple productions: NT13 \u2192 NT6 NT12, NT13 \u2192 NT5 NT12, etc. But looking for terminals, the string has tokens like t2, t5, etc.\n\nSo, looking at the last token, t5, which production could produce it?\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\nSo, NT4 can produce 't5'.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- NT2 can produce 't5' as per rule NT2 \u2192 NT7 and other, but in this case, we have t5 as a terminal. Wait, looking back: I'm a bit confused. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT4 has two rules:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\nWait, no, looking again, the user provided:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nOh, okay, wait, so NT4 can produce either 't0' or 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other non-terminals that produce 't5', we have:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (since in the grammar, NT2 has a rule NT2 \u2192 't5'\u2014oh wait, looking back, let me check:\n\nIn the provided rules, does NT2 have a terminal production? Yes, I see \"NT2 -> 't2']\", but also checking further down, I see \"NT2 -> 't5'\". Right, so NT2 can produce 't2' as per rule NT2 \u2192 't2', but also looking for 't5', I see that yes, in another rule: \"NT2 -> 't5'\". So NT2 can produce both 't2' and 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5'. So in the string, we end with t5. So the last symbol in the string is t5, which could be produced by NT4 or NT2 or NT2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing something up. Let me clarify: the terminals in the grammar are:\n\nLooking at the NT rules ending with 't...', like NT3 \u2192 't2', NT9 \u2192 't9', etc.\n\nWait, no, wait, the terminals are given as individual rules at the bottom, like \"NT3 -> 't2'\", \"NT4 -> 't0'\", etc. So, for example, 't5' is a terminal that is produced by NT4 or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking back, in the rule list, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6' (multiple rules)\n- NT10 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5' (wait, is that correct? Because in the provided rules, I see \"NT2->NT7\" and \"NT2->'t5'\", etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.\n\nWait, I think I should clarify which rules produce terminals. Let's list all the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2' (twice)\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc. Wait, no, 't0' is from NT4. Let me list them:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc. Wait:\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through all the RHS where it's a single terminal:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9' (twice)\n- NT10 \u2192 't6' (some rules)\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6' (multiple rules)\n- NT8 \u2192 't0', 't3', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc.\n- ... others. So, 't0', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't7', 't8', 't9', 't10'\u2014all are individual terminals.\n\nSo each token in the string corresponds to a production where the non-terminal on the left produces that terminal.\n\nSo, for the terminal 't5', it's produced by some non-terminals. Looking at the rules where RHS is 't5' (I think in the given grammar, that's NT4 and NT2):\n\nWait, let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at the given rules, do any produce 't5' as a terminal? Let me search for 't5' in the RHS.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n\nSo NT4 can produce 't5' and NT2 can produce 't5'. Also, let me check NT13: I see NT13 \u2192 't6', but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, in the string, each 't5' must correspond to either NT4 or NT2.\n\nWait, but looking again: the production for NT2 has a terminal 't5' as one of the options. So NT2 can produce 't5' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can produce 't5'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t5 t5 t0 t2 t9 t0 t0 t5 t0 t0 t3 t10 t0 t10 t3 t1 t1 t7 t0 t10 t10 t0 t6 t2 t5 t10 t3 t6 t2`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the productions only have two non-terminals on the right side or single terminals.\n\nThe initial step is to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing in CNF can be done using a recursive or iterative approach, but since I don't have a parser, I'll try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S. In the given grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nI'll consider both possibilities and see which one can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5 t5. Let's see how these can be generated.\n\nFirst, S can produce NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. Let's check which of these can start with t5.\n\nLooking at the productions in the grammar, NT4 has rules like NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', etc. Similarly, NT8 has rules leading to terminals like t6, t3, etc.\n\nWait, but the first token is t5. Let's look at the productions that produce t5. In the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't0', NT4 \u2192 't5' directly. So if a non-terminal can produce t5, that's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT4 include 't0' and 't5', but does it produce t5 directly? Yes, NT4 \u2192 't5' is one of the productions. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't0' and NT4 \u2192 't0' as well.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5. So, to get a t5, that non-terminal must be a child of the S node.\n\nLet me think. If S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first symbol is from NT4. Since NT4 can produce 't5', that could explain the first t5.\n\nSo, let's tentatively say that S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the correct initial path.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT4 \u2192 t5, and then we have another symbol, which is also t5. Let's look at the next symbol.\n\nWait, the string is t5 t5 t0 t2... So after the first t5 from NT4, the next is another t5. That suggests that NT4 might be able to produce another t5, but looking at the productions for NT4, it can produce 't5', or other combinations.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT4 has multiple rules. For example, NT4 \u2192 't5' directly. So maybe NT4 can produce two t5s in a row.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the first part is NT4 \u2192 t5, and then the next part is NT8. Now, the next symbol in the string is the second t5, which would have to come from NT8, but let's check what NT8 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't7', 't0', etc. None of these directly produce t5. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nHmm, maybe I got the initial step wrong. Perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is more appropriate because NT1 can produce t8, and NT2 can produce t2, which might align better with the string starting with t5 t5.\n\nWait, let me clarify. S can be NT1 or NT2 as the initial productions. Let's try S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nNT1's production: Looking at the grammar, NT1 can produce 't8' directly. So, if NT1 \u2192 t8, then followed by NT2, which can produce 't2' directly. So the first part would be t8 t2, but the string starts with t5 t5, so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for S \u2192 NT4 NT8 because NT4 can produce t5. But as I saw earlier, NT8 doesn't produce t5. Let's double-check NT8's productions.\n\nLooking again, NT8 can produce:\n- 't6' via NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, then NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and so on, which eventually can produce 't6' as one of the paths. But it's a long chain and doesn't directly produce 't5'.\n\nWait, maybe the string isn't feasible because after t5, we can't get another t5 from NT8. So perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8 isn't the right starting point. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is the correct starting point.\n\nBut then, NT1 produces 't8', and NT2 produces 't2', which doesn't match the string starting with t5. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is correct, but the parsing isn't straightforward. Perhaps there's a way through other productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and it's better to look for the possible structure.\n\nLet me consider that each symbol in the string must be generated by a production from the grammar, and the entire string must form a valid derivation in the grammar.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t5 t5, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, first, NT4 \u2192 t5, then NT8 needs to produce t5. But looking at NT8's productions: NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', etc. So how do we get t5 from NT8?\n\nWait, maybe NT8 can produce other non-terminals that can lead to t5. So let's look at NT8's productions.\n\nNT8 can produce:\n- NT6 NT3 (from NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3)\n- NT2 (from NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2 via NT5 \u2192 't0' or other paths)\nWait, no, NT8's productions are listed as NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT2, etc.\n\nWait, from the grammar, looking again:\n\nIt seems that NT8 has several productions, including:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n- Maybe others, but I think it's these two.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT8, there's:\n\n`NT8 -> NT6 NT3`\n`NT8 -> NT2 NT4`\n\nSo, from NT8, we can go to NT6 NT3 or NT2 NT4.\n\nSo, if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then the first symbol is NT4 \u2192 t5, and the second symbol comes from NT8.\n\nSo, after t5, we have another t5, so the next symbol must come from NT8 producing t5. But how? Because NT8's direct productions don't include t5.\n\nUnless there's a way for NT8 to produce a t5 through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps NT8 can be broken down into components that produce t5 through other productions.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\n1. NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n2. NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT4\n\nSo, if we take the first option, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, then we have NT6 and NT3. Let's see what NT6 and NT3 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3 NT10\n- etc. So, NT6's main productions involve other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT3's productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't7' directly\n- Other productions involving NT7, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps from NT6, we can get to t7 via NT3.\n\nWait, but wait: If NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, then NT6 can produce sequences like 't0' (since NT9 \u2192 't0'), and NT3 can produce 't7' directly.\n\nBut that would make NT8 produce 't0 t7', which is 't0 t7', but we need t5. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if NT8 \u2192 NT2 NT4, then NT2 can produce various things. Looking at NT2's productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0 (from NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0)\n- NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4 (from NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4)\n- Other rules involving NT5, etc.\n\nSo, if we take NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, then each NT0 can produce various things.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Alternatively, I can try to derive the string step by step.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t8 t0 t2 t5 t8 t9 t10 t5 t10 t5 t0 t7 t10 t8 t7 t0 t0 t0 t7 t0 t2 t8 t10 t2 t0 t4 t2 t0 t2`.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let me see if I can map each terminal to the possible non-terminals that can produce it. Let's list out the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals from the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- t0 is produced by nt10, nt13, nt9, etc. Wait, in the grammar, nt9 \u2192 t0, nt10 \u2192 t1, but wait no, nt10 is a non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, some of the rules end with terminals.\n\nLooking at each production, the right-hand sides (RHS) that are terminals are:\n\nNT13 \u2192 t2, t4, t5? Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking at each production, for NT4 \u2192 t0, t5; NT2 \u2192 t2, t5; NT1 \u2192 t8; NT7 \u2192 t0; NT8 \u2192 t0; NT0 \u2192 t10, t4; NT10 \u2192 t3; Wait, perhaps I should make a list.\n\nTerminal productions:\n\n- nt13 \u2192 t2\n- nt5 \u2192 t0\n- nt1 \u2192 t8\n- nt7 \u2192 t0\n- nt8 \u2192 t0\n- nt0 \u2192 t10, t4\n- nt10 \u2192 t3\n- nt2 \u2192 t2, t5\n- nt9 \u2192 t0\n\nOthers are non-terminals that produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo, to produce terminals, a non-terminal must derive directly to a terminal.\n\nSo, for the given string, each token is a terminal. To get each token, we need to find a production rule that can derive it.\n\nLet's process the string step by step, trying to see if each terminal can be the result of a production.\n\nThe string is: t8 t0 t2 t5 t8 t9 t10 t5 t10 t5 t0 t7 t10 t8 t7 t0 t0 t0 t7 t0 t2 t8 t10 t2 t0 t4 t2 t0 t2\n\nLet me list them in order as positions 1 to 30:\n\n1: t8\n2: t0\n3: t2\n4: t5\n5: t8\n6: t9\n7: t10\n8: t5\n9: t10\n10: t5\n11: t0\n12: t7\n13: t10\n14: t8\n15: t7\n16: t0\n17: t0\n18: t0\n19: t7\n20: t0\n21: t2\n22: t8\n23: t10\n24: t2\n25: t0\n26: t4\n27: t2\n28: t0\n29: t2\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a derivation pathway that can produce this sequence. Starting from S.\n\nLooking at the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can be split into two non-terminals, each of which needs to derive into a sequence that expands into the string.\n\nLet me choose one production for S and see if I can derive the string. Let's try S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo the initial step would be S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Now, each of these non-terminals (NT4 and NT8) need to derive into parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT4, from the grammar:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (multiple options here), NT11 NT6, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the beginning and see if each terminal can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider using a top-down approach, building a parse tree.\n\nBut this might get complicated. An alternative approach is to simulate the derivation step by step, trying to match the string.\n\nLet's attempt a possible derivation.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, we need to derive a string starting with t8 and t0 as per the string.\n\nWait, but NT4 produces t0, t5, etc., and NT8 produces t0, t6, etc.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0 via NT4 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo from NT4, we can get t0.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 \u2192 t0 via NT8 \u2192 t0.\n\nWait, but the first two symbols in the string are t8, t0.\n\nBut according to S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the first symbol should be derived from NT4. But NT4's terminals are t0 and t5. The first symbol is t8, which is not produced directly by NT4.\n\nSo maybe S can't produce t8 as the first symbol via NT4.\n\nSo perhaps we should pick a different production for S.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nThen, NT1 \u2192 t8, and NT2 \u2192 t2 or t5.\n\nSo the first symbols would be t8 and t2 or t5. The string starts with t8, so NT1 can produce t8, and NT2 can produce t2 or t5. So this seems possible.\n\nBut wait, in the first production, from S \u2192 NT1 NT2, the first part is NT1 \u2192 t8, and the second part is NT2, which could produce t2 or t5.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t0...\n\nSo after t8 from NT1, the next is t0. So the second part, which is NT2, needs to derive a string that starts with t0.\n\nBut NT2's productions are NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT13, etc. Wait, let's listNT2's productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT13\n\nAnd also:\n\nLooking again, in the original grammar, NT2 has multiple rules, but when considering terminals, NT2 can produce t2 or t5.\n\nSo if NT2 is part of the S \u2192 NT1 NT2, then the second part would be NT2, which can produce t2 or t5. But the string after t8 is t0, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but that's the first two symbols: t8 (from NT1) and then t0. But NT2 can't produce t0 directly. The productions for NT2 involve non-terminals, so unless NT2 can derive into t0 via some steps, but looking at NT2's rules, it doesn't produce t0 directly. The terminals for NT2 are t2 and t5, but it can't go directly to t0.\n\nSo maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is not viable because after t8, we would need something that can produce t0, but NT2 can't directly. So maybe this path doesn't work.\n\nAnother option is to consider S \u2192 NT4 NT11.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT4 NT11, which would generate two non-terminals.\n\nNT4 can produce t0, t5, etc., and NT11 can produce t3, t5 via NT11 \u2192 NT5 NT11 or NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5.\n\nWait, the string starts with t8, so perhaps NT4 can't produce t8 because its direct productions are t0 and t5. So this seems impossible. So S \u2192 NT4 NT11 probably doesn't help because the first symbol is t8, which is produced by NT1 or NT4.\n\nWait, no: wait NT4 can produce t0 and t5. So if S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and then we need the first symbol to be t8. But as I thought earlier, NT4 can't produce t8, so S \u2192 NT4 NT8 can't start with t8.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT4 NT11 can't start with t8 because NT4 can't produce t8 directly.\n\nSo the only viable initial production seems to be S \u2192 NT1 NT2, which starts with NT1 \u2192 t8, and then NT2 needs to derive a string starting with t0.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that NT2 can't produce t0 directly, so maybe it's via derivation.

The given grammar seems to fit this structure, with all rules being binary or terminal productions.\n\nMy approach will be to either use a parsing method like CYK or attempt a top-down parsing (using something like the Earley algorithm) to see if the parser can derive the string. Since I'm dealing with this manually, perhaps a top-down approach, albeit simplified, might work.\n\nI'll start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. The start symbol S has production rules that produce different combinations of non-terminals:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, for the string to start with, according to S's rules, the first two symbols must be the results of NT4 and NT8, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are `t9` and `t5`. Let me check which of the S rules could start with t9 t5.\n\nLet's break down NT4 and NT8. From the grammar, NT4 has a production:\n\nNT4 -> 't0' | 't5' | 't7'\n\nWait, but in the given S rule, it's S -> NT4 NT8, so both NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals. So they need to produce strings, each contributing to the overall production.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t9 followed by t5.\n\nLet's see what T9 and T5 come from. T9 is a terminal, and T5 is another terminal. So, perhaps one of the NT4 or NT8 non-terminals can produce a t9 and t5 in sequence.\n\nWait, no, because NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals, so they produce other non-terminals or terminals. Maybe I should traverse the grammar's rules to see how these terminals are generated.\n\nLooking at the NT9, it's part of the grammar rules. Let's see:\n\nNT9 -> 't0' | 't10'\n\nBut in the string, there's a t9 followed by t5. Hmm, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t9 t5 t5 t9 t3 t2...`. So the sequence is t9, t5, t5, t9, etc.\n\nWait, but NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals. So perhaps one of them can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT9 production:\n\nNT9 has rules:\nNT9 -> 't0' | 't10'\n\nWait, that doesn't include t9 or t5. Similarly, NT5's rules include:\n\nNT5 -> 't0' | 't10'\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 is:\n\nNT3 -> 't2' | 't7'\n\nBut in the string, there's a t3 t2 after several other tokens.

Alternatively, I could try to find a derivation path in the grammar that leads to the string. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Each non-terminal on the left side of a production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the cases where a non-terminal can produce a terminal symbol. I notice that some rules produce terminals directly, like NT3 -> 't5', NT9 -> 't0', and others. \n\nI should start by identifying which non-terminals can produce the terminal symbols in the string. So, let's list the terminals in the string: t5, t10, t2, t0, etc. We can see that NT3 -> t5, NT10 -> t1, NT13 -> t4 or t6, NT9 -> t0, NT4 -> t0, t5, etc.\n\nNext, I'll try to reverse-engineer the parsing process.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for other non-terminals that can directly produce t5, t10, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t5, which is directly produced by NT3, but NT3 is defined as NT7 NT1. So for NT3 to produce t5, both NT7 and NT1 must derive to t5? Or perhaps, no, wait: NT3 is a non-terminal that produces t5 directly.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nAt the bottom of the list, I see:\nNT3 -> 't2' (Wait, no, looking again, I see:\nNT3 -> 't2'\nBut the string has t5, so that's not relevant.\n\nWait, looking for where 't5' is produced directly. \n\nLooking through all the rules, I find:\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't8', 't13'\n- NT0 -> 't10', 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT10 -> 't1', 't6'\n- NT13 -> 't4', 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0', 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't0', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, looking for NT4 and NT2, both produce 't5' when applicable.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5' (so when NT4 is derived, it can be 't5')\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5' (same, NT2 can be 't5')\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is t5. So, perhaps S produces NT4 and NT8. Let's see.\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\n\nSo S can be NT4 derived to 't5' and NT8 derived to 't0' or other symbols.\n\nWait, but in the string, the next symbol after t5 is t10.\n\nSo if S is NT4 (which can be t5) and NT8 (which needs to be t10), can NT8 derive t10?\n\nLooking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\nNT8 -> other rules involving more steps.\n\nWait, let's check NT8. I need NT8 to produce 't10'. Let's see if any production of NT8 can result in 't10'.\n\nLooking through NT8's rules, I don't see a direct production to 't10'. So perhaps we need to look deeper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for the first part of the string and see how it can be generated.\n\nThe string starts with t5 t10 t2 t0...\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\n1. S can produce NT4 NT8.\n\nSuppose we choose S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, NT4 can derive 't5' directly because one of its productions is NT4 -> 't5'.\n\nSo, NT4 -> 't5', then NT8 needs to produce the next symbols.\n\nThe next symbol is t10. So, what can NT8 produce? It seems that NT8 does not directly produce 't10', so we need to see if we can split NT8 into two non-terminals that can generate 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n\nNT8 can be NT6 NT3, NT1 NT5, etc.\n\nLet me see what NT6 and NT3 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT11\nNT6 cannot directly produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT9:\n\nNT9 can produce 't0' or 't10'.\n\nSo, if NT8 is NT6 NT3, then:\n\nNT6 can produce 't10' (if NT9 -> 't10'), but wait, NT6 is NT9 NT11, so both NT9 and NT11 must be considered.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe NT8 can split into NT1 NT5.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: NT1 -> NT9 NT13, etc. So that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should try another approach. Let's consider that S -> NT4 NT8, then NT4 is 't5'. Now, NT8 needs to produce t10, then the rest of the string.\n\nBut NT8 doesn't have a production that directly gives 't10'. So perhaps we need NT8 to derive more non-terminals that can eventually produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules again, another possibility is NT8 -> NT11 NT6.\n\nWait, but NT11's productions: \n\nLooking through the list, I see NT11 -> NT3 NT11, which is a left recursion. Or NT11 -> NT8 NT5.\n\nWait, that could get tricky. Maybe another approach would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should think about the entire string and see if we can split it into parts that correspond to the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5 t10 t2 t0 t5 t10 t0 t5 t0 t10 t0 t0 t8 t0 t3 t6 t5 t9 t3 t5 t9 t5 t0 t5 t3 t0 t2 t5 t3 t5\n\nThat's 30 symbols. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\nStart with S -> NT4 NT8. \n\nNT4 can produce 't5' directly. Now, we need to parse the remaining string starting with t10.\n\nSo after 't5', we have t10 t2 t0...\n\nSo, now, NT8 needs to produce the rest: t10 t2 t0... \n\nLooking at NT8's rules again, maybe NT8 can be NT1 NT5.\n\nSo S -> NT4 NT8 becomes 't5' [NT8 derivation].\n\nNow, NT8 -> NT1 NT5.\n\nSo NT1 needs to produce t10, and NT5 needs to produce the rest.\n\nLooking at NT1's rules: NT1 -> NT9 NT13, so we'll have to split NT1.\n\nSo perhaps NT1 is NT9 NT13.\n\nThen, NT9 can produce 't10' directly, right?

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is separate from the terminals. So, looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit because all the productions are either to two non-terminals or directly to a single terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t2 t8 t8 t8 t2 t9 t2 t0 t3 t5 t5 t9 t2 t5 t8 t0 t10 t0 t0 t5 t2 t0 t10 t3 t2 t5 t0 t0 t9 t5 t0`. That's a pretty long string\u201430 symbols. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The possible productions for S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can produce two NT4 and either NT8 or NT11, or it can produce NT1 and NT2.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t2, t8, t8, t8. Let me see if these can come from any of the productions.\n\nWait, the initial productions from S all start with NT4 and NT8 or NT11 or NT1 and NT2.

Hmm, so starting with NT2 might be tricky because there are multiple options. But let's see, what about NT8 and NT9?\n\nLooking at NT8, the productions are:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n\nAnd NT9 is:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT13 NT9\n- NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT13 NT11\n\nNot too bad. Let me try to reconstruct the string by working backward. Since the string starts with t2, t8, t8, t8, perhaps it's from the production S \u2192 NT1 NT2, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, from S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11.\n\nWait, let's see. The first part is t2 t8 t8 t8. Let's suppose that the first NT2 produces t2, which occurs in NT2's productions: NT2 \u2192 't2' through several rules. For example, NT2 \u2192 't2' via NT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4, but wait, no, actually NT2 has a production to 't2' only if one of the rules directly maps to t2, but looking at the productions given, I don't immediately see any. Wait, checking the NT2 productions: Do any of them map to t2 directly? Hmm, looking through the list, I don't see an NT2 \u2192 't2' production, but wait, I do see NT2 \u2192 't8' in one production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the NT2 productions again. Oh, no, actually, looking back, the user's grammar says:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2' isn't direct in the provided rules. Wait, let me check the provided grammar again carefully. The user provided the grammar, so let's parse it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\n...\nalso NT2 -> NT5 NT2\n...\nWait, perhaps I was wrong; actually, in the user's grammar, I see NT2 has:\n\nWait, checking line by line:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar lines:\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\nNT2 -> NT5 NT2\nNT2 -> NT7 NT7\nNT2 -> NT10 NT4\nNT2 -> NT2 NT4\nNT2 -> NT5 NT8\nNT2 -> NT10 NT10\nNT2 -> NT8 NT4\nNT2 -> NT7 NT10\nNT2 -> NT5 NT2\nNT2 -> NT9 NT7\nNT2 -> NT10 NT10\nNT2 -> NT8 NT8\nNT2 -> NT9 NT11\nNT2 -> NT2 NT9\nNT2 -> NT9 NT9\nNT2 -> NT10 NT10\nNT2 -> NT7 NT3\nNT2 -> NT10 NT5\nNT2 -> NT11 NT7\nNT2 -> NT2 NT10\nNT2 -> NT3 NT12\nNT2 -> NT2 NT5\nNT2 -> NT12 NT2\nNT2 -> NT3 NT12\nNT2 -> NT8 NT4\nNT2 -> NT6 NT3\nNT2 -> NT12 NT2\nNT2 -> NT3 NT12\nNT2 -> NT10 NT5\nNT2 -> NT8 NT8\nNT2 -> NT1 NT5\nNT2 -> NT9 NT10\nNT2 -> NT0 NT3\nNT2 -> NT2 NT10\nNT2 -> NT3 NT12\nNT2 -> NT8 NT10\nNT2 -> NT6 NT7\nNT2 -> NT12 NT9\nNT2 -> NT5 NT10\nNT2 -> NT9 NT6\nNT2 -> NT10 NT10\n\nHmm, looking for NT2 \u2192 't2'. There isn't a direct production, but perhaps through another production. Wait, maybe through a chain. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the NT2's productions and see if they can derive t2, t8, etc. Maybe the first t2 comes from NT2, which is derived from NT2, which is part of the initial S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and that's how we get t2.\n\nNow, let's consider what NT1 can produce. From the grammar, NT1 can go to NT9 NT13, etc., and eventually, NT13 can map to 't3' or other terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-596","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex with many production rules, so I'll have to break it down step by step. The string to evaluate is:\n\n`t7 t0 t3 t10 t8 t9 t3 t5 t2 t3 t10 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t10 t5 t2 t0 t0 t10 t2 t5 t3 t7 t3 t5 t7 t3 t2`\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. All non-terminals have exactly two production rules except for the start symbol, which can have one or more. However, from the provided grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have more than two rules, which might complicate things because CNF typically restricts to two productions per non-terminal. But perhaps the start symbol only has one, or maybe it's okay as long as each step strictly follows two.\n\nLooking closer, the start symbol is S, and its productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nWait, that's three productions. Hmm, that's a bit unusual for CNF, but I suppose it's allowed as long as each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. However, for parsing, this might make things a bit trickier because each step in the parse tree would have to choose between these options. But since we're just trying to generate the string, perhaps we can think of it as building the string step by step using the available rules.\n\nNext, I'll list out all the non-terminals and their productions. I notice that the non-terminals include S, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT7, NT8, NT9, NT10, NT11, NT12, NT13, NT14, NT0, and NT6. Each of these has one or more production rules. I'll need to figure out how each of these can generate the terminals in the string.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t0, t1, t2, t3, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, and t10. Let me map each terminal to its corresponding production rule to see how they can be generated.\n\nFirst, I'll list each terminal and what they expand to:\n\n- t0: NT9 \u2192 t0, NT0 \u2192 t0, NT10 \u2192 t0, NT2 \u2192 t0\n- t1: NT0 \u2192 t1, NT13 \u2192 t6 isn't a terminal, but looking through, I think NT10 \u2192 t6, wait no. Wait, the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10.\n\nWait, maybe I need to list each non-terminal's end-commands (directly produceable terminals):\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t0, t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t0, t2\n- NT7 \u2192 t0, t10\n- NT8 \u2192 t6, t0, t5, but wait, NT8's rules are:\n\nWait, actually, let me re-express each rule:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t2\nNT4 \u2192 t0, t5\nNT5 \u2192 t0, t2\nNT7 \u2192 t0, t10\nNT8 \u2192 t0, t1, t3, t5 (Wait, looking at the rules, let me list them properly.)\n\nWait, the rule for NT4 is:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 t0, NT4 \u2192 t5 (from the last line, perhaps?)\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Let me try to parse each production properly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping for each non-terminal to its possible terminals through their productions. So for each non-terminal, we can see which terminals they can directly produce, and also other non-terminals they produce.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm to determine if the string is in the language. The CYK algorithm is a dynamic programming method used to parse strings in Chomsky Normal Form. It works by building a table where each cell (i,j) represents whether the substring from position i to j can be generated by the non-terminal at a certain position.\n\nBut since the grammar is quite large and the string is quite long, manually applying CYK would be time-consuming. Instead, perhaps I can look for alternative approaches, such as trying to break the string into parts that match the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t7 t0 t3 t10 t8 t9 t3 t5 t2 t3 t10 t3 t5 t7 t9 t10 t10 t5 t2 t0 t0 t10 t2 t5 t3 t7 t3 t5 t7 t3 t2`.\n\nI need to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal and that their predecessors in the parse tree form a valid structure.\n\nFirst, let's note that S can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So the root of the parse tree is S.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t7, perhaps the start symbol uses S \u2192 NT7, but wait, no, the first productions are all two non-terminals. So S can't directly produce a single terminal. Therefore, the start symbol must produce non-terminals that eventually derive into the string.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t7, which is a terminal. So that would require that one of the non-terminals in the parse tree directly produces t7. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t7.\n\nLooking back at the rules:\n\nNT7 can produce t7 (if such a production exists). Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT7 \u2192 t7. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT7:\n\nNT7 has several rules:\n\nNT7 -> NT8 NT5\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT7 -> NT7 NT11\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\nNT7 -> NT5 NT12\nNT7 -> NT3 NT11\nNT7 -> NT11 NT7\nNT7 -> NT0 NT6\nNT7 -> NT13 NT9\nWait, I don't see an NT7 \u2192 t7. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier; some of these productions might lead into terminals through other rules.\n\nWait, let's see: If NT7 can produce NT8, and NT8 could produce something, perhaps t2, t5, t0, etc., but perhaps t7 is one of the terminals. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all the rules, NT3 \u2192 t2.\n\nLooking for t7, where could it come from? Let me see if any non-terminal can produce t7.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t7. So t7 must be the result of some combination of productions. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the rules. Let me check the initial rules again.\n\nLooking at the third line in the grammar: \"S-> NT1 NT2\". So S can produce NT1 and NT2, which are non-terminals. Now, let's see the rules for NT1 and NT2.\n\nFrom earlier, the rules are:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT13 -> 't6'\nSO NT1's production leads to terminal t0 and NT13, which leads to t6.

Hmm, where to start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal (A) is rewritten as two non-terminals (BC), or terminals. So every production either is a terminal or expands into two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to fit this, so it's definitely a CFG in CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so our task is to parse it from the start symbol S by applying these rules. Since the string has 35 tokens, that's a bit long, but manageable with patience.\n\nI think using a parsing method like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent approach could help, but without coding, maybe a step-by-step approach would work. Let me see if I can find a path through the grammar that matches the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has two main options:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nWait, no, the first two options are S -> NT4 NT8 and S -> NT1 NT11? Let me check the initial grammar rules again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT4 NT4 NT8? Or wait, looking back: The grammar is presented as S -> NT4 NT8, S -> NT4 NT11, and S -> NT1 NT2. So three options for S.\n\nSo S can split into NT4 and NT8, or NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nI think the first step is to see which of S's options can generate parts of the string.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which is a terminal. Looking at NT rules, several have production rules that include t5, t0, etc.\n\nLet me look through all the NT productions to see where t5, t0, etc., are produced.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see several productions ending with specific terminals.\n\nFor example, NT13 -> 't4', 't6', NT9 -> 't0', etc.\n\nWait, in the user\u2019s grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 -> 't2', 't4', 't6', 't0', etc. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the user's grammar has entries like NT13 -> 't4', 't2', etc. For example:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12, NT13 -> NT6 NT10, NT13 -> 't4', 't2', 't6'.\n\nSo when a non-terminal reaches a point where it's supposed to produce a terminal, that's the end of a derivation for that part.\n\nThe string starts with t5. Let's check which non-terminals produce t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> 't2' (from NT2 -> 't2'?)\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't7' for example, because multiple rules produce t0, t5, etc.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the production rules for non-terminals:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't4', etc.\n- NT1 -> 't8', 't13', etc.\n- Oh, wait, the detailed rules are given, but perhaps it's easier to list all the non-terminals that can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't2', 't5'\n- NT12 -> 't3', etc.\n\nSo NT4 can produce t5, and NT2 also can produce t5. So the first token t5 could come from NT4 or NT2.\n\nNow, looking at S's options, since we're in the beginning, say S divides into two non-terminals, so maybe if S is split into NT4 and NT8, then the first step could generate t5 from NT4, and then the next part of the string should be generated by NT8.\n\nAlternatively, if S is split into NT4 and NT11, then the first part would be t5 from NT4 and the second from NT11. Alternatively, if S is split into NT1 and NT2, but I don't think NT1 produces t5 immediately.\n\nSo let's proceed with the first possibility: S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the first token t5 would come from NT4. Now, what does NT4 produce? Looking through the production rules for NT4:\n\nNT4 -> 't0', 't5', 't4', etc. It can directly produce t5, t0, t5 again, or other combinations.\n\nIn this case, since the string starts with t5, let's see if NT4 can produce t5. Yes, NT4 has a production to 't5', so that's possible.\n\nThen, after that, NT8 would have to generate the rest of the string starting from the second token t0, t10, etc.\n\nWait, after NT4 produces t5, NT8 would then generate the rest of the string.\n\nBut how does NT8 generate subsequent tokens?\n\nLooking at NT8's production rules:\n\nNT8 -> 't6', 't3', 't0', 't5', 't10', etc.\n\nSpecifically, NT8 can produce t6, t3, t0, t5, t10, etc., directly.\n\nSo, the next token after t5 is t0. Can NT8 generate t0? Let's check NT8's productions.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n\nNT8 -> 't6', 't3', 't0', 't5', 't10', etc. So yes, NT8 can produce t0.\n\nSo, after NT4 produces t5, NT8 can produce t0. Then the next token is t10, which needs to be generated by NT8.\n\nDoes NT8 have a production for t10? Looking back, NT8's rules include NT10, which I think can produce t10. Wait, no. Wait, let's check NT8.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT8 has:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT8 NT5, etc. And in another place: NT8 -> 't6', 't3', 't0', 't5', 't10', ... Wait, no, perhaps I need to recheck.\n\nWait, in the productions listed by the user:\n\nLooking for NT8:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT8 -> something else, etc.\n\nAnd also specifically:\n\n- NT8 -> 't6' 't3'\n- Also, there's NT8 -> 't0' 't5' (wait, no, I need to look in the detailed rules.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT8's productions:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- ... and other combinations.\n\nAnd in other parts:\n\n- NT8 -> 't6' 't3' (e.g., from NT8 -> t6 t3 in some rule?)\nWait, the user mentions NT8 -> 't6' 't3' (like in NT8 rules):\n\nLooking at the grammar, yes:\n\n- NT8 -> 't6' 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't0' 't5' (No, looking back: Wait, in the grammar, there's NT8 -> NT6 NT3, and also NT8 -> NT3 NT8, and others, but I don't see a direct production for 't6 t3' and 't3 t8'.\n\nWait, perhaps in the initial string, t0 is followed by t10.\n\nSo after NT8 produces t0, the next token is t10, which must be generated by either NT8 or another non-terminal derived from NT8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT8 itself can produce a t10 through its production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a production where NT8 can produce t10. If not directly, perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT8's rules:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT3 NT8\n- NT8 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3 (again)\n- NT8 -> 't6' 't3'\n- NT8 -> 't3' 't8'?\n\nWait, no, in the user's grammar, I don't see a production like NT8 -> 't8' directly.

The string is `t0 t10 t9 t10 t7 t0 t3 t5 t2 t2 t7 t10 t0 t2 t0 t0 t5 t0 t10 t5 t0 t8 t2 t10 t0 t10 t0 t0 t3 t0 t7 t5`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, and the variables (non-terminals) are things like NT1, NT2, etc. Some of these are directly mapped to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc. \n\nLooking at the productions, I can see that each non-terminal eventually reduces to a terminal string. The string provided consists of about 35 tokens, so it's quite long. I think it's best to approach this by trying to find a path in the grammar that generates this string. But since the string is so long, maybe I can look for segments or find patterns that help.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. The start symbol S can produce three different options:\n1. NT4 NT8 \u2192 T-terminals, so I can calculate what this produces.\n2. NT1 NT2 \u2192 Again, NT1 and NT2 produce certain terminators.\n3. NT1 NT1 \u2192 Hmm, but in the string, the very first token is t0, so maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is more relevant.\n\nWait, looking at S's productions:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which would produce sequences like t0 t7, since NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5, and NT8 \u2192 t0 or t7. But the string starts with t0 t10, which doesn't fit S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is the right path.\n\nNow, NT1's production: From the rules, I see NT1 can produce several things, including NT9 NT13 and others. Let me see what NT1 could produce:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13 | NT12 NT8 | ..., but let's check the possible paths. For the string, the first token is t0, but wait, S \u2192 NT1 NT2 would mean NT1 and NT2 together. Looking at NT1's productions, some of them could directly go to terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, NT1 has a production to 't8'. In the rules: NT1 \u2192 t8. So if NT1 can directly produce t8, that's possible. But the first token is t0, so maybe that's not. Alternatively, perhaps NT1 can produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's correct. If S \u2192 NT1 NT2, and the string starts with t0, maybe NT1 can produce t0 in some way. Let me check NT1's productions. Looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8 | NT9 NT13 | other non-terminals. But in the given list, looking at NT1: It does have NT1 \u2192 t8. So if NT1 can be t8, but the string's first token is t0. Hmm, maybe this isn't the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT1 NT2 isn't the right first step. Or perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if S's first production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, which would lead to combining two non-terminals. Let's see what those could produce. For example, NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', and NT8 \u2192 't0' or 't7'. So possible initial combinations could be t0 t0, t0 t7, t5 t0, t5 t7. But the string starts with t0 t10, so none of these fit, meaning S \u2192 NT4 NT8 isn't producing the start.\n\nTherefore, the first production from S must be S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So, NT1 produces something that can generate t0, and NT2 can generate t10.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: Among them, NT1 \u2192 t8, but that doesn't fit t0. Wait, maybe NT1 can produce other combinations. Let's see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8 | NT9 NT13 | ... other combinations. So if NT1 is split into NT12 and NT8, each of which might produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT12: From the rules, NT12 \u2192 NT3 NT12 or other things. Wait, let's see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4 (since looking at the given, I see NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4). So NT12 can produce NT8 NT4. Then, if NT8 can produce 't0' or 't5', and NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5'. Hmm, but we need t10. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The string starts with t0 t10 t9 t10 t7 t0 t3 t5 t2 t2 t7 t10 t0 t2 t0 t0 t5 t0 t10 t5 t0 t8 t2 t10 t0 t10 t0 t0 t3 t0 t7 t5.\n\nThe first token is t0. Looking back, which non-terminals can produce t0?\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT2 \u2192 t2, but t2 isn't t0. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the given list, some non-terminals directly correspond to 't0'. For instance:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t0 or t5\nNT2 \u2192 t2 or t5\nNT9 \u2192 t9 or t10\nNT7 \u2192 t0 or t10\nOthers like NT13 \u2192 t2, NT13 can't produce t0. NT5 \u2192 t0 or t2. So, for example, NT5 can produce t0.\n\nSo perhaps NT5 is a source for t0. Looking, if NT1 can produce NT12 and NT8, and one of them produces a t0, maybe that's a way.\n\nWait, let me try to map the initial steps.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nSo NT1 and NT2 need to produce the first part of the string: t0 t10.\n\nSuppose NT1 produces t0 and NT2 produces t10.\n\nLooking for NT1 \u2192 t0. From the rules, does NT1 have a direct production to t0? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list of NT1's productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n\nNo, there's no direct t0 for NT1. So maybe NT2 is producing t10.\n\nWait, if NT2 can produce t10. Let's look at NT2's productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see that NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0, which is production NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0 | NT2 NT2 | NT2 NT4. So NT2 seems to produce sequences involving NT0.\n\nWait, but perhaps NT2 can produce t10 via some rule. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any NT2 \u2192 'something' that produces t10.\n\nWait, from the given rules, I don't see NT2 directly producing 't10'. Hmm. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the entire string and see if it can be parsed step by step.\n\nBut this is a long string, so maybe looking for subparts. Let me check the first few tokens: t0 t10 t9 t10.\n\nPerhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 can produce t0 via NT1 and t10 via NT2.\n\nBut since NT1 might not produce t0, maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT11 NT6 can produce it, but not sure. Maybe instead, another approach: for the given grammar, the start symbol is S, and the string starts with t0. So, let me find if S can produce t0 as the first token.\n\nLooking at S's productions: does S produce a 't0'? Well, S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Do either NT1 or NT2 produce 't0'?\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- NT7 \u2192 t0\n- NT5 \u2192 t0 (yes)\n- NT2 \u2192 t2 or t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t9 or t10\n\nSo, it seems that to produce t0 as the first token, the first non-terminal (either NT1 or NT2) must produce t0 via one of their productions.\n\nLooking at NT1: Does it produce t0? The rules for NT1 don't seem to directly produce t0; NT1's productions are combinations of non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT2: Does it directly produce t0? No, as per the rules, NT2 can produce NT0 NT0, etc., which might lead to other terminals.\n\nWait, but maybe NT2 can produce 't10' as the first token. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT1 NT2 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the terminals, which are the only symbols that can appear at the end of the derivation.\n\nFirst, I'll parse through the grammar to understand which non-terminals can produce which terminals. I'll note that all non-terminals eventually derive into a series of terminal symbols, as each rule leads to other non-terminals until a terminal is reached.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals all in lowercase, and each is one of t0, t1, ..., t14. Now, according to the grammar, each non-terminal will expand into a chain of terminals, and I'll need to see if the string can be constructed by these expansions.\n\nI'll note that the grammar seems to have various non-terminals that can produce different combinations of terminals. However, some non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NT3 directly produces 't2' and 't7', whereas others might produce several steps ending with different terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I'll try to see if the string can be broken down into the possible expansions from the grammar. I'll consider the bottom-up approach, looking for steps where terminals match the productions.\n\nFor instance, starting from the end of the string, maybe I can find rules that end with certain terminals. For example, 't5' can come from NT4, NT5, or NT12. Similarly, 't0' can come from several non-terminals like NT0, NT7, NT9, NT5, etc.\n\nBut another approach is to see if there's a way to recursively apply the grammar rules to cover each part of the string.\n\nGiven the length of the string, which is 35 terminals, the process could be quite involved. However, perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to split the string into segments that match the known productions.\n\nAlternatively, I'll consider that each production in the grammar is two symbols on the right. So when expanding a non-terminal, each derivation will split into two non-terminals, each further expanding until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is A\u2192BC, so during expansion, each step doubles the number of symbols. That suggests that the derived string is a sequence where each non-terminal contributes two symbols until terminals are reached. So the total number of symbols in the string should be a power of 2 times the initial expansion.\n\nHmm, let's check: Let's see how many symbols are in the string.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t3 t9 t0 t5 t9 t0 t0 t5 t9 t0 t9 t8 t10 t5 t7 t9 t3 t5 t5 t3 t2 t10 t7 t0 t5 t8 t0 t7 t0 t5 t5\n\nCounting them: 1,2,... 35. 35 is not a power of two plus one or any multiplication that follows the CNF structure's split. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of symbols at each step doubles. Therefore, the total number of symbols in the string should be 2^k for some k, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nBut S initially can branch into NT4 NT4, or perhaps other combinations, but let's count the number of terminals in the string. It's 35. 35 is not a power of two. The nearest power of two is 32 (2^5). 35 is 3 more than 32, so this suggests that it's impossible because each expansion doubles the count. So the string length must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 etc. Since 35 is not a power of two, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 35 terminals, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step of expansion doubles the number of symbols. Therefore, the string length must be a power of two, but 35 is not.  \n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t0 t7 t5 t5 t10 t2 t5 t2 t2 t5 t1 t5 t0 t7 t7 t9 t3 t4 t0 t10 t7 t7 t0 t5 t0 t3 t9 t5 t2 t3 t3 t2 t2`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. CNF means every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Let me scan through the productions to see the non-terminals and the terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice some rules that directly produce terminals. For example, `NT3 -> 't5'`, `NT10 -> 't1'`, and so on. These are the terminal symbols that can't be broken down further.\n\nThe string starts with `t0`, so I need to find if `S` can derive this through a series of productions. The start symbol is `S`, which has the following productions:\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- S -> NT4 NT11\n- S -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the first step is to expand `S` into one of these options. Let's consider each case.\n\nFirst case: S -> NT4 NT8\n- NT4: Looking at productions, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or 't7'. The first symbol of the string is 't0', so let's choose NT4 -> 't0'.\n- Now, the next part after NT4 is NT8. So, we need to expand NT8.\n\nNT8 can produce 't6', 't3', 't0', 't1', or 't5' based on its productions. The next symbol in the string after 't0' is 't7'. But wait, NT8 doesn't directly produce 't7'. So, perhaps I took the wrong path. Maybe I should choose a different NT4.\n\nAlternatively, let's see NT8's productions: \n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3 (which could be 't9' from NT9, which is 't9' and NT6 -> 't3')\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me look at NT8 again. From the grammar, NT8 can produce various combinations like NT6 NT3, NT7 NT7, etc. Each of these can further break down into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar rules, step by step, trying to match each symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree step by step, ensuring that each production leads to the correct terminals.\n\nStarting with S, let's see which production to take.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT4 NT8. If NT4 is 't0', then the string starts with t0, which matches.\n\nNow, NT8 needs to produce the rest of the string after t0. The next symbol is t7.\n\nBut looking at NT8's productions:\n\n- NT8 can produce NT6 NT3 or other combinations, but none directly produce t7. So perhaps this path is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S->NT1 NT2. Let's try that.\n\nS -> NT1 NT2.\n\nNT1 can produce 't8', 't1', 't9', etc. The first symbol is 't0', so perhaps this is not the right path.\n\nAnother option: S->NT4 NT11.\n\nNT4 can be 't0', and NT11 would produce the rest. So let's try this.\n\nS->NT4 NT11. NT4 is 't0', so first symbol is matched. Now, NT11 needs to produce the string starting from t7.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions: NT11 -> NT8 NT5, NT11 -> NT3 NT11, others are not relevant here.\n\nSo, NT11 can be expanded into NT8 NT5.\n\nNow, the string after t0 is t7 t5, so let's see:\n\nFirst, we have NT11 as NT8 NT5.\n\nNT8 can produce 't6' (from NT8->NT6 NT3, and since NT3 is 't5'), but wait:\n\nWait, let's parse NT11.\n\nFrom NT11:\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5.\n\nNow, we have to see what NT8 and NT5 produce.\n\nNT8 can be NT6 NT3. NT6 is NT9 NT7. NT9 is 't0'. NT7 is 't10'. So NT6 is 't0 t10'. So NT8 would become 't0 t10 t5' because NT5 is 't5'.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm not breaking it down correctly.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to break down each step more carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\nThe string is t0 t7 t5 t5 t10... and so on.\n\nWe need to find a way to derive this string using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use a top-down parsing method, specifically the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, maybe I can try to find a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by substituting non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nThe first symbol is t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t0 can be produced by:\n\n- NT3 -> 't5'? Wait, no, NT3 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe terminals in the grammar are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t4 (which is a variable, not a terminal). Wait, no, in the rules, 't0' is a terminal. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals are:\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4: So NT14 is a non-terminal because it contains NT3 and NT4. Wait, no, it's part of a production; some NTs produce terminals and others don't.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's list all the rules and identify terminal symbols.\n\nTerminals are the symbols that eventually produce string literals, not non-terminals. So, to find which are terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT3 produces 't5'\n\n- NT10 produces 't1'\n\n- NT13 produces 't2'\n\n- NT12 produces 't3'\n\n- NT8 produces 't6'\n\n- NT5 produces 't0'\n\n- NT7 produces 't10'\n\n- NT9 produces 't9'\n\n- NT4 produces 't0' or 't5'\n\nWait, let's list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13: No terminal here.\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2: NT2 is 't2'\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nSo 't2' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, the terminals are:\n\n- t0: produced by NT4, NT9, certain others?\n\nLooking back:\n\nEach production that has a terminal on the RHS.\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4: No terminal yet.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT3 -> 't7'\n\nYes, NT3 produces 't7'.\n\nNT5 -> 't0'\n\nYes, NT5 -> 't0'\n\nNT7 -> 't0'\n\nNT7 -> 't9'\n\nWait, no, NT7's rules are:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT7: Both non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal symbols based on the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't7'\n\n- NT5 -> 't0'\n\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n\n- NT7 -> 't0' (from NT7 -> 't0')\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT7:\n\nNT7 -> NT5 NT7: No terminal.\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6: No terminal.\n\nWait, no, NT7 also has:\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6?\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7: No terminal.\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6: Wait, NT11 and NT6 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side (RHS). The start symbol is S. The string given consists entirely of terminal symbols with no spaces, making it easier to parse step by step.\n\nMy approach will be to try to derive the string step by step using the grammar rules. If I can successfully reduce the string to the start symbol S, the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me first write down the grammar rules for clarity. I'll focus on the non-terminal symbols and their possible productions.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S, the top-level productions are:\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, S can expand into two non-terminals. The string starts with \"t5\", which is a terminal. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't5'. Looking through the productions, I see NT4 and NT2 have rules that result in 't5' in the end.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions:\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't4', 't5' (multiple options)\nBut it's more precise to check each rule where the RHS leads directly to terminal symbols. For example, NT4 has a rule that directly terminals, but looking at the rules, most of NT4's productions involve other non-terminals except for one rule that might have a terminal. Wait, let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT4 has:\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- NT4 \u2192 t4\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\nSo, NT4 can produce 't5' directly. Similarly, NT2 has:\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\nSo, NT2 can produce 't5' directly.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't5', which can be produced by NT4 or NT2. Let's assume it's produced by NT4. So, moving forward, after 't5', the next symbol is 't10'. So, after the initial 't5', we need to produce 't10'. \n\nWait, but the initial expansion of S would be either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So, for the initial step, if S expands to NT4 NT8, then each of these two non-terminals needs to produce a string that starts with 't5 t10 t5...', which is the case here.\n\nLet me try expanding S as NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the current string is t5, and the next part is t10, t5, etc. Let me see what each 't' could correspond to.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial production S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, NT4 can produce 't5' directly, and NT8 can produce 't6', 't3', 't9', etc. Wait, NT8's productions are:\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't9', etc. Let me check all NT8 productions.\n\nLooking back, I see NT8's productions are:\n1. NT8 \u2192 t6\n2. NT8 \u2192 t3\n3. NT8 \u2192 t9\n4. NT8 \u2192 t0\n5. NT8 \u2192 t6\n6. NT8 \u2192 t3\n7. NT8 \u2192 t5\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the grammar shows multiple rules for NT8, but let me parse them correctly.\n\nFrom the grammar provided, NT8's productions are:\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' (from rule NT8 \u2192 t6 NT11)\nWait, no, that's not right. Looking at the detailed grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions for NT8:\n\n- From the grammar, NT8 has productions like:\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT9\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check.\n\nActually, looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal's productions. Let me list all the rules for each non-terminal, focusing on the ones that can produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT4:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT4 has:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, NT4 can directly produce 't0', 't4', or 't5'; similarly, NT2 can directly produce 't2' or 't5'.\n\nNow, the first symbol is 't5', which can come from NT4 or NT2. Let's try one path and see if it works.\n\nLet me choose NT4 \u2192 't5' as the first step. So, the first symbol is 't5', and now the remaining string starts with 't10 t5 t5 t5 t3...'.\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the NT4 produces 't5', and now we need NT8 to produce the rest of the string starting with 't10 t5...'.\n\nSo, NT8's productions: Let me check what NT8 can do. Looking back, NT8's productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT8:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT10\n- NT8 \u2192 NT7 NT10\n- NT8 \u2192 NT13 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT12\n- NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT12\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nWait, no, maybe I misread the grammar. Wait, looking through the rules, NT8 has several productions, some leading to other non-terminals, but I'm looking for a production that ends up in 't10'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT8's rules that produce terminals. Let me check each production for NT8:\n\nLooking carefully, I see NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Neither NT6 nor NT3 are terminals. NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT7: same. NT8 \u2192 NT0 NT8: recursive. NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5: NT1 is another non-terminal. NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT7: no. NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT9: same. NT8 \u2192 NT3 NT5: same. NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT13: same. Wait, looking back through the grammar provided, perhaps I'm missing a production where NT8 directly produces a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe in the grammar, some of the rule RHS include just a terminal. Let me check again. For example, looking through the grammar, perhaps NT8 \u2192 't10'?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see NT10 \u2192 't1', but I don't see NT8 directly producing 't10'. So perhaps 't10' is produced via another non-terminal, like NT2 or NT10. Wait, in the grammar, NT10 can produce 't1' or 't6' directly, and through other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a way that the 't10' is produced by some other non-terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the string, after 't5' comes 't10', so perhaps the NT8 expansion would include NT2, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should take a different approach. Let me consider all possible ways S can produce the string. Since the string starts with 't5', the expansion from S must first go to NT4 or NT2. Let me try the other option, that S expands to NT2 NT5.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S starts as NT4 NT8. So, after the initial 't5', the next step is to generate the rest of the string, starting with 't10'.

It's specified in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to parse it backwards to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the possible productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSince the string starts with \"t8\" and ends with \"t10\", I should check which of these options can lead to the beginning of the string.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8 first. The string starts with \"t8\", so NT4 must expand to something that starts with \"t8\". Looking at the productions for NT4, I see NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT11 and NT4 \u2192 't0' (twice), 't5', and 't7'. Wait, actually, looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, NT4 has these productions:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT4 \u2192 't0' (twice), 't5', 't7'\n\nWait no, looking again: The user provided the grammar, and I see:\nNT4 -> 't0' (twice) and NT4 -> 't5' etc. But looking more closely, for example:\nNT4 \u2192 't0' (twice), so 't0' is a terminal, and NT5 \u2192 't0', but perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT4 has the following productions:\nLooking up:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT4 -> 't0' \nWait, no, in the grammar provided, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't0' (that's one)\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar carefully.\n\nLooking for NT4:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\nSo NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or 't7'. So in the given string, the first symbol is 't8', which is not generated by NT4's productions. So this means that the first step cannot be S \u2192 NT4 NT8 because that would require NT4 to produce 't8', which isn't possible. So perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is the way to go.\n\nWait, no, let's see: S can produce either NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. The string starts with 't8', which would be produced by NT4, but that's only if S \u2192 NT4 NT8. But NT4 can't produce 't8', so that path is closed. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the start symbol S's productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar S has two options:\n1) S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2) S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nThe string starts with 't8', so for S \u2192 NT4 NT8, NT8 must produce 't8'. But wait, checking the NT8 productions: looking for NT8's rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT8 has:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n- NT8 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (twice)\nWait, but in NT8's productions, I don't see any that produce 't8'. Because I think the rules for NT8 are actually:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT8 -> 't6' ... Wait, actually in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, for NT8, the productions are:\n- NT8 -> 't6'\\]\nWait no, let me look back. The user provided the grammar in a list, so I have to parse it carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try a different approach: perhaps the string is such that when we split it into parts that correspond to the grammar's non-terminals, it can form a reduction.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can split it into groups that match the non-terminal productions.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string backward using the grammar's productions.\n\nSo, the last symbol is 't10'. So we need to check which non-terminal can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at all the NT rules, the terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\nFrom the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' or 't5' (Wait, looking through the grammar:\nLooking at all the productions, the terminals are:\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4'\n- NT10 \u2192 't3', 't6'\n- etc.\n\nSo the last symbol is 't10', which can be produced by NT0 or maybe another non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't10' is a rule, and NT0 \u2192 't4' is another. So the last symbol 't10' can be produced by NT0.\n\nSo the last step in the derivation would be NT0 \u2192 't10'.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT0 has several productions, including NT0 \u2192 't4' and others. So 't10' is produced by NT0, so the last step is S \u2192 NT0, but wait, S's productions are NT4 NT8 and NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, no. S can produce NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2, but in this case, the string starts with 't8', which would require the first production S \u2192 NT4 NT8. But NT8 can't produce 't8'. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, no, the first production S \u2192 NT4 NT8 produces two symbols: NT4 and NT8. The entire string starts with 't8', so the first two symbols would need to be NT8. Wait no, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would mean that the entire string is the concatenation of NT4 NT8's expansion. So 't8' would have to be the first symbol in NT8's expansion.\n\nBut is there a production of NT8 that starts with 't8'? Looking back, in the grammar rules, I don't see any NT8 production starting with 't8'. So perhaps S \u2192 NT1 NT2 is the correct initial step.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT1 NT2: Let's see if that can generate the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't8', so for NT2 to produce 't8', but looking at NT2's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT2 has:\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 (as terminal)\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (Wait, looking back: NT2's productions are 't5' and 't7' and 't5' again?)\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT2's productions include:\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' \n- NT2 \u2192 't7' \n- etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the specific NT2 rules are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2' \nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2' (Is that a terminal?)\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, for example, NT2 has:\n\nFrom the grammar, the relevant part is:\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the grammar rules are written as:\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\nNT2 -> NT5 \nNT2 -> 't2'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nWait, perhaps I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-677","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar and the string to have everything clear. The string is:\nt5 t0 t5 t10 t9 t2 t5 t5 t3 t5 t0 t0 t5 t2 t5 t3 t3 t9 t9 t3 t9 t3 t6 t6 t5 t2 t0 t5 t0 t0 t4 t10 t3 t5 t7.\n\nThe grammar has several non-terminals, which I'll list out as S, NT1, NT2, ..., NT14, etc. Each non-terminal has productions that can be used to expand the structure of the string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string must consist of a sequence of terminals that can be derived step by step through the productions. Each production in CNF has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right-hand side. This structure suggests that the parse tree will be binary, as each production splits into two parts.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the grammar to see which non-terminals produce which terminals. It might help to create a mapping from each non-terminal to the terminals they can derive.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT13 can produce 't2', 't3', 't4'.\n- NT10 can produce 't1', 't6'.\n- NT9 can produce 't0', 't9'.\n- NT7 can produce 't0', 't7', 't10'.\n- NT8 can produce 't0', 't5', 't6'.\n- NT1 can produce 't8', 't13'.\n- NT2 can produce 't2', 't5', 't7'.\n- NT3 can produce 't2', 't7', 't9'.\n- NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', 't7'.\n- NT5 can produce 't0', 't2', 't5'.\n- NT0 can produce 't4', 't5', 't6', 't9', 't10', 't11', 't13'.\n- NT6 can produce 't3', 't9', 't11'.\n- NT7 can produce 't0', 't5', 't10', etc.\n- NT9 can produce 't0', 't9'.\n- NT11 can produce 't0', 't3', etc.\n- NT14 can produce 't3', 't4'.\n\nLooking deeper, some non-terminals might generate more complex structures, but I think the key is to see if the entire string can be broken down into a sequence of these terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is quite long, 40 tokens. Let's see how many steps are needed. Since each production expands to two non-terminals or a terminal, the parse tree will be a binary tree. So the number of nodes in the tree will be 2^n -1, where n is the number of layers. But I'm not sure that helps directly; I'll try a different approach.\n\nI can attempt to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S, and see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the following productions:\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- S -> NT4 NT11\n- S -> NT1 NT2\n\nI'll have to choose one of these to start with. Let's pick S -> NT4 NT8, as it's the first one.\n\nSo, S sends us to NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, I need to parse 't5 t0 t5 t10 t9 t2 t5 t5 t3 t5 t0 t0 t5 t2 t5 t3 t3 t9 t9 t3 t9 t3 t6 t6 t5 t2 t0 t5 t0 t0 t4 t10 t3 t5 t7' as the combination of NT4 and NT8.\n\nFirst, NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', 't7'. Let's see if any of these match the first token 't5'. Yes, NT4 can produce 't5'. So we match 't5' with NT4. That leaves us with the remaining string: ['t0', 't5', 't10', 't9', 't2', ... 't7'].\n\nNow, the next part is NT8. Let's see what NT8 can produce. NT8 can produce 't0', 't5', 't6'. The next token is 't0', which NT8 can produce. So we match 't0' with NT8, leaving the rest of the string: ['t5', 't10', 't9', 't2', ... 't7'].\n\nSo now, the string is parsed as S -> NT4 -> t5, NT8 -> t0.\n\nNext, the remaining string starts with 't5'. We need to parse the rest of the string as NT4 and NT8? Wait, no. Wait: when we split S into NT4 and NT8, each of these can be non-terminals, and each can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAfter matching NT4 to 't5', we have NT8 left to process. But we already processed NT8 for the next token. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me structure this better.\n\nWait, S expands to NT4 NT8, so the entire string is a sequence of terms generated from NT4 and NT8. So the parsing is that the entire string is derived from NT4 followed by NT8.\n\nWait, maybe that's not correct. In CNF, each production is in the form of two non-terminals or a terminal. So S can only directly produce two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and something else? No, in CNF, the productions are A -> BC or A -> a. So each production in the start symbol will be expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo when we start with S -> NT4 NT8, the first part is NT4, which must expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, and the second part is NT8, which must expand into another sequence.\n\nBut how? Because the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT4 and NT8.\n\nSo, let me think. The string after 't5' (from NT4) is 't0 t5 t10 t9 t2 t5 t5 t3 t5 t0 t0 t5 t2 t5 t3 t3 t9 t9 t3 t9 t3 t6 t6 t5 t2 t0 t5 t0 t0 t4 t10 t3 t5 t7'. But the first part after S is NT4 (t5) and NT8 (t0), so perhaps the remaining string should be treated as the expansion of NT8 followed by something? I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this recursively. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production in the left side (LHS) of a rule determines the structure. So starting with S, which can be NT4 NT8, I need to process the entire string as the concatenation of the derivations of NT4 and NT8.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't5', which is the expansion of NT4. So the rest of the string after 't5' should be the expansion of NT8.\n\nBut the next token is 't0', which matches NT8's production of 't0'. So that's good. Now, the rest of the string after 't5 t0' is: ['t5', 't10', 't9', 't2', ... 't7'].\n\nNow, the entire string is t5 followed by t0 followed by the remaining string. But wait, S is NT4 NT8, so the expansion must be NT4's expansion followed by NT8's expansion. So after matching t5 (NT4), the next part should be NT8's expansion, which starts with t0, then the rest should be NT8's expansion.\n\nSo after t5 t0, the remaining string is 't5 t10 t9 t2 ... t7'. We need to process this string as the expansion of NT8.\n\nBut let's check NT8's productions. NT8 can produce:\n\n- t0\n- t5\n- t6\n- Also, if there are non-terminals, but let's check:\n\nLooking back, the rules for NT8 are:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT13\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT13 again?

Hmm, this seems a bit daunting at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal, but in this case, the start symbol S produces combinations of non-terminals like NT4 NT8, etc.\n\nEach non-terminal eventually resolves to a terminal symbol (the 't' and numbers) according to the rules. My goal is to see if the given string can be generated by this grammar. To do that, I need to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals step by step according to the rules.\n\nBut how? Maybe I can approach this by looking at the structure of the string and seeing if the sequence of non-terminals could lead to it. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed according to the grammar, which would involve applying the productions in reverse, starting from the string and breaking it down until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string from left to right, trying to apply the rules step by step. Let's consider both approaches.\n\nFirst, let me write down the productions again to see the connections between non-terminals:\n\n- S -> NT4 NT8\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n- NT10 -> NT1 NT1\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT7 -> NT12 NT9\n- NT11 -> NT3 NT11\n- NT13 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT11\n- NT11 -> NT7 NT11\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12\n- NT7 -> NT1 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT12 NT8\n- NT12 -> NT8 NT4\n- NT14 -> NT3 NT4\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT10\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT10 NT2\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT4\n- NT12 -> NT3 NT12\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT13\n- NT1 -> NT7 NT14\n- NT0 -> NT10 NT10\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT10 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't6'\n- NT9 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't0'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT10 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't8'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT7 -> 't0'\n- NT8 -> 't0'\n- NT0 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't4'\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n\nOkay, that's a lot. Now, looking at the string, it's a sequence of 't's and numbers. Each terminal should correspond to a production where a non-terminal resolves to a single terminal. So let's start by breaking down the string into possible segments that might match these terminals.\n\nLooking at the first term: t10. From the productions, NT10 is two terminals, either 't1' or 't6'. But wait, NT10's production only has these, but in the given grammar, I see NT10 -> 't1' or 't6'. But in the string, we have t10 as a single token? That seems conflicting because in the grammar, NT10 only resolves to 't1' or 't6', not 't10'. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, is there an NT called 'T10' or 'T0'? Let me check the productions. Oh, NT10 is either 't1' or 't6', but there's no NT10 -> 't10' production. So if the string starts with t10, but the grammar doesn't have a rule where NT10 becomes 't10', that suggests that the string cannot be generated because 't10' can't be derived from any non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, I see Nterminals like NT13, NT10, etc., but not NT10. Maybe the string's 't10' doesn't correspond to any NT. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT9 -> 't0', NT4-> 't0', NT4->'t5', NT2->'t2', NT10->'t1' or 't6', etc. I don't see a production where any NT10 -> 't10'. So 't10' in the string can't be produced by any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the string is invalid because it contains a 't10' which isn't produced by any non-terminal.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. The string is \"t10 t8 t0 t0...\", so the first symbol is 't10'. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce 't10' according to the grammar. Looking through the productions, none of the NTs produce 't10'. For example, NT10 is either 't1' or 't6', not 't10'. So the presence of 't10' in the string means the grammar cannot generate it since there's no production that leads to 't10'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows multiple steps, but I'm not seeing a way to get 't10' as a terminal. Each production must resolve to terminals, so if none of the non-terminals produce 't10', then 't10' can't be in the string.\n\nTherefore, my initial thought is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it contains 't10', which isn't a terminal in any production rule.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, perhaps 't10' is a typo, and the actual intended symbol was 't6' or 't1'\u2014those are present. Alternatively, maybe the grammar has a way to generate 't10' through other means, but looking at the rules again, no NT's production includes 't10'. So no, 't10' isn't a terminal.\n\nSo, given that, the answer is 'No'.

The grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. The starting symbol is S, and the productions are from various non-terminals (T1, T4, T7, etc.) to combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI notice that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5', which are terminals. The rest are non-terminals that produce other non-terminals.\n\nThe given string consists of a series of terminals, so my approach should be to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree for any string should be a binary tree where each node corresponds to a production step, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nGiven the string's length, it's quite long (35 tokens), so manually parsing it might be time-consuming. Instead, I can use a top-down parsing method, trying to break down the string from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't8', which suggests looking at the productions that result in 't8'.

Wait, NT12 has a production like NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4. Hmm, perhaps not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the productions for 't8' come from some NT. Let me see: 't8' appears in NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', 't5', etc. But in the string, the first symbol is 't8', so we need a production that can generate 't8' as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produce 't8'. So that's a problem because the first symbol is 't8', which should come from a production that starts with 't8'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking at all NT productions:\n\nWait, let me list all the productions to find if any non-terminal produces 't8':\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13\n- NT10 \u2192 NT1 NT1\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- NT13 \u2192 NT3 NT12\n- NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT11\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8 <-- Wait, this is for NT0. But NT0 is written as 'NT0' in the productions, but in the string, it's 't0'. Similarly, NT4 is 't4', but 't4' is actually 't4' in the string? Wait no, the string is given as various 't' followed by numbers. Let me check: the string is `t8 t7 t2 t5 t10 t3 t2 t0 t2 t9 t10 t3 t10 t0 t10 t9 t3 t0 t3 t3 t0 t10 t10 t2 t0 t3 t3 t5 t5 t7 t10 t2 t0 t3 t9 t3`.\n\nSo, all symbols are lowercase 't' followed by digits.

The string is pretty long, and the grammar has a bunch of rules. I'm a bit nervous because parsing can get tricky, especially with so many non-terminals. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of production rules (S \u2192 ...), and each rule is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which is Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t7 t9 t9 t9 t10 t3 t4 t0 t5 t2 t0 t2 t0 t0 t0 t5 t0 t4 t10 t8 t0 t3 t2 t5 t0 t7 t0 t3 t6 t0 t2 t0 t0 t5 t7 t0`.\n\nMy plan is to try to parse the string from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules. Parsing can be done using methods like recursive descent or using a parsing table, but since the string is quite long, I might need to look for patterns or the structure that could help me break it down.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. The grammar has three productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, starting from S, the string must begin with the concatenation of two non-terminals. Let me see if the string starts with any of these pairs.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t7. Now, I need to see which production starts with NT4, NT1, or NT2.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT4 can produce t0, t5, etc., but from S, it's NT4 followed by NT8 or NT11 or NT2.\n\nWait, let me check the first rule: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. So, for S, the first part is NT4 and the second is NT8. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t7, which isn't directly part of NT4's productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In the grammar, each NT is a non-terminal, and each production for an NT leads to other NTs or terminal symbols. For example, NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, and so on. The end symbols are the 't's. So I think the parsing is more like the top-down approach where we expand the start symbol S into the string.\n\nLet me see what S can produce in terms of terminals. Wait, actually, S is a non-terminal that expands into two other non-terminals. So the generated string will be the result of expanding these non-terminals into terminal symbols using the productions.\n\nI'm a bit confused because each NT is a non-terminal that can expand into two more NTs or a terminal. So to parse the string, I'll need to see if each part can be derived from an NT.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t7. So which NT can produce t7? Let me scan the grammar rules for NTs ending with t7.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT7 has a production: NT7 \u2192 't0', NT7 \u2192 't10', etc. Wait, actually, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't9'\n\nWhich I don't see exactly, but looking back:\n\nLooking for 't7', I think there's a rule like NT14 \u2192 't3' and other t's, but I don't see any NT that directly produce 't7'. Wait, let's check the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT2 has a production to 't2' and others. NT14 \u2192 't3', NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc. Wait, let me see:\n\nI think I might have made a mistake because in the rules, I think NT2 can produce 't2' but also, for example, NT2 \u2192 't2' (from the rule at the end where NT2: 't2').\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t7, so perhaps the first NT in S's production is NT1, because NT1's productions include 't8' and 't13', but not t7. Wait, maybe none of the NTs can directly produce t7. Hmm, that would be a problem because the string starts with t7, and I need to see if any NT can produce t7.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all the NT rules to see which NTs end with 't7'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't9' (I think the rules mention NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc., but in the terminal rules, I don't see 't7' being produced directly by any NT.)\n\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, I don't see any NTs that produce 't7' as a terminal. That's a problem because the first token in the string is 't7'. So if none of the NTs can produce 't7', then that would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar. But that seems too easy. Am I missing something?\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me re-examine the grammar rules to make sure none of the NTs have a production that ends with 't7'.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- S: starts with NT4 and others, but these are non-terminals.\n- NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13; NT13 can produce 't2', 't4', 't6', 't5', etc.\n- NT2: NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', 'NT2 NT4', etc.\n- NT3: 't2' and others.\n- NT4: 't0', 't5' directly, and others involving non-terminals.\n- NT5: 't0' and others.\n- NT7: 't0', 't10', 't9'.\nWait, but in the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't7'.\n\nSo if none of the NTs directly produce 't7', then the start symbol S can't produce the string because the first token is 't7', which isn't in any NT's production. So that would mean the answer is 'No', but I feel like I'm missing something because maybe NT7 can produce 't7', but looking back:\n\nWait, in the NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', etc., but no 't7'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the NT7 rules. Let me re-examine the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 is defined as NT9 NT1 and NT7 in some places, but looking at the end symbols, I don't see 't7'.\n\nSo, in the grammar, the terminal symbols are things like t0, t1, t2, etc., but there's no 't7' as a terminal, meaning no NT can directly produce 't7'. Therefore, the string can't start with 't7', so it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but am I sure about that? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me confirm.\n\nIn the provided grammar, the end symbols (terminals) are the 't's, but looking through each rule, I don't see any NT that ends with 't7'. So unless I'm missing a production, which I don't think I am, then 't7' can't be a terminal, hence the string starting with t7 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No', because the grammar doesn't have any production for any non-terminal to 't7' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-717","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by it. The string is pretty long, so I think the best approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for such cases. Let me recall how the CYK algorithm works.\n\nFirst, I'll lay out the grammar rules for reference to make sure I don't get lost. The start symbol is S, and the grammar seems quite complex with multiple non-terminals leading to terminals. The string given is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, and I need to check if this sequence is a valid derivation from the grammar.\n\nCYK works by constructing a table where each entry C[i,j] represents whether the substring from position i to j can be derived from the start symbol. Alternatively, since we know our start symbol is S, each entry C[i,j] should be whether the substring can be rewritten starting from S.\n\nGiven that, I'll start by noting the length of the string. The string has 44 tokens, so N=44. The CYK table will be a (N+1)x(N+1) table, but in practice, we can just track the relevant ranges.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can simplify things. Let me look at the grammar and see if any of the rules directly produce 't's or if I can find any production that leads directly to terms in the string. Sometimes, if none of the productions start with a terminal, CYK isn't the easiest approach, but in this case, many of the non-terminals do produce terminals. For example, NT4 is 't0' or 't5', NT2 is 't2', etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach might be to try to parse the string using the grammar's productions, seeing if each part can be generated step by step. Let me also note that in Chomsky normal form, all productions are left-linear or right-linear, so each rule has exactly one non-terminal on the left and two on the right, or a terminal.\n\nWait, but CYK can handle all of that. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to process the string from left to right and for each substring, determine the possible non-terminals that can derive it. Since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to try to find a sequence of replacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a simpler approach would be to see if each token in the string can be matched directly or through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t7 t0 t9 t0 t9 t0 t8 t10 t5 t0 t10 t2 t5 t9 t2 t2 t2 t0 t5 t5 t7 t5 t2 t2 t5 t0 t7 t0 t0 t5 t10 t1 t7 t0 t10 t5 t7.\n\nI can try to look for repeated patterns. For example, let's look for the sequence t7 t0 t9 t0 t9 t0 t8 t10 t5 t0 t10 t2 t5 t9 t2 t2 t2 t0 t5 t5 t7 t5 t2 t2 t5 t0 t7 t0 t0 t5 t10 t1 t7 t0 t10 t5 t7.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe I can break it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me see some of the NT rules:\n\nS produces NT4 NT8 or other combinations. Then NT11, NT7, etc., produce other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find a starting point. Let's see the first token is t7. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 can produce 't0' or 't10' (since there's a production NT7 -> 't0' and NT7->'t10'). Hmm, not exactly the first token being t7, but wait, in the string, the first token is t7. Does any production produce t7?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce t7. Wait, let me check the list.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT1->'t8'\n- NT9->'t0'\n- NT4->'t0'\n- NT4->'t5'\n- NT2->'t2'\n- NT10->'t6'\n- NT2->'t5'\n- NT1->'t8'\n- NT9->'t9'\n- NT7->'t0'\n- NT8->'t0'\n- NT0->'t10'\n- NT0->'t4'\n- NT13->'t2'\n- NT5->'t0'\n- NT7->'t10'\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't7'. So that would mean the string starts with t7, which isn't directly a production of any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that produce 't7'. For example, checking NT3, NT4... \n\nWait, in fact, looking at the NT3 productions:\n\n- NT3-> 't2'\n- NT3-> NT7 NT1\n- Also, looking at other NT3 rules, none seem to generate t7. So perhaps 't7' is not in the language at all.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the rules. Maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking through the list, for example:\n\n- NT1->'t8'\n- NT9->'t0' and 't9'\n- NT4->'t0' and 't5'\n- NT2->'t2', 't5'\n- NT10->'t6', 't1'?\nWait, no, looking at the grammar: NT10->'t6', and other rules.\n\nWait, no, looking back, it's possible that I've overlooked a rule.\n\nLooking at the rules again, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\nNT13 -> 't2' and NT5 NT12\nNT11->'t3' and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't7'.\n\nLooking through all the terminals in the rules:\n\nI see 't0' appears multiple times, 't5', 't2', 't9', etc., but 't7' is not mentioned. So if 't7' is the first token, then since no production ends with 't7', the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 't7' is derived from some combination. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce 't7' through a left derivation.\n\nLooking at the rules, none of the NT6, NT7, NT8, etc., directly produce 't7'. So maybe it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT7: I see NT7->NT9 NT7 (a left recursion). But that doesn't produce 't7', just NT9 and NT7. So that can't be the first token.\n\nSo, the string starts with t7, but none of the NTs derive t7. Hence, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the rules.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT7:\n\nNT7 -> nt9 nt7?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the lines are:\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nWait, that's a left recursive rule. But does that produce any terminal directly? No, because NT9 -> 't0' or 't9', which are terminals. So if I have NT7 -> NT9 NT7, then a derivation could go NT7 -> NT9 NT7, and if the second NT7 can become a terminal? Wait, no, because NT7 can't produce a terminal. So a left-recursive rule for NT7 would produce t9 followed by more t9s and NT7s, but since NT7 can't produce a terminal, that's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that rule is used in a way that allows for termination. But in this case, it seems that the left-recursive rule leads to a non-terminal that can't produce a terminal. So that production might not be useful for generating any strings ending with t7.\n\nTherefore, considering that the first token is t7, which can't be generated by any production in the grammar, the string is not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't7', and none of the grammar's non-terminals directly produce 't7'.

I should check if the string can be derived starting from S and ending with the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nI'll check if either of these can be expanded to the given string.\n\nBut since S produces only non-terminals and terminals, perhaps it's better to approach this with a parsing method like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm just supposed to determine yes or no, maybe a top-down approach is feasible, but it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to analyze if each step of the string uses valid productions.\n\nAlso, I notice that some NT symbols have productions that expand into a single terminal or another non-terminal. For example, NT3 -> 't5', so if a production uses NT3, it directly becomes 't5'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't5'. Let me see if any production leads to 't5'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 -> 't5', so if a production leads to 't5', it must be through NT3.\n\nLooking at the string, the entire string is t5 followed by a series of t's and t's, so perhaps the first t5 comes from NT3. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t5, so maybe S eventually expands to t5 through some path. But S in the initial productions only starts with NT1 and NT2. Hmm, maybe the initial step is to look for S's possible expansions and see if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me try to find a parsing path.\n\nStarting with S, which can be:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nLooking at the string, the first t5 is the first symbol. Maybe S's production has a t5 after several steps.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to see all terminal symbols in the string and see if they can be derived from S.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first symbol is t5, which is produced by NT3. So somewhere in the derivation, NT3 must be involved.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 is defined as:\n\nNT3 -> 't5'\n\nSo, for a t5, NT3 must be the immediate parent.\n\nBut how is NT3 derived? Let me check the grammar for NT3.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules are many, so I need to see if NT3 is a non-terminal that can be expanded further.\n\nWait, from the provided grammar, NT3 only has one production: NT3 -> 't5'.\n\nSo NT3 can't be derived further; it's a terminal. So any occurrence of NT3 must be replaced by 't5'. So in the string, every t5 must be directly from NT3.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t5, so perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 ... which eventually produces a t5. But looking at S's initial productions, they all go to NTx NTy. So S is a non-terminal that can only produce two NT productions. So S can't directly produce a t5; S must be expanded to NT4 NT8, etc., and then those NTs must produce the terminals.\n\nSo for example, if S \u2192 NT1 NT2, maybe NT1 and NT2 can be expanded to t5 or something else. But in the initial productions, NT1 and NT2 have more complex rules.\n\nWait, let me look at each of S's possible initial productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo any string derived from S must start with the terminals produced by NT4 and NT8, NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t5, which is not t4 or t8. So none of these initial productions start with t5. So perhaps none of the initial S productions can derive a t5 as the first symbol, which suggests that the string may not be in the language.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case, because S can lead to other NTs, which perhaps can derive t5 after expanding further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check NT1 and NT2.\n\nNT1 has productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT1 \u2192 NT2 NT1\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 NT2 NT4\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, in NT2, one of the productions is NT2 \u2192 't2'. So t2 can be derived directly from NT2.\n\nBut in the string, t5 comes first, so if S can derive t5 via NT2, perhaps that's possible. However, S starts with NT1, NT2, so to get t5, the NT must expand to t5, but let's check how each NT can derive t5.\n\nLooking at NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n...\nNT4 has multiple expansions, but one of them is NT4 \u2192 't0', another 't5', another 't4' etc. So from NT4, 't5' is directly produced.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 can produce 't5' via some expansion.\n\nWait, so in the initial productions of S, if any NT (like NT4, NT11, or NT1, NT2) can derive a t5 that would be the first symbol, that would start the string with t5.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is t5, so S's expansion must generate that.\n\nLet me check if any production starting from S can lead to the first t5.\n\nLooking at S's first option: S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, NT4 can be 't5', NT8 can be something else.

First, I remember that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have production rules that are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either pairs of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a series of terminals: t7 t0 t0 t10 t10 t2 t0 t3 t9 t0 t4 t9 t7 t0 t5 t7 t9 t9 t0 t2 t2 t5 t0 t9 t10 t3 t3 t0 t0 t3 t10 t3 t0 t5 t3 t6 t3 t2. That's 38 tokens, so the derivation needs to start from S and expand to exactly these tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S, it can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's break this down. If S \u2192 NT4 NT8, then we have two parts to derive. NT4 and NT8 each might produce more, but let's check if they can directly lead to any of the terminals or if we need to expand further.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals NT4 and NT8:\n- NT4 has productions like NT14 NT7, NT4 \u2192 t0, NT4 \u2192 t5. So if we can derive from NT4 a terminal, that might help.\n- NT8 has productions like NT6 NT3, NT8 \u2192 t0, NT8 \u2192 t1, NT8 \u2192 t5, etc.\n\nBut before that, I should check if this string can be built starting from S's possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by building a parse tree for the string or using a top-down or bottom-up method. Since the string is quite long, top-down might be tedious. Maybe a better approach is to look for possible expansions step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol in the string: t7. So, I need to see which non-terminals can directly produce t7.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n- NT7 \u2192 't7' (explicitly)\n- NT10 \u2192 't10' isn't t7\n- NT11 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2', 't7'?\nWait, let me check each NT that has a production to 't7'.\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\nNT1: Not directly, seems to go into t8 and such.\nNT2: t2, no.\nNT3: has NT7 \u2192 t7, so NT3 can produce t7.\nWait, no, NT3's production is NT7 \u2192 t7, but NT3 itself. Looking back, NT3 has a production that eventually leads to t7.\n\nWait, let me list all non-terminals and their terminal productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT3 \u2192 't7', 't2', 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', via other rules\n- NT0: multiple and some to terminals.\nWait, no, looking back, NT3 has a rule NT3 \u2192 't7' directly. Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, I might have missed this. Let me check each NT that can directly produce 't7':\n\nLooking through all rules, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', and there's NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11. But I don't see a direct 't7' in NT7. Wait, maybe I'm wrong earlier.

Let me scan the rules:\n\nIn the given grammar, here are direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5', 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't5' (Wait, NT5 \u2192 't0')\n- Wait, need to parse the rules carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't9', 't5', 't3', 't2', 't1', 't0', etc.\n\nWait, but to find where a non-terminal directly produces 't7', I look for NT with a rule that includes 't7'. Scanning the rules:\n\nLooking at each rule's right-hand side:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't7' (explicitly, wait let me check each NT.\n\nLooking for NTs where a production is 't7':\n\n- NT7: I don't see any rule where NT7 \u2192 't7'. Looking at the rules, NT7's rules are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11\n- So, no direct 't7' for NT7.\n\nWait, then where does 't7' come from? Looking through the rules, is there any NT that produces 't7' directly?\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT3's rules:\n   - NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n   - NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n   - NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\n   - etc. But these are all non-terminals.\n\nWait, is there any NT that directly produces 't7'? I think not. That would mean the string can't be generated because 't7' can't be derived from any non-terminal. Wait, but looking back at the given grammar, did I miss any NT that has a terminal 't7'? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their rules:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends in 't7':\n\n- NT11 has a rule: NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, which goes into NT3, but that doesn't produce t7 directly.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me see.\n\nWait, NT3's rules have:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t3 t3\n- other combinations, but no 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I have an error in my understanding. Let me double-check the grammar rules provided by the user.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each rule is written as A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a.\n\nUpon re-examining each production:\n\nI see that NT3 has the following rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT3 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT3\nNT3 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nWait, all the right-hand sides for NT3 are non-terminals or a combination.\n\nSo, NT3 doesn't produce 't7' directly. That would mean the string can't have 't7' unless it's derived somehow. Wait, but that's impossible because in a context-free grammar starting from S, you can only produce terminals through the rules, and if none of the NTs directly produce 't7', the string can't contain 't7'. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed an NT that can produce 't7' through a production chain.\n\nLooking for a path from an NT that can produce 't7':\n\nWait, I think I'm wrong. Let me see if any NT can produce 't7' through the rules. Checking the entire grammar:\n\nLooking through each NT's production rules:\n\n- Any NT whose production rules include 't7'? It doesn't seem so. So, the grammar can't generate any string that contains 't7' because none of the NTs can produce 't7' directly or indirectly. Therefore, the given string, which starts with 't7', cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar does have NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT11. Wait, is NT7 in any way producing 't7'? No, because NT7's rules don't include any terminal 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, checking other NTs:\n\n- NT1: produces 't8'\n- NT2: 't2', 't5'\n- NT3: all non-terminals leading to more non-terminals\n- NT4: 't0', 't5'\n- NT5: 't0'\n- NT7: non-terminals\n- NT8: 't0', 't1', 't5'\n- NT9: 't0', 't2', 't9'\n- NT0: many rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-731","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals and production rules. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap what a context-free grammar is. It consists of a set of production rules that expand non-terminals into other symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. The string we need to check is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules.\n\nThe grammar provided has a start symbol S and a bunch of production rules. Some of the non-terminals produce terminals directly, while others produce combinations of other non-terminals. The string given is pretty long, with 38 tokens separated by spaces: `t10 t0 t2 t0 t5 t7 t0 t2 t0 t5 t7 t10 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t9 t3 t6 t7 t0 t5 t5 t10 t10 t7 t3 t10 t3 t0 t8 t1 t5 t3 t2 t6`.\n\nTo approach this, I think I'll need to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse context-free grammars in CNF. It works by filling a table where each cell corresponds to a substring of the input and checks whether that substring can be generated by a non-terminal A. If I can fill the entire table such that the start symbol S can generate the entire string, then the answer is yes.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the CYK algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create a table with rows and columns equal to the length of the input string. Each cell (i, j) corresponds to the substring starting at position i and ending at position j-1 (assuming 0-based indexing). We'll need to fill this table for all possible substrings.\n\n2. **Filling the Table**: For each possible substring length (from 0 up to the length of the string), check all possible positions of the substring. For each substring, check each production rule that directly expands to the corresponding terminals. If a production's symbols match the substring, mark the cell as true.\n\n3. **Checking the Start Symbol**: After filling the table, check the cell corresponding to the entire string (cell (0, n) where n is the length) to see if it's marked as true. If it is, the string is in the language.\n\nHowever, the fact that the grammar is in CNF means that each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the algorithm because, for each cell (i, j), the possible decompositions are only splits into two parts with a production that expands to those two parts.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, not all non-terminals have two-symbol productions. Some have more. For example, S -> NT4 NT8, which is a two-symbol production, but others might have more. Hmm, I notice that most rules are of the form A -> BC, but some have A -> a, like NT13 -> 't2', etc. So the grammar is in CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar might have productions of the form A -> B C, where B and C are non-terminals. So to apply CYK, I can proceed as usual.\n\nBut the string has 38 terminals, so I'll need to process all possible substrings up to length 38.\n\nGiven the complexity, manually constructing the table would be error-prone, so maybe I can look for a pattern or specific steps that might help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find specific non-terminals that expand to certain sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps I can try to break it down into chunks that correspond to the production rules.\n\nFor example, starting with S -> NT4 NT8. So the string must split into two parts where the first part is generated by NT4 and the second by NT8.\n\nLooking at the string: `t10 t0 t2 t0 t5 t7 t0 t2 t0 t5 t7 t10 t0 t2 t0 t0 t4 t2 t9 t3 t6 t7 t0 t5 t5 t10 t10 t7 t3 t10 t3 t0 t8 t1 t5 t3 t2 t6`\n\nIf we split the entire string into two parts, the first part needs to be generated by NT4 and the second by NT8.\n\nLet me see what NT4 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT4 has several productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> NT7 NT1\n\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT2\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT4 -> NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nWait, sorry, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nThe production for NT4 is:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nWait, but there's also NT4 -> 't0' and NT4 -> 't5'.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some rules end with a terminal. For example:\n\nNT4 -> 't0'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nNT9 -> 't9'\n\nNT7 -> 't0'\n\nNT8 -> 't0'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nNT0 -> 't4'\n\nNT13 -> 't2'\n\nNT5 -> 't0'\n\nNT7 -> 't10'\n\nNT10 -> 't3'\n\nNT3 -> 't2'\n\nNT11 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so NT4 can produce either 't0' or 't5' directly. So NT4 is a production that can generate terminals, so in the CYK algorithm, in step 2, when checking the cell (i, j), if j - i +1 is 1, then if the string at that position is a terminal matched by NT4, then cell (i, j) is true.\n\nBut in our case, the first split is S -> NT4 NT8, so the string is split into two parts: part1 is generated by NT4, part2 by NT8.\n\nLooking at the entire string, it's 38 tokens. So for S -> NT4 NT8, the string must be split into two parts. Let's try to see if the first part can be generated by NT4 and the second part by NT8.\n\nBut without knowing the exact way NT4 and NT8 can split, it's difficult. Maybe I can look for the first symbol.\n\nThe string starts with 't10'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT8 -> 't0'\n\nNT5 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nNT1 -> 't8'\n\nNT9 -> 't9'\n\nNT7 -> 't0'\n\nNT8 -> 't0'\n\nNT0 -> 't10'\n\nAh, so NT8 cannot produce 't10' directly. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT8 is defined as:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT13\n\nWait, no, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check each production if any NT can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking for production rules where the right-hand side is 't10' or includes 't10':\n\n- NT10 -> 't1' (but that's 't1')\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't0' or 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't10' or 't4' etc.\n\nAh, yes, NT0 -> 't10' is a production.\n\nSo, if the string starts with 't10' and 't0', it's possible that the first part is generated by NT0.\n\nWait, but in the S production, it's NT4 and NT8. So the string split must correspond to NT4 and NT8.\n\nBut 't10' is supposed to be the first symbol, but NT4 does not produce 't10'. The possible terminals from NT4 are 't0' and 't5'.\n\nSo the initial 't10' must be coming from NT8 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is 't10', which is produced only by NT0, NT13, or some other?\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT0 produces 't10' among others.\n\nSo if the first symbol 't10' is produced by NT0, then perhaps the split is not from S but perhaps a different production.\n\nWait, but S produces NT4 and NT8.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because I can use a recursive descent or parsing method, maybe even apply the CYK algorithm since it's a standard approach for CFGs.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t0 t2 t0 t10 t9 t5 t5 t2 t10 t3 t1 t2 t0 t7 t7 t2 t10 t5 t8 t10 t10 t2 t7 t4 t0 t2 t5 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t10 t2 t3 t4 t0 t6 t3`. Wow, that's a long string with 39 tokens. Okay, so I need to see if this token sequence can be derived from the starting symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT1 NT2, or S \u2192 NT4 NT11. So S can expand into two non-terminals each time, leading to a binary tree of productions.\n\nEach production rule either breaks down into two non-terminals or a terminal. So for each token in the string, I need to find a production path that can generate it.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.

I might need to restructure this into a more manageable form. Maybe create a list where each non-terminal maps to its possible terminal productions and the non-terminals it can produce.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and note which terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT11 can produce NT8 and NT5 (so via NT8, which is terminal?), but looking back, NT8 has productions that can generate terminals like t0, t2, etc. Wait, maybe I should first list the terminals each non-terminal can generate directly.\n\nFrom the rules, NT3 \u2192 't5', NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't9', etc. But perhaps it's better to approach this differently. Let's look for which non-terminals directly produce 't0' or other terminals in the string.\n\nOur string starts with t0. Let's find which non-terminals can directly produce 't0'.

Oh, but then NT9 \u2192 't0', so if NT7 can produce NT9, which then becomes 't0', that might work.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree or see if the string can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to check each token in the string and see if it can be generated by any production rule, considering the stack-based parsing.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use memoization or dynamic programming.

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step, even though I'm still new to this.\n\nFirst, let me understand what CNF means. CNF requires that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I notice that each production seems to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is a production with two non-terminals, and several of them break down into terminals and non-terminals. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t5 t0 t9 t10 t0 t0 t5 t10 t2 t5 t7 t5 t5 t5 t2 t9 t0 t0 t4 t0 t9 t1 t5 t6 t10 t2 t10 t3 t6 t0 t0 t8 t0 t2 t10 t2 t0 t0 t3`. It looks like a sequence of terminals, and I need to check if this can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use a parsing method like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser. However, since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can backtrack through the grammar, seeing if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which can produce NT4 NT8 or others. The first thing I notice is that the first part of the string starts with 't5'. Looking at the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', etc., but more importantly, in the initial productions, S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Wait, but the string starts with 't5', so maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT11 NT8. Because looking at NT11, one of its productions leads to 't5'. Let me see: NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT3, and then NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't5', etc., and NT3 is 't2' or 't7', etc. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking at the start symbol S and see what possible non-terminals can derive parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each 't' is likely a terminal, so the grammar must have rules that produce these terminals.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14. Wait, no, the terminals in the grammar are more limited. Looking at the rules, some produce specific terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', 't10'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1', 't3', 't6'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', 't9', 't14'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't4', 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0', 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10', 't13', etc.\n- NT12 \u2192 't3'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6', etc.\n- NT14 \u2192 't3', 't4'\n\nSo each terminal in the string must appear in the expansion of the non-terminals.\n\nNow, the given string starts with 't5'. Looking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't10', 't4', 't5' is not correct because NT0 has rules that produce 't10' or 't4' or 't0' or others, but I don't see NT0 producing 't5' directly. Wait, no, looking back, NT4 can produce 't5' as in NT4 \u2192 't5'. So, perhaps the first part of the string comes from NT4.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is 't5', which is derived from NT4 \u2192 't5'. So maybe the start symbol S goes through some production that starts with NT4 \u2192 't5'. Let me check the S productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8: So this would produce 't5' followed by whatever NT8 can produce.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with another S production, but looking at all S productions, S can be NT11 NT8, NT1 NT2, etc. But let's see: S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is the first one. If S uses this, then NT4 could produce 't5' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but looking at NT4's productions, yes, NT4 can produce 't5' as one of its options. So S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would allow 't5' as the first symbol if NT4 produces 't5' and NT8 starts with something else.\n\nWait, but according to the given grammar, NT4 has productions like \u2192 NT9 NT2, NT5 NT4, etc., but also\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5 produce 't0', 't4', 't5'. So yes, NT4 can produce 't5'.\n\nSo, assuming S \u2192 NT4 NT8, and NT4 \u2192 't5', that would start the string correctly with 't5'.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't0'. So after 't5', the next symbol is 't0'. Let's see, the production for NT8. Looking back, NT8's rule: NT8 can produce 't6', 't0', 't5'. Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I think NT8 has a production: NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', or 't5'. Yes, because looking at the rules, for example, NT8 \u2192 't6' (from NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT11), but also other rules. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list NT8's productions properly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' (from NT10 \u2192 't6'? Wait no, looking at NT8: I think in the grammar, NT8 could be part of other rules, but I'm not finding it. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, let me check again. Looking through all the rules:\n\n- I see NT0 \u2192 't6' (from production NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3)\n- NT4 can produce 't5' but also others\n- NT13 \u2192 't6' or 't4'\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Let me try to list NT8's productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I think NT8 is in the production S \u2192 NT11 NT8, and within that, NT8 might produce 't0', 't5', etc. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct production for NT8.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn the given grammar, looking for NT8, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' is not directly part of NT8's rules, but perhaps via another non-terminal. For example, looking at the rules, NT8 is part of other productions:\n\nLooking for all non-terminals that end with NT8:\n\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT8\n\nWait, is there a production where NT8 directly goes to 't0'? Let me look:\n\nYes, checking the rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' is a production (from the rule NT8 \u2192 't6' is actually another production, but maybe I'm mixing). Wait no, let me find it:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nWait, I think I need a better way to organize this. Let me go through each non-terminal and list their productions.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can try to backtrack.\n\nSo, starting from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with 't5' followed by 't0', then 't9', etc.\n\nAssuming S \u2192 NT4 NT8, with NT4 \u2192 't5', then we now need to derive the rest starting from NT8.\n\nSo the string so far is 't5' followed by the rest. Now, the next symbol is 't0', so from NT8, we have to produce 't0' as the next symbol. Assuming that NT8 can directly produce 't0', then that's possible.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see NT8 \u2192 't0' as a direct production. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT8's rules:\n\nI see rules like NT8 \u2192 't6', 't0', 't5' perhaps?\n\nWait, no, let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking for NT8:\n\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (is this present?

{"custom_id":"request-772","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two terminals or non-terminals. The string given is a sequence of t's and numbers, but from the grammar, each non-terminal eventually leads to terminals like t0, t1, etc. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar to see the structure. The start symbol is S, and S has production rules like S -> NT4 NT8 and others. But the first step is to parse the string correctly, ensuring each production rule is followed.\n\nThe string is quite long: t0 t10 t0 t3 t2 t9 t0 t4 t10 t2 t2 t0 t7 t0 t5 t7 t9 t8 t9 t3 t5 t0 t0 t0 t9 t5 t2 t0 t0 t0 t5 t7 t0 t5 t8 t10 t7 t0 t5 t3 t5 t0.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so every part of the string is a terminal. My approach should be to try to build the string step by step by following the grammar rules, starting from S and breaking down each part into smaller components until I reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string using a recursive descent approach. Starting from S, each production of S will produce two non-terminals. So, the string should be split into two parts, each part corresponding to the right-hand side of a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 48 tokens long. So, it's even, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's split into two halves. I'll have to see how the non-terminals can produce sequences that lead to the terminals.\n\nI notice that the start symbol S has three production rules:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nI'll start by trying to see which of these rules fit the beginning of the string. The first two tokens are t0 t10.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t0 appears in several places, but let me see if NT4 or NT1 can produce t0. Looking at NT4's productions, I see NT4 -> NT14 NT7, and nt14 can produce t3 and t4. Hmm, perhaps not directly helpful for t0.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a NT9 -> 't0', which might be useful. Let me see where NT9 comes from. NT9 -> 't0', and looking at the start symbols, S doesn't produce NT9 directly. But maybe via other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the first production S->NT4 NT8. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce. NT4 -> NT14 NT7. NT14-> NT3 NT4. NT3-> NT7 NT1, then NT7-> NT11 NT6, and so on. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, S->NT4 NT8. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 can generate. NT4 is producing a certain structure, but maybe that's not leading to t0 and t10 early in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S->NT1 NT2. Let's see, NT1's production is NT9 NT13, which can produce t0 and other things. Wait, NT9 is 't0', so that's possible. Then NT2 has a production NT2->NT0 NT0 or other. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build possible parse trees. Let's take the first part of the string: t0 t10 t0 t3 t2... So the first two tokens are t0 and t10. If S->NT4 NT8, then the first part is NT4 and the second is NT8.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules: NT4->NT14 NT7, and NT14->NT3 NT14 or NT3 NT4, etc. This might not produce t0 and t10.\n\nAlternatively, let's check NT4's rules. NT4 can also produce t3 and t5 via NT14 and NT7, but perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps considering NT2's production: NT2->NT0 NT0 or NT2->NT4 NT0, etc. Let's see, if S->NT4 NT8, then we need NT4 to produce t0 and NT8 to produce t10.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I don't immediately see it producing t10. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's a NT10->'t6' and other rules. Maybe I'm mixing up which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them. For example, t0 is given by NT9. So, if I have a part of the string that starts with t0, then it must come from a production rule where one of the non-terminals is NT9.\n\nLooking back, S has production S->NT1 NT2. NT1->NT9 NT13, which would produce t0 and something else.\n\nWait, let me try building a possible parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t0 t10 t0 t3 t2...\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is S->NT1 NT2.\n\nNT1 produces NT9 NT13, which gives t0 and whatever NT13 produces. NT13 has multiple rules: NT13->NT6 NT12 or NT13->'t2' or others. So maybe NT13 can produce t2 directly.\n\nSo, S->NT1 NT2 would first produce t0 (from NT9) and t10 (from NT2? Wait, let me check what NT2 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT2's rules: NT2->NT0 NT0, NT2->NT4 NT0, NT2->NT2 NT4, and NT2->NT7 NT9, etc. I don't see an immediate way for NT2 to produce t10.\n\nWait, perhaps NT2 can produce t10 via another route. Let me check NT2's rules again. Oh wait, in the given grammar, there's a production NT2->'t5' which is a terminal. Hmm, no, looking at the grammar, it says NT2->'t5', so that means it can produce t5 as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t0, then t10. So if NT2 can produce t10, that would fit. But looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t10 directly? Let me check. NT10->'t6', and NT2 can produce 't5', but that's not t10.\n\nHmm, so perhaps S->NT4 NT8 is a better approach. NT4->'t3' and 't5'. But the initial tokens are t0, so maybe this isn't the right split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S->NT1 NT2 is the right approach, but then I have to ensure that NT2 can produce t10. But looking back, the grammar has NT2->'t5', so perhaps NT2 can produce t5 directly. So, maybe the initial split is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT2's rules are:\n\nNT2-> NT0 NT0\n\nNT2-> NT2 NT4\n\nNT2-> NT4 NT0\n\nNT2-> NT7 NT9\n\nAlso, in the terminal productions, NT2-> 't2', which is 't2'. So, in the string, I see t2 multiple times.\n\nSo, perhaps in the string, the initial t0 t10 t0... could be part of a larger structure, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nMaybe another approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm is efficient for parsing context-free grammars in CNF. Let me try applying the CYK algorithm step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the symbols in the string: t0, t10, t0, t3, t2, t9, t7, t0, t4, t10, t2, t2, t0, t7, t0, t5, t7, t9, t8, t9, t3, t5, t0, t0, t0, t9, t5, t2, t0, t0, t0, t5, t7, t0, t5, t8, t10, t7, t0, t5, t3, t5, t0.\n\nThe string has 48 tokens, which is even. The CNF grammar means that each rule has exactly two elements, which match the CYK approach.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where cell (i,j) contains all possible non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i,j) is empty. The table has n rows and n columns where n is the length of the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-770","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: t0 t0 t10 t8 t5 t2 t7 t2 t2 t0 t5 t10 t2 t9 t10 t0 t8 t3 t5 t7 t7 t9 t6 t9 t5 t5 t2 t5 t5 t5 t0 t0 t9 t2 t0 t9 t4 t9 t3 t2.\n\nFirst, I should analyze the grammar structure to understand how it generates strings. Since it's in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the analysis because the grammar should generate strings where terminals are leaves, and each non-terminal corresponds to a node that expands into two non-terminals, forming a binary tree.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has multiple productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n2. S \u2192 NT4 NT11\n3. S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo, the initial expansion of S will produce two non-terminals, either NT4 and NT8, NT4 and NT11, or NT1 and NT2. From there, each of these NT symbols will eventually expand into terminal symbols or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string length, it's 42 terminals long. Each non-terminal expansion (A \u2192 BC) contributes two symbols to the string. Since S is the start symbol and every production is in CNF, the derivation tree must have a binary structure. Let's check if the number of symbols is a power of two. Wait, 42 is not a power of two\u2014it's 2 * 21, but 21 is not a power of two. That might be a problem because each expansion doubles the number of symbols. Starting from S (1 symbol), to generate a string of length n, the number of symbols must be (some k) where 2^k = n+1? Or maybe the way it's built is each level can only add a certain number. Alternatively, perhaps the terminals in the string must correspond to a derivation path that can be represented as a binary tree of depth k where 2^k -1 = length. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, in a leftmost derivation for a CNF grammar, each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal. For each non-terminal replaced, the number of symbols increases by one each time a non-terminal is expanded. So the total number of steps would be equal to the number of non-terminals in the derivation minus 1. However, for the resulting string length, if the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the derived string must be equal to 2^n, where n is the number of times you expanded a non-terminal in a particular branch.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe instead of worrying about the length, I should look at the specific symbols in the string and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to note all the terminal symbols in the string: t0, t10, t8, t5, t2, t7, t9, t6, t3, t4. From the grammar, these are all terminal symbols. So the string must be composed using these terminals.\n\nLooking at production rules for terminals, let's see:\n\nFrom the productions, some NT symbols directly expand to terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't0' or 't10'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't0' or 't6'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- NT4 can become t0 or t5\n- NT5 becomes t0\n- NT7 can become t0 or t10\n- NT8 can become t0 or t6\n- NT11 becomes t3\n- NT13 becomes t4\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first few symbols are t0, t0, t10, etc. Let me try to see how the string could be built.\n\nLet me see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which can expand to NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLet me pick one possibility. Let's see if the string starts with NT4 NT8. Then S would derive to NT4 NT8, which then further expand. So each of these can expand further.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t0. So, perhaps NT4 \u2192 t0. Wait, yes, NT4 can be t0 or t5.\n\nSo, first symbol: NT4 \u2192 t0.\n\nThe next symbol is t0, so the second in the string is t0. So, perhaps the next NT4 also goes to t0.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 \u2192 (t0) (something). But in the string, the second symbol is t0, so NT8 would have to generate t0. Let's check.\n\nNT8 can be t0 or t6. So t0 is possible. So, NT8 \u2192 t0.\n\nSo, so far, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 \u2192 t0 t0. That matches the first two symbols.\n\nNext, the third symbol is t10. So, after the second symbol is t0, what comes next?\n\nWait, after the first two symbols, what's the structure? Let's see: S expands to NT4 NT8, which becomes t0 and then NT8. But after that, NT8 would expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the derivation as a tree. So, starting from S:\n\nS (S \u2192 NT4 NT8) \u2192 NT4 (\u2192 t0) and NT8 (\u2192 t0)\n\nBut in the string, after t0 t0, the third symbol is t10. So perhaps NT8 is further expanded to t10.\n\nWait, but NT8 can produce t0 or t6. It can't produce t10. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the NT8 productions. Looking back:\n\nNT8: the productions are not in the main list, but let's see. From the given grammar, NT8's productions are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n\nSo, NT8 is a non-terminal that can only produce other non-terminals. It doesn't directly produce a terminal like t10. So, my initial approach is wrong. So perhaps the string doesn't start with NT4 NT8 because NT8 can't directly produce t10.\n\nSo, maybe S expands to another option, like NT4 NT11.\n\nLet me try that. S \u2192 NT4 NT11. Then NT4 can be t0 or t5. The first symbol in the string is t0, so NT4 \u2192 t0. Then NT11 can expand to t3 or something else.\n\nBut the second symbol is t0. So NT11 must expand to t0? But looking at NT11's productions:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\n\nNo direct production for terminal, only to non-terminals. So NT11 can't directly produce t0. So that means the second symbol can't be t0 if the first symbol is t0 via NT4. Therefore, this path is invalid because the second symbol would have to be a non-terminal, but the string has t0.\n\nWait, that suggests that the first expansion can't have both NT4 and NT11 because the second symbol would have to be a t0 from NT4, but then NT11 can't produce t0 directly. So perhaps the initial expansion is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe S expands to NT1 NT2. So S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nThen NT1: NT1 can produce t8 or t13.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t0, which is from NT4. Since NT1 doesn't produce t0, S \u2192 NT1 NT2 would not start with t0. Therefore, that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT4 NT8, but we had trouble with the second symbol. Wait, but maybe the second symbol is part of the expansion of NT8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that after S \u2192 NT4 NT8, the NT8 can further expand. Since NT8 is a non-terminal, it will expand into other non-terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\n\nSo, the next symbol after the first t0 is t0, which would come from NT8 expanding into something that then produces t0.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT6 and NT3 might lead to t0.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n\nNT3 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, no, that's not.

Alternatively, since the grammar is small, perhaps I can look for specific patterns or substitutions that can help me break down the string.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols, I notice that some non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't2', NT9 \u2192 't0', NT5 \u2192 't0', etc. So perhaps I can trace backward from the string, replacing these terminals with their possible non-terminals, and see if I can eventually reduce everything to S.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string as a list:\n\nt5, t0, t0, t10, t9, t3, t0, t0, t3, t6, t2, t5, t0, t5, t5, t9, t10, t0, t10, t8, t0, t1, t5, t10, t5, t5, t2, t8, t0, t5, t0, t0, t7, t0, t0, t0, t6, t0, t0, t3, t6.\n\nHmm, quite long. Let's see if I can find some patterns or starting points. Maybe the last part of the string ends with t3 t6. Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't2', and NT11 \u2192 't3'. Wait, but in the string, I have t3 at the end. Let's see possible productions for t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for NT3: NT3 \u2192 't2', but no production for NT3 \u2192 't3'. So maybe that's not relevant. Wait, no, looking again at the grammar definitions, I see NT11 \u2192 't3'? Let me check: Yes, in the top part of the grammar, NT11 is defined as NT3 NT1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and see if any produce 't3'.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT11 \u2192 't3' when? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't2', and NT11 \u2192 't3' when? No, looking at the given productions, I don't see NT11 \u2192 't3' directly. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'.\n\nNT11: Checking all productions, I see NT11\u2192NT3 NT1, NT8\u2192NT6 NT3, etc. But in the string, I have a t3 which needs to be generated. So from NT3, it's 't2', but how do we get 't3'? Maybe NT11 \u2192 't3'? Wait, in the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't3'?\n\nWait, I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through all NT productions and see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1, NT8 NT5, NT7 NT11, etc. No production directly to a terminal, except maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', etc.\n\nWait, I think I see NT13: in the given rules, NT13 \u2192 't4', 't6', etc.\n\nSo NT13 can produce 't4' or 't6'. Also, NT13 appears in NT9 \u2192 NT7 NT9 and others.\n\nWait, in the string, I have a 't4' towards the end. Let me check when t4 is produced.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions: NT13 \u2192 't4', 't6', 't2', etc. So, yes, NT13 can produce 't4'.\n\nGoing back to the string: ... t0, t1, t5, t10, t5, t5, t2, t8, t0, t5, t0, t0, t7, t0, t0, t0, t6, t0, t0, t3, t6.\n\nThe terminal t3 is at the end. So, in the string, the last part is t3, t6.\n\nLooking for where 't3' can come from. Checking NT13 can produce 't3' as per some of its rules? Wait, no. Let me list all NT productions to see if any produce 't3':\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me check each NT in the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2' (only that terminal output)\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3', etc. Wait, looking at the given rules, I see NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, and also NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT1, NT2, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled.\n\nWait, in the given rules, let me look for NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for NT: \n\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5', 't7'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6', 't3' (wait, does NT8 have a production to 't3'? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which is a production to two non-terminals. But I don't see a rule that directly produces 't3' except perhaps in another NT. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, NT8 appears in a production rule: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which is a production to non-terminals. So perhaps 't3' is only produced by NT13 via NT13 \u2192 't3'? Looking back: Do any non-terminals produce 't3'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't3' is possible? Wait, in the given rules, NT11 is defined with some NTs, like NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5. Does NT11 ever produce 't3'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT11 productions: NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1. Wait, so NT11 can have two NTs, but does any production of NT11 directly produce a terminal? It seems not. So, NT11 must be used to derive until the terminals are produced.\n\nSo, in the string, we have a 't3' towards the end. So perhaps it's generated by NT11 \u2192 't3' but looking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT11 that directly produces 't3'. Instead, NT11 is used in other productions, like NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT1, which would then need to be substituted.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nI recall that in Chomsky normal form, the top-down approach is feasible, but perhaps a better way is to use the fact that each rule produces two non-terminals, and so for a string of length n, the derivation will have a parse tree of height log n. Alternatively, maybe using the Inside-Outer method.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a step-by-step decomposition of the string from the end backwards.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t3, t6."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is quite long, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, each production seems to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8, where NT4 and NT8 are non-terminals, and similarly, some non-terminals go directly to terminal symbols like 't5' or 't7'.\n\nThe string given is: `t7 t5 t0 t2 t10 t3 t0 t5 t3 t1 t5 t5 t0 t9 t0 t0 t0 t10 t5 t0 t8 t6 t3 t9 t3 t10 t10 t10 t5 t7 t7 t9 t8 t10 t7 t0 t1 t5 t0 t5`.\n\nI think the approach should be to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or other options, but in this case, the string starts with t7, which I notice is a terminal.

The string starts with t7. Looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t7? Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT7 \u2192 't0' in one case, but I don't see any NT producing t7 directly. Wait, actually, some non-terminals produce t7.

Let's check NT17? No, the NT's listed are up to NT14. So perhaps there's no NT that directly produces t7? That would mean that t7 can only be produced via a non-terminal that eventually reaches it. But looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t7. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules for S:\n\nS is only the combinations of NTs, none producing a terminal directly. So the first symbol is t7, which must come from a production that starts with a non-terminal which ultimately produces t7. But if no NT directly produces t7, then it's impossible for the string to start with t7. Therefore, the string cannot be produced by the grammar. So the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should confirm. Let me recheck the grammar to see if any non-terminal produces 't7'.

That means the only way to produce 't7' is through a non-terminal chain that eventually leads to a terminal production that is 't7'. But the grammar doesn't have any such NT, so 't7' cannot be generated by this grammar.

Let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a series of production rules where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) expands into two non-terminals or terminals. The terminals in this grammar are labeled with 't' followed by numbers. For example, 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. Some non-terminals seem to produce these terminals directly, which will be important for matching the string.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and it has production rules:\nS -> NT4 NT8\nS -> NT4 NT11\nS -> NT1 NT2\n\nSo the initial expansion of S will produce two non-terminals, which will be further expanded until we reach the terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string to be checked:\nt2 t10 t10 t2 t3 t2 t0 t5 t5 t0 t2 t2 t7 t5 t2 t10 t9 t10 t9 t10 t0 t0 t10 t3 t6 t3 t7 t2 t0 t2 t1 t2 t9 t10 t5 t8 t9 t7 t0 t3 t5 t7\n\nThis string is quite long, with 37 tokens. I need to see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by trying to split the string into possible expansions. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step produces two tokens, so the total number of tokens should be 2^n -1 where n is the number of steps, but in this case, it's 37, which is an odd number, so perhaps n=6, which gives 63 tokens, or maybe the string is built differently\u2014maybe it's built in a way where non-terminals can produce terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar's production rules, starting from the start symbol S and recursively breaking down the string into the productions.\n\nLet me list out the possible expansions again:\n\n- S can expand to NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nI'll start by assuming S expands to NT4 NT8. Then, I'll need to see if the strings derived from NT4 and NT8 can produce the required substring.\n\nWait, but another approach might be better: building a parse tree from the string and seeing if each non-terminal can be expanded using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that match the productions. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't2'. I need to find a production rule that starts with t2. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT11 -> NT8 NT5, NT7 -> NT9 NT7, etc. Checking which production rules end with 't2':\n\nLooking at all the rules, I see that:\n\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT2\n- NT9 -> 't10' (Wait, no, NT9 is 't10'? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT2 -> 't2' (so it directly produces t2)\nSimilarly, NT3 -> 't2', NT9 -> 't10', NT7 -> 't0', etc.\n\nWait, let me list each non-terminal and see which ones produce 't2':\n\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6, but does it ever reach 't2'? No, NT7 eventually ends up in something that results in 't0', 't1', etc.\nWait, wait, looking at NT2: NT2 can directly produce 't2', so that's a possibility.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with t2, so the first production is NT2.\n\nSo the first token 't2' would come from NT2, which can be either followed by NT0 NT0 or some other production. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar rules include NT2, but looking at the list provided, the production rules for NT2 are:\n\nWait, the grammar provided has at the top:\n\nS->NT4 NT8, etc.\n\nAnd looking through the list:\n\nNT2 has rules like -> NT0 NT0, -> NT2 NT4, etc. So yes, NT2 can be rewritten once, but sometimes directly into 't2'.\n\nSo if the first token is 't2', then NT2 must produce it via a rule where it directly is a terminal. So looking through the grammar, NT2 has these productions:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT2:\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT4\n- NT9 -> 't10' \u2014 wait, no, NT9 is 't10'?

So NT1 can produce 't8', 't9', etc., but not 't2' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals that can directly produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can track possible paths. Since the string starts with 't2', let's see which non-terminals can produce 't2':\n\nFrom the rules, NT2 can directly produce 't2' (rule: NT2 -> 't2'), so that's a possibility. So S might expand into S-> NT4 NT8, NT4 and NT8 need to expand to produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t2, so perhaps S is not the starting point here, unless S can produce t2 through a chain. But looking at S's expansions:\n\nS-> NT1 NT2: So if S expands into NT1 NT2, then the first symbol is generated by NT1. But in the string, the first symbol is t2, which is produced by NT2.\n\nSo if the first expansion is S -> NT4 NT8, then the first symbol would come from NT4, but NT4's rule doesn't produce t2; or S->NT1 NT2, which would mean the first non-terminal is NT1, which doesn't produce t2 directly, except perhaps through some expansion.\n\nWait, maybe S-> NT4 NT8: What can NT4 produce?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4: NT4 has several rules, one of which is NT4 -> 't0', another 't5', another 't7', etc.\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar list:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7, NT4 -> 't0', NT4 -> 't5', NT4 -> 't7'\n\nSo NT4 can directly produce t0, t5, or t7.\n\nSo if S-> NT4 NT8, the first symbol would be either t0, t5, or t7. But the first token in the string is t2, which is not among these. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps S is expanding via S-> NT1 NT2. Let's consider that.\n\nIf S-> NT1 NT2, then the first symbol is from NT1, which can produce t8, t9, t10, t3, etc., but looking at the rules, does any of NT1's rules produce t2? I don't see that.

{"custom_id":"request-816","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complicated with a bunch of production rules. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the string to see its structure: t5 t7 t5 t0 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t8 t0 t0 t10 t0 t2 t3 t10 t10 t8 t2 t5 t7 t9 t9 t2 t2 t5 t10 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2 t7 t0 t9 t4 t8 t6 t4 t10.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. I wonder how they connect. Maybe I can start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, S can produce NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. Let's see which one makes sense. The string starts with t5, so maybe the leftmost symbol should generate t5. Let's check the rules for NTs.\n\nNT13 can go to 't2' directly. But NT13 also has production rules, like NT13 -> NT5 NT12. Wait, does that help? The string starts with t5, so maybe NT4 or NT1.\n\nWait, the first token is t5. Let me see which NT can generate t5. Looking at the rules, NT4 has two productions: one to NT14 NT7 and another to 't0', which isn't t5. NT2 has a production to 't2', which is different. Hmm, maybe NT9? Wait, NT9 can go to 't0' or 't10'. That also doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. NT13 can go to 't2', but the first token is t5. Maybe the first part of the string comes from a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol is generated by S -> NT4 NT8 or S -> NT1 NT2. Let's check if either NT4 or NT1 can produce t5.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules: NT4 -> NT14 NT7 or 't0' or 't5'. Oh, so NT4 can produce 't5' directly. That might explain the first token.\n\nSo if the first part is NT4 -> 't5', then the second symbol should be generated by NT8. Let's see what NT8 can produce.\n\nNT8's rules: NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT6 NT11, NT1 NT5, etc. It can also go directly to 't0' or 't0' in some cases. Wait, looking at the rules, NT8 has several paths. Maybe it can produce 't7' via some steps.\n\nWait, NT8 can produce 't0' or 't5' via other pathways? No, looking again, the direct terms are 't0', but perhaps through sequences.\n\nWait, let's look at the string again. The second token is t7. So if the first part is t5, the second is t7. So the NT4 and NT8 together must produce t5 t7.\n\nBut S produces NT4 NT8, so if NT4 can produce t5 and NT8 can produce t7, then together they make t5 t7. Let's check their possible productions.\n\nNT4 can produce 't5' directly. For NT8, does any production lead to 't7'? Looking back, the rules for NT8: I don't see a direct 't7'. Wait, maybe through a chain.\n\nLet me see: NT8 can produce NT1 NT5. NT1 can go to 't8', so if NT1 becomes 't8' and NT5 can produce 't7'? Let's check NT5's rules. NT5 can go to 't0' or 't10', but maybe through other rules.\n\nWait, NT5 can be NT9 NT2. NT9 can go to 't0' or 't10'. NT2 can go to 't2', 't5', or via some other rules. If NT5 is NT9 NT2, and both go to 't10', then NT5 could produce 't10' or not.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a parsing approach or look for the leftmost derivation.\n\nAnother approach: look for the entire string and see if it can be built from the start symbol using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long, and I should look for patterns or see if it's even possible. The grammar uses mostly nt symbols with various derivations, and some symbols like 't0' to 't10' are terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should see which t tokens are connected. For instance, after t5 t7, the next token is t5. So perhaps there's a recursive structure.\n\nLooking at the rules, some NTs have recursive productions, like NT7 -> NT9 NT7, which suggests a repetition. Similarly, NT0 can produce NT10 NT10, which is another recursive rule.\n\nThe string has multiple repetitions. For example, after t5 t7, it's t5 again, then t0 several times. Maybe these are from recursive rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into smaller parts. The entire string is:\n\nt5 t7 t5 t0 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t8 t0 t0 t10 t0 t2 t3 t10 t10 t8 t2 t5 t7 t9 t9 t2 t2 t5 t10 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2 t7 t0 t9 t4 t8 t6 t4 t10.\n\nLooking at the first three tokens: t5 t7 t5. Maybe this comes from NT4 producing t5, then NT8 producing t7, and then another step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT4 produces t5, and then NT8 is split into parts that produce t7 t5.\n\nBut let's try to see if the string can be broken down.\n\nThe first token t5 could be from NT4. The next t7: if NT8 can produce t7 through some process, perhaps via NT1 and NT5. Let's trace:\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5.\n\nNT1 can produce 't8', and NT5 can produce... NT5's rules: NT5 -> NT9 NT2, NT2 -> 't2', 't5', etc. So NT5 could produce 't5' or 't9' or 't2' depending on its branches.\n\nWait, so NT8 -> NT1 NT5 -> 't8' * something?\n\nAlternatively, if NT8 produces 't7' via some path, but I don't see a direct rule for that. Maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, NT7 is a production rule that can become 't0' or 't10' or via recursion. Maybe the string's continuation after t5 t7 is t5 t0 t0 t0, which could come from a recursive structure.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider using CYK parsing or some other method, but since I'm just brainstorming, let me try a step-by-step approach.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT4 NT8.\n\nIf NT4 produces 't5' directly, then NT8 must produce the remaining string starting with t7.\n\nSo, the rest of the string after 't5' is: t7 t5 t0 t0 t0 t2 t0 t0 t8 t0 t0 t10 t0 t2 t3 t10 t10 t8 t2 t5 t7 t9 t9 t2 t2 t5 t10 t0 t0 t4 t0 t3 t2 t7 t0 t9 t4 t8 t6 t4 t10.\n\nWait, the second token is t7, which would be from NT8. So NT8 must produce 't7'. Looking at NT8's rules, I don't see a direct 't7'. So maybe it's generated through some steps.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules: NT8 can produce NT1 NT5, which could be split into 't8' and 't5' or similar. But since the second token is 't7', which is different from 't8', maybe this approach isn't directly working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second token 't7' is from NT7, which can be part of another NT production. Wait, perhaps NT7 is somewhere in another rule.\n\nLooking back, the first application is S -> NT4 NT8. If NT4 produces 't5', then NT8 should produce the rest. But NT8 can't directly produce 't7' from its rules, so maybe I've gone wrong in choosing which rule for NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps NT4 can also produce 't5' via a path that includes other NTs. Maybe NT4 can lead to more than just 't5' in this case.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules again: NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', or via other rules. Wait, there's another NT4 production: NT4 -> NT14 NT7.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some of the non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example, S is a start symbol, but all the productions are from S to combinations of NTs, eventually leading to terminals. \n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string step by step using the grammar, ensuring that each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Since this is a CFG, I might use a recursive descent parser or some other parsing method, but since I'm just evaluating manually, I'll try breaking down the string and see if each part can be matched to a production.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the terminals in the string:\nt8, t10, t0, t0, t3, t3, t5, t0, t3, t0, t1, t4, t3, t6, t10, t8, t9, t2, t10, t7, t5, t0, t2, t9, t9, t3, t3, t10, t7, t7, t8, t3, t2, t6, t2, t0, t0, t5, t0, t3, t2, t6, t6.\n\nThat's a long string, but manageable. Let me try to see if I can find a production that starts with the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, in the grammar S can produce NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. Let's check the string starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first few symbols are t8, t10, t0, t0. Wait, but the options for S are NT4 NT8, etc. Let's see which NTs can derive t8, t10, etc.\n\nLooking at the NTs, for example:\n- NT8 can derive t6, t0, t5, t3, t9, etc. Specifically, in the given rules, NT8 has several productions:\n  - NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n  - NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n  - NT8 -> NT6 NT13\n  - NT8 -> NT9 NT2\n  - NT8 -> NT0 NT3\n  - NT8 -> NT5 NT7\n  - NT8 -> NT9 NT8\n  - NT8 -> NT0 NT8\n  - NT8 -> NT7 NT10\n  - NT8 -> NT10 NT7\n  - NT8 -> NT0 NT10\n  - NT8 -> NT0 NT9\n  - NT8 -> NT6 NT5\n  - NT8 -> NT7 NT3\n  - NT8 -> NT10 NT8\n  - ... and so on. It's a bit messy.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each terminal and see which NTs can derive them. \n\nLet's list all the terminals and their possible sources:\n\nt8: From NT8.\n\nt10: From NT10.\n\nt0: From NT0, NT9, NT4, etc.\n\nt3: From NT3.\n\nt5: From NT5.\n\nt2: From NT2.\n\nt6: From NT6.\n\nt1: From NT1.\n\nt4: From NT4.\n\nt7: From NT7.\n\nt9: From NT9.\n\nLet me check the productions starting with NT4 and NT8, as they are the first two of S.\n\nLooking at the string: starting with t8, that would come from NT8. So if S is producing NT4 NT8, and then NT8 can produce t8, but wait, no. S is a production that goes to NT4 and NT8. So to get the string starting with t8, perhaps S is using the production S -> NT8 NT1..., but wait, S is NT4 NT8 or NT4 NT11 or NT1 NT2.\n\nWait, for example, if S produces NT8 (through one production) and then some other NTs. Let me think: If the string starts with t8, that could come from NT8. So what's the production for NT8? It has many options. Let's see if we can get t8 from NT8's production.\n\nLooking at NT8: could produce t8's terminal? Wait, the productions for NT8 include NT8 -> NT0 NT8, which is recursive, and others. But I'm looking for a terminal starting the string. So in the grammar, the only productions that produce terminals directly are the ones that have a single terminal on the right. Wait, no\u2014actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So looking at the given grammar rules, I see some NTs have productions that are just a terminal:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- Hmm, that's two non-terminals. Wait no, many produce two. Wait, looking through all the rules, do any NTs directly derive a single terminal? Let's check:\n\nLooking at each NT production:\n- NT3 -> 't5'\nYes, that's a terminal.\n- NT10 -> 't1'\nYes.\n- NT13 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT9 -> 't0' [But wait, NT9's production is NT9 -> NT7 NT9, which is recursive, but I don't see a direct terminal.

The string in question is: `t5 t9 t10 t9 t0 t9 t0 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t7 t0 t7 t0 t5 t1 t7 t5 t10 t10 t10 t3 t10 t10 t10 t9 t2 t0 t7 t3 t5 t9 t4 t0 t0 t5 t9 t2 t5 t3 t4`.\n\nOkay, first things first, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. It\u2019s a set of rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this grammar, I see that all non-terminals only produce two symbols, either other non-terminals or terminal tokens like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string consists of a bunch of these 't' tokens. The grammar mostly uses these terminals as the leaf nodes in the parse tree, so each 't' corresponds to a single step in the derivation. My approach will be to try to parse the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals until I reach terminals that match the string.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, and the productions from S are to two NTs followed by 4 or 11 or 1. Let's check each production:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S can only produce strings that start with NT4 followed by NT8 or NT11, or NT1 followed by NT2. The first step is to see which path to take.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't5'. So let's see what each production for NT4, NT8, etc., can generate.\n\nFrom the rules, I see that:\n\nNT4 can produce t0, t5, t7.\n\nWait, let me look at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nNT2 \u2192 t2, and others, but perhaps I should map them out more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree or trace the possible expansions. Alternatively, I can use a top-down approach, starting from S and see if I can match the string symbol by symbol.\n\nBut considering the size of the string, this might get complicated. Another approach is to see if the grammar allows certain terminals, like 't5', to appear anywhere in the string.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with t5, so the first symbols must come from NT4 or maybe another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's check the rules for NT1 because S \u2192 NT1 NT2. So the first part of the string could be NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT6\nBut wait, looking back at the provided rules, the exact productions for NT1 are:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT6\nAnd perhaps others?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see multiple entries for NT1. Let me list them all:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT6\nNT1 \u2192 ... Wait, let me check all the rules starting with NT1.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13\nNT1 \u2192 NT12 NT8\nNT1 \u2192 NT13 NT6\n\nSo NT1 can produce these combinations of non-terminals. Now, the first token is 't5', so maybe NT1 isn't the starting point here because NT1's productions don't directly produce 't5'.\n\nLet me double-check the rules for NT1. It seems that NT1 can't produce a single 't' immediately. So maybe the start is via S \u2192 NT4 NT8. Let's trace this.\n\nSo starting from S, S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nNow, let's look at what NT4 can produce. From the given rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n\nLooking at these, each production is a pair of non-terminals. The only way to get to a 't' is when the non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nLooking for where 't5' comes from. From NT4, possible t5 is in NT7:\n\nWait, in the rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT1, so if NT7 produces 't5'..., wait, let's check NT7's rules.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT11\nAnd another: NT7 \u2192 NT10 NT3\nAnd others down.\n\nWait, actually, from the initial rules provided, the NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\nNT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT11\nNT7 \u2192 NT10 NT3\nSo none of these immediately produce 't5'. Wait, did I miss any? Let me go through all NT7's rules:\n\nLooking up NT7 in the provided rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT12 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT1\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT4\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT10 NT3\n- NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4\nWait, here's one that produces 't5': NT7 \u2192 NT5 NT4.\n\nYes, so NT7 can produce t5 when expanded if NT5 can connect to a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT5's rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT10 NT2\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nSo no direct 't's there.\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2, t5, etc. Let's check NT2's rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT2 \u2192 t0\nNT2 \u2190 other rules?\n\nYes, in the provided rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t2\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT2 \u2192 t0\nNT2 also has transitions that take it to other non-terminals:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0\nNT2 \u2192 NT1 NT4\nNT3 \u2192 ... but that's for NT3, not NT2.\n\nSo, NT2 can produce 't5' directly.\n\nSo, putting it together: NT7 can produce t5 NT4. Then NT4 needs to produce something. Looking at NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 can produce NT2 NT2, which can each produce 't5's. So let's see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t5 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT2 \u2192 t5\n\nSo, that would produce t5 t5 t5.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t5, t9, t10, etc., so maybe this isn't the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is not the right starting point, though. Let's see what S\u2192NT4 NT8 can produce.\n\nFrom NT4, production to BT comes via NT4\u2192...? Let's see NT8's rules.\n\nLooking at NT8:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT5\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT13\nNT8 \u2192 ... and so on.\n\nWait, NT8 can expand into non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT6's rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11\nNT6 \u2192 NT11 NT11\nNT6 \u2192 NT10 NT3\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT10\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting symbol S isn't able to produce the first token t5. Let's check.\n\nThe first token is 't5'. So looking at all paths from S that can produce 't5'. Let me check each production of S.\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8: Does NT4 or NT8 have a production that leads to 't5'? From earlier, NT4 can produce t5 via NT7 \u2192 t5 NT4, but that's not helpful for the first token.\n\nLooking at NT8, are there any expansions that produce 't5'? Let's check NT8's rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nLooking at NT6's rules: does any path produce a t5?\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-854","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I\u2019ve got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it structures each production into a non-terminal leading to exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires each production rule to be either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the production rules seem to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is a rule leading to two non-terminals, and some produce terminals directly, like NT3 \u2192 't5'. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t3 t10 t9 t9 t3 t2 t0 t0 t10 t2 t9 t9 t0 t3 t9 t0 t0 t10 t8 t7 t9 t5 t0 t0 t1 t7 t2 t0 t7 t0 t5 t0`. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not very familiar with the exact steps, I\u2019ll try a method of breaking down the string into parts that could be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar. Alternatively, I can try to build a derivation tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. Each S production is either \"S \u2192 NT4 NT8\", \"S \u2192 NT4 NT11\", or \"S \u2192 NT1 NT2\". So any derivation must start with one of these sequences. The first step is to see if the string begins with any of these sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't0'. Let me check which non-terminals produce 't0'. From the grammar, the production rules where a non-terminal produces 't0' are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT10 \u2192 't3' and 't10'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2' (wait, that's 't2', not 't0', so perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, under NT2, it's listed as \"NT2 -> 't5'\", \"NT2 -> 't7'\". Hmm, no, maybe I confused another one. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT5 it's NT5 \u2192 't0', and under NT0 there are a few rules, like NT0 \u2192 't10', and some others, but not 't0' directly. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT4 has some rules, but looking through, I see NT4 can produce 't0' (since there are rules like NT4 \u2192 't0'). So perhaps I should list all non-terminals that can produce 't0':\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10' but under some other rules, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar has:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT2 \u2192 't2', but that\u2019s 't2', not 't0'\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\nNT0 \u2192 't10' (so not 't0')\nWait, but looking again, I see that in the grammar, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5', but maybe other non-terminals can produce 't0' as well. Wait, let me list all the rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, the only terminals are 't0', 't1', etc. So, for example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT10 \u2192 't3', 't10'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2', 't10'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0', 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5', 't7'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8', etc.\n\nWait, I need to list all non-terminals that can produce 't0':\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- Are there any others? Let me check each production.\n\nLooking at NT0: its productions are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT14 NT13\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2 (Wait, no: the grammar says NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT1, is that right? Let me check the grammar again. It says:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT11 NT11\n- NT0 \u2192 NT8 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n\nWait, under NT0, I see:\n\n\"NT14 -> NT3 NT4\"\n\nBut for NT0, the productions are:\n\n\"NT0 -> NT14 NT13\"\n\"NT0 -> NT6 NT3\"\n\"NT0 -> NT11 NT11\"\n\"NT0 -> NT8 NT8\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\nSo NT0 can produce terminal strings only if any of these non-terminals produce terminals. For instance, if NT14 produces 't3' and 't4', which may not produce 't0'. So perhaps NT0 doesn't directly or indirectly produce 't0'. Thus, the only non-terminals that directly produce 't0' are NT4 and NT5.\n\nWait, let me check NT5's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, under NT5 I see:\n\n\"NT5 -> NT9 NT2\"\n\nBut under NT2, we have multiple productions like NT2 -> 't5' and NT2 -> 't7', but no terminal 't0'. So NT5 doesn't produce 't0' directly. Similarly, looking at other non-terminals:\n\nLooking again, I see NT4 has rules like \"NT4 -> 't0'\", \"NT4 -> 't5'\", and some others. So NT4 is the main non-terminal that can produce 't0'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't0', which could come from NT4 or any non-terminal that can produce 't0', but only NT4 does so directly. So, the first production must be S \u2192 NT4 NT8, S \u2192 NT4 NT11, or S \u2192 NT1 NT2. Since the first token is 't0', let's see if any of the productions starting from S can produce 't0' at the beginning.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT4 NT8: the first symbol of NT4 is 't0' (since NT4 can produce 't0'), so the string starts with 't0' and is followed by the entire NT4 NT8 derivation.\n\nSimilarly, S \u2192 NT4 NT11 would also start with 't0', and S \u2192 NT1 NT2: well, does NT1 produce 't0'? Let me check NT1's productions. Looking through the grammar, under NT1 I have:\n\n\"NT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4\nNT1 -> NT14 NT1\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT1 -> NT7 NT14\nNT10 -> 't6'\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\nNT12 -> NT3 NT12\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT9 -> 't0'\nNT7 -> 't0',\nand some others.\"\n\nSo, NT1 can produce NT7, which can produce 't0' (since NT7 \u2192 't0'), so from NT1, you can get 't0' as well. So S \u2192 NT1 NT2 could also start with 't0'.\n\nTherefore, the first rule can be either S \u2192 NT4 NT8 or S \u2192 NT1 NT2.\n\nBut the first token is 't0', which comes from either NT4 or NT1. Let's take both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, the string is 't0 t3 ...'.

The grammar starts with S and has several non-terminals (S, NT1, NT2, NT4, NT5, etc.) that eventually derive terminal symbols ('t0' through 't14'). \n\nLooking at the production rules for S, I see:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8 (twice)\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo the string starts with NT4 NT8 or NT1 NT2. Let's see the start of the string: \"t0 t5 t9 t9 t7 t0 t9 t9 t0 t9 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t0 t0 t0 t7 t10 t9 t9 t9 t10 t3 t2 t2 t2 t0 t0 t5 t0 t5\"\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let's break it down.

So, S \u2192 NT4 NT8 would start with t0. \n\nNow, after NT4 (which is 't0'), we have NT8. Let's see what NT8 produces.\n\nNT8 has several productions:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0' (another)\n- etc.\n\nLooking at the string, after t0 comes t5. So, the second part must be NT8. Let's see: the second symbol is t5. So, how does NT8 derive t5?\n\nLooking at NT8's productions, none of the rules directly produce t5. Wait, that's a problem. Let me check again.\n\nNC productions for NT8:\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6' (from the rules: NT8 \u2192 't6' via NT5? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-870","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it has a specific structure that might make parsing easier. CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can have the terminals directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t4 t8 t5 t10 t5 t0 t7 t10 t9 t0 t10 t8 t3 t0 t0 t0 t3 t9 t7 t2 t0 t0 t0 t8 t0 t7 t10 t8 t3 t0 t2 t5 t0 t5 t5 t10 t3 t4 t0 t10 t0 t7 t0 t7`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that CNF allows for a recursive descent parser, but given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps a better approach is to build a derivation tree or use a parsing strategy step by step. However, the number of non-terminals can be quite large, so manually building a tree might be error-prone. Alternatively, I can try to analyze the string step by step using the productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8\n- S \u2192 NT1 NT2\n- S \u2192 NT11 NT1\n\nSo the initial expansion of S must produce one of those.

{"custom_id":"request-877","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes it easier because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let me write down the string:\n\nt2 t0 t3 t10 t2 t10 t8 t4 t0 t0 t0 t4 t0 t9 t5 t0 t10 t2 t0 t7 t0 t0 t5 t6 t4 t2 t7 t2 t5 t0 t7 t10 t9 t10 t8 t7 t3 t2 t0 t0 t0 t5 t0 t5 t3.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the given string. Since S can produce either NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2, I'll need to explore each possibility. But given the length of the string, it's probably not feasible to do this naively.\n\nLooking more closely at the grammar, I can notice that some non-terminals have productions that directly translate to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT13 has productions to 't2' and 't6'.\n- NT9 has 't0'.\n- NT5 has 't0'.\n- NT4 has 't0' and 't5'.\n- NT2 has 't2', 't5', and 't7'.\n- NT0 has several 't' options, including 't4', 't10', and others.\n- NT7 has 't0' and 't10'.\n- Others seem to terminate in some 't' tokens as well.\n\nThis indicates that perhaps the grammar is designed to generate sequences of 't's with certain patterns. Let me try to see if the string itself follows such patterns.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t2, t0, t3. Now, looking at the grammar, when does 't3' appear? \n\nLooking at NT3, it can produce 't2' via NT3->NT7 NT1. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT3-> NT7 NT1, and NT1 can produce sequences that might lead to 't2's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that NT3 can produce 't2', so 't3' would correspond to NT3. So, for the first token 't2', does any rule produce 't2'?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT2->t2, so that is one option.\n- NT9->t0, NT1->t8, which don't produce t2.\n- NT4->t0 or t5.\n- NT0 has t10 and t4, etc., but no immediate t2 except from NT2 itself.\n\nSo the initial 't2' could come from NT2.\n\nNow, looking at the production rules for NT2: it can produce several options, including NT0 NT0, which seems to expand further. But since the first token is 't2', the first step might be NT2->t2, but NT2 can also split into other rules, so maybe the initial 't2' comes directly.\n\nBut wait, S can't produce just t2, because S's productions are combinations of two non-terminals. So the initial step must be S expanding into two non-terminals that together produce the string.\n\nSo S can be NT4 NT8, NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at the given string: the first two tokens are t2 and t0.\n\nLet me consider if any of S's productions can generate t2 t0... Let's explore each possibility.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT4 NT8\n\nSo NT4 can produce certain 't's, and NT8 can too. Let's see what NT4 and NT8 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT4 has two options: 't0' or 't5'.\n\nNT8 has options: 't6', 't3', 't0' (from NT8->NT6 NT3, which can then produce t0 via NT6->t0 or something else).\n\nWait, NT8 can produce t0 (directly) and t6 or t3. Maybe via other routes.\n\nBut the first token is t2, which doesn't come directly from NT4 or NT8, so maybe this path is not possible. So if we choose S->NT4 NT8, the first token would have to come from NT4 or NT8's productions, but since they don't produce t2, this path seems impossible.\n\nOption 2: S -> NT4 NT11\n\nSo NT4 produces 't0' or 't5', and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT11->... NT11 can produce NT8 NT5 or NT3 NT1.\n\nLet's see the first two tokens are t2 and t0. So perhaps NT4 produces 't0' and NT11 produces 't2', but does NT11 produce t2?\n\nLooking at NT11's productions: NT11->NT8 NT5 or NT3 NT1. Do any of these lead to 't2'?\n\nNT8 can produce t0, t6, t3. Let's see:\n\nNT8->NT6 NT3. Then NT6->... Looking at NT6, from the rules:\n\nNT6->NT9 NT11 or NT6->... Wait, NT6->NT9 NT11 or NT11 NT6? Wait, looking back, NT6 is defined as:\n\nWait, the rules for NT6: NT6->NT9 NT11 or NT6->... Wait, actually, checking the given rules:\n\n- NT6->NT9 NT11\n- NT6->NT11 NT6? Or is that another rule. Wait, I might have miswritten.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I need to extract for each symbol.

Let's see if this can produce t2 t0 as the start.\n\nBut NT4 doesn't produce t2, and NT11 doesn't produce t2 unless through its own productions.\n\nWait, NT3 is a terminal that can produce t2, but NT3 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I recall has productions where the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar has a mix of non-terminals (like NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals ('t0', 't1', etc.). Wait, but in the grammar, some of these look like terminals but perhaps I should clarify. For example, NT0 \u2192 't10' is a production where NT0 is a non-terminal that produces terminal 't10'. Similarly, NT1 \u2192 't8'.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a top-down parse starting from the start symbol S. Alternatively, since the string is pretty long, perhaps a bottom-up approach would be more practical, using a parser that tracks the possible derivations.\n\nBut since the grammar is given, maybe I can first identify the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and looking at the productions, S can go to NT4 NT8, or NT4 NT11, or NT1 NT2. So S can split into two non-terminals each time.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (like NT4, NT8, etc.) have their own productions. The challenge is to see if the string can be produced by any combination of these productions.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols in the string. It's quite long\u201436 symbols. Given that each production in CNF increases the length by one, starting from S (which would produce two symbols after one step), the number of steps required would be such that the length of the string minus the initial S gives the number of productions. But perhaps that's more involved than necessary.\n\nAnother approach is to simulate the parse using a table or step-by-step expansion. Since the string is made up of 't's, I should check if each 't' can be generated by a production. For example, if a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal, that's a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t10\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT2 \u2192 t2 or t5 or t7 (but wait, some have t2, others, like NT10 \u2192t6, etc.)\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't6', etc. Wait no, some are terminals and others are non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't7' and 't2'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0', 't10'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0', 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2', 't5', 't7' (I think, based on the productions listed above)\n- NT13 \u2192 't4', 't6', 't10', 't2'\n- NT7 \u2192 't0', 't10', 't3' (and so on)\nWait, perhaps I should make a list:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t10\nNT1 \u2192 t8\nNT2 \u2192 t2, t5, t7\nNT3 \u2192 t7, t2\nNT4 \u2192 t0, t5\nNT5 \u2192 t0, t2\nNT6 \u2192 t9, t11\nWait, NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT11, which are non-terminals, so it depends on what those produce. Hmm, perhaps I should look for any non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t10\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT2 \u2192 t2, t5, t7 (Wait, looking back: I think NT2 has \"\u2192 NT0 NT0\", but that's a non-terminal production.

The terminals are: t0, t1, t2, t3, t5, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, and t13. The non-terminals are S, NT1, NT2, up to NT14.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of these terminals, so I need to see if S can derive this sequence through some series of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except for the rules where a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal. These direct terminals are called axioms in CNF grammars.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that several non-terminals directly produce a single terminal:\n- NT3 \u2192 't5'\n- NT10 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't6'\n- NT9 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't6'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT1 \u2192 't8'\n- NT9 \u2192 't9'\n- NT4 \u2192 't7'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT8 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't2'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT7 \u2192 't10'\n- NT10 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but looking at NT13 again, it has two productions: NT13 \u2192 't4' and NT13 \u2192 't6'. That's a bit confusing. I need to make sure which one applies, but perhaps the parser can choose either. However, each production is a rule, so the same non-terminal can have multiple productions. So in the parse tree, each application of a production can choose one of the available options.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. To check if S can derive this string, I can try building a parse tree or use a method like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is large, it might be easier to step through the possible derivations manually.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't7', which comes from NT4 or NT2, as per the rules. Both NT4 and NT2 have 't7' as a terminal production. For example, NT4 \u2192 't7', and NT2 \u2192 't7' as per the grammar.\n\nLet me consider S, which can produce various combinations of non-terminals, as per the first three productions:\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nI'll try to see which of these could lead to the string.\n\nLet me focus on the first production: S \u2192 NT4 NT8. NT4 can produce 't7', NT8 can produce 't0', t0, etc.\n\nWait, let me look back. The first symbol in the string is 't7', so I can consider S \u2192 NT4 NT8, because NT4 \u2192 t7 and NT8 \u2192 t0. So the first two symbols would be 't7 t0'. But the string starts with 't7 t9', which isn't 't7 t0'. So that production's first step gives 't7 t0', which doesn't match the first two symbols. So maybe that's not the right production.\n\nWait, let's check what NT8 can produce. NT8's productions include 't0' and 't6', which are both terminals. So first two symbols are 't7 t9', so perhaps S \u2192 NT4 NT8 is not the start because NT8 can't produce 't9' directly. So perhaps the other productions are better.\n\nLet me look at the third production: S \u2192 NT1 NT2. NT1 can produce 't8', and NT2 can produce 't7' as per the rules. So S can produce 't8 t7' as the first two symbols. But the string starts with 't7 t9', which doesn't match 't8 t7', so that production might not lead to the correct string either.\n\nSo perhaps the second production: S \u2192 NT4 NT11. NT4 can produce 't7' or 't5' or 't0'. Wait, looking at NT4's productions: NT4 can produce 't0', 't5', and 't7'. So NT4 \u2192 't7' is possible. So S \u2192 NT4 (\u2192 t7) and NT11. Let's see what NT11 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT11's productions: NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, and others. Wait, looking back, NT11's productions are:\nNT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5\nNT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11\nBut I might have missed others. Wait, in the grammar, looking at NT11, I see:\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\nNT11-> NT3 NT11\nWait, perhaps I missed other productions, but based on the given rules, it looks like NT11 has those two main ones. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the lines under NT11 are:\n- NT11 -> NT8 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6\n- NT11-> NT3 NT11\n\nWait, so NT11 only has those two productions? No, I think I might have missed some. Let's look carefully: the grammar list for NT11 is:\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\nNT11-> NT3 NT11\nMaybe there's more, but perhaps in the given rules, only these two. So from NT11, it can produce either (a) NT8 and NT5, or (b) NT3 and NT11.\n\nBut to get a terminal string from NT11, it would have to reduce all non-terminals to terminals, but perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some of the non-terminals might have paths to terminals through multiple steps. So perhaps we can derive a terminal from NT11. Let's explore that.\n\nIf NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5, then NT8 can produce 't0' or 't6', and NT5 can produce 't0' or 't2' or 't5' or 't7' (checking NT5's productions):\n\nNT5's productions: looking through the grammar, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2, NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT2, and others, but the direct terminals are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules for NT5:\n\nNT5 -> 't0'\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar is:\n\nWait, checking NT5's rules: looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, checking NT5's productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT5 \u2192 't0' except for NT2 \u2192 't2' and NT9 \u2192 't9', etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check: \n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT5, the rule is: \n\nNT5 -> 't0'\n\nYes, that's one of the rules. So NT5 can produce 't0' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 can produce 't0' or 't6' directly.\n\nSo going back to S \u2192 NT4 NT11, since NT4 can produce 't7', and NT11 can produce NT8 NT5 or NT3 NT11.\n\nLet me consider the case where NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5. Then NT8 can produce 't0' or 't6', and NT5 can produce 't0'.\n\nSo the string would start with t7 (from NT4), followed by t0 (from NT8), t0 (from NT5), etc. But the string starts with t7 t9, so this path wouldn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if NT11 \u2192 NT3 NT11, then NT3 can produce 't2', and then we have NT11 again. But then, can NT3 reduce further? Let's see, NT3's productions are:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, no, actually, the grammar seems to mix NTs and Ts. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are things like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and some of the productions have terminals like 't5', 't10', 't3', etc. So, for example, NT3 -> 't2', so when we see t2 in the string, that's a terminal derived from NT3.\n\nWait, but when building a parse tree for the string, we start from S and derive strings using the rules. So, for example, S -> NT4 NT8, so S directly produces two NTs, each of which can be replaced by more NTs or terminals.\n\nThe strategy here is to use a recursive descent parser approach, trying to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me first list out all the production rules, grouping them as needed. Starting from S:\n\nS -> NT4 NT8 | NT4 NT11 | NT1 NT2\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13 | NT6 NT3 | NT11 NT11 | NT8 NT8 | NT2 NT2 | NT10 NT10\n\nNT10 -> NT3 NT10 | NT1 NT1\n\nWait, some of these have recursive rules.

Let me check each NT rule again.\n\nWait, I see in the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't0' | NT7 is part of a larger rule, but none of the NT rules produce 't7'. So does that mean that 't7' can't be derived from the grammar? That's a problem because the string starts with 't7'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I am misunderstanding how the NT rules are defined.

{"custom_id":"request-929","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, along with the string to evaluate. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I understand that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit the CNF structure because all productions either have two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe next thing I notice is that the grammar produces a series of terminal symbols, which likely form a string. The string provided is a sequence of these terminals. To check if this string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if it can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t10 t0 t10 t0 t0 t2 t10 t4 t0 t0 t6 t7 t5 t9 t0 t10 t2 t0 t5 t5 t10 t10 t5 t2 t10 t10 t10 t2 t5 t7 t6 t3 t6 t2 t5 t0 t0 t7 t9 t3 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t0 t4`.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string using the grammar's productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps a recursive descent parser or a memoization approach could work, but maybe a simpler way is to see if the string can be divided into parts according to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps I can represent the string as a series of symbols and see if each production can be expanded step by step.\n\nAnother idea is to construct a parse tree. Starting from S, each step expands a non-terminal into two symbols, either another non-terminal or a terminal. The string, therefore, should correspond to a sequence that can be produced by such an expansion.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, it might be time-consuming to do this manually, but perhaps I can look for patterns or possible expansions that include the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. Let me check which productions produce 't5'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT4, NT2, NT9, NT7, NT1, and NT3 can produce 't5' based on the productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- NT1 \u2192 t8\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT7 \u2192 t10\n- NT0 \u2192 t10\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT11 \u2192 t3\n- etc.\n\nWait, actually, from the provided grammar, I need to find which NT produce 't5'. Looking through, I realize I might have an error. Let me check each production that ends with a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT4 can produce 't0' or 't5' based on the given rules. Similarly, NT2 can produce 't2' or 't5' via NT2 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 t5? Wait, no, looking deeper:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT2 can produce NT0 NT0, and NT0 can produce various things, including t10, t4, etc. But specifically, I'm looking for which NT can produce 't5' directly. From the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT2 \u2192 t2\n- Also, NT7 \u2192 t5? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT7: it has productions like NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which can lead to terminals, but do any NT7 productions produce 't5'? Looking through the list, I don't see NT7 directly producing 't5'. For example, NT7 can produce NT3 NT11, which may expand to terminals, but I'm not sure if any path leads directly to 't5'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's list all non-terminals that can produce 't5':\n\nLooking through each production that ends with a terminal 't5', I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t0 or t5? Wait, looking at NT4: the rules are NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7 and NT14 can produce NT3 NT4. Also, NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and NT5 can produce NT9 NT2. Wait, maybe I'm not looking correctly.\n\nWait, looking at each NT's rules:\n\n- NT4: Rule is NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. But no rule directly produces 't5' from NT4. So maybe NT4 doesn't produce 't5' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each line from the grammar to see if any NT produces 't5' as a terminal:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't0' or 't5' via NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7, but does that lead to 't5'? Maybe not directly. Let me see if any rule for NT4 ends with 't5'. No, I think NT4 produces either two NTs or a terminal 't0' or 't5' via chain rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Maybe each terminal in the string must be generated by a production that directly produces that terminal. So, for each 't' in the string, there must be a way for a non-terminal to produce it.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't5'. So I need a production for a non-terminal that can produce 't5' directly. Let me go through each rule and see which NTs can produce 't5' directly.\n\nLooking through each '\u2192' list:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT8 NT5: This doesn't produce 't5' directly.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT7: Not producing a terminal.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2: No 't5' terminal.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT0: But NT0 can produce 't10', etc., but no 't5'.\n- NT1 \u2192 NT9 NT13: No 't5'.\n- NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT4: No 't5'.\n- NT14 \u2192 NT3 NT4: No 't5'.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT0 NT10: No 't5'.\n- NT4: Does any production of NT4 include 't5'? Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT4 has the rule: NT4 \u2192 NT14 NT7. But earlier, there's a line that says NT4 \u2192 't0', but no, that was a typo. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT3, there's a rule NT3 \u2192 't7' which may or may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should list all the terminals mentioned:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t9, t10, t11, t13, t14.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the rules that end with terminals are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT4 NT8: If NT4 \u2192 't5' and NT8 \u2192 't5', then 't5 t5' would be possible.\nBut wait, looking at S: S can produce NT4 and NT8. So if NT4 and NT8 can produce 't5', then S can produce 't5 t5'.\n\nBut in the string, let's see: the first two are 't5 t10', so that wouldn't fit that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's start by trying to find if each symbol in the string can be generated by some NT.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5, t10, t0, t10, t0, t0, t2, t10, t4, t0, t0, t6, t7, t5, t9, t0, t10, t2, t0, t5, t5, t10, t10, t5, t2, t10, t10, t10, t2, t5, t7, t6, t3, t6, t2, t5, t0, t0, t7, t9, t3, t5, t0, t0, t5, t0, t0, t4.\n\nThis is a long string, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, 't5'. Let's see if any NT produces 't5' directly. Looking through the grammar, the only NT that seems to produce 't5' directly is NT5 (if I'm reading correctly). Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar's initial lines don't list NT5 as a terminal production. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT5, there's a rule: NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT2.

{"custom_id":"request-935","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either a single non-terminal symbol or a combination of two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I believe are the terminals.\n\nFirst, let me parse the grammar rules to see what they produce. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT4 NT8, or other similar combinations. Each of these non-terminals can eventually derive into a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be broken down into these rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t0 t5 t10 t2 t0 t3 t2 t0 t9 t10 t0 t5 t10 t9 t10 t3 t5 t0 t4 t3 t5 t6 t0 t5 t9 t3 t5 t2 t0 t5 t0 t3 t5 t5 t5 t10 t5 t0 t0 t10 t9 t3 t2 t1 t7 t7 t6.\n\nI notice that some of the tokens are known from the grammar. For example, t0, t1, t2, etc., are terminals. So I should map the string into the non-terminals based on these productions.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT4 NT8. So I should check if the string starts with NT4 followed by NT8. NT4 can produce various things. Looking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7\nNT4 -> NT9 NT2\nNT4 -> NT5\nNT4 -> NT4 NT5 (wait, this is a recursive production, but perhaps it's not needed here)\n\nLet me see which NT4 production can lead to t0 or other terminals. For example, if NT4 can produce a terminal, that would be helpful. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, none directly produce a terminal. Wait, let me check again. NT4 -> NT14 NT7. Then I need to see if NT14 or NT7 can derive into terminals.\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4. So NT14 can go to NT3 and NT4. NT3 produces t2, so NT14 becomes t2... Hmm, but then NT4 can go to other paths. This seems a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for another NT4 production. Let me check all NT4 productions again:\n\n1. NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n2. NT4 -> NT7\n3. NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n4. NT4 -> NT5\n\nSo none of them directly produce a terminal, except perhaps NT9 and NT5 could produce one. Let's look at NT9:\n\nNT9 -> NT0 NT10, which goes to t10 via NT10 -> 't10'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT10 is defined as NT10 -> 't1', according to NT10 -> 't1'. Similarly, NT5 -> 't0' directly. NT5 is defined as NT5 -> 't0' among other possibilities.\n\nSo if S produces NT4 NT8, and NT4 can somehow lead to t0 and t0, that might be part of the start. Alternatively, let's check another possible starting rule.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t0 t0. Let's see if S can produce t0 t0 via some NT. Maybe S -> NT4 NT8, and both NT4 and NT8 produce t0. Or perhaps NT4 produces t0, but from the grammar, looking at NT4's rules, none directly go to t0. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at NT0's rules: NT0 has several productions, one of which is NT0 -> 't10', another is NT0 -> 't4', and others. But I don't have NT0 in the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a tree. Each non-terminal expands into two terminals or non-terminals. Let me think about possible subtrees.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t0. Let's see where t0 can come from. Checking the grammar, NT9 can produce t0 because NT9 -> 't0'. Similarly, NT5 can produce 't0'. Also, NT0 can produce 't10' or 't4', but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider all possible starting points. Since S produces NT4 NT8, and the string starts with t0 t0, let's see if NT4 can produce t0, and NT8 can produce t0.\n\nBut looking at NT4's productions, none directly produce t0. So perhaps I need to look at how NT4 can derive to something that ends with t0. For example, if NT4 can produce a series of symbols that, when all non-terminals are resolved, results in t0 t0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT8 can produce t0. Looking at NT8's productions:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\nNT8 -> NT9 NT7\nNT8 can also recursively go on, but looking for terminals. Let me see NT8's rules that lead to terminals:\n\nLooking, for example, NT6: NT6 -> NT9 NT11. Neither NT9 nor NT11 produce terminals, except NT11->t3 and others. Not directly seeing a t0 there.\n\nWait, maybe using a different approach. Let me see which non-terminals can produce t0. From the grammar:\n\n- NT0: can produce 't10', 't4', etc.\n- NT9: can produce 't0'\n- NT5: can produce 't0'\n\nNow, perhaps t0 can come from NT9 or NT5. So in the string, starting with t0 t0, perhaps these are the result of some NT9 or NT5.\n\nLet me look at S's productions again. The first is S -> NT4 NT8, another is S -> NT1 NT2, etc. Wait, the initial S may produce NT4 NT8, so if NT4 and NT8 can each produce 't0', that would match the first two tokens 't0' 't0'.\n\nBut earlier I thought NT4 doesn't directly produce 't0', but maybe through some expansion. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at NT4:\n\n- NT4 can produce NT14 NT7\n- Or NT7\n- Or NT9 NT2\n- Or NT5\n\nNone of these produce 't0' directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps if NT4 expands to NT9 NT2, and NT9 can produce 't0', then 't0' 't0' could come from NT4 -> NT9 NT2, but then NT2 needs to produce 't0'. Looking at NT2's production:\n\nNT2 -> t2, according to NT2 -> 't2' among others. Oh, wait, looking at the grammar, NT2 produces 't2' as one of its rules. So NT2 can produce 't2' directly. But in this case, the initial part is t0 t0, so if S produces NT4 NT8, then NT4 could be NT9 NT2, and NT8 could be NT9 NT7, and NT7 could be 't0'. Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf NT4 -> NT9 NT2, then NT9 can produce 't0', and NT2 can produce 't2', but that would result in t0 t2, not t0 t0.\n\nAlternatively, if NT4 is producing something else.\n\nWait, let me check all NT4's rules again:\n\n1. NT4 -> NT14 NT7\n2. NT4 -> NT7\n3. NT4 -> NT9 NT2\n4. NT4 -> NT5\n\nSo, only NT5 directly produces 't0', but NT4 can't directly produce 't0' unless there's a way through its expansion. Let's see NT5's productions:\n\nNT5 -> 't0', so yes, NT5 can produce 't0'.\n\nSo, perhaps if NT4 -> NT5, it would produce 't0'. So then the first part, S could produce NT4 (which is 't0') and NT8, which needs to produce 't0'. Let's see how NT8 can produce 't0'.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules:\n\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT5\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT13\n- NT8 -> NT9 NT7\n\nLooking at these options:\n\n- NT8 can't directly produce a terminal. So, perhaps NT8 can produce 't0' through some combination. For example, if NT8 expands to NT1 NT5, and NT5 is 't0', but what is NT1's output?\n\nLooking at NT1:\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\nNT1 -> NT9 NT1\nNT1 -> NT12 NT9\nNT1 -> 't8' among others"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break it down into individual tokens:\n\nt5, t5, t10, t9, t3, t0, t3, t10, t6, t0, t5, t5, t1, t2, t5, t9, t5, t2, t5, t0, t7, t0, t2, t8, t2, t2, t10, t0, t0, t0, t5, t5, t3, t5, t0, t10, t0, t7, t0, t0, t0, t5, t0, t0, t3, t2, t0, t4, t0\n\nHmm. Let me start by looking at the grammar and see how 't5's are generated. From the rules, NT2 -> t2 and also NT2 -> t5 based on NT2 -> 't5' and also other rules like NT2 -> NT0 NT0, but wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nYes, in the rules:\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nAlso, looking further, I see NT9 -> 't9', NT0 -> 't10', etc. So t tokens are generated by the right-hand sides of the NT productions.\n\nWait, in the initial rules provided, I need to carefully list each production because the strings can be a bit confusing. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking at all the options for each NT:\n\nNT11 -> NT8 NT5\n\nNT7 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT5 -> NT9 NT2\n\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13\n\nNT10 -> NT1 NT1\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT0\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT6\n\nNT7 -> NT12 NT9\n\nNT11 -> NT3 NT11\n\nNT13 -> NT3 NT12\n\nNT4 -> NT14 NT7\n\nNT1 -> NT9 NT13\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT0 -> NT11 NT11\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT11\n\nNT11 -> NT7 NT11\n\nNT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\n\nNT7 -> NT1 NT13\n\nNT1 -> NT12 NT8\n\nNT12 -> NT8 NT4\n\nNT14 -> NT3 NT4\n\nNT3 -> NT7 NT1\n\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT5 -> NT10 NT2\n\nNT2 -> NT2 NT4\n\nNT12 -> NT3 NT12\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT5\n\nNT1 -> NT7 NT14\n\nNT0 -> NT2 NT1\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT13\n\nNT1 -> NT7 NT14\n\nNT0 -> NT10 NT10\n\nNT3 -> 't7'\n\nWait, some entries were duplicates, maybe. Let me separate each production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more efficient to note the terminals:\n\n- NT2 -> 't2'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't9'\n- NT7 -> 't7'\n- NT0 -> 't10' (from NT0 -> 't10')\nWait, no: looking at the rules, for example, NT0 appears in several productions:\n\nLooking for NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT14 NT13\n\nNT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\nNT0 -> NT11 NT11\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT3\n\nNT0 -> NT11 NT11\n\nNT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all NT0 productions correctly.\n\nWait, in the list provided above, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT14 NT13\n\n- NT0 -> NT8 NT8\n\n- NT0 -> NT11 NT11\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3\n\nSo, that's four different productions for NT0.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t5, which is generated by NT2. But NT2 is in the grammar. Let me check NT2's production:\n\nNT2 -> 't2' and also NT2 -> NT0 NT0, right? Wait, in the rules, looking back:\n\nYes:\n\nNT2 -> 't2'\n\nAlso, NT2 -> NT0 NT0: according to the rules, looking for NT2->...:\n\nLooking back at all NT2 productions:\n\nWait, I don't see NT2 -> NT0 NT0. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through all the productions again.\n\nLooking through each production line in the grammar, I see NT2 in this list:\n\n- NT2->'t2'\n\n- NT2->NT0 NT0?\n\nWait, no, looking through all the lines:\n\nWait, looking at each line, I see:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\n4. NT11->NT8 NT5\n\n5. NT7->NT9 NT7\n\n6. NT5->NT9 NT2\n\n7. NT0->NT14 NT13\n\n8. NT10->NT1 NT1\n\n9. NT2->NT0 NT0\n\nWait, yes, NT2->NT0 NT0 is production option 9.\n\nSo NT2 can produce 't2' or expand into NT0 NT0.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t5, t5, so first token is NT2? But t5 is generated by NT5. So that makes me think.\n\nWait, for the first token 't5', it must come from NT5, whose production is NT5->'t5' and also possibly other things.\n\nBut looking at production for NT5: NT5->'t5' and also NT5->NT9 NT2.\n\nSo, in the beginning of the string, we have 't5 t5 ...'\n\nLet me simulate expanding S.\n\nWe need to see whether this string can be derived by S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach, since the string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar is CNF, we can try to build parse trees to see if the string can be generated.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar and see if we can build it up.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nThe string starts with t5 t5.\n\nt5 is generated by NT5.\n\nSo, the beginning part could be NT5 -> 't5', then maybe another NT5 -> 't5'.\n\nBut let's try to see if the production S can lead to that.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S can produce nt4 nt8, nt4 nt11, or nt1 nt2.\n\nFirst option: nt4 nt8.\n\nIf we choose S -> NT1 NT2, then to produce t5 t5..., let's see.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, S can expand into three options.\n\nWhich one is more likely to produce t5 t5 at the start?\n\nOption 1: S -> NT1 NT2.\n\nThen NT1 can produce what?

The string is quite long, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nThe string is: t7 t0 t10 t0 t2 t5 t9 t8 t4 t0 t10 t0 t0 t0 t6 t5 t0 t0 t7 t10 t9 t0 t9 t3 t6 t5 t0 t0 t5 t9 t3 t2 t8 t0 t10 t3 t5 t0 t10 t3 t0 t0 t6 t6 t2 t0 t5 t7 t10.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components, treating each \"t\" followed by a number as a single token. There are 59 tokens in total, which seems quite long.\n\nI'll try to build the string from the bottom up, looking for the rules that can produce sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has two productions:\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT1 NT2\n3. S -> NT11 NT6\n\nWait, no, the first line says S can go to NT4 NT8, and the second line says S can go to NT4 NT11, and S can go to NT1 NT2. So, S has three possible initial productions.\n\nI'll consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's consider S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nAccording to the grammar, NT4 can produce several things. Let's see the production for NT4: it can be NT14 NT7, or NT4 -> t0, or NT4 -> t5, or NT4 -> NT9 NT4, or NT4 -> NT7 NT4. Similarly, NT8 has several productions, including NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT8 -> t0, etc.\n\nSo, S -> NT4 NT8 can start the string with NT4 and NT8. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nIf I take NT4 and see if it can produce a terminal, like t0 or t5. Alternatively, it might require combining with NT14 or NT7. Similarly for NT8.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, treating it as a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nBut since the string is so long, perhaps a bottom-up approach (using the CYK algorithm or something similar) would be better, but without implementing that, I'll try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I'll try to look for the leftmost symbols first.\n\nLet me list the possible NT (non-terminals) and see their possible terminal sequences.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the NTs and their productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13\n- NT4 -> NT14 NT7 or 't0', 't5', NT9 NT4, NT7 NT4\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT3, NT14 NT13, NT11 NT11, etc.\n- NT11 -> NT3 NT11 or 't3'\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT2 or 't0'\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT6 or NT9 NT7 or NT12 NT9 or NT7 NT11 or 't0', 't10', 't7', etc.\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT0, NT2 NT4, etc.\n- NT10 -> 't6'\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT3, NT1 NT5, NT6 NT13, NT9 NT8, 't0', etc.\n- NT13 -> NT5 NT12, 't2', 't4', etc.\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1, 't2', 't3'\n- NT12 -> NT3 NT12, 't8', etc.\n- NT9 -> NT0 NT10, 't0', etc.\n- NT1 -> NT9 NT13, 't8', etc.\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT1, etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I'll start by seeing if 't7' can be produced by any NT.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't7'. Looking at the productions, which NTs can produce 't7'?\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminal tokens for each NT:\n\n- NT4 can produce t0 or t5.\n- NT7 can produce t0, t10, t7, etc., directly or via other rules.\n- NT9 can produce t0, t10, etc., but not directly t7.\n- NT10 produces 't6'.\n- NT2 produces 't2' or 't5' or 't7'.\n- NT1 can produce 't8' directly.\n- NT12 can produce 't8' as well.\n- NT3 can produce 't2' or 't3'.\n- NT5 can produce 't0' or 't2', via NT2.\n- Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each NT might have multiple ways to produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT2: it can produce 't2' or 't5' (from NT10 which produces 't6'?), no, wait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs and their direct terminal productions.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT1, ... but according to the production, NT3 can go to NT7 NT1 or 't2' or 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps the direct terminals are:\n\n- NT1: can't produce a terminal directly; it goes to NT9 NT13, etc.\n- NT2: can produce 't2' (directly?), no. Let me check: NT2's production includes NT2 -> NT0 NT0, NT2 -> NT2 NT4, NT2 -> 't2' (from which rule?), and 't5' (through NT10?).\n\nWait, let me go through each NT and see if any can directly produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: it has a rule NT7 -> 't0', 't10', 't7', etc. Yes, NT7 can produce 't7' directly. So, the initial part of the string is 't7', which can come from NT7.\n\nSo, the first step is to have NT7 produce 't7'.\n\nSo, S -> NT4 NT8 or S-> NT1 NT2 or S-> NT11 NT6.\n\nIn this case, the first symbol is 't7', which is produced by NT7, so perhaps the production used was S -> NT4 NT8. But wait, no. Because the first production from S is NT4 and NT8. But 't7' is in NT7, which is in the body of NT7, which is perhaps derived from S via some rule.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the initial productions, S has three options:\n\n1. S -> NT4 NT8\n2. S -> NT4 NT11\n3. S -> NT1 NT2\n\nBut these are S -> NT... So, S is an S symbol, and then follows NT... So, to get a string starting with 't7', which is produced by NT7, perhaps NT7 is part of a larger derivation from S. Or maybe I need to see if S can produce a string that starts with 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for whether S can derive into a string that starts with 't7'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules for S, they all produce two non-terminals: for example, S -> NT4 NT8, which are both non-terminals. So, to get a 't7' as the first symbol, that 't7' must come from one of the NT's in the body of S's production.\n\nLooking at the first production: S -> NT4 NT8.\n\nSo, NT4 can be NT14 NT7 or other things, and NT8 can be NT6 NT3, or other.\n\nIf NT8 can produce 't0', 't5', etc., but not 't7', so how does 't7' come into play here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the other productions for S. Let's see S's other options:\n\nS -> NT1 NT2.\n\nLooking at NT1's productions: NT1 -> NT9 NT13, and so on. So NT1 can't directly produce 't7'? Or can it via some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps looking deeper: NT1 -> NT9 NT13. NT9 can go to NT0 NT10, which can go to NT2 NT1, etc. But maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial symbols in the string can be broken down in a way that matches S's productions.\n\nLooking at the string starting with t7 t0 t10..., perhaps the S derivation starts with a path that leads to NT7.\n\nWait, maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-973","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, where do I start? Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So all the non-terminals expand into two non-terminals or a terminal directly.\n\nThe given string is pretty long: `t0 t9 t9 t10 t8 t3 t0 t0 t3 t5 t0 t2 t0 t2 t0 t3 t10 t8 t0 t10 t9 t10 t10 t0 t5 t5 t2 t2 t0 t7 t0 t2 t5 t1 t7 t0 t9 t9 t0 t3 t6 t8 t2 t8 t0 t5 t9 t0 t0 t6`.\n\nFirst, I think I should list out all the production rules again to double-check, but wait, the user provided the entire grammar in the initial chunk. Let me scan through the grammar to identify all the terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals seem to be t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t13, t14, NT1, NT2, NT4, NT5, NT7, NT9, NT0, etc. Wait, some of the right-hand sides have combinations like NT2, NT5, 't5', 't7', etc. So the grammar uses uppercase NT for non-terminals and lowercase t for terminals.\n\nNow, the initial string is all terminals, so I need to see if this can be produced by the grammar. I'll think about how to approach this. Since the string is long, perhaps I should try building a parse tree or use a recursive descent method. But with this many steps, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step doubles the length, so the string length should be a power of two multiplied by the initial length. Let me check the string length: counting the number of tokens.\n\nThe string has: `t0`, `t9`, `t9`, `t10`, `t8`, `t3`, `t0`, `t0`, `t3`, `t5`, `t0`, `t2`, `t0`, `t2`, `t0`, `t3`, `t10`, `t8`, `t0`, `t10`, `t9`, `t10`, `t10`, `t0`, `t5`, `t5`, `t2`, `t2`, `t0`, `t7`, `t0`, `t2`, `t5`, `t1`, `t7`, `t0`, `t9`, `t9`, `t0`, `t3`, `t6`, `t8`, `t2`, `t8`, `t0`, `t5`, `t9`, `t0`, `t0`, `t6`. That's 58 tokens. Wait, 58 is not a power of two, and in CNF, the derived strings have lengths that are exponentials in the number of steps. Hmm, but wait, maybe the start symbol S can produce strings of length 2^n. Let me see the start productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT4 NT8\nS \u2192 NT4 NT11\nS \u2192 NT1 NT2\n\nSo S starts with two non-terminals. From each NT production, each step doubles the number of non-terminals. When terminals are introduced, each terminal is a production step of a single terminal. So the total length of the string must be a product of 2^k and the number of terminals derived from each NT.\n\nWait, but 58 is even, but more importantly, the length is 58, which is 58-2=56, which is 8*7, but wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for the presence of certain terminals and see if they can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find the terminals in the string and see if they are directly derivable from some productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I see several 't's: 't0', 't1', etc., but from the grammar, some of the terminals are specific.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals present in the string:\n\nt0, t9, t10, t8, t3, t5, t2, t7, t4, t6, t1.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT13 can produce t2, t4, t5, etc. Wait, let me look at the grammar rules:\n\nNT13 has these rules:\n\nNT13 -> NT5 NT12\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT13 -> NT12 NT9\nNT13 -> NT6 NT10\nNT13 -> NT3 NT11\nNT13 -> NT6 NT12\nAlso, looking at the productions, for example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't0'\nNT4 \u2192 't5'\nNT2 \u2192 't2'\nNT10 \u2192 't6'\nNT2 \u2192 't5' (another rule)\nNT1 \u2192 't8'\nNT0 \u2192 't10' (among others)\nNT13 \u2192 't2', 't4', 't5', 't6', 't9', 't10' as well.\n\nWait, looking at NT13's productions:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT13 -> 't2' (from NT13 \u2192 't2')\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT13 -> NT6 NT12\"\n\"NT7 -> NT11 NT7\"\n\"NT0 -> NT14 NT13\"\n\"NT10 -> NT1 NT1\"\n\"NT2 -> NT2 NT4\"\n\"NT12 -> NT3 NT12\"\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT3\"\n\"NT5 -> NT10 NT2\"\n\"NT2 -> NT2 NT5\"\n\"NT12 -> NT3 NT12\"\n\"NT8 -> NT1 NT5\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT13\"\n\"NT1 -> NT7 NT14\"\n\"NT0 -> NT10 NT10\"\n\"NT3 -> NT7 NT1\"\n\"NT11 -> NT7 NT11\"\n\"NT13 -> NT5 NT12\"\n\"NT7 -> NT1 NT13\"\n\"NT1 -> NT12 NT8\"\n\"NT12 -> NT8 NT4\"\n\"NT14 -> NT3 NT4\"\n\"NT3 -> NT7 NT1\"\n\"NT11 -> NT3 NT11\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\"NT0 -> NT6 NT3\"\n\"NT13 -> NT6 NT12\"\n\"NT11 -> NT7 NT11\"\n\"NT0 -> NT8 NT8\"\n\"NT13 -> NT5 NT12\"\n\"NT7 -> NT1 NT13\"\n\"NT1 -> NT7 NT14\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT13\"\n\"NT5 -> NT10 NT2\"\n\"NT2 -> NT2 NT4\"\n\"NT12 -> NT3 NT12\"\n\"NT8 -> NT1 NT5\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT13\"\n\"NT1 -> NT7 NT14\"\n\"NT0 -> NT10 NT10\"\n\"NT3 -> NT7 NT1\"\n\"NT11 -> NT7 NT11\"\n\"NT13 -> NT5 NT12\"\n\"NT7 -> NT1 NT13\"\n\"NT1 -> NT12 NT8\"\n\"NT12 -> NT8 NT4\"\n\"NT14 -> NT3 NT4\"\n\"NT3 -> NT7 NT1\"\n\"NT11 -> NT3 NT11\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\"NT0 -> NT6 NT3\"\n\"NT13 -> NT6 NT12\"\n\"NT11 -> NT7 NT11\"\n\"NT0 -> NT8 NT8\"\n\"NT13 -> NT5 NT12\"\n\"NT7 -> NT1 NT13\"\n\"NT1 -> NT7 NT14\"\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT1\"\n\"NT8 -> NT6 NT13\"\n\"NT5 -> NT10 NT2\"\n\"NT2 -> NT2 NT4\"\n\"NT12 -> NT3 NT12\"\n\"NT8 -> NT1 NT5\"\n\"NT0 -> NT6 NT3\"\n\"NT4 -> NT10 NT5\"\n\"NT2 -> NT2 NT5\"\n...\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

The string is pretty long, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule with two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal as the only symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see all the productions fit this form.\n\nThe string to check is: `t0 t10 t0 t9 t2 t0 t0 t0 t3 t10 t3 t6 t0 t0 t0 t9 t9 t5 t0 t3 t3 t6 t0 t0 t2 t0 t1 t7 t3 t10 t2 t1 t9 t4 t0 t10 t3 t3 t3 t5 t9 t10 t4 t5 t1 t6 t3 t10 t8 t3`.\n\nI think the best approach is to apply the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell represents a substring of the input. For each position in the string, I need to determine which non-terminals can derive that substring.\n\nThe steps for CYK are:\n\n1. Initialize the table: For each character in the string, check which non-terminals can derive that single character.\n2. Fill the table: For each substring of increasing length, determine the possible non-terminals that can generate the substring based on the previous step and the grammar rules.\n3. Check the top-left cell: After filling the table up to the full length of the string, if the start symbol S can derive the entire string, the answer is yes.\n\nStarting the process:\n\n1. Initialization: For each t in the string, find all NT such that NT -> t.\nLooking at the grammar, let's find which NT produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't0' (from NT7->'t0')\n- NT10 -> 't1' (from NT10->'t1')\n- NT13 -> 't2' (from NT13->'t2')\n- NT9 -> 't3' (from NT9->'t3')\n- NT1 -> 't8' (from NT1->'t8')\n- NT5 -> 't0' (from NT5->'t0')\n- NT2 -> 't5' (from NT2->'t5')\n- NT4 -> 't0' (from NT4->'t0')\n- NT8 -> 't6' (from NT8->'t6'), but wait, some NT produce 't6'? Looking, I think NT4->'t5' and others, but I might have to check more.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let's check each terminal:\n\n- t0: NT7 (t0), NT5 (t0), NT4 (t0), NT0 (t10?), wait, no, looking back, NT0 production is like S->... but not directly producing t0.

Wait, in the given grammar, the rules like S->NT4 NT8, etc., but terminals in the rules are only 't0', 't1', etc. Wait, looking at the production rules, for example, NT4 -> 't0' and 't5' perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the rules.
