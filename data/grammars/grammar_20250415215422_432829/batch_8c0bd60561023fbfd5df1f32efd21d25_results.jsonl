{"custom_id":"request-9","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t3\" is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. In CNF, the productions are either to two non-terminals or to a single terminal. This structure makes parsing easier because it limits the possible ways a string can be derived, which can also help in checking if a string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice all the productions are either to two non-terminals or directly to a terminal. So, that checks out for CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t3\". My goal is to see if there's a derivation sequence starting from the start symbol S that results in \"t3\".\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the production S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, S expands into two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. \n\nNow, each of these NTs will need to be examined to see how they can reach the terminal 't' and '3'. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting with NT81: Looking at the grammar, NT81 has a production to NT95 NT9. So, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 is a terminal which is 't10' according to the grammar. But wait, in the string we're looking at, it's \"t3\", so 't10' doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the string is \"t3\", so perhaps 't3' is NT81 directly, but looking at the productions for NT81, it only has one production: NT95 NT9. So NT81 can't be a terminal, but it's a combination of NT95 and NT9. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list out all the productions for each NT that might lead to 't3'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some terminal symbols:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT43 \u2192 't20'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't22'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT83 \u2192 't23'\n- NT90 \u2192 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't20'\n- NT98 \u2192 't24'\n\nLooking for terminal symbols that are 't3' but I see 't1', 't6', 't10', 't13', 't15', 't16', 't18', etc., but nothing for 't3'. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, I'm looking for 't3' but the terminals don't include that. Wait, did I misread the grammar? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is \"t3\". But in the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't3', except perhaps through some other steps. Or maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that can produce 't3'. Checking the list:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't67' and 't37'\n- Wait, looking at NT55: NT55's productions include 't67' and 't37'. But 't67' is 't67' again, which is another terminal. Wait, no. According to the grammar, 't67' is 't37', no, wait, the NT67 production is NT67 \u2192 't15'. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nHold on, let's clarify. Each rule's right-hand side is either a non-terminal or a terminal. So for NT55, the rule is NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37. Both NT67 and NT37 are non-terminals.\n\nSo, if NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, and that's it, then to get 't3', we need either NT67 or NT37 to produce 't3' somewhere down the line. But neither of them produce a terminal, but instead, they produce other non-terminals. So that won't help.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't3'. All terminals are 't' followed by some number, but none have '3' as the second t.\n\nSo, since the string is 't3', which is a two-character string consisting of 't' followed by '3', I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't3' through two-step derivations, considering the rules in CNF.\n\nBut in CNF, each non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals or one terminal. So, a non-terminal can't produce two terminals in a single step. Therefore, each production is a two-level structure.\n\nWait, so perhaps 't3' is achievable if one non-terminal produces 't' and another produces '3', but looking through the grammar, the only terminals are single 't' followed by numbers, not '3' as part of a digit.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused again. The string is 't3', which is 't' followed by '3', but in the grammar, we don't have any terminals that correspond to 't3'. The terminals are 't' followed by single digits, but 't3' is 't' followed by 3, but in our case, the terminal symbols in the grammar are things like 't1', 't6', 't10', etc. There's no terminal that is just 't3'. So, perhaps 't3' cannot be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar because there's no production that results in 't3' being a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe each 't' in 't3' is a separate terminal. Wait, in the grammar, each production ends with a single terminal symbol. So, for example, NT82 \u2192 't3', which would match 't3'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly goes to 't3'. All terminals are 't' followed by something like 1, 6, etc.\n\nSo, to generate 't3', we would need a non-terminal that can produce 't' and another that can produce '3', but the grammar doesn't seem to have a non-terminal that can do that. All the terminals are single 't' with numbers, but none of the non-terminals have 't3' as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't3' is formed by two non-terminals, each of which produce a 't' and a '3', but again, that's not possible because there's no terminal 't3' or 't' and '3' as separate.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The string is 't3', which is two characters. In CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal. So for a string of length 2, each character must come from some non-derivation step that combines two non-terminals each producing a single terminal.\n\nSo, for 't3', we need to find non-terminals A and B such that A \u2192 a terminal and B \u2192 another terminal, and the derivation starts with A B leading to a (e.g., S \u2192 AB). But in our case, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so NT81 and NT90 need to produce 't' and '3' respectively, or vice versa. Let's see what each of them can produce.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 is 't10', and NT95 can be derived to 't13' according to the grammar. So NT81 expands to 't13' and 't10', which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Oh, but NT5 isn't mentioned as a terminal. Wait, in the NT production rules, are any of them just 't5'? Let me check the last lines.\n\nWait, the lines towards the end are:\n\nNT51 \u2192 't32'\nNT83 \u2192 't23'\nNT90 \u2192 't14'\nNT7 \u2192 't20'\nNT98 \u2192 't24'\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce \"t5\". But looking back earlier, in NT25 \u2192 NT5, and other NT rules. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to trace back where \"t5\" could come from. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the NT production rules, I see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT5\n\nWait, so NT25 can produce NT5. But where is NT5 defined? In the rules, is NT5 defined as anything else? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any rule for NT5. All other NT's either produce other NTs or terminals. So NT5 is undefined. Hmm, that's a problem. So NT25 \u2192 NT5 implies that NT5 must be a non-terminal, but it's not defined, which means that NT25 can't produce a terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake in looking for \"t5\".\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me list all the NTs:\n\nNTs are:\nNT7, NT98, NT37, NT26, NT48, NT18, NT74, NT35, NT86, NT95, NT81, NT86, NT31, NT60, NT82, NT95, NT55, NT26, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT82 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because in the production rules, I see NT25 \u2192 NT5. So NT25 can produce NT5, but no rule for NT5, meaning it's a stranded non-terminal, so NT25 can't produce a terminal. So in this case, how could \"t5\" appear in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps in a different production chain. Maybe \"t5\" is not directly produced by any of the terminal rules but appears indirectly, but given that Chomsky normal form has all productions with two non-terminals or terminals, maybe \"t5\" could be part of a longer string.\n\nWait, but the string we have is \"t5\". The grammar doesn't have any production where a terminal is \"t5\". So is there a way to get \"t5\" from the start symbol S? Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo S produces two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT90 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT18\n\nAnd NT90 is produced by: Looking through the rules, I don't see NT90 \u2192 anything; let me check.\n\nIn the production list, looking for NT90: Yes, one of the rules is NT90 \u2192 't14'. Oh, okay! So NT90 produces 't14', a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let me track all the steps.\n\nSo starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT90 \u2192 't14'\n\nNow, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT18\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo the string so far would be: [NT95 derivation] 't14' \n\nLet me expand NT95:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT18\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 which is undefined, as earlier\n\nWait, but NT25 is defined as NT25 \u2192 NT5. Since NT5 isn't a terminal or defined, that path can't contribute. So if I take NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT18, and NT25 can't produce anything except NT5, which isn't defined, this path would lead to an undefined non-terminal, meaning that NT95 can't directly produce a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another path. Wait, but looking back, is there a rule where NT95 produces 't0'? Yes! There is a line: NT95 \u2192 't0'\n\nAh, so NT95 can directly produce 't0' as a terminal. So let me retrace that path:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT90 \u2192 't14'\n\nBut if we choose NT95 to produce 't0' instead of further breakdown, then NT81 produces 't0' and 't10'?\n\nWait, no, wait. NT95 can produce either 't0' or NT25 NT18. Similarly, NT9 can produce 't10' directly. So when NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and each of those can produce either a terminal or other non-terminals.\n\nSo let's see, for the NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9:\n\nOption 1: NT95 \u2192 't0' and NT9 \u2192 't10', so together that would produce 't0t10', making the string 't0t10', but our input is 't5', so not that.\n\nOption 2: If we proceed to expand further, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT18, and NT25 \u2192 NT5 (undefined), so this path can't produce anything useful because NT25 can't produce a terminal.\n\nTherefore, NT81 can either produce 't0t10' or enter into a path that can't produce a terminal. So if we take the first option, the string would be longer than 't5'.\n\nNow, looking at NT90: NT90 \u2192 't14', so the full string from S would be [something] followed by 't14'.\n\nSo, the possible expanded string from S would be a sequence where the first part could be 't0t10', 't32', etc., depending on the NTs chosen. But the key point is that 't5' must be part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe at a different part of the production. Let me think if I missed any NT rule that can produce 't5'. I don't see any NT directly producing 't5' in the production rules. So it seems that 't5' isn't produced anywhere, making it impossible for the string \"t5\" to be generated by this grammar.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, the productions for NT9 aren't directly given, but let's see: does any rule have NT9 on the left side?\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT9 appears nowhere on the left side except perhaps in the terminal parts, but no.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If NT9 is not on the left side of any production, how can it be derived? That would mean NT9 is a terminal itself, but according to the grammar, all non-terminals must be on the left side.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I don't see any rule where NT9 is on the left side except possibly where it's part of another production.\n\nWait, is there any production where NT9 is a non-terminal on the left? Let's check:\n\nThe given rules start with S -> ... and then other NT rules.\n\nI don't see a production for NT9, which means that NT9 is perhaps a terminal. But that's not usual in Chomsky Normal Form. Normally, all non-terminals have productions, but if NT9 is a terminal, that changes things.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. But in standard C.N.F., all non-terminals must have exactly two non-terminals on the right. Terminals are on the left. Wait, no: Chomsky Normal Form requires that every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. But in this problem, all the productions given start with a non-terminal on the left and produce two non-terminals on the right. So, that's standard for CNF for grammars that produce only non-terminals, but if any non-terminal is allowed to produce a terminal, then that would be a mix of CNF and other productions.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. All are A->BC, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals. But then, the grammar doesn't have any terminals except those that are part of the productions, like NT77 -> 't34'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals like NT77 produce 't34'\u2014no, actually, in the problem statement, for NT77-> 't34' is it? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't0'\nWait no, in the 'grammar' list, I see NT31 -> 't35' etc. Wait, but those seem to be the productions. Wait, let's parse the grammar provided in the problem statement:\n\nThe grammar has lines like:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n...\nNT67 -> 't15'\n...\nNT77 -> 't34'\n...\nand some others like NT55 -> 't31', etc.\n\nWait, this suggests that some non-terminals, like NT67, produce a terminal like 't15', and so on.\n\nSo, the grammar includes both A->BC (non-terminals) and A->a (terminals). So, that's correct for Chomsky Normal Form when including unit productions (A->a) as well as binary productions. So, it's indeed in CNF, with some non-terminals producing terminals.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I can proceed.\n\nNow, back to the string \"t16 t10\".

{"custom_id":"request-13","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the string \"t29 t6\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, first, I should probably look at the grammar rules provided because they define the possible productions from non-terminals to terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLet me see the grammar structure. The top-level rule is S -> NT81 NT90, which means any string generated by this grammar must start with whatever NT81 produces and be followed by whatever NT90 produces. So the string we're looking at is \"t29 t6\", which is two tokens separated by a space. So each of these must be the result of the productions for NT81 and NT90 respectively.\n\nFirst, let me check NT81. Looking through the grammar, NT81 can produce several options. Wait, in the given grammar, does NT81 have a production that results in 't29'? Let me scan through.\n\nLooking at NT81, the production is NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So NT81 is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded into two other non-terminals: NT95 and NT9. Now, each of these has to be expanded into the appropriate terminals.\n\nNT95: Let me see the productions. NT95 appears multiple times, but looking at the options, NT95 -> NT25 NT60 and NT95 -> 't13'. Wait, so NT95 can produce 't13' as a terminal. So for NT95, there's an option where it becomes a terminal, which is 't13'. Similarly, NT9: Looking through the productions, NT9 appears as NT9 -> 't10'. So if NT95 can produce 't13' and NT9 can produce 't10', then NT81 (which is NT95 NT9) can produce 't13' 't10', which would be the string \"t13 t10\". But our target is \"t29 t6\", which is different. Hmm, so that suggests that maybe our initial assumption is wrong or we need another path.\n\nWait, what if there's another production path for NT81. Let me check again. The grammar for NT81 is only NT81 -> NT95 NT9. There's no other way to proceed from NT81; it's always NT95 NT9. So NT95 must produce 't13' to get 't13' 't10', but that's not matching our target.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake. Let me look again. Oh, wait, no\u2014looking at NT81: it's only one production: NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So I can't choose another path for NT81.\n\nBut our string starts with 't29', which suggests that maybe NT81 needs to produce a 't29', but I don't see any production for NT81 that results in 't29'. The only way NT81 can produce a terminal is through NT95 and NT9, which we've seen lead to 't13' and 't10', respectively. So how can NT81 produce a 't29'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me double-check the grammar. Oh! I notice that in some places, there are entries like NT55 -> NT67 NT37 and so on, but looking for 't29' in the terminals. Let's scan the entire grammar for any rule that produces 't29'.\n\nLooking through: NT95 has various options, including 't13', 't10'. NT18 -> 't20', 't26'. NT35 has 't35', which might not help. NT77 -> 't34'. NT43 -> 't20', 't1'. NT25 -> 't15', 't5'. NT86 -> 't32', 't25', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any production directly for 't29'. Unless, perhaps, I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me look again. Oh! In the grammar, I see NT48 -> NT69 NT74 and so on. Wait, could any combination of non-terminals produce 't29'? Or perhaps I've missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the string is \"t29 t6\" can't be generated because NT81's production leads to 't13' and 't10', not 't29' and something else.\n\nWait, but perhaps I've made a mistake in looking for 't29'. Let me go through all the non-terminals and their productions to see if any can produce 't29'.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nNT81: Only produces NT95 NT9. So no.\n\nNT95: produces 't13' or other combinations, not 't29'. So no.\n\nWait, maybe looking at other non-terminals. Let's see NT26: NT26 -> NT43 NT88, among others. NT43 is 't35', 't20', etc. Wait, I don't see 't29' in the terminals of any rules. So perhaps 't29' cannot be generated by this grammar, making the entire string \"t29 t6\" ungrammatical.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Let me check again. Did I miss any rule?\n\nLooking again, in the NT48 production, there's a rule: NT48 -> NT69 NT74, but I don't see 't29' there. Similarly, NT51 -> NT48 NT22, again no 't29'.\n\nWait, maybe 't29' is part of NT24, but in the provided grammar, NT24 isn't present. Let me check. The top-level is S -> NT81 NT90, but beyond that, perhaps other non-terminals are involved.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have a lot of non-terminals, but perhaps I'm missing where 't29' comes from. Hmm, perhaps I can think of this as a tree derivation. Starting from S, which requires NT81 and NT90. So each part must produce a terminal string. So for S, the output is the concatenation of NT81's output and NT90's output.\n\nSo for \"t29 t6\", we have two tokens. So NT81 must produce \"t29\", and NT90 must produce \"t6\".\n\nLooking at NT90: in the grammar, is there a production for NT90 that can produce 't6'? Looking through, I see NT90 -> 't14', which is a single terminal. So NT90 can produce 't14' but not 't6' unless there's another production path.\n\nWait, let me check NT90's productions: Oh, the bottom of the grammar, for NT90 is \"t14\", but perhaps there are others. Wait, I don't see any other production for NT90. Wait, looking again: It says NT90 -> 't14', which is a single terminal. So NT90 can only produce 't14', which would mean the second token in our string \"t6\" can't be produced by NT90. That suggests the string is invalid, but wait, perhaps I'm wrong about that.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking at NT90. Let me scan the entire grammar for any rule that ends with 't6'.\n\nLooking again, I see NT81: 't13' and 't10', which is \"t13 t10\" if that's the output.\n\nWait, but in our string, the output is \"t29 t6\". So the first part \"t29\" must come from NT81, and the second part \"t6\" must come from NT90. But since NT90 can only produce 't14', not 't6', the entire string can't be generated. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the user provided this specific string, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the NT90 is producing something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any NT can derive 't6' through NT90. For example, in the grammar, is there a way for NT90 to produce 't6'? Let's see: NT90 -> 't14' only. So no. So NT90 cannot generate 't6'. Therefore, the entire string \"t29 t6\" cannot be derived by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form has productions that are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is important because in such a grammar, the number of symbols in the left-hand side (LHS) is at least two, except when it's a single terminal. Each production either combines two non-terminals into one or a terminal is introduced, which affects how the parsing tree can form.\n\nThe string we need to check is \"t10 t22 t20\", which is a sequence of three terminals. Given that CFGs can have left-recursive or other structures, I'll need to find a way to break down the string backwards or forwards to see if it fits the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each non-terminal on the LHS branches into two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Each of these NTs also branches further until we reach terminals like 't10', 't22', etc.\n\nLet me start by considering the string as a sequence of three terminals. So, the string is t10 followed by t22 followed by t20. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, possible ways this could parse are using a binary tree structure where each node combines two symbols. So, the three-terminals could be formed by two steps: first, combining two into one, then combining that with the third.\n\nBut wait, each production either introduces two non-terminals from one or introduces a terminal. So, perhaps we need to reconstruct a parse tree from the string.\n\nAnother approach is to look for which non-terminals can produce each terminal. Let's list the terminals and see where they come from in the grammar.\n\nFrom the given grammar, I can list all the productions where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT55 \u2192 't6' (wait, no, looking back, NT55 \u2192 't6' is under the original grammar?

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a type of context-free grammar. My task is to determine whether the string `t14 t33 t18` can be generated by this grammar. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar consists of. In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. The given grammar has a bunch of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT7, NT90, etc.) eventually resolves to either another non-terminal or a terminal (like 't1', 't2', etc.). \n\nThe string to verify is `t14 t33 t18`. Since the grammar is in CNF, each terminal in the string must be directly derived from a non-terminal in the grammar. So, I'll need to see if each 't' in the string corresponds to a path in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's three tokens: t14, t33, t18. I'll check each one to see if they exist in the grammar.\n\nStarting with 't14': scrolling through the rules, I see the production `NT90 -> t14`. So, 't14' is a terminal derived from NT90.\n\nNext, 't33': scanning through the rules, I find `NT39 -> t33`. So yes, 't33' is a terminal from NT39.\n\nThen, 't18': checking the rules, there's `NT18 -> t18` directly. So 't18' comes from NT18.\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these non-terminals (NT90, NT39, NT18) can produce their respective terminals.\n\nStarting with NT90: The rule is NT90 -> t14. But in the grammar, NT90 is defined as NT90 -> t14, which is already a terminal, so that's fine. However, wait, in the given grammar, is that correct? Let me check the rule for NT90 again. Oh, in the provided rules, I see `NT90 -> t14`, which is correct. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the rule is written as:\n\nWait, looking back, I might have misread. Let me check the grammar rules again. Here's the relevant part:\n\nNT90 -> t14\nNT39 -> t33\nNT18 -> t18\n\nYes, so NT90 directly produces t14, NT39 directly produces t33, and NT18 directly produces t18. So each of those three terminals is a direct production from their respective non-terminals, which are defined in the grammar.\n\nNow, since the string is 't14 t33 t18', I need to see how this would be generated from the start symbol S. Let's see if we can derive this string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the rule for S: S -> NT81 NT90. So, S expands into NT81 and NT90. That means the string must be generated by combining the expansions of NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo, NT81 and NT90 each need to expand into parts of the string.\n\nWait, the string is three tokens: t14, t33, t18. So, S produces NT81 NT90, which must then be expanded into the three tokens. Since each token is a terminal, that implies that NT81 and NT90 each expand to one or two terminals, but perhaps one part is split into two symbols. Let me think about the production rules.\n\nWait, S -> NT81 NT90. So, the whole string must be NT81 NT90. But the string is three tokens, so how can two non-terminals each expand into one terminal? Wait, that can't be because that would give us two terminals, but we have three. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps NT81 and NT90 are each non-terminals that expand into more than one symbol. Wait, but in our case, we have the string as three tokens, so S produces two non-terminals, which together after expansion should produce three terminals. Therefore, each of NT81 and NT90 must expand into one or two terminals such that the total is three. Alternatively, maybe one of them is a non-terminal that expands into two tokens, and the other into one.\n\nWait, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT81: In the given grammar, NT81 is defined as NT81 -> NT95 NT9. Then, NT95 -> ... Wait, according to the grammar, NT95 has a rule NT95 -> t13, right? Let me check: looking through the rules, NT95->t13 is present. So, NT95 is a terminal, and NT81 is NT95 NT9. \n\nWait, but if NT81 is NT95 NT9, and NT9 is t10, then NT81 -> t13 t10. Then, NT81 would expand into 't13 t10', which is two terminals. \n\nNow, what about NT90? NT90 is a non-terminal, and according to the rules, NT90 has a production rule as NT90 -> t14. So, NT90 is a direct terminal. Wait, no, actually, looking at the rules: yes, NT90 is t14. So, NT90 directly produces t14.\n\nSo, S -> NT81 NT90, which is NT81 (which is t13 t10) and NT90 (t14). Putting those together, S would expand into t13 t10 t14. But the string we have is t14 t33 t18. So, in this case, that would not match.\n\nWait, but in the string, the order is 't14 t33 t18'. In the expansion from NT81 NT90, we would have t13 t10 t14 in that order. But the string doesn't have t13 or t10 anywhere except in the T81 expansion.\n\nSo, maybe I made a wrong assumption about how NT81 is expanded. Let's check the production rules more carefully.\n\nLooking more closely at NT81, it's defined as NT81 -> NT95 NT9. Then, looking at NT95, the rule is NT95->t13. So, NT81 is t13 NT9, and NT9 is t10. So NT81 -> t13 t10. So S is NT81 NT90 -> t13 t10 t14. But the desired string starts with t14, so that's a problem. So in this case, if the expansion of S is t13 t10 t14, which is different from the desired t14 t33 t18.\n\nHmm, so that doesn't match. So perhaps the way to derive S is different. Maybe there's another path for NT81 that I'm missing.\n\nWait, checking NT81 again: the rule is NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So, no other production for NT81 except that one. Unless NT95 can also produce something else, but looking at the grammar, for NT95, the only rule is NT95->t13, so it's a terminal. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, S produces t13 t10 t14, which is three terminals, but in the order t13, t10, t14, whereas the string given is t14, t33, t18. That's a mismatch.\n\nSo that suggests that either the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to look at this. Wait, perhaps the NT90 is part of a longer derivation that includes more non-terminals. No, because NT90 is t14 directly. So that part must expand to 't14'.\n\nWait, are there any other non-terminals that can expand into more tokens? Let me check other rules.\n\nLooking at the other NT rules: for example, NT39 is t33, NT18 is t18, NT7 is t10, etc. Some non-terminals have multi-symbol productions, but let's see. For NT86, it's t32. Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait, let me recheck S's production: S->NT81 NT90, expanding to t13 t10 t14. So if that's the only production for S, then S can only generate this specific sequence of three terminals. But the string we have is different: 't14 t33 t18'. Therefore, the string doesn't fit into this S's expansion.\n\nUnless, perhaps, S has another production. But wait, in the given grammar, S only has 'S -> NT81 NT90', as per the provided rules. So no, that's not possible"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the initial string will be whatever NT81 and NT90 produce. The string we're evaluating is `t30 t32 t31 t3`. \n\nLooking at the production rules for NT81 and NT90:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n\nSo, starting from S, after the first step, we have NT95 and NT9, and NT25 and NT37. Let's focus on each of these.\n\nNT95's productions include:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT67\n- NT95 \u2192 NT95 't13' (this is a problem because this would create a cycle, but we'll handle that)\n- NT95 \u2192 NT0\n\nBut since our string includes t30, which is a terminal, I need to track where that comes from.

But looking at individual terminals, I can see that NT12 \u2192 't30' is one of the terminal productions. So, where does 't30' come from?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT12 is a non-terminal with production NT12 \u2192 't30'. So, wherever we have NT12, we get 't30'. Therefore, the string `t30` must come from a production rule that includes NT12.\n\nBut when does NT12 get used? Let's check NT12's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT12 \u2192 't30' is a terminal production. There are no non-terminal productions for NT12. So, NT12 can only directly produce 't30'. So, in the derivation, we must have a path where NT81 leads to NT95 and NT9, and one of these produces NT12.\n\nWait, let's track the derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nFirst, let's process NT81:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nThen, NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n\nNow, from NT95 and NT9, we need to see how they can lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions:\n\nNT95 can produce various non-terminals and terminals. One of its productions is NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT55, which leads to NT25 and NT55.\n\nWait, but our string has t30, which comes from NT12, so we need a way for NT95 or another non-terminal to produce NT12.\n\nWait, looking at NT81's path, after producing NT95 and NT9, we have to find a way for one of these to produce 't30'. Since NT12 is the only non-terminal that directly produces 't30', we need to have a production rule that leads to NT12.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT9, for example:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10' (a terminal production)\nBut also, NT12 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, is there a way for NT9 to lead to NT12? No, because NT9's only production is NT77 (I think I might have missed this). Let me check all NT9's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT99 \u2192 't31' (but wait, I don't see NT99, maybe a typo? Let's check.)\n\nWait, in the production list, I have NT95 \u2192 't13', NT90 \u2192 't14', NT82 \u2192 't23', etc. Let's see if NT9 has any non-terminal productions or only terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I only see NT9 \u2192 't10' and NT77 \u2192 't34', etc. So, NT9 can only produce 't10'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't1'.\n\nWait, that's a problem because NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT9 can only give 't10' as a terminal, but we need 't30' from NT12.\n\nSo, is there a way for NT9 to somehow lead to NT12? Or is there another path?\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production where NT9 leads to a non-terminal that further leads to NT12.\n\nLooking deeper into NT9's production: NT9 \u2192 't10'. So that's terminal, and doesn't help. Another possibility is that perhaps NT9 is part of a longer chain. For example, maybe NT95 can lead to NT9 and another path that may eventually lead to NT81, which can then lead to NT12, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but if NT95 is producing NT25 and NT55, perhaps NT25 can lead to NT12.\n\nLooking at NT25's productions:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT5 NT95?

Let me try to understand what I'm facing here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. I have a grammar, which is a set of production rules that define how to generate strings. The string I need to evaluate is \"t32 t35 t22 t1\". I need to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means all production rules are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and 'a' is a terminal symbol. So each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t32, which is a terminal symbol. So I guess I need to see if t32 can be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. Let me look through the grammar rules to see which non-terminals produce t32.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT86 \u2192 t32. So NT86 can produce t32. That's a good start because the first token in the string is t32, so NT86 must be the starting point.\n\nNow, the production for NT86 is: NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT37. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check. The original grammar has a rule: NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37, but I also see another rule for NT86: NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88. Wait, no, actually, the grammar provided lists multiple rules, some as non-terminals and others as terminals. Let me find all rules for NT86.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I find two rules for NT86:\n1. NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n2. NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88\n\nSo in this grammar, NT86 can produce either NT25 NT37 or t32 NT88. Since our string starts with t32, we need to take the second option: NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88.\n\nSo now, after producing t32, the next symbol in the string is t35. That t35 must come from the next non-terminal in the NT86 production, which is NT88.\n\nSo let's look at the rules for NT88. In the grammar, I see NT88 \u2192 NT51 NT74. Wait, no, that can't be right because NT88 is a non-terminal, and it's producing two non-terminals. But the next symbol in the string is t35, which is a terminal symbol. So we need to see if NT88 can produce a terminal symbol, but in the given grammar, all rules for NT88 seem to produce non-terminals, like NT88 \u2192 NT51 NT74, which are both non-terminals. That's confusing because the second token is t35, a terminal. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, I realize that in the grammar, there's another production: NT31 \u2192 t35. So perhaps NT35 is producing t35, but looking at the grammar, NT35 is defined as NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37 or NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nLet me backtrack. The string is t32 t35 t22 t1. Let's list the tokens in order: 32, 35, 22, 1.\n\nWe started with NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88. So after t32, we have NT88. Now, in the next step, NT88 must produce t35. Since NT88's production is NT88 \u2192 NT51 NT74, which are both non-terminals, that can't produce a terminal. This suggests a problem because the next symbol in the string is a terminal, but the production only gives non-terminals. So this path might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct production rules. Let me check again. Wait, looking at the grammar, perhaps there's another rule I missed. Let me scan through all the NT rules again.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Yes, under NT86, there's a rule NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88. So NT86 can produce t32 NT88, meaning that after t32, the next symbol is whatever NT88 produces.\n\nSo after t32, we're left with NT88, which needs to produce t35. But looking at the rule for NT88, it's NT88 \u2192 NT51 NT74. Both non-terminals. So NT88 can't directly produce t35 because it's only producing two non-terminals. So t35 can't be produced directly from NT88 unless there's another rule that allows it to produce a terminal, but it seems there isn't one from the initial productions.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see: maybe NT51 or NT74 can produce a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT48 NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 NT15 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (from NT7 \u2192 't1' earlier)\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n\nLooking deeper into NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83. So NT74 is two non-terminals. Similarly, NT51 is NT48 NT22, which are non-terminals. \n\nBut in the string, after t35, we have t22. Let's think about t22. Let's move forward.\n\nWait, this seems too confusing. Let me try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nWe need to generate the string t32 t35 t22 t1.\n\n1. The string starts with t32, which comes from NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT81 NT90 (from the first rule). But wait, no. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, but the string starts with t32, which is part of NT86, not NT81 or NT90. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's see. The start symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. So perhaps I need to consider S's production, not directly NT86. But wait, the string starts with t32, which comes from NT86. So how does that fit?\n\nMaybe S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and NT81 and NT90 can each produce non-terminals that eventually lead to t32, t35, etc. Let's see.\n\nBut that's getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to work backwards, starting from the string, and see if each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me list all the non-terminals that can produce each symbol.\n\nt32 comes from NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88.\n\nt35 comes from NT35 \u2192 t35. Checking the grammar, NT35 is defined as:\n\nLooking through the grammar, it's not explicitly given, but looking at the rules, perhaps NT35 is defined as:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT77 \u2192 't34', NT35 \u2192 't18', etc. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The grammar gives:\n\nNT37 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nLooking for how to get 't35', I see:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't35' is not in the rules. Hmm, maybe NT35 is produced by another rule. Alternatively, perhaps it's NT51 that produces 't23', which I don't think is relevant.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with the string: t32, t35, t22, t1.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of productions that can generate this.\n\nFirst, t32 comes from NT86 \u2192 t32 NT88.\n\nSo, S must produce something that can lead to this, but S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So perhaps NT81 and NT90 can produce the remaining symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT86 is part of a larger production. Let's try to see.\n\nWait, the initial rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So perhaps the first production is NT81 and NT90.\n\nLet me see what NT81 does: rule is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT99 (wait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar again.

Each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the terminals, which terminate the process.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of terminals: t7, t23, t10, t16, t35.

{"custom_id":"request-79","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string `t20 t5 t31 t22 t14 t29` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S. The string consists of several terminal symbols (all 't' followed by a number). My task is to see if this string can be derived from S using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string and see how it might fit into the grammar. The string is `t20 t5 t31 t22 t14 t29`, which is a sequence of six t-terms. I'll represent each t as an index, so the string is [20,5,31,22,14,29].\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So every step in the expansion will involve replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are several productions that result in 't' terms. My first thought is to see if I can find a derivation path from S to the string by chaining these 't's.\n\nLet me start by looking at how S is defined. S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S is the start and breaks down into two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. \n\nSo the string starts with t81 and t90? Wait, looking at the string, it starts with t20, not t81 or t90. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the string is `t20 t5 t31 t22 t14 t29`. But S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which would imply the string should start with t81 followed by t90, or perhaps t81 and t90 in some order, but the string starts with t20. So maybe S is not directly the root here, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, S is the start symbol and the only way to get t-terms is through the right-hand sides of the productions. So each production either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get t20, I need to find a production where a non-terminal can derive t20.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, and NT74 also has another production NT74 \u2192 't34' perhaps? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar list, there are multiple entries.

That simplifies things because the derivation process is step-by-step, matching each non-terminal with two symbols. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of production rules for non-terminals (NTs) that eventually derive into terminals ('t' followed by numbers). My task is to trace how the given string can be Derived from the starting symbol S.\n\nThe starting symbol S -> NT81 NT90. So the first step is to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, it's `t6 t32 t0 t33 t1 t33`. Since S produces two non-terminals, the string should be split into two substrings that each can be generated by NT81 and NT90, respectively.\n\nLet's think about NT90.

Let me check.\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT31 -> NT86 NT28, but NT90 is only in the production for S. So perhaps NT90 itself is a non-terminal that further produces other non-terminals. But in the given grammar, I don't see any rule for NT90 except perhaps being part of S. So perhaps I made a mistake because NT90 as a non-terminal must have its own rule, but I don't see it here. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the rules, after S, NT90 is part of the production. But in the list of rules above, I don't see any rule for NT90 except as part of S, so maybe that's a mistake. Or perhaps the actual rules are longer.

So, in the grammar, S produces NT81 and NT90. But looking at the other rules, I don't see how NT90 is further broken down. So perhaps in the given grammar, NT90 is a terminal symbol, but that seems inconsistent because it's in the production rules alongside other non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I missed the rule for NT90. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is incorrect, but I have to proceed as per the given data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't14' is from NT90, as per the last line: NT90 -> 't14'. Wait, looking back, in the rules, the last line says NT90 -> 't14'. Yes, that's correct. Because in the given rules, the last entry is NT90 -> 't14'.\n\nWait, yes! I missed that earlier. Looking back, the production rules include:\n\n- NT90 -> 't14'\n\nYes, so that means when S is split into NT81 and NT90, the 't14' comes directly from NT90. So the second part of the string is just 't14', so that works. So the first non-terminal, NT81, must derive the first part of the string: 't6 t32 t0 t33 t1 t33', which is six components, split as two, three, three? No, wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal in the derivation splits into two symbols. So starting from the top, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one until only the terminals are left.\n\nWait, the string has six symbols, which is an even number, so that's good because in CNF, the derivation must result in an even number of terminals if it starts with a single non-terminal. But in this case, the starting rule S produces two non-terminals. So when we derive from S, each step should result in more terminals, but the total number of symbols can vary.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe string is `t6 t32 t0 t33 t1 t33`. We can split it into two parts: the left side from NT81 and the right side from NT90. So NT81 should generate the left part, and NT90 should generate the right part, which is just 't14'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT90 -> 't14'. That's straightforward. So that's good because the last 't14' in the string is from NT90.\n\nNow, the left part is `t6 t32 t0 t33 t1 t33`. That's six symbols, which corresponds to NT81. So we need to see if NT81 can derive this sequence.\n\nLooking at NT81's production: NT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nSo NT81 splits into NT95 and NT9.

Let me start by looking at the grammar structure and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This simplifies the parsing process because I can apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm without much hassle.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the derivation starts with NT81 and NT90. I'll need to see if each part of the string can be derived from these.\n\nLet me write down the string components to process: t13, t33, t5, t33, t0, t23, t23. Each of these is separated by spaces, so it's a sequence of seven tokens.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down each non-terminal (NT81, NT90, etc.) into their terminals. Let me start by examining each rule for these non-terminals and see if they can directly produce the tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at NT13, I see a production rule: NT13 \u2192 NT28 NT54 (which isn't listed, but maybe I missed it... Wait, no, the given grammar only lists up to certain points. Wait, actually, the rules seem to go into specifics, so perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nMaybe I should construct the parse tree step by step. Starting from S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, we need to derive NT81 and NT90 such that their combination forms the string.\n\nLet's look at NT81. The rules include NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 and NT95 \u2192 various options. Wait, actually, NT81 is used in the string as t13, which is a terminal. So I need to find a path from NT81 to t13.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then, NT95 could be split further. NT95's rules include NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 NT51 NT37. Hmm, let's see if any of these can lead to t13.\n\nWait, the string has t13 before t33, which is later. Let me try to map each part.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to build a mapping from each non-terminal to possible terminals. For example, NT13 \u2192 t15, t18, t15, t0, t13, t0, etc. Wait, looking at the rules, for NT13: the production is NT13 \u2192 NT28 NT54 (which isn't listed, maybe I missed some production for NT13? Or perhaps the string's t13 comes from NT13. Wait, the given rules for NT13: Let me check again. The rules list NT13 \u2192 NT28 NT54, which might be a typo because the provided grammar doesn't have that. Alternatively, in the given rules, NT13 is perhaps derived from another step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their direct productions to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 't3' ... Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, some rules have the right-hand side as two non-terminals, others have terminals. For example, some rules are written as NT82 \u2192 't3', which is just a terminal. But in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal, so that makes sense.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some rules might be productions to terminals, which would be a leaf node in the parse tree. Let's list out each non-terminal and see their direct terminal productions.\n\nLet me go through the list and note which non-terminals can directly produce a terminal.\n\n- NT1: Looking at the rules for NT1. Let's see: The provided rules don't directly show NT1, but perhaps I can derive it. Or maybe NT1 doesn't produce any terminals. Hmm, perhaps I should look more carefully.\n\nWait, let me scan the rules again to find direct terminal productions.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't3' (so NT82 produces t3)\n- NT86 \u2192 't32' (so NT86 produces t32)\n- NT95 \u2192 't13' (so NT95 produces t13)\n- NT39 \u2192 't33' (so NT39 produces t33)\n- NT55 \u2192 't6' (so NT55 produces t6)\n- NT51 \u2192 't32' (so NT51 produces t32)\n- NT25 \u2192 't5' (so NT25 produces t5)\n- NT28 \u2192 't34' (so NT28 produces t34)\n- NT57 \u2192 (Wait, not listed here, but perhaps I'm missing some.)\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLet me go through each rule:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-107","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make things a bit easier because each step in the derivation increases the length by one.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of non-terminals like S, NT98, NT37, and so on, and terminals like t1, t16, etc. The string I need to check is \"t16 t34 t23 t15 t0 t10 t5\". So the string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S following the rules.\n\nFirst, I should start by analyzing the structure of the grammar. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So to get a string starting from S, we'll have to see how NT81 and NT90 can each derive some string of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT81: the production is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Since both are non-terminals, we'll need to expand each of these. NT9 is a direct terminal, so that's easy\u2014it becomes 't10', as per the rules. But NT95 can be expanded in a few ways. Let me look up NT95's productions.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, NT55, or NT0. Wait, checking the given rules, I see NT95 has two productions: one is NT25 NT60, another is NT55, and also another rule 'NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT35'\u2014no, wait, looking back, the user input for the grammar seems extensive. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT35\n\nWait, but there's also NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, NT31 NT83, etc.?

Then each NT is followed by arrows and productions.\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\nNT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\nNT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\nNT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\nNT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\nNT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\nNT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT35\n\nWait, perhaps looking for how each NT can derive a terminal or eventually reach terminals.\n\nWait, but the string I have is \"t16 t34 t23 t15 t0 t10 t5\". Let me think about the structure of the grammar. S starts with NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo let's take the derivation from S.\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nNow, each of NT81 and NT90 needs to produce a string that, when combined, makes the entire string. Since S \u2192 NT81 NT90, the string will be the concatenation of the strings produced by NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, but this is a context-free grammar, so the productions are applied recursively. So the derivation path will go through these NTs, expanding each until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me consider NT81 first.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nSo NT81 is NT95 followed by NT9. NT9 is a terminal 't10'. But NT95 is a non-terminal, so we have to expand it.\n\nNT95 has two options:\n\n1. NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n2. NT95 \u2192 NT55 (since in the user's grammar, I see \"NT95 -> NT55\" only once? Wait, looking back, the initial grammar provided:\n\nWait, as given, for NT95, the first line after S is \"NT95 -> NT25 NT60\" and then later \"NT55 -> NT67 NT35\". But for NT95, I see \"NT95 -> NT25 NT60\" and no other rules for NT95 except for another line: \"NT0 ->...\", perhaps. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT35\nAnd others.\n\nWait, it seems that NT95 is defined as:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n\nand\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nAdditionally, from above, is there another production for NT95? I don't think so. Let me count all lines:\n\nLooking at the beginning:\n\n- S is defined.\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT35\n- Then, the rest are more NTs: NT25, NT86, etc., but probably not relevant for the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread; maybe the grammar continues with more lines beyond what I listed. Anyway, focusing on NT95, which has two production rules:\n\n1. NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n2. NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nSo when expanding NT95, the choice is between producing NT37 and NT18 or NT25 and NT60.\n\nIn the string, the first term is 't16'. Let's see where 't16' appears.\n\nLooking for 't16', I see the productions that derive terminals:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t16\nNT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, etc., but NT20 directly maps to t16. So in NT20, the expansion is 't16'.\n\nNow, looking at the string: 't16 t34 t23 t15 t0 t10 t5'.\n\nIf the first part comes from NT20, that gives 't16'. So let me see if in the NT hierarchy, somewhere we can get NT20, which directly gives 't16'.\n\nWhere does NT20 appear? Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT20 appears in several productions:\n\n- NT20 appears as NT20 \u2192 t16? Wait, no:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't16' is directly a production. So NT20 is a terminal 't16'.\n\nSo how is NT20 derived? Since it's a terminal, no further expansion is needed; NT20 is 't16'.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built by using NT20 as part of it. Let's backtrack.\n\nThe string starts with t16, which could come from NT20.

The goal is to break down the string into these rules.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. I'll list them out: t5, t15, t16, t1, t35, t5, t16, t23.

For example, S is produced by NT81 and NT90. So S can be thought of as consisting of the two non-terminals from these.\n\nTo parse the string, I can use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, where we start from the top and see if we can reduce the string step by step.\n\nLet's write the string as positions 1 to 8:\n\n1. t5\n2. t15\n3. t16\n4. t1\n5. t35\n6. t5\n7. t16\n8. t23\n\nThe top-level non-terminal is S, which is derived from NT81 and NT90.\n\nFirst, S -> NT81 NT90. So the start is NT81 followed by NT90.\n\nI'll check each part. So the first two symbols of the string must be covered by NT81, and the next two by NT90? Or wait, no. In the CYK approach, each production can split the string into two parts, each covered by the left and right non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of possible splits for each rule.\n\nFor instance, for each position, check if a production rule can produce the substring from that position onward, starting with the leftmost symbol of the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to start with the first token, which is t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which rules produce t5 as the first symbol. The non-terminal 't5' can only be reached if a production has t5 on the left. Wait, no. Looking through the grammar, most of the rules are of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except the terminals where, for example, NT7 -> 't1', etc.\n\nSo the terminals are the leaf nodes. So t5 is produced by some NT.\n\nWait, let's check which non-terminals produce 't5' as their first symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT25 -> 't15', which is position 3 in the string. Wait no, the grammar includes 't5' directly. Let me scan:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT5 -> Not sure if there's a rule, but looking through the given rules, I only see things like NT26 -> NT43 NT88, etc. Wait, is there a rule that ends with 't5'? Let me check. Yes, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT28 -> 't34'\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n\nAh, there's NT60 -> 't5'. So t5 is produced by NT60. So the first occurrence of t5 would be production of NT60.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, the first token is t5, which is production of NT60.\n\nSo t5 comes from NT60. So in the parse tree, the root S has NT81 and NT90. Let's see if one of them can produce t5.\n\nWait, no. The root production is S -> NT81 NT90. So S is the root, and the left part is NT81, the right is NT90.\n\nSo to get the first token t5, which comes from NT60, that would have to be from the right side of the production, but the left side is NT81. Wait, maybe I confused left and right.\n\nWait, the production is S -> NT81 NT90. So when processing the string, the leftmost symbols would have to be derived from NT81, and the right from NT90.\n\nBut the string starts with t5, which is derived from NT60. So to get that, perhaps NT81 must produce NT60, and then the next symbol(s) must come from NT90.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should build a dependency tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can step through the string and see if each part comes from the correct non-terminals.\n\nLet me write the string as a list:\n\nt5, t15, t16, t1, t35, t5, t16, t23\n\nLooking at each token and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\n- t5: produced by NT60\n- t15: produced by NT26\n- t16: produced by NT98\n- t1: produced by NT7\n- t35: produced by NT31 or NT39\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT26 -> 't15'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, some of the terminals are assigned by the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT5 -> 't6' (Wait, no, 't16' is in the string. Oh, wait, looking again:\n\nWait, let's list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT7: 't1'\n- NT20: 't16'\n- NT98: 't31'\n- NT86: 't32'\n- NT39: 't33'\n- NT88: 't7'\n- NT9: 't10'\n- NT82: 't6' (Wait, no, the rule says NT82-> 't6'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT69 -> 't34'\n- NT51 -> 't32'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT26 -> 't15'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT95 -> 't0'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n\nWait, so for example, NT82 can produce 't6'.\n\nSo the string has:\n\n1. t5: NT60\n2. t15: NT26 or possibly another NT like NT74, but let's check.\n\nWait, t15 is produced by NT26, because NT26->'t15'. So token 2 is produced by NT26.\n\nThird token is t16, which is produced by NT98.\n\nFourth token is t1, which is produced by NT7.\n\nFifth token is t35, which is the first symbol of NT31. So, which non-terminal produces 't35'? Looking at the rules, I see NT31-> t35.\n\nWait, NT31's rule is: NT31 -> 't35'. So the fifth token 't35' comes from NT31.\n\nSixth token is t5, which comes from NT60.\n\nSeventh token is t16, which comes from NT98.\n\nEighth token is t23, which comes from NT48 (because in the rules, NT48->'t23').\n\nSo breaking down the string's tokens into their producing NTs:\n\n- t5: NT60\n- t15: NT26\n- t16: NT98\n- t1: NT7\n- t35: NT31\n- t5: NT60\n- t16: NT98\n- t23: NT48\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each production splits two NTs"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-124","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a series of productions. Each non-terminal symbol on the left side of the arrow (e.g., S) expands into two other non-terminal symbols. Some of these non-terminals expand directly into terminals, like 'tX' or other symbols like NT followed by a number. For example, I see productions like NT86 -> 't32', which means whenever NT86 is on the left, it produces the terminal 't32'.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t30 t10 t35 t0 t3 t24 t24 t23`. So this string is a sequence of terminals. I need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the standard approach to parse a string in such a grammar is to use a recursive descent parser, especially since it's in CNF. Alternatively, I can approach this by trying to find a derivation that matches the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminals. Let's list them in order: t30, t10, t35, t0, t3, t24, t24, t23.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, each step in the derivation will expand non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me try to work backwards from the string. Each step in the parse tree should match the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see how the non-terminals could expand into it. The last symbol is 't23', which I think is a terminal. So let's check which non-terminals can produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT23 is not a production. But looking for all NTs that produce 't23', I see in the grammar:\n\n- NT35 -> t15? Wait, let me check each one. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT77 -> 't34', NT83 -> 't23', NT23 is not present. Wait, looking through the list:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'?\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me look at each terminal production:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT74 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT97 (no, in the provided grammar, NT77 -> 't34'\nHmm, looking at the list:\n\n- NT83 -> 't23' (is that present)? Checking the list: yes, the line \"NT83 -> t23\" is there (wait, no, in the list provided, the line \"NT83 -> 't23'\" is not there. Wait, looking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't23', I see:\n\n- NT95 -> 't23' (yes, one of them is line: \"NT95 -> t23\")\n- NT23 is a non-terminal, but it's not an end production, because no production ends with NT23 except perhaps in S.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, 't23' can be produced by NT95.\n\nSo, the last symbol is 't23', which comes from NT95. Then, before that, we have another 't24'. So, the last part of the string is 't24 t23', which must come from a non-terminal that expands into 't24' and 't23'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminal produces 't24'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n\nSo, the production for NT60 is 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, the next symbol before 't23' is 't24', which could come from NT60.\n\nSo, the last part of the string, 't24 t23', is generated by NT60 -> t24, followed by NT60's production ending in t23? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, each step in the grammar only allows two symbols to be generated. Wait, no: the string is a sequence of terminals, so each step must match a production that expands a non-terminal into two terminals, but wait, no\u2014Non-terminals can only expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, 't24' must be the expansion of a non-terminal that has 't24' in its left-hand side. Wait, actually, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if I have 't24 t23' as the last two symbols, that would come from a non-terminal NT that expands into two non-terminals, which in turn expand into 't24' and 't23', respectively. Or, perhaps a production that ends with two terminals.\n\nWait, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.\n\nSince S is the start symbol, maybe I can build the derivation tree bottom-up, starting from the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to represent the string as a sequence of steps from S to these terminals.\n\nLet me list the string again: t30, t10, t35, t0, t3, t24, t24, t23.\n\nThis is 8 symbols, so the derivation must start with S, and each production expanding into two symbols (either more non-terminals or terminals).\n\nSo, let's model the string as an 8-term list, and see which non-terminals could generate these sequences.\n\nStarting from the end, the last two symbols are t24 and t23. So, perhaps the penultimate step is a non-terminal that expands into t24 and t23. Wait, but in the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal produces t24 and t23 directly. Instead, I need to have a non-terminal that can produce a sequence of t24 followed by t23. Alternatively, the non-terminal could produce t24 and another non-terminal, which then produces t23. So, let me see.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that expand into t24 on the left. Wait, 't24' is a terminal, so the only non-terminal that directly produces t24 is NT60. So, if we have a non-terminal that expands into NT60 and another that expands into NT95 (since NT95 -> t23). So, perhaps there's a production like A -> NT60 NT95, and NT60 produces t24, and NT95 produces t23. So then, the two symbols 't24 t23' are generated by NT60 and NT95, which are part of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT60 has the production NT60 -> 't24'. So, NT60 can produce 't24'. Also, looking for productions where a non-terminal could produce 't24' and another non-terminal that leads to 't23'. Alternatively, perhaps a non-terminal that produces a t24 and another non-terminal which produces 't23' is needed.\n\nBut I think a better approach is to parse the string step by step, starting from the left.\n\nLet me try to find the leftmost non-terminal that can produce the first symbol, which is 't30'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT86 -> t32, and NT31 -> t35, etc., but who produces 't30'? Looking through the list, I see NT39 -> 't33', NT88 -> 't7', etc., but I don't see anyone producing 't30' directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let's list all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is either prefixed by 't' and a number, like 't30', 't10', etc.\n\nSo, let me check each production to see which non-terminals produce 't30'.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see the productions where a non-terminal is followed by 't' and a number.

{"custom_id":"request-145","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t31 t30 t15 t32 t33 t29 t22 t14 t3` is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it looks like all non-terminals on the left have productions that either go to two other non-terminals or directly to a terminal. So, the productions are set up correctly for CNF.\n\nThe start symbol looks to be S, as it's the only symbol on the left without any further productions. The string I'm given seems to be a sequence of terminal symbols: t31, t30, t15, t32, t33, t29, t22, t14, t3. Wait, actually, wait\u2014that's 9 tokens. But in the grammar, looking at the productions, the starting symbol S is NT81 NT90, so the string should start with t31 (from NT81) and t16 (from NT90), right? Let me check the grammar.\n\nYes, the S is NT81 NT90. So the string starts with t31 (from NT81) and t16. But the given string is `t31 t30 t15 t32 t33 t29 t22 t14 t3`. Wait, but S should expand to NT81 NT90, so the first token is t31, which is correct for NT81 (since NT81 -> 't31'), and then the next token should be t16, but the string has t30 as the second token. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of all the terminals generated by the entire derivation. So, let me parse the string correctly. The string is: t31, t30, t15, t32, t33, t29, t22, t14, t3. So, nine tokens. The start is S -> NT81 NT90, so the string starts with NT81 and NT90. NT81 should produce 't31', and NT90 should produce 't16'. But the string starts with t31, which is correct, but the second token should be t16, not t30. However, in the string, the second token is t30, which doesn't match. Hmm, that suggests the string might not be correct. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check: S -> NT81 NT90, so the first two symbols should be t31 and t16. But the string starts with t31, then t30. That means the second symbol is wrong, implying the string is not generated by this grammar. But let me think again\u2014maybe the string is a sequence of all the terminals, so the entire string would be a combination of all productions. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by trying to build the string from the start symbol, following the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step to see if the given string can be derived.\n\nSo, the approach would be to use the grammar to see if the given string can be built. Since all the non-terminals eventually produce a terminal, this is about the right derivation.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Each production leads to a terminal when it's a terminal production. So, let's see:\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, all generated by non-terminals. The structure of the grammar is such that each non-terminal on the right-hand side either leads to two more non-terminals or eventually to a terminal. So, each non-terminal can be thought of as a node in a parse tree, and the string corresponds to the leaves.\n\nSo, to see if the string is entirely generated, we can try to parse it. Let me list the tokens in order: [t31, t30, t15, t32, t33, t29, t22, t14, t3]\n\nWait, that's nine tokens. Let me check if each terminal in the string is correctly produced by the corresponding non-terminals.\n\nFirst, breaking down the string:\n\n- The first part would be the expansion of S, which is NT81 NT90. So, the first two terminals should be t31 and t16, but the string starts with t31 then t30, which is a problem.\n\nHmm, that's a red flag. Perhaps the string isn't possible because NT90 doesn't produce t30. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT90 is only used in S (S -> NT81 NT90), and I don't see any other production for NT90 except S. Wait, let me check all productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT90 is only defined in S. Let me check if NT90 has any productions. Looking at all the rules:\n\nYes, I see NT98 -> NT7 NT39, etc., down to NT90 -> something? Wait, checking the list:\n\nLooking through, I don't immediately see NT90 being defined as a production. Wait, let me go through the grammar productions:\n\nWait, I see NT90 is only in the S production. No other NT90 on the left. So, perhaps NT90 just produces itself? Or does it have a terminal production? Wait, in the list, I don't see NT90 being further produced; it only appears once as S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean NT90 is only a part of S and doesn't have a definition. So, maybe the grammar is incomplete? Or perhaps I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, looking back at the list:\n\nAll the NT's have productions. Let me check for NT90. Scanning each line, I don't see NT90 being on the left except in S. So NT90 is only present on the right in S but doesn't have any own productions. That suggests that NT90 must be a terminal because there's no rule for it. But in that case, in the string, t16 is expected from NT90, but the string has t30 as the second token.\n\nWait, so that would mean that NT90 must produce t16, but since there's no production for NT90, that would be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and NT90 does have a production elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the list. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nSo, yeah, looking for NT90, it's only in S's production. So, that suggests that NT90 is part of the start symbol but has no own production. Therefore, in the grammar, NT90 must produce a terminal or something else. Wait, but if it's not defined, it would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT90 is a typo and should be NT7 or something else. But if it's only present once in S, perhaps it's a terminal, meaning NT90 produces t16.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand how the non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. The grammar has a bunch of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NTxx, etc.) can produce two other non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals eventually become terminals with specific values, like 't1', 't2', up to 't39' or something. \n\nThe string I'm given has a sequence of 't's, each with a number, and I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar. Let's list the string out:\n\nt16 t23 t15 t33 t23 t22 t22 t1 t30.\n\nSince this is a concatenation of terminals, the grammar must have a derivation where each non-terminal expands step by step until all symbols are replaced by terminals, forming this exact sequence.\n\nI think the best approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can generate this string. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, expands into NT81 NT90. So, S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, each NT is a non-terminal that can produce other non-terminals. Let's look at NT81 and NT90 individually.\n\nNT81 expands into NT95 NT9. NT9 is a terminal, which from the list is 't10'. Wait, the production for NT9 is 't10'. But in the string, I see 't1' and 't15', not 't10'. Hmm, maybe I need to check NT9's production again. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'. So, yes, NT9 is 't10'. But in the string, I don't see 't10'. The string has t16, t23, t15, t33, t23, t22, t22, t1, t30. Wait, the last symbol is t1. So is there an NT that produces 't1'?\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't1'. NT7 is a non-terminal. Also, NT28 \u2192 't34', NT60 \u2192 't5', etc. But I don't see any NT that gives 't1' except NT7, which is supposed to be 't1' from NT7 \u2192 't1'. Wait, no, looking again: No, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, sorry, looking again at the grammar:\n\nIn the rules:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, so NT7 can become 't1', but I need to start tracing from S.\n\nWait, so starting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first part is NT81, which is NT95 NT9. NT9 is 't10', as per the rule NT9 \u2192 't10'. So the first part would be NT95 followed by 't10'.\n\nNow, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So the first symbol in the string would be whatever NT95 produces. Looking at the rules for NT95:\n\nI see NT95 has two rules: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 't0'. So NT95 can be either two non-terminals or 't0'. So in this case, when deriving S, which is NT81 NT90, each of these non-terminals can be NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, which is NT95 followed by 't10', and NT90 is a non-terminal in the start rule. Wait, no, the start rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so both NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nWait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. The string is \"t16 t23 t15 t33 t23 t22 t22 t1 t30\". So the string has nine tokens. Since each production in the grammar is a binomial expansion (each non-terminal produces two non-terminals), the overall structure must be such that each step of the derivation doubles the number of symbols, but since we can have terminals, it can vary.\n\nWait, but for a context-free grammar, the number of symbols in the derived string can vary, but perhaps it's easier to check if the sequence can be generated by ensuring each step is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be connected by the grammar rules.\n\nWait, another approach is to model this as a parse tree where the root is S, and each node is a non-terminal that expands into two children (each a non-terminal or terminal). The leaves would then be the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me attempt to construct a possible parse tree:\n\nThe string has 9 terminals: t16, t23, t15, t33, t23, t22, t22, t1, t30.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is NT81 NT90. So each of these must expand into something that can produce the string.\n\nLet's consider NT90. Looking at the grammar, NT90 has the production NT90 \u2192 't14'. So NT90 directly produces 't14'. So in the string, t14 is the last symbol, so the last part of the parse tree must be NT90 \u2192 't14'.\n\nSo, the string is ... t22 t22 t1 t30.\n\nWait, but let's see: S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so after expanding, the string would have to be NT81's expansion followed by NT90's expansion. So since NT90 is 't14', that final token in the string is 't14', which matches.\n\nSo, before that, in NT81, which is the first part, we have NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT9 is 't10', as before. So the second to last symbol is 't14', which comes from NT90. But before that, we have in the string: t30 is before the last t14, but wait, the full string is:\n\n\"t16 t23 t15 t33 t23 t22 t22 t1 t30\"\n\nWait, actually, I'm confused here. Let me count the symbols:\n\n1: t16\n\n2: t23\n\n3: t15\n\n4: t33\n\n5: t23\n\n6: t22\n\n7: t22\n\n8: t1\n\n9: t30\n\nWait, no, the string is 't16 t23 t15 t33 t23 t22 t22 t1 t30'. So it's nine tokens, with t30 being the last one.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the expansion is NT81 followed by NT90. NT90 \u2192 't14', so the last symbol in the string must be 't14', but the string has 't30' as the last symbol. That's a contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible for S to produce a string ending with 't30' because NT90 only produces 't14'. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the start symbol. S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the derived string must start with whatever NT81 produces and end with NT90 \u2192 't14'. So any string ending with anything other than 't14' cannot be produced by S, which is the start symbol. Therefore, since the given string ends with 't30', it's impossible, so the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT90 can expand into something else, but looking at the grammar, NT90 only has one production: NT90 \u2192 't14'. So no, there's no other way. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Okay, first, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided is a bit extensive, so I'll need to parse it carefully. The grammar consists of several non-terminal symbols like S, NT7, NT81, etc., leading to terminals such as 't30', 't16', and so on. The string to evaluate is `t30 t16 t10 t18 t10 t7 t16 t14 t15 t35`.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the grammar to see how the non-terminals expand into terminals. Starting from the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. That means S generates two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. So, to get the string, these two must be expanded into sequences of terminals with some order.\n\nLooking at the string, it's split into 10 tokens, which suggests that the derivation will involve these non-terminals expanding into these tokens in a specific order. Now, I need to see if the sequence of non-terminals from S can lead to this string.\n\nLet me list the productions again for relevant non-terminals:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55\n- NT15 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT82 \u2192 't3' (from the string)\n- NT9 \u2192 't10' (from the string)\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Let's see:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55\nNT15 \u2192 NT86 NT28\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\nNT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55\nNT15 \u2192 NT86 NT28\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\n\nPutting that together: NT81 expands to NT95 NT9, which then becomes NT25 NT60 NT9. NT25 becomes NT15 NT55, which then becomes NT86 NT28 NT55. NT86 becomes NT25 NT37, which then becomes NT15 NT55 NT37. NT15 becomes NT86 NT28 again, which becomes NT25 NT37 NT28. NT25 becomes NT15 NT55 again, which becomes NT86 NT28 NT55. NT86 again becomes NT25 NT37, which then becomes NT15 NT55 NT37. Now, NT15 \u2192 NT86 NT28 again, which goes into NT25 NT37 NT28, and NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55 \u2192 NT86 NT28 NT55.\n\nBut wait, I'm trying to see if this can generate 't30 t16 t10...'. Looking at the string, the first token is 't30'. Let's look at which non-terminal expands into 't30'. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 't24' (from the string)\n- NT48 \u2192 't23' and 't29'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15' and 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT88, so that's 't5' followed by 't7'\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't30', which is not an immediate terminal. So, is there any non-terminal that expands to 't30'?\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice that 't30' is a terminal, but none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't30'. Let me check the list again:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1', 't20', 't1'\nNT20 \u2192 't16'\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55\nNT15 \u2192 NT86 NT28\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\n\nLooking through all the productions, 't30' is a terminal but none of the non-terminals produce it directly. That means the first token in the string, 't30', cannot be generated by any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string `t30 t16 t10 t18 t10 t7 t16 t14 t15 t35` starts with 't30', which does not appear as a terminal in any production rule of the given grammar. All terminals in the grammar are directly listed (e.g., 't1', 't3', etc.), but there is no rule that produces 't30'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-178","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t13 t10 t29 t15 t29 t18 t7 t22 t32 t35 t32`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. Since I'm just starting out, I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Here, the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT7, NT98, etc. The terminals are the ts with numbers, like t1, t10, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which goes directly to NT81 NT90. So, any valid derivation must start from S.\n\nThe given string has tokens: t13, t10, t29, t15, t29, t18, t7, t22, t32, t35, t32. Since the string is composed entirely of terminals, I need to see if there's a way to derive this string from S.\n\nEach production in the grammar either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a single terminal. Since the string is 11 tokens long, I suspect that the derivation will involve 10 productions from S, each expanding a non-terminal.\n\nI should start by mapping each terminal to its possible non-terminal sources. Let me look through the productions to see which non-terminals expand into which terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT10 \u2192 t6\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't10' (so NT9 expands to t10)\nNT7 -> 't1' (so NT7 expands to t1)\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT25 -> 't15'\nNT28 -> 't34'\nWait, but looking more carefully, I see that some non-terminals expand directly into terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 t1, NT9 \u2192 t10, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nStarting with NT7:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- Also, NT7 \u2192 t1 (from the given)\nWait, no, looking again. In the provided grammar, under NT7: \"NT7 -> NT48 NT35\" and \"NT7 -> t1\". Similarly, NT9 is \"NT9 -> 't10'\" etc.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to work backwards from the string and see if each token can be matched by a production.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first expansion is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals may need to expand. Let's consider NT81 and NT90.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT90 \u2192 NT48 NT55\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 NT95 NT9 NT48 NT55.\n\nNow, the string starts with t13, which comes from NT13 \u2192 t15? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the string is `t13 t10 t29 t15 t29 t18 t7 t22 t32 t35 t32`. So the first token is t13, which needs to come from a production. Looking back, in the grammar, NT13 \u2192 t15, but wait, that's NT13 \u2192 t15. However, our string starts with t13. Is there a NT that expands to t13?\n\nWait, going through the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce t13? Let me check each production:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t15 (so NT13 can only produce t15)\n- NT25 \u2192 t15\n- NT43 \u2192 t20\n- NT51 \u2192 t32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT35 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT77 \u2192 NT34 NT34\n- NT34 \u2192 NT67 NT27\nWait, but in our list, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the grammar properly.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\nWait, now I'm seeing that in some cases, the same production appears multiple times. For example, NT95 appears in two places:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nand\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with t13, which would come from NT95 \u2192 t13.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking at NT95's productions:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- Also, earlier, under NT95: \"NT95-> t13\". Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at the provided list, there's a line: \"NT95 -> NT25 NT60\" and another line: \"NT95 -> NT37 NT18\". Additionally, there's another line: \"NT95 -> t13\"? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nIt says:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nAlso, \"NT95 -> t0\" (from \"NT95 -> t13\", which perhaps is a typo? Or perhaps the \"t13\" is another production. Wait, but looking through the list:\n\nYes, under NT25: \"NT25 -> t15\"\n\nWait, no, wait: The user provided a long list, some lines might be repeated or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, let me check each production carefully to avoid confusion. The user provided a list in the question, and I can see that for example, under NT25:\n\n- \"NT25 -> t15\"\n\nAnother production: \"NT95 -> t13\"? Wait, looking back:\n\nYes, in the list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nSo, NT95 can also produce t13. So now, I have two possible expansions for NT95: it can go to NT25 and NT60, or to NT37 and NT18, or to t13.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t13. So the first non-terminal NT95 must produce t13, so in the first step, S \u2192 NT95 NT81 NT90 might not be correct, but wait, the initial expansion was S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Wait, no, S is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nThen, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT90 \u2192 NT48 NT55. So, S \u2192 NT95 NT9 NT48 NT55.\n\nNow, the first token in the string is t13, which comes from NT95, so the first step is to have NT95 \u2192 t13. So the string starts with t13, followed by t10, etc.\n\nSo, after S, we have:\n\nNT95 NT9 NT48 NT55.\n\nNow, since NT95 is being used to produce t13, that means NT95 must have split into t13, and the remaining NT9, NT48, NT55 need to be expanded further.\n\nBut wait, in a typical derivation, all non-terminals must expand until only terminals are left. So, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, but that's just the first expansion.

{"custom_id":"request-180","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. In CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar starts with a single start symbol and can be parsed using methods like the CYK algorithm. However, since this grammar is quite large and complex, maybe I should see if the string can be broken down using the rules provided.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t22 t7 t33 t33 t33 t23 t32 t5 t13 t33`.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so each tX is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t6. So I need to find a production that can start with t6. Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t6\nNT86 \u2192 t5\nNT95 \u2192 t13\nNT43 \u2192 t1\nNT25 \u2192 t5\nNT13 \u2192 t15\nNT60 \u2192 t24\nNT48 \u2192 t23\nNT25 \u2192 t5\nNT9 \u2192 t6\nNT43 \u2192 t1\nNT13 \u2192 t0\nNT28 \u2192 t34\nNT60 \u2192 t5\nNT48 \u2192 t29\nNT51 \u2192 t22\nNT83 \u2192 t23\nNT90 \u2192 t14\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT98 \u2192 t24\n\nWait, so t6 is produced by NT9 and also NT9. Since there are two ways, but let's proceed.\n\nThe string starts with t6. So, perhaps the first part of the derivation is using the production NT9 \u2192 t6.\n\nBut looking at the grammar structure, NT9 is a non-terminal. So how do I get t6? Maybe the start symbol is S, which is NT81 NT90. So S produces two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Let me look at the productions for NT81 and NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nSo NT81 is followed by NT95 and NT9. Let's see if these can produce the subsequent 't's.\n\nFrom NT81: NT95 \u2192 t13, t9? Wait, I need to check the productions.\n\nWait, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So to get t6, maybe that's from NT95 NT9? Let me see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nSo NT95 needs to derive to t13 because in NT95 \u2192 t13. Similarly, NT9 is t9? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, NT9: does it produce anything? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT9 is present here: NT9 \u2192 t6\n\nSo NT9 \u2192 t6. Great.\n\nSo to get t6, we can use NT9 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo maybe S \u2192 NT81 NT90 can be broken down as follows:\n\nFirst part of the string: t6 comes from NT9. So S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then NT81 leads to NT95 NT9. So we have NT95 \u2192 t13 (since NT95 \u2192 t13 is one production, looking at the grammar, NT95 has production NT95 \u2192 t13, and also NT95 \u2192 t0. But we need t13, so we pick that.\n\nWait, but wait: NT81 is NT95 NT9, so first NT95 produces t13, and then NT9 produces t6. Wait, but in the string, the first element is t6, but according to this order, it would be t13 followed by t6. But the string starts with t6, so that can't be right.\n\nHmm, that might be an issue. Maybe I need to see if there's a different production for NT81 that can lead to t6 in a different way. Let me check NT81's productions.\n\nLooking at NT81, its productions are:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nI don't see NT81 producing any terminal directly. So NT81 must be expanded further. So the 't6' would have to come from NT9, which is in NT81's production. So perhaps the first part is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and then each of those non-terminals produce their respective terminals.\n\nBut NT95 produces t13 when we have NT95 \u2192 t13, and NT9 \u2192 t6. So combining these, NT81 \u2192 t13 t6. But in the string, the first two elements are t6 t22 t7..., which doesn't match this order.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is NT81 NT90. The string has t6 as the first element. So S must expand to NT81 NT90, and then each of these must generate parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t6, which comes from NT9, so maybe S \u2192 NT81 NT90, where NT90 is another non-terminal, but NT90 might produce 't14', but let's see. Looking for t14, from NT90 \u2192 t14.\n\nWait, so if S \u2192 NT81 NT90, then NT81 needs to produce t6 followed by something else, and NT90 produces the rest.\n\nBut the string starts with t6, which is from NT9. So maybe NT81 is expanded to produce NT95 NT9, where NT95 produces t13, and NT9 \u2192 t6. That gives us t13 t6, but the string starts with t6 t22 t7..., which doesn't match. So that suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is NT81 followed by NT90. So the first part is from NT81, and the second part from NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81's productions: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT95 can produce t13, and NT9 produces t6. So that would give us t13 t6 in the string, but that doesn't match the beginning of the given string. So perhaps that path is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT81 can produce another sequence. Let me check if there are any other productions for NT81. From the grammar, NT81 is only NT95 NT9, not producing any terminal directly. So no, NT81 can't produce t6 directly.\n\nWait, so maybe S \u2192 NT81 NT90, but S can be derived into something else. Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t6, t22, t7, t33, t33, t33, t23, t32, t5, t13, t33.\n\nI need to see if each of these terminals is the result of some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nFirst, t6: looking for non-terminals that produce t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 t6\nAlso, NT9 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo NT9 can be expanded to t6.\n\nSo perhaps we can have a production NT9 \u2192 t6.\n\nBut NT9 only can be derived from NT95 in some productions. Wait, looking at the rules, NT95 has productions:\n\nNT95 \u2192 t13\nNT95 \u2192 t0\nAlso, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nWait, but to get t6, we might need NT95 to produce t13, and then NT9 to produce t6. So that would give t13 t6. But in the string, the first element is t6, not t13.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a specific way of structuring the production rules where each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually CNF is when each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals and C is a terminal. So all productions must have two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, each production seems to follow that. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90 has two non-terminals, and many others like NT7 \u2192 't1' is a terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t6 t29 t6 t10 t18 t13 t24 t20 t33 t18 t18 t15`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. That means I have to find a sequence of productions that breaks down the string into the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. According to the first production, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT81 and NT90. Let me look at the string: it starts with t6, which is a terminal. That must come from either NT81 or NT90.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT81 and NT90 have productions. Let's see:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n\nWait, but wait, in the grammar, looking at NT95's production, there's NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55. But I'm not sure if that's the path. Alternatively, NT81 has another production: NT81 \u2192 't9' in some place? No, looking at the provided grammar, I don't see a production for NT81 that ends with t9. Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT* productions:\n\nAh, here we go. In the grammar, there's NT95 \u2192 't13', NT55 \u2192 't31', NT25 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't10', etc. So for NT81, looking at the beginning of the string, it's t6. Let me check if any NT81 has an 't6' as a terminal. Wait, the production for NT81 is only NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 and NT81 \u2192 't10'. Wait no, looking at the given grammar:\n\nNo, looking again:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13' is one production, and so on.

Oh, wait, the user has a typo in the grammar? Because in their list, I can see:\n\nNT81 appears here: S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and for NT90: NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88.\n\nWait, but in the user's grammar, under NT90, it's only listed as:\n\nNT90 -> 'something'? Let me check the user's provided grammar:\n\nThe user's grammar has lines like:\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nAnd so on.

Wait, looking at the user's grammar, is there a production for NT81? It seems that in the provided rules, NT81 is only present in S's production as S \u2192 NT81 NT90, but elsewhere, I don't see NT81 having a production that ends with a terminal. For example, looking through the rules, the only places NT81 appears are in S's production, with other NT's.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan through all the NT productions again.

{"custom_id":"request-203","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is essentially a set of production rules that define the language. The goal is to determine whether the string `t7 t3 t16 t32 t7 t5 t13 t5 t32 t22 t7 t23` is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the grammar provided. Each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except when a terminal is present. From the rules, I can see that many non-terminals eventually reduce to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. So, the entire grammar seems to be a terminal string once everything is expanded.\n\nThe string to test is `t7 t3 t16 t32 t7 t5 t13 t5 t32 t22 t7 t23`. My approach will be to see if the string can be mapped back through the grammar to the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I can process it from the start, looking for possible derivations from the grammar. The string consists of 12 tokens, so if the grammar can derive this string by expanding from S, it should match.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check the initial grammar rules**: The start symbol is S. Looking at the production rules, S is only defined as S -> NT81 NT90. So, the string must start with NT81 and NT90. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part should be the expansion of NT81, and the second part the expansion of NT90.\n\n   The string starts with `t7 t3`, so the first part is \"t7 t3\". I need to see if NT81 can derive \"t7 t3\".\n\n2. **NT81 derivation**: Looking at NT81's production rules, in the given grammar, I see multiple rules for NT81. Scanning through, I notice NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So, NT81 can become NT95 followed by NT9. Let's see what NT9 becomes. From the rules, NT9 -> 't10'. So, NT81 as NT95 NT9 becomes \"t10\".\n\n   Wait, but the first token of NT81 should be \"t7\". Hmm, that's a problem because NT95 NT9 would give \"t10\" as the first token. But the string starts with \"t7\", so maybe we need another production.\n\n   Wait, perhaps there's another production for NT81. Let me check again. Looking through all NT81's rules... Oh, wait, in the initial grammar listing, I think I might have missed that NT81 also has a rule NT81 -> NT77, but checking the provided rules, it doesn't seem so. Let me verify.\n\n   Wait, looking at the given grammar, the rules for NT81 are:\n   \n   NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\n   So, the first production for NT81 is NT95 NT9. So, that produces \"t10\". But the string starts with \"t7\", so that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps NT81 can be expanded differently. Alternatively, maybe I should check all possible ways to derive \"t7 t3\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the string isn't split correctly into two parts. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, the problem says the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so every production is of the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal, B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. Some non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, which eventually expand into terminals.\n\nSo, to see if the string \"t7 t3 t16 t32 t7 t5 t13 t5 t32 t22 t7 t23\" can be generated, I need to see if it's a correct leftmost (or rightmost) derivation.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, trying to find which non-terminals can generate these sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for which parts of the string can be derived by which non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: \"t7 t3\". Let's see which non-terminal can produce this.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT77 -> 't13'\n- NT7 -> 't1' but there's also NT74 -> ..., etc. Wait, but the terminal strings are as follows:\n\nFrom the rules provided, a list of NTs expands into specific 't' strings:\n\n- NT7 -> 't7'? Let me check.\n\nWait, from the provided grammar, several non-terminals expand into specific 't's with numbers:\n\nLooking through each rule where a non-terminal leads directly to a terminal:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT82 -> 't3'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT60 -> 't98'? Wait, no, let's check:\n\nThe provided rules are detailed. Let me go through each:\n\nNT7 -> 't1' (multiple instances)\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT95 -> 't0', 't13', 't23'? Wait, looking at the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT7 is defined as -> 't1'.\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26.

Since the grammar is CNF, each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two others. The parsing algorithm works by dividing the string into chunks, each of which can be generated by starting from the bottom and working up.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols in the string. There are 14 tokens: t34, t23, t13, t34, t7, t3, t23, t16, t31, t23, t7, t34, t1. So the length is 14. Since each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, the number of steps should be around log2(14) \u2248 4 steps. Wait, no, the length of the string corresponds to the number of terminals produced. Each production goes from one non-terminal to two, so the total number of terminals is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. The number of symbols used would be 2^n where n is the number of productions, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nMaybe I should list the productions that produce each terminal. For example, when does a non-terminal produce 't34'? Looking through the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 t34, and any other productions that might generate 't34'. Wait, NT77 is not in the rules, maybe I missed something. Let me check the rules provided.\n\nLooking again, the NT77 rule is written as `NT77 -> t34`, so NT77 produces 't34'. Similarly, NT43 \u2192 t20, t1, t35, etc. I need to map each terminal to the possible non-terminals that produce it.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, I should see which non-terminals can produce it:\n\n- t34 is from NT77\n- t23 is from NT18, because NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26, and NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55, etc., but looking more closely, in the rules provided, NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55, and so on. Wait, no, let me check the rules correctly.\n\nWait, the rules are a long list, so I should go through each terminal and see which NT produces it.\n\nLet me list each terminal and their possible sources:\n\n- t1: NT77 produces t1\n- t2: None in the provided rules\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I see `NT7 -> t1` and `NT77 -> t34`, etc. Maybe I should create a map from each terminal to NTs.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through the rules:\n\nFrom the list:\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT18 \u2192 nt20 nt26 (and so on), but t20 is nt20 \u2192 t16 (as per the rule NT20 \u2192 t16) but in the rules provided, NT20 \u2192 t16? Let me see the rules:\n\nWait, here are some rules:\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\nSo, NT20 produces t16. So if a production is NT20, it's replaced by 't16'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 is replaced by 't1', NT9 \u2192 t10, NT77 \u2192 t34, NT13 \u2192 t15, NT18 \u2192 t20 and t34 (because NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26 and then NT20 is 't16', NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55, etc.), but I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from the end and trace back the production steps using the given string.\n\nSo the string is t34 t23 t13 t34 t7 t3 t23 t16 t31 t23 t7 t34 t1.\n\nSince the grammar is CNF, the number of layers should correspond to the number of times each production is applied. Let's think of the string as a series of terminals that can be grouped into non-terminals, working backwards.\n\nThe entire string is 13 symbols, so the number of layers will be log2(n) where n=13, but 13 isn't a power of 2. Maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps building the parse tree would help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the recursive descent approach: check the highest level production and see if the string can be split accordingly.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, S generates two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo the first two symbols should correspond to the production of NT81 or NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81 and NT90 in the rules.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT90 is not present in the rules (wait, looking through the rules, the rules are all for NTs. Wait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nWait, the rules provided start with S \u2192 NT81 NT90, then lists NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39, etc. So NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals that produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the entire string must start with a production that generates NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: the first symbol is t34. So the first part should be generated by NT81 and the second part by NT90, or vice versa. But since the rules are ordered, perhaps it's NT81 first.\n\nSo the string starts with t34, so NT81's production must start with t34. Looking at how NT81 is used:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nSo NT81 is replaced by NT95 and NT9.\n\nThen, each of those is replaced.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 (from NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60), but looking back, wait, the rule is NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60? Or is it NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60?\n\nWait, looking back through the rules, I find:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nWait, no, the rules are a series of lines. Let me make sure:\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nYes, that's correct. So NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules list:\n\n- NT95-> NT25 NT60 (Yes, line 95->96? I might be mixing line numbers.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find all the non-terminals that can produce t34, which is NT77 \u2192 t34.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t34, which comes from NT77. So the first production should be NT77.\n\nBut wait, the start is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So for the initial split, we need to generate NT81 and NT90 from S. The first part is t34, which is produced by NT77, but NT77 isn't part of NT81 or NT90's productions. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first split is not directly producing NT81 and NT90, but perhaps each parts of NT81 and NT90 can generate their own sub-parts, which may include t34.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps working backward from the string.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt34 t23 t13 t34 t7 t3 t23 t16 t31 t23 t7 t34 t1\n\nCounting the length, it's 13 tokens, which is not a power of 2, so perhaps it's invalid because each production in CNF adds a non-terminal, so the length should be a power of 2. Wait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two non-terminals, so the number of terminals in a derivation sequence increases by a factor of 2 each time. But the start symbol S produces two, which can each produce two, so the number of leaves (terminals) would be 2^n, where n is the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-224","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex, with multiple non-terminal symbols (NT) each expanding into two other non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t20 t13 t35 t31 t10 t1 t24 t34 t0 t0 t32 t35 t33`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, except for a few that seem to have more than two, but upon closer inspection, actually, they all are either two non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT82 can produce 't3' or 't6' or others, but wait, no, I think each production is only two parts. Wait, the grammar lines have NT18 -> NT20 NT26, which are two non-terminals, and some like NT77 -> NT34 NT34, which is two non-terminals, and some like NT79 -> NT25 NT something. So all productions are in CNF except that some non-terminals might produce multiple options.\n\nNow, the string to analyze is `t20 t13 t35 t31 t10 t1 t24 t34 t0 t0 t32 t35 t33`. So there are 13 t-terms separated by spaces. I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to construct a parse tree from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived. The start symbol is S, which as per the first production is NT81 NT90. So S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Each of these NTs can expand further.\n\nI need to see if the string starts with t20 or t13. Looking at the terminals, t20 is produced by NT7's production: NT7 \u2192 t1 or? Wait, let's check the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT70 is in NT70 \u2192 NT51 NT88? Or wait, the productions are all in CNF. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, more accurately, each rule is like NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ or ntX.\n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT81 NT90, the first two terminals are t20 t13, which would be produced by NT81 and NT90. So let's check NT81 and NT90's productions.\n\nLooking at NT81: its production is NT95 NT9. So NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Now, NT9 is 't10' or is it another rule? Wait, no, some of these have single terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 t1, but more accurately, looking at the rules, NT7's production is NT48 NT35, but also, some terminals appear elsewhere.\n\nWait, no, let's clarify. The grammar may have rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal or other non-terminals. But in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C can be non-terminals or terminals?\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT25 NT something?

For example, NT82 has production NT... \u2192 't3' and also 't6' and others. So that's a terminal. So in the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminals, but each production is exactly two parts, each a non-terminal or a terminal?\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the right, either terminals or non-terminals. But the given grammar has some non-terminals producing a terminal directly.\n\nWait, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, which is two non-terminals. But in the grammar, some entries have a single terminal:\n\nNT98 \u2192 't31' \n\nWait, no, looking again, some rules have a single terminal:\n\nLooking at the list, for example, NT98 has a production \u2192 't31'?

Let me recheck the original question.\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nWait, this last line, NT82 \u2192 't3'? But that's only one symbol. So that would violate CNF, as in CNF, each production must have two symbols on the right. So perhaps this is incorrect. Wait, no, perhaps it's a mistake. Or maybe the transcription is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the given grammar includes some terminals on the RHS of the production, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So perhaps the last part, NT82 \u2192 't3' is correct, meaning NT82 is a terminal.\n\nBut that seems odd because other rules have NT82 as a non-terminal.

The string to evaluate is `t14 t10 t35 t0 t29 t30 t13 t6 t18 t22 t34 t13 t0 t20`. Hmm, that's quite a long string with a bunch of t followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. From what I remember, it's a set of rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, it seems each non-terminal (NT) on the left side of the production produces two non-terminals on the right, except when it produces a terminal directly, like 't3' or 't1.'\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, I see some have two terminals, like NT82 \u2192 't3' and 't6', because the production is given as NT82 -> 't7'. Wait, no, looking again, actually, some of these rules have terminals. For example, NT82 \u2192 't3', 't6', which I think was mistakenly written. Let me check: looking at the given grammar, some rules do have two terminals? No, I think each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait no, looking again, I see that NT26 has a production NT26 -> NT43 NT88, and also NT86 -> NT25 NT37, which are both two non-terminals. So perhaps the productions are all either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, wait, but in the string, there are several 't' terms, like t14, t10, etc., which I think are terminals, so the grammar must have rules that produce these directly or through a chain.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the given string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the entire derivation starts with NT81 and NT90.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 't's and numbers, but wait, no, actually the string is `t14 t10 t35 t0 t29 t30 t13 t6 t18 t22 t34 t13 t0 t20`. Wait, no, wait. Looking back, I think I misread the string. Let me check: the string is `t14 t10 t35 t0 t29 t30 t13 t6 t18 t22 t34 t13 t0 t20`. Wait, that's one word, but with spaces separating them, like a list of terms. Wait, maybe it's a sentence of terms, each being a terminal.\n\nBut the grammar's terminal symbols include things like 't7', 't3', etc. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each being a token composed of 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, the string is t14, t10, t35, t0, t29, t30, t13, t6, t18, t22, t34, t13, t0, t20.\n\nWait, but the terminal symbols in the grammar are things like 't1', 't3', etc., so the string consists of these terminals. So to check if the string is generated, I need to see if we can split the string into a series of steps that follow the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me consider that each pair of non-terminals in a production generates a pair of terminals. So, perhaps the string must be built up by replacing non-terminals step by step until I get a string of terminals.\n\nSince the start symbol is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, we have S generates NT81 and NT90. So the first step is to have NT81 and NT90. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT81: according to the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Similarly, NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT24, according to NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT24. Wait, no, let me check: the grammar says NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT55. Wait, let me check each line to avoid confusion.\n\nActually, the grammar is written with NTxx -> some productions, each with either two NTs or a terminal. So let's find where NT81 and NT90 come into play.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT95 can produce NT25 NT60, for example. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should build the entire derivation path step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a parse tree for the given string, trying to match it to the grammar.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and each production in the grammar either produces two terminals or two non-terminals, the derivation process would involve replacing non-terminals with their child terminals or continuing to split.\n\nBut with two non-terminals at the top level (S \u2192 NT81 NT90), the string would start with the symbols derived by NT81 and NT90. So, the string starts with t14, t10, etc., which would likely correspond to the terminals produced by NT81 and NT90.\n\nLet me start by analyzing NT81 and NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo, NT81 produces NT95 and NT9, which must then each produce terminal symbols. Let's see what NT95 can do.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT25 can produce NT5, and NT60 can produce NT98 and NT55, for example.\n\nWait, let me make this more systematic.\n\nFirst, we have the string `t14 t10 t35 t0 t29 t30 t13 t6 t18 t22 t34 t13 t0 t20`.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT81 NT90, the generated string must be the concatenation of the strings derived by NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo, the first part of the string (t14) must come from NT81, and the second part (the rest up to t20) must come from NT90.\n\nBut wait, the start rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the entire generated string is the concatenation of the strings derived by NT81 and NT90. So the given string must be split into two parts: one part generated by NT81 and the other by NT90.\n\nLet me consider the full string: it's t14 t10 t35 t0 t29 t30 t13 t6 t18 t22 t34 t13 t0 t20.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens: 14 terms, so perhaps the split is after the first 5 or so.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be generated by the whole S production, which splits into NT81 and NT90, each of which must generate a substring, and together form the given string.\n\nSo, our first step is to check if the entire string can be considered as two parts: one generated by NT81 and one by NT90.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT81: according to the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT86 NT55, as per the last line: NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT55.\n\nSo, now let's look at NT90's production: it's NT86 and NT55.\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar says NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT55, yes. So NT90 produces two non-terminals: NT86 and NT55. Then NT86 and NT55 must each produce some terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT81's production is NT95 and NT9, each of which must produce terminals.\n\nLet's see what NT86 does: looking up, NT86 \u2192 NT26 NT37.\n\nAnd NT55: according to the grammar, NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37.\n\nWait, let me look back at the grammar. Yes, line says NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37.\n\nNow, proceeding step by step, let's try to derive the given string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, the string starts as (derivatives of NT81) + (derivatives of NT90).\n\nThe given string is t14 t10 t35 t0 t29 t30 t13 t6 t18 t22 t34 t13 t0 t20.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string by assigning the first part to NT81 and the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-238","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of a set of productions for non-terminals like S, NT7, NT9, and others, until I see the terminals like t0, t1, etc. Since it's in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. My goal is to see if the string \"t0 t5 t1 t0 t6 t3 t6 t7 t22 t5 t31 t3 t32 t3\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. Both NT81 and NT90 must be expanded to terminals for the string to be generated. Let's check the productions for NT81 and NT90.\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT90 -> NT25 NT37\n\nSo, NT9 should directly produce t9? Wait, looking at NT9, it's actually NT9 -> 't10'. Oh, that's a terminal. Now NT95: checking the productions, NT95 has two options: one is NT25 NT60 and another is the terminal t0. So either way, NT95 can produce t0, which is part of the string.\n\nFrom the string, the first element is t0, which would come from either NT95 directly or through t0. Let's consider NT95 being t0 first. So, S starts by producing NT81 NT90, which in turn NT95 NT9. If NT95 is t0 and NT9 is t10, but the next element after t0 in the string is t5, not t10. Hmm, so maybe this is a wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, let's see NT81: it splits into NT95 and NT9. NT95 could be t0 or another option, but if NT95 is t0, then NT9 is t10. But the string after t0 is t5, which doesn't match t10. So maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's double-check NT9's production. Looking at the grammar, NT9 is defined as -> 't10'. So NT9 can only produce t10. So if NT81 is NT95 and NT9, that would be t95 followed by t10, but in the string, after t0, it's t5, then t1, etc. So maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for another path through NT81. Let's see, are there any other productions for NT95 besides NT25 NT60 and t0? Yes, looking again: NT95->NT25 NT60 | t0. So the only terminals are t0 and, maybe, others? Wait, earlier I think I missed that NT95 also has production NT25 NT60. But that's a non-terminal, so it has to be expanded further.\n\nWait, let me clarify NT95's productions. The grammar has:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60 | t0.\n\nSo NT95 can generate either t0 or NT25 followed by NT60. If it's t0, then the first element t0 is satisfied. But then what about NT9? Let me see if I can find a mistake here.\n\nWait, original string: t0 t5 t1 t0 t6 t3 t6 t7 t22 t5 t31 t3 t32 t3.\n\nSo after the first t0 from NT95, we have t5 next. So after t0, comes t5. So perhaps the path is not using NT95 as t0, but the other option.\n\nWait, can NT95 produce something else? It's either t0 or NT25 NT60. So unless t25 and t60 are terminals, which they aren't, they need to be expanded. So maybe the only way to get a terminal is through t0.\n\nSo maybe S -> NT81 NT90 needs to generate t0 as the first element, but then after that, NT90 is NT25 NT37. Let's check NT25: it can be NT5 or t15.\n\nWait, let's check NT25's productions: Looking at the grammar, NT25 -> NT15 NT5. NT15 and NT5, I need to see their productions.\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\nNT25 -> NT15 NT5.\n\nBut I need to see the productions for NT15 and NT5. Let me scan through the grammar again.\n\nLooking for NT15: I see \"NT15 -> 't25'\". Wait, no, \"NT25 -> NT55 NT37\", but that's from another rule. Wait, perhaps I should list all the productions systematically.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT25 -> NT15 NT5.\n\nWait, no, checking line by line:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT7: NT48 NT35\n\nNT82: 't3'\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT25 -> NT55 NT37 (line 12)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, line by line, here are some key parts:\n\nLine 8: NT79 (Wait, maybe I miscounted). Let's find NT25:\n\nLooking for all lines where left-hand side starts with NT. Counting the lines:\n\nLine 8: NT79 is it? Wait, initial grammar lines:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nLines:\n\n1.

The string I'm supposed to check is `t20 t22 t35 t10 t5 t23 t23 t10 t32 t6 t22 t35 t3 t15 t18`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a set of rules where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can also have a terminal. Alternatively, some definitions allow the start symbol to have a terminal as well. In the given grammar, I notice that some NT's right-hand side has a terminal like 't3', so that's a mix. So the grammar allows for terminals directly in the productions.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production starts with a non-terminal, and each production expands to two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal is allowed to produce a terminal symbol. So the key is to parse the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nI remember that for CNF grammars, the derivation tree must have a specific structure. Each step in the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the entire derivation for a string will have a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children, corresponding to the two symbols in each production.\n\nThe string starts with `t20`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 can produce 't1' and 't20' elsewhere? Wait, let me check. Oh, looking at the production rules for NT7: I see `NT7 -> NT48 NT35` and also `NT7 -> 't1'`. Oh, so NT7 can produce a terminal 't1' or a combination of NT48 and NT35.\n\nSimilarly, for `t22`, I look at the grammar and find that NT20 can produce 't16', and NT28 can produce 't34'.

{"custom_id":"request-285","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools at my disposal. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol otherwise. This form is useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, so maybe that's applicable here. Alternatively, I could try to build a parse tree manually, but with a long string, that might get too complicated. The string to evaluate is `t35 t31 t34 t29 t31 t18 t3 t29 t35 t18 t13 t34 t33 t0 t16 t14`. Let's count the tokens: that's 17 tokens. So the string has 17 symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So for a string with n terminals, the derivation requires n-1 steps. The string has 17 tokens, so the number of non-terminals in the initial symbol S would go down from 1 to 17 in 16 steps. But wait, actually, S starts as a single non-terminal, so deriving 17 terminals would require 17-1 =16 steps. Hmm, not sure if that's directly useful, but it's good to know.\n\nAlternatively, using the CYK algorithm could help parse the string and determine if it's in the language. The CYK algorithm efficiently checks if a string can be generated by a grammar in CNF. I think I should try that approach because it's systematic.\n\nLet me recap how CYK works:\n\n1. Initialize a table where each cell corresponds to a position in the string and contains non-terminals that can derive the substring starting at that position with the given length.\n\n2. For each cell, consider all possible ways to split the substring into two parts, each derivable by some non-terminal.\n\n3. For each possible split, and each possible production rule, check if the two parts correspond to the two non-terminals in the production.\n\n4. If for all positions, the start symbol S can derive the entire string, then the string is in the language.\n\nAlright, let's try to apply CYK to the given string. The string is: `t35 t31 t34 t29 t31 t18 t3 t29 t35 t18 t13 t34 t33 t0 t16 t14`\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, I realize that some symbols might be terminals, and others could be non-terminals depending on their definitions. For example, in the grammar, certain rules have terminal symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, some of the productions have terminal symbols like 't3', 't16', etc., while others have non-terminals. So, for instance, `NT7 -> NT48 NT35` is a non-terminal production, but `NT77 -> 't34'` would mean a production that produces the terminal symbol 't34'.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing because in the grammar, some symbols like NT7 are non-terminals, but others may lead to terminal symbols through further productions. For example, NT7 eventually leads to 't1' as per a production. So in the CYK table, terminals are terminals, and non-terminals are the ones on the left of the -> in the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, in CYK, the table works by considering non-terminals as the rules that produce sequences of terminals. So when we apply it, each cell [i,j] will contain the non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nSo, first step: list all the terminals in the given string. It looks like all the parts are 't' followed by numbers, like t35, t31, etc. So each of these is a terminal symbol because in the grammar, these are written as the right-hand sides of some productions, e.g., NT77 -> 't34' or NT7 -> 't1'.\n\nWait a minute, that complicates things because in a standard CNF grammar, each production is either a non-terminal broken into two non-terminals or a single terminal. So in this grammar, some of the non-terminals are directly terminals through some productions. But then, in the CYK algorithm, when you encounter a terminal symbol, you check if any production rule for a non-terminal has that terminal as one of the two symbols, but that's not how it works. Because in CYK, terminals are the atomic units; the algorithm doesn't process them, except for when considering possible productions. Wait, no, actually, the algorithm works by, for each cell, keeping track of all possible non-terminals that can generate the substring in that cell.\n\nBut in this case, if a terminal symbol like 't35' is present in the string, then in the CYK table, that 't35' must be produced by some production that is a single terminal, i.e., NT->t35. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any such production. Because in the grammar, all productions of non-terminals seem to break into two non-terminals. For example, NT7 -> NT48 NT35, which is a non-terminal breaking into two, but then each of those can break further down.\n\nWait, but let's go back. The grammar provided has rules like NT77 -> 't34', so NT77 is a non-terminal that can produce 't34'. So, in the parser, 't34' is a terminal, which can be matched directly from NT77. But in the given string, every token is a terminal, which implies that somehow each of these must be generated from the grammar.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, not all non-terminals directly produce a terminal; for instance, NT77 does, but others are broken down into two non-terminals. So to parse a token like 't35', you need a non-terminal that can derive it through a single production.\n\nAlternatively, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write all the productions and see which non-terminals can directly produce the given terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7-> 't1' (from NT7-> NT48 NT35 and then NT48 -> 't23')? Wait, no, actually, each production in the grammar is either a non-terminal broken into two, or a terminal, but let's look:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT77 -> 't34' \u2192 NT77 is a non-terminal that can produce t34.\n\n- NT7 -> 't1' \u2192 NT7 can produce t1.\n\n- NT17 (or maybe not, let's check the list) \u2192 I don't see it.

Each production starts with S, and the terminals in the string are derived from non-terminals through a series of steps.\n\nSince the string consists of a sequence of terminals, I need to see if the leftmost derivation of the grammar can produce this string. Each terminal in the string corresponds to a production rule somewhere in the grammar. The idea is to parse the string and see if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nI should represent the string as a sequence of symbols to process: [t3, t30, t1, t1, t34, t16, t20, t14, t16, t3, t34, t7, t30, t18, t7, t33].\n\nLet me start from the beginning and try to substitute the non-terminals step by step based on the grammar.\n\n1. The first symbol is t3. Looking at the grammar, which production ends with 't3'? \n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT39 -> t33\nWait, no, looking at the list, I see:\n\nWait, more accurately, the rules that produce t's:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT39 -> t33\n\nWait, no, wait, let's list all the rules with 't' in their production:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, each production that ends with a single terminal 't' followed by a number. Let's make a list:\n\n- NT7 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t20 (wait, is it? Let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit long. Let me go through each production and note which ones have terminals as their rhs.\n\nLooking through each production line:\n\nNT7 has:\n-> NT48 NT35\nAND\n-> t1\n-> t20\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT7's rules are:\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT7 ->t1\nNT7 -> t20\n\nSo NT7 can produce t1 or t20.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other NT rules that produce single terminals:\n\nNT37: It has a production -> t34.\n\nWait, no, wait looking through each rule:\n\nLet me go through each NT and see:\n\n- NT7 -> t1, t20\n- NT98 -> t31\nCheck the rules for NT98: It has NT98 -> t31\n- NT37 -> t34\n- NT86 -> t32\n- NT82 (wait, I see two 't82's: one as NT82 -> t6 and another as NT82 -> 't3'). No, looking again, the list includes:\n\nNT82 -> t3 (twice? Wait, let me see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT82 -> 't3' once\n- Another rule: NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n- And in the list, there is: NT82 -> 't6'\n\nWait, perhaps looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT82: two rules\n-> 't6'\n-> NT95 NT13 (but NT95 produces t23, NT13 produces t15?)\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar lines:\n\nLooking at NT82:\nLine says \"NT82 -> t6\" and probably another rule where NT82 is made from other symbols. Hmm, not sure, but I think more accurately:\n\nLooking through each production, I think for each NT, I need to list all the rules they have.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can create a dependency tree or parse the string by working backward using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the string in terms of the non-terminals that can generate it.\n\nWait, but perhaps starting from the first symbol t3. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t3. Wait, let me check the grammar again. The string starts with t3. Looking through the rules, which NTs produce t3? I don't think any NT directly produces t3 based on the lines provided.\n\nWait, let me check: looking for any production where the rhs is a single terminal 't3':\n\nLooking through the list, under 't X' we have:\n\n- NT39 -> t33\n- NT43 -> t20\n- NT13 -> t15\n- NT25 -> t15\n- NT48 -> t23\n- NT25 -> t5 (Hmm, but earlier I thought NT25 -> t15?

Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules to understand what each symbol can expand into. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S -> NT81 NT90. So the string must start with nt81 nt90. Looking at the string, the first two tokens are t18 and t0. Hmm, that doesn't match because NT81 comes before NT90. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The grammar says S expands into NT81 and NT90. Each NT is a non-terminal, right? So the string \"t18 t0 t33...\" probably corresponds to the non-terminals NT81 and NT90. Let me check the grammar again. NT81 can be derived from NT95 NT9, and NT9 is 't10'. So NT81 becomes 't10' from NT9, but NT95 can further expand into other terms. Similarly, NT90 is broken down into NT26 NT39. NT26 is NT25 NT55, which then become t15 and t31 respectively. NT39 is t33. So overall, NT90 should be t15 t31 t33.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should list the productions for each non-terminal and see their corresponding t tokens.\n\nLet me start by mapping each NT to its expansion:\n\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88\n- NT48 -> NT69 NT74\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT35 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n- NT31 -> NT86 NT28\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT82 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT95 -> 't0'\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n- NT12 -> 't35'\n- NT69 -> 't34'\n- NT51 -> 't32'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't1'\n\nWait, some non-terminals have multiple productions, like NT7, which goes to NT48 NT35 and also to 't1'. This could complicate things because there might be ambiguity.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t18 t0 t33 t3 t22 t16 t10 t5 t20 t22 t31 t15 t16 t7 t32 t34 t31.\n\nI need to see if this can be formed by a series of productions starting from S.\n\nLet's start breaking down the string token by token, but maybe it's better to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t18 t0. Let's check NT81. NT81 is NT95 NT9. NT9 is t10. So the end of NT81 is t10. The beginning of the string is t18 t0. So perhaps the first t18 comes from NT81's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me see. NT81 -> NT95 NT9. NT95 -> NT25 NT60. NT25 -> t15. NT60 -> NT98 NT55. NT98 -> t31. NT55 -> NT67 NT37. NT67 -> t15. NT37 -> NT9 NT82. NT9 is t10, NT82 is either t82 or further expansions.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe it's better to approach this using parsing methods, like the CYK algorithm, but since I don't have much time, I'll try a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to see if the string can be generated by the given non-terminals. Let's consider the string and see if each part matches any non-terminal's production.\n\nBut the string is a flat list of t tokens. Each non-terminal corresponds to some t tokens. For example, NT7 is 't1' or more terms, but perhaps we can group the tokens into segments that match each non-terminal's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into two parts: the first part corresponds to NT81, and the second to NT90.\n\nLooking at the string: t18 t0... that's the start. Let's see what could produce t18.\n\nWait, NT77 -> t34, and NT9 -> t10. There's NT9->t6 as well. I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the string can be represented as NT81 NT90, each of which has their own expansion.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the string doesn't match the grammar because the initial parts don't align. For example, NT81 should end with t10, but the string starts with t18, which might not be part of NT81's expansion.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. The initial string is t18 t0 t33... So the first two tokens are t18 and t0, but according to the grammar, S is supposed to be NT81 NT90, which would expand to something like t18 t6 (since NT90 is t15 t31 t33 or something else). Hmm, this might not add up.\n\nWait, maybe the start symbol S -> NT81 NT90 needs to expand into t18 t6 (since NT90 is NT26 NT39, which is t15 t33 or whatever), but the string starts with t18 t0, which doesn't match. Therefore, the string might not be derivable from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the non-terminals expand. Each NT in the string might be a node in the parse tree, so I have to see if each part can be derived.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. I think the answer is 'No' because the initial t18 and t0 don't align with the expected expansions starting from S.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t7 t3 t16 t35 t31 t31 t1 t15 t20 t31 t33 t23 t20 t32 t30 t23 t34`. \n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is something like A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this case, all the productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nNow, the string is just a sequence of terminals. To check if it's generated by the grammar, we need to see if there's a way to derive the string step by step using the productions. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some rules produce terminals directly. For example:\n- NT90 \u2192 't14'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6', 't39'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- And so on.\n\nThe given string starts with `t7`, so I need to find a production for the initial symbol S that can eventually produce a sequence starting with t7. Let's look at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S starts with NT81 and NT90. \n\nNT81 has a production \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then, looking at NT9: It's in the productions as NT9 \u2192 't10' or other non-terminals. Let's see, NT9 goes to 't10' or, looking back, is there another rule? Wait, checking the grammar again, NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39 is one, but what about NT9? Oh, in the provided grammar, looking for NT9, I see that NT9 \u2192 't10' is present (e.g., NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39, but is NT9 directly a terminal? Looking again, the list includes entries for NT9 \u2192 't10', so NT9 can produce 't10' or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, the production rules are:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT25 -> NT5\nNT5 -> ... and so on. \n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the string starts with NT81 and NT90. Let's see NT81.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So the first part of the string is the sequence generated by NT81. Then NT90 \u2192 't14'. So the last part of the string is 't14'. So the initial part before 't14' is derived from NT81, which is NT95 and NT9.\n\nSo the string should be something like (from NT81 portion) ... t14.\n\nLooking at the string: the last element is t34. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the exact string again: `t7 t3 t16 t35 t31 t31 t1 t15 t20 t31 t33 t23 t20 t32 t30 t23 t34`.\n\nWait, that's 18 tokens. Let's see the order. The string starts with t7, then t3, up to t34.\n\nBut the initial part of the string is t7, which would have to come from some NT that produces t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any production that directly gives t7? Yes, NT82 \u2192 't7' directly, as well as NT88 \u2192 't7' I think. Wait, let me check: NT82 has a production NT82 \u2192 't3' and 't6' and 't39', and another production NT82 \u2192 't23', 't34'. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar includes:\n\nNT82 -> 't3', 't6', 't39', 't23', 't34'.\n\nWait, so NT82 can directly produce any of these terminals. So one of the options is 't34', which is the last part of the string.\n\nSo, for the initial S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60: so that's another step. Let's see what NT25 produces.\n\nLooking it up: NT25 \u2192 NT5.\n\nAnd then NT5, I think it's in the production rules. Wait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT5 might not be a terminal. Let me check: the grammar doesn't have a production for NT5 directly to a terminal, so it's a non-terminal. Let's see what NT25 produces.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll map out the structure of the grammar to understand how the non-terminals expand into terminals.

This might be a typo or a different version. Since the given grammar has both, I'll have to check which one is active. Wait, the initial list provided at the beginning includes both versions for NT95, so maybe it's a mistake. Let me check the initial grammar again. Oh, I see, the user provided the grammar with multiple entries for some NT95. I'll proceed as per the more specific rules.)\n\nI think the production NT95 \u2192 't0' might be the latest one, so I'll note that. But first, I'll go through each step.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nFirst part: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10', according to NT9's production. So the first part is NT81 \u2192 NT95 't10'.\n\nBut NT95 has multiple productions. I need to make sure which one is being used. Let me check the given grammar for NT95 again:\n\nLooking back, the user provided:\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n... and later\nNT95 -> 't13'\nAlso, another one: NT95 -> 't1' \nWait, that seems inconsistent. Hmm. Let me clarify. The initial grammar has:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n...\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n...\nNT95 -> 't0'\n...\nThen, later:\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT98 -> 't31'\n...\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\nWait, perhaps there are multiple rules for NT95, which would conflict. Maybe the correct one is the terminals. Let me check the last entries:\n\nNT95: \n- NT25 NT60\n- NT37 NT18\n- 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 ... (Wait, no, NT55 is another non-terminal.)\n\nIt seems like the latest productions for NT95 are the terminals. So the production could be NT95 \u2192 't13'. Alternatively, I might have miscounted. Let me look again:\n\nThe initial grammar as presented has:\n\n...\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't30'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't0'\nNT48 -> 't23'\nNT25 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't34'\nNT60 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> 't29'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT83 -> 't23'\nNT90 -> 't14'\nNT7 -> 't20'\nNT98 -> 't24'\n\nWait, no, looking again, the user's grammar seems to have multiple entries for some non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT95 appears multiple times with different productions. The last production for NT95 is NT95 -> 't0'. Before that, it's NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18 and others. Similarly, NT7 has multiple rules.\n\nSo perhaps the rules as presented are multiple, and the last one to be defined should take precedence, but in this case, some are terminals and some aren't. I'm a bit confused here, but I'll proceed, possibly making an assumption about the latest rule being the intended production.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed step by step, considering each possible expansion. However, that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, since this is a problem-solving scenario, I'll assume the latest rules take precedence unless I can verify otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps I'll go through the string step by step, trying to match it from the start.\n\nThe string is: t16 t3 t30 t35 t33 t15 t5 t35 t14 t0 t23 t3 t6 t29 t31 t0 t34 t14.\n\nI'll start by noting that the start symbol S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the first part must expand to t16 (since the string starts with t16). Let's see how NT81 and NT90 can produce this.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 is 't10', so NT95 must produce something that when combined with 't10' gives the first part.\n\nBut the first part of the string is t16. So S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which would mean NT81's expansion must start with t16. Let's see how NT81 can produce terms starting with t16.\n\nLooking at NT81's productions:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo NT81's first part is NT95 and the second part is NT9. NT9 is 't10', as per NT9's rule. So the first part would be NT95's expansion followed by 't10'. \n\nBut the string starts with 't16', so we need NT95 to produce something ending with 't6' because 't16' is the first token. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the entire string is generated by NT81's expansion followed by NT90's expansion.

So t23 is only possible as NT74.\n\nSimilarly, other rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I can see that NT7 produces t1, NT77 produces t34, NT9 produces t6 and t10, NT13 produces t15, NT16 may come from where?

So each non-terminal is expanded either further or directly to a terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S, which expands to NT81 NT90.\n\nLet's see each of these:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT25 NT88\n\nSo, first step: S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 (NT95 NT9) (NT25 NT88)\n\nNow, let's process each of these:\n\nNT95: Looking at the rules, NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n\nSimilarly, NT9 is a terminal, right? Wait, looking back, it's NT9, but in the grammar, I don't see NT9 being directly expanded, but in the string, I see 't9' or 't90' which is different. Wait, hold on. Wait, is NT9 a terminal or a non-terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT90 is a production, but NT9 is not listed as a non-terminal\u2014probably a terminal.\n\nWait, in the list of non-terminals, I see NT1, NT3, etc. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking through the productions, it's all NT followed by a number. So maybe the grammar uses numbers beyond 30 as NTX where X is two digits, like 7 being NT7, 16 as NT16 (but in the grammar, it's NT20, etc.). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps some of these NTX are non-terminals, and others are terminals if they only appear on the right-hand side as terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, if an NTX only appears as a left-hand side or as a terminal in the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT7 appears as NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35. So it's a non-terminal. NT33 is a terminal? Wait, but looking at the grammar, all the rules have NTX producing other combinations. Then where are the terminals?\n\nLooking back: some NT rules produce a terminal. For example, NT82 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't1', and so on. So any NTX that has a production ending with a terminal (i.e., 't' followed by numbers) is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT82 \u2192 't3' is a production, meaning NT82 is a non-terminal whose expansion ends with 't3'. So 't3' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT20 \u2192 't16' and NT98 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nSo the terminals in the string are 't1', 't10', 't13', 't15', 't16', 't20', 't23', 't24', 't29', 't3', 't31', 't33', 't34', 't35', 't39', 't7', etc.\n\nSo, to process the string, each symbol must be matched by the terminals in the expansions.\n\nNow, back to S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 (NT95 NT9) (NT25 NT88)\n\nSo the string starts with the expansions of NT95 and NT25, then NT9, and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S expands to NT81 NT90, so the string will be the concatenation of the expansions of NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals. So each NT in the grammar must expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut to proceed, perhaps the best approach is to model this as a leftmost derivation. Let me see:\n\nThe string is: t20 t33 t0 t16 t7 t7 t20 t10 t13 t34 t14 t3 t31 t15 t24 t7 t31 t13 t29\n\nThat's 19 tokens, so 19 steps in the expansion, but it's more about how they connect.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the string as a sequence of symbols and check if each symbol can be produced by a non-terminal step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps using the CYK algorithm approach, but given the time, I can try to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternative approach: build a parse tree, ensuring that each part of the string matches the grammar.\n\nStarting with S: NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, the first few terminals would be the expansion of NT81 and NT90.\n\nLet's see if the string can be constructed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down as:\n\nFirst, looking for the first symbol: 't20'.\n\nIn the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't16', but also, perhaps from further productions.\n\nLooking at the productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-346","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing because each step in the derivation consumes exactly one symbol, making the parsing efficient.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that most of the productions are of the form NTXY \u2192 NTXZ NTY something, creating a chain of non-terminals. Some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as NT82 \u2192 't3' or NT20 \u2192 't16'. These are the leaf symbols that eventually make up the string we're checking.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t24 t14 t32 t31 t15 t29 t30 t31 t6 t30 t34 t0 t24 t1 t31 t0 t32 t1 t22`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT81 NT90. So, S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of symbols: [t24, t14, t32, t31, t15, t29, t30, t31, t6, t30, t34, t0, t24, t1, t31, t0, t32, t1, t22]\n\nI'll number the positions for clarity:\n\n1: t24\n2: t14\n3: t32\n4: t31\n5: t15\n6: t29\n7: t30\n8: t31\n9: t6\n10: t30\n11: t34\n12: t0\n13: t24\n14: t1\n15: t31\n16: t0\n17: t32\n18: t1\n19: t22\n\nFirst, the start symbol S splits into NT81 and NT90. So, the start string isNT81 NT90. Let's see what each of these produce.\n\nLooking up NT81 in the grammar: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 expands to NT95 and NT9. NT9 \u2192 't10', so that's straightforward. NT95 expands into multiple non-terminals, as per the grammar.\n\nSimilarly, NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88. NT51 \u2192 't32' and NT88 \u2192 't7'.\n\nSo, the initial expansion would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 NT95 NT9 NT51 NT88.\n\nWait, no. Actually, S directly expands to NT81 NT90, so each step involves replacing non-terminals.\n\nBut to make it clearer, perhaps I should write the entire derivation tree, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can simulate the leftmost derivation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a binary tree (each production is two symbols), the number of symbols should double each time, so starting with S (1 symbol), then 2, then 4, 8, 16, etc. But our string has 19 symbols, which isn't a power of two, so that's a red flag. Let me check: 19 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, which totals 15, but with some extra. Wait, perhaps it's a valid phrase if it's a concatenation. Alternatively, maybe the grammar allows for other derivations.\n\nWait, each step in the grammar replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols. So, starting from S (1 symbol), each expansion increases the count by 1 (because S can only produce two non-terminals, leading to 2 symbols). Then, each of those non-terminals can further split, each producing two, so 4, then 8, etc. So, the number of symbols should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of steps. Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the length doubles each time. Let's see. For example, starting with S, which is 1 symbol. S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so 2 symbols. Then, each of NT81 and NT90 can split further, each step adding more symbols. So, for each non-terminal that's a non-terminal, when expanded, will add one more symbol (since they split 1 into 2), increasing the total by one each time.\n\nBut let me get back. The given string has 19 symbols. The grammar's initial expansion would result in an odd number of symbols? I'm not sure, perhaps I should instead think about how the string is built up step by step.\n\nGiven the target string, each terminal corresponds to a production. Let me try to parse the string backward.\n\nThe string is t24 t14 ... t22.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see which production it comes from.\n\nLooking up each tX:\n\nt24: from NT7 \u2192 't24'\n\nt14: from NT98 \u2192 't31'? Wait no. Wait, NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39. Hmm, but t14 is directly produced by NT98 only if NT98 \u2192 't31' which is t14? Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nt24 \u2192 NT7\n\nt14 \u2192 NT98 (since NT98 \u2192 't31' which is t14. Wait, wait NT98's production is NT7 NT39. So NT98 doesn't produce t14 directly.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-examine the productions.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' (from the grammar provided, line 24: NT7 \u2192 't1')\n\nWait no, let me check the grammar again:\n\nUpon checking, the productions for NT7 are at multiple lines:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT18 NT22\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, no, that's not.

It looks like NT7 \u2192 't1' and also NT7 \u2192 't20', which seems conflicting. That's unusual; perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, line 24 says: NT7 \u2192 't1' and line 26: NT77 \u2192 NT25 NT60, but earlier lines:\n\n- Line 24: NT7 \u2192 't1'\n\n- Line 49: NT7 \u2192 't20'\n\nHmm, that can't both be true unless one of them is incorrect or miswritten.

{"custom_id":"request-366","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the grammar to understand the structure. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that most of the rules are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, like S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Some of them produce a single terminal symbol. For example, NT82 \u2192 't3'. So the grammar is set up such that each production can be expanded into terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to check is: t16 t35 t24 t7 t7 t1 t31 t16 t6 t33 t35 t29 t3 t3 t20 t1 t34 t10 t29 t29.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince this can get quite complex manually, maybe an approach using memoization or a recursive descent parser would work. But given that I'm doing this manually, perhaps a better way is to attempt to parse the string step by step, trying to match from the start symbol.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the string must start with the production of NT81 followed by NT90. That means after expanding S, the first two symbols should be from NT81 and the next two from NT90, though actually, since NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals, they can produce sequences that start with terminals.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should look at each symbol in the string and see if they can be matched by the productions. Let's list the symbols and see possible matches.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt16, t35, t24, t7, t7, t1, t31, t16, t6, t33, t35, t29, t3, t3, t20, t1, t34, t10, t29, t29.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo S starts with NT81 followed by NT90. Let's check if the first part can be NT81 leading to the first few symbols.\n\nNT81's production is given as NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. But wait, looking back, I realize that some non-terminals have multiple productions. Wait, in the grammar, each line is a production rule.

Looking for NT90 in the grammar:\n\nNT90 \u2192 't14'\n\nBecause I see NT90 \u2192 't14' in the provided rules. So S \u2192 NT81 NT90 means that after expanding S, the first part is NT81, then NT90, which is 't14'. So the string should start with symbols that can be the expansion of NT81 followed by 't14'.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t16, t35, etc. So perhaps S expands to a sequence that starts with those symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to find a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in reverse: start from the end of the string and see if it can be built up by the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, but since the grammar only generates sequences starting with certain symbols, perhaps starting from the start symbol and expanding non-terminals toward the terminals is a better approach.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components:\n\n1. t16\n2. t35\n3. t24\n4. t7\n5. t7\n6. t1\n7. t31\n8. t16\n9. t6\n10. t33\n11. t35\n12. t29\n13. t3\n14. t3\n15. t20\n16. t1\n17. t34\n18. t10\n19. t29\n20. t29\n\nWait, 20 symbols in total. So each application of a production should add either one or two more symbols. Let me consider the structure of the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands into NT81 NT90. So NT81 and NT90 are both non-terminals. NT90 is 't14', so that's a terminal. So after S expands, the second part is 't14'.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string, it's t16, which is not 't14'. Hmm, so perhaps the second part of S is not expanding to 't14' in the top-level expansion. Wait, no: S's expansion is NT81 followed by NT90, and NT90 is 't14'. So S must expand to a sequence that starts with NT81 and then ends with 't14'. But the string starts with t16, which suggests that perhaps the NT90 is non-terminal and needs further expansion. Wait, but according to the grammar, NT90 is a terminal 't14', so S can't be the first part; perhaps I've misseen the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I was wrong. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nBut NT90 is 't14' directly. So when S is expanded, it's NT81 followed by 't14'. Thus, S's expansion is a sequence that starts with NT81, then 't14', but in the string given, the first symbol is t16, not part of the nt81 sequence. So this suggests that either the string starts with 't14', which is not the case, or the NT81 is further expanded, and the string continues beyond 't14'.\n\nWait, no: S is NT81 NT90. So when you expand S, it becomes whatever NT81"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-358","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I think correspond to terminal symbols. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's all in CNF, which means every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and it's defined as NT81 NT90. So the initial derivation starts with NT81 and NT90, each of which might produce further non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string we're checking is: `t3 t32 t0 t33 t1 t29 t1 t34 t18 t31 t7 t32 t6 t24 t15 t23 t34 t13 t20 t5`.\n\nThis looks like a sequence of production steps where each 't' is a terminal, and the numbers are indices that point to production rules for the non-terminals. So each 'tX' corresponds to a non-terminal that has a production rule ending with 'tX'.\n\nLet me see if I can reconstruct the derivation that would produce this string. Starting from S: NT81 NT90. Each of these non-terminals must eventually produce parts of the string.\n\nLooking at NT81, according to the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. But looking at the 't's, I notice that 't9' isn't present. Wait, the string has t9? Wait, no, let me check the string again. Wait, the string doesn't have t9 except at the end: t13 is after t18, t15 is before that, t20, t5. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the string is: t3, t32, t0, t33, t1, t29, t1, t34, t18, t31, t7, t32, t6, t24, t15, t23, t34, t13, t20, t5. Wait, is there a 't9' in there? I don't see it. So maybe I'm wrong, or perhaps I need to see where each 't' comes from.\n\nLooking through each 't' in the string, I can find which non-terminals they correspond to. For example:\n\nt3: From NT7's rule, looking at the grammar: NT7 -> NT48 NT35. Also, in the end, NT7 appears in both NT97 and some other rules, but more importantly, the 't3' is produced by a rule that isn't listed here. Wait, in the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are linked to terminals, like NT74-> 't31', but wait, looking more carefully, the grammar has several entries where NTx corresponds to t something, but the exact mappings aren't clear.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list which non-terminals are linked to which terminals. Let me go through each production rule and note which non-terminals produce which 't's.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT37 -> 't6' via NT82's rule and others?\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, many don't directly produce t's.

Wait, NT95's production? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT74 -> 't31'\nNT25 -> 't15'\nNT86 -> 't32'\nNT39 -> 't33'\nNT88 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't20'\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT69 -> 't34'\nNT51 -> 't32'\nNT48 -> 't23'\nNT25 -> 't5'\nNT43 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't34'\nNT60 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> 't29'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT83 -> 't23'\nNT90 -> 't14'\nNT74 -> 't24'\nWait, okay, let's try to map each 'tX' to the non-terminal that produces it. So:\n\nt1: NT7\nt3: I don't see a non-terminal in the rules that directly produce t3. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check all the rules carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT82\n\nWait, but I don't see any rules that produce t3. Let me check all the 't's in the string and see if they correspond to any non-terminals in the grammar that lead to them.\n\nWait, in the string, the first 't' is t3, which I don't see in the mappings. That's a red flag because if the grammar doesn't have a production for NTx -> t3, then any string with t3 can't be generated by it. So perhaps the answer is No, but let's check all terms.\n\nWait, let's go through each 't' in the string and see if it's possible:\n\n- t3: Is there any NT rule that leads to t3? Let me look through all NT rules. I see NT77->t34, but I don't see any rule producing t3. So unless another rule leads to it through other steps, but since all are in CNF, the only terminal symbols are those that have a direct production.\n\nWait, if t3 isn't produced by any non-terminal, then the string can't be generated. So perhaps the string contains a 't3' which can't be derived from any NT rule, leading to the conclusion of No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me scan through the rules again:\n\nNT74 -> 't31'\nNT26 -> 't32'\nNT73 -> 't34' (is that a rule? Wait, no, the rules start with NT, so I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I see NT74-> 't31', but nothing for t3 or t32 except NT86->t32 and NT26->t32. Alternatively, maybe t3 comes from NT26, but the string starts with t3, so to get t3, you'd have to have a production rule NT26->t3..., but I don't see that.\n\nIn the rules, NT26 has two options: either NT43 NT82 or NT25 NT55. But wait, do any of these lead to terminal? No, because they're both two non-terminals. So unless the non-terminal NT26 itself produces a terminal, but I don't see any rule where NT26->'tX'; the rules are only:\n\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nSo NT26 can't produce a terminal. So any 't' that comes from NT26 is impossible because you have to go through non-terminals. So the string starts with t3, which maybe comes from NT26, but wait, t3 isn't in the list of end symbols for any NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of each NT and the terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT77-> 't34'\n- NT39-> 't33'\n- NT88-> 't7'\n- NT37-> via where? Looking at NT67-> 't15' but no. Wait, actually, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should make a table of all NT rules and their possible terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a 't3' which isn't present in any non-terminal's production, so it's impossible, hence the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe I misread the rules and t3 is somewhere else. Let me go through all rules again.\n\nHmm, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> 't31'\n- NT26 -> 't32'\n- NT73 -> 't34' (wait, that's not a rule.

My task is to parse the string `t6 t1 t13 t29 t10 t32 t16 t10 t5 t33 t16 t20 t24 t31 t7 t30 t23 t29 t15 t31 t10` and see if it can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the string is a sequence of terminals, and since it's in CNF, each production either has two terminals or a single non-terminal. So, each step in the string should correspond to a production where a non-terminal is replaced by two terminals or another non-terminal.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use a recursive descent parser or maybe a top-down approach, starting from the top symbol S and trying to derive the given string step by step. However, it might be easier to reverse the process: check if the string can be broken down according to the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to build the parse tree from bottom up, starting from the leaves (terminals) and seeing if they can be grouped according to the grammar rules to form higher non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the productions for clarity:\n\n1.

NT25 \u2192 't5'\n47. NT9 \u2192 't6'\n48. NT43 \u2192 't1'\nWait, I notice that NT43 appears twice with different replacements. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, production 35 says NT43 \u2192 't35', and production 48 and 49 (wait, in the provided list, perhaps some duplications). Wait, let me recount:\n\nIn the given grammar, under NT43, it's written twice. Let me check:\n\nLines 34 and 48 and 49? Wait, the user provided the grammar with multiple entries under some non-terminals. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT43:\n\nLine 34: NT43 \u2192 't35'\n\nLine 40: NT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nAnd line 48: NT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo, actually, NT43 has two productions:\n\n40: NT43 \u2192 't35'\n\n48: NT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nThe user's grammar includes:\n\nLine 34: NT43 -> 't35'\n\nThen line 40: NT43 -> 't1'\n\nWait, but line 48 is also NT43 -> 't1', so actually, NT43 has two different productions: one leading to 't35' and another to 't1'. That\u2019s important because when parsing, if the current terminal is either 't35' or 't1', we can consume it accordingly.\n\nNow, the string is: t6 t1 t13 t29 t10 t32 t16 t10 t5 t33 t16 t20 t24 t31 t7 t30 t23 t29 t15 t31 t10.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to try to match the string to the grammar. Starting from the beginning, let's attempt to see which productions could be used.\n\nThe first symbol is t6. Looking at the grammar, I can find which non-terminals expand to 't6'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6' (line 38).\n\nAlso, NT9 \u2192 't10' (line 37), and NT12 \u2192 't30' (line 42), but none of these is 't6' except NT82. So the first token must come from NT82.\n\nSo the string starts with NT82 -> 't6', which matches the first token.\n\nThen the next token is 't1'. So after 't6', we have 't1'.\n\nBut NT82 can expand to 't6' (itself), or in the original grammar, NT82 can expand to NT51 NT37 (line 9) or other productions? Wait no: looking at the grammar, line 15 says NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13. Wait, but in the given grammar, line 15 is NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13, but also line 35 and line 43.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, let me check NT82:\n\nNT82: line 15: NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n\nline 20: NT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nline 38: Is there another line for NT82? Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nThe grammar has lines:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (line 38)\n- NT82 \u2192 nt95 nt13 (line 15)\n\nNo, line 38 is just NT82 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount the lines provided:\n\nLooking back, the user's grammar:\n\n- NT82: line 15 (NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13)\n- line 38: NT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake; looking again, line 38 is NT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nYes, line 38:\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\n\nSo, NT82 can produce 't6' or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, after 't6', the next symbol is 't1'. So perhaps 't1' is produced by NT82. Wait, but NT82 can produce 't6' or 't1' via another path?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT82 can only produce 't6' or NT95 NT13. There's no production for NT82 directly to 't1'. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, looking back, line 40: Wait, line 40 is NT43, so no. So perhaps, after 't6', to get 't1', we need to have 't6' followed by something that produces 't1'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all the productions that lead to 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can produce terminals. The start symbol here seems to be S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S directly produces N T81 N T90. Wait, but in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals on the right side, right? So S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t35 t31 t35 t3 t6 t33 t5 t7 t15 t3 t34 t13 t15 t6 t20 t29 t1 t0 t29 t13 t23.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar and the string mention \"NT\" followed by numbers, but the given string is a series of \"t\" followed by numbers. So each \"t\" seems to represent a terminal, possibly corresponding to a rule that ends with 't' followed by some digits.\n\nI think the first step is to build the parse tree for the given string and see if it conforms to the grammar.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S must start with NT81 followed by NT90. Let's break that down.\n\nEach NT has a production rule. For example, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 can split into two non-terminals, NT95 and NT9.\n\nThe string starts with t35, which I think corresponds to the production NT35 \u2192 t35.

Non-terminals are terms like S, NT98, NT37, etc. The productions for these non-terminals will guide how they can be split into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me list out the productions for reference:\n\n- S -> NT81 NT90\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88\n- NT48 -> NT69 NT74\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT35 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT95 -> NT37 NT18\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n- NT31 -> NT86 NT28\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT82 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT95 -> 't0'\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n- NT12 -> 't35'\n- NT69 -> 't34'\n- NT51 -> 't32'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't0'\n- NT28 -> 't34'\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't29'\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT83 -> 't23'\n- NT90 -> 't14'\n\nWait, I see that some non-terminals have multiple productions, and some have terminal symbols. My approach should be to work from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, the string must be split into two parts: the first generated by NT81 and the second by NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t20. Let me see what the first part could be.\n\nFirst, let me see the entire string length: there are 21 tokens. S -> NT81 NT90, so the string can be divided into two parts, let's say of lengths a and b, where a + b =21.\n\nI'll consider possible splits. For example, maybe the first NT81 generates the first part and NT90 generates the second. Let's see the possible splits.\n\nLet me try splitting at position k where k is the split after generating the first part and before the second.\n\nLet me list the tokens:\n\n1: t20\n\n2: t33\n\n3: t18\n\n4: t3\n\n5: t20\n\n6: t31\n\n7: t30\n\n8: t6\n\n9: t7\n\n10: t1\n\n11: t30\n\n12: t3\n\n13: t33\n\n14: t33\n\n15: t20\n\n16: t15\n\n17: t31\n\n18: t16\n\n19: t35\n\n20: t33\n\n21: t34\n\n22: t14\n\nWait, wait, the string has 22 tokens? Let me recount: from the initial input, it's t20 followed by 21 more, making total 22 tokens. Hmm, but in the previous analysis, I thought 21, but now 22. Let me check the original string again.\n\nWait, the string is: `t20 t33 t18 t3 t20 t31 t30 t6 t7 t1 t30 t3 t33 t33 t20 t15 t31 t16 t35 t33 t34 t14`.\n\nCounting each t... that's 22 tokens. So in S, each production is two non-terminals, so we need to split into two parts, each part being a sequence generated by the first and second non-terminals, respectively.\n\nSo the total length of the string is 22, which must be split into two parts, the first generated by NT81 and the second by NT90. Let's see.\n\nLet me find the possible split points. For NT81, let's see what it produces.\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nSo NT81 can derive into NT95 NT9, which are two non-terminals. These would produce two sequences.\n\nSimilarly, NT90 -> NT98 NT55, so that's two non-terminals as well.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated quickly. Let me try to approach this as a tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work backwards from the string. I can try to identify the last symbols and see if they correspond to productions in the grammar.\n\nGiven the string is: t20 t33 t18 t3 t20 t31 t30 t6 t7 t1 t30 t3 t33 t33 t20 t15 t31 t16 t35 t33 t34 t14.\n\nLet's see if the last part comes from NT90, which produces NT98 NT55, which are non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the end is a terminal.\n\nWait, the last token is t14. Let's look for a non-terminal that can produce 't14'. Looking at the grammar, yes: NT90 -> 't14' (since NT90 is part of S -> NT90, and in the production, NT90 -> 't14').\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the productions, NT90 is in S -> NT90. And NT90 -> 't14' is one of the productions. So NT90 can directly produce 't14'.\n\nSo, that means the last symbol in the string is 't14', which could be the result of NT90 being directly expanded to 't14'. So that would mean the second part of S (the part generated by NT90) is just 't14', so the split must happen before the last symbol, so the second part has length 1.\n\nWait, but the string has 22 symbols. If the second part is 't14', which is one symbol, then the first part must be the first 21 symbols, generated by NT81.\n\nWait, but that's a lot. Let me verify: S -> NT81 NT90. So the first part is generated by NT81, which must produce 21 symbols, and the second part by NT90, which produces 1 symbol.\n\nHmm, but NT81's productions are NT95 NT9. So NT81 starts with NT95 and NT9.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions: NT95 has multiple options, such as NT37 NT18, NT25 NT60, etc"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for maybe the start symbol producing a terminal, but here everything seems to be non-terminals until the end.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string provided: `t0 t33 t16 t35 t33 t1 t14 t30 t23 t18 t34 t5 t10 t13 t22 t23 t23 t10 t34 t16 t24 t10`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The grammar's right-hand sides consist of combinations of non-terminals that expand into these terminals. So, I need to see if the string can be derived by successively expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I can try to decompose the string into the possible rules from the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, the string must be a left derivation (or right, depending on the parsing strategy). But given that the grammar is in CNF, the derivations are more structured.\n\nI can try building the parse tree from left to right. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which only has one production: S -> NT81 NT90. So the entire string must come from expanding S into these two non-terminals. So S should be the first two non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, productions are S -> AB, so the string would consist of the concatenation of the expansions of A and B. So the string must be a sequence where the first part comes from the expansion of NT81 and the second part from NT90.\n\nBut the string starts with `t0`, which is a terminal. So let's see which NT can produce t0. Looking through the grammar, in the 't...' rules, I see for example:\n\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking for t0: searching the grammar, I see:\n- NT95 -> 't0' ?

Let me parse the grammar carefully.\n\nWait the grammars are written as, for example:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nand also,\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nAh, so NT7 can expand into either NT48 NT35 or 't1'. So any occurrence of 't7' in the string comes from NT7 -> 't7', but in the grammar provided, I don't see 't7' as a terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n\nAh, okay, so 't7' comes from NT88. Similarly, 't0' comes from NT95 via NT95 -> 't0', but wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking for the last lines:\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT60 -> 't24'\nNT12 -> 't35'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't35'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'\nNT25 -> 't15'\nNT43 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT60 -> 't24'\nNT48 -> 't23'\nNT25 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't0'\n\nWait, I think the last few lines might have errors, but in any case, the terminal symbols are things like 't0', 't1', etc. So for example, 't0' is produced by NT95.\n\nSo now, looking at the given string: `t0 t33 t16 t35 t33 t1 t14 t30 t23 t18 t34 t5 t10 t13 t22 t23 t23 t10 t34 t16 t24 t10`.\n\nBreaking it down, the first symbol is 't0', so that must come from a non-terminal that can expand to 't0'.

Wait, in the grammar, the rules for NT13 are:\n\n- NT13 -> NT43 NT22\n- NT13 -> 't15'  (looking through the grammar... perhaps I missed that part)\n\nWait, let me check the full grammar rules again.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a bunch of rules. It seems like each non-terminal symbol is being broken down into two other non-terminals until we reach 't' symbols, which I assume are terminals. So, every production starts with S and eventually leads to a sequence of 't's.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is: `t30 t1 t32 t0 t18 t14 t22 t15 t13 t32 t35 t6 t16 t10 t24 t16 t20 t23 t15 t29 t29 t20 t31`\n\nThat's a lot of 't's and numbers. My first thought is that each 't' represents a terminal symbol, so I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the grammar rules.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90. So the string should start with whatever NT81 and NT90 produce. Looking at the rules, NT81 is defined as NT95 NT9, and NT90 is another non-terminal. Wait, NT90 might be a terminal. Let me check.\n\nOh, wait, looking at the rules, NT90 isn't directly a terminal, but I see NT95 and others. Wait, let me go through the rules systematically.\n\nWait, I should note that the grammar seems to have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Some NTs are being broken down into other NTs, and others are just terminals ending with 't' and a number. For example, NT7 is 't20', NT9 is 't10', etc.\n\nSo, the first step is that S produces NT81 and NT90. Let's look at NT81:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9. So NT81 eventually leads to NT95 and NT9. Now, NT95 is producing more NTs. Wait, NT95 has two rules: one is NT37 NT18 and another is 't0'. So for NT95, we can either produce NT37 NT18 or just 't0'. Similarly, NT9 is 't10'.\n\nSo let's break down NT81. It becomes NT95 NT9. Suppose NT95 is 't0', but wait, looking back at the rules, I see that NT95 is 't13' earlier, no, wait, no\u2014looking back, actually, in the rules, some NTs are terminals. Like NT7 is 't1', another is 't7', etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of all the NTs and their possible derivations.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NTs have rules that are two NTs, while others have a single 't' followed by a number. So each production is either a single terminal (like NT7 -> 't1') or a combination of two NTs.\n\nSo, for example, NT7 has two rules: NT48 NT35 and 't1'. Similarly, NT13 -> 't15' and another rule perhaps.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all the rules:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT12 -> 't35'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT55 -> 't31'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nWait, wait. Hmm, notice that some NTs have more than one production. For example, NT7 has two rules: one is NT48 NT35, the other is 't1'. So NT7 can produce either NT48 NT35 or just 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 has two rules: one is NT25 NT60, and another is 't13', then another is 't0'? Wait, no, looking back, the rule is NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT95 -> 't13'? Or wait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nWait, so NT95 can be either NT25 NT60 or 't0'. Similarly, NT7 has two options: NT48 NT35 or 't1'.\n\nSo, to analyze the string, we have to work backwards from the string to see if we can trace back through the NT productions.\n\nThe string is: t30, t1, t32, t0, t18, t14, t22, t15, t13, t32, t35, t6, t16, t10, t24, t16, t20, t23, t15, t29, t29, t20, t31.\n\nThat's 21 tokens. Let's see if it's possible to split this sequence into the correct NT productions.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT81 NT90. So the string should start with what NT81 and NT90 produce.\n\nLooking at NT81: it's NT95 NT9. NT9 is 't10'? Wait, no:\n\nWait, NT9 -> 't10'... looking at the rules, yes, in the grammar, NT9 is 't10'. So NT81 is NT95 NT9, which would be NT95 't10'.\n\nWait, no, because NT95 can be either 't0' or NT25 NT60, and NT9 is always 't10'.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that NT81 is NT95 NT9. So, the output of NT81 is the concatenation of NT95 and NT9.\n\nSo, the first part of S is NT81, which becomes NT95 followed by NT9. Since NT9 is always 't10', the first symbol after processing S would be 't10'. But wait, the first token in the string is 't30', not 't10'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So if S->NT81 NT90, and NT81 is NT95 NT9, and NT9 is 't10', the first symbol in the string should be 't10', but the string starts with 't30', so that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NT81 rule. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe grammar is written as S -> NT81 NT90\n\nThen NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nSo, when S is expanded, it's NT81 followed by NT90.

Wait, do all NTs have productions? Let me check:\n\nFrom the list, I see NT86 -> NT51 NT37, NT90 is present but I don't see it being broken down into NTs. So maybe NT90 is a terminal. But in the given grammar, is there any rule for NT90?\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT90 being defined. The rules list ends at some NT95, etc. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, the top-level rules are given, but when I look through the list, I don't see any production for NT90.

The grammar has several non-terminals, each of which can be rewritten into two other non-terminals. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols representing the actual string being checked.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the grammar works. Each non-terminal (like S, NT98, etc.) can expand into two other non-terminals. Since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the bottom-level productions where a non-terminal directly expands into a terminal.\n\nI need to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals until only terminals remain, matching the string exactly.\n\nLooking at the string: `t35 t29 t16 t15 t7 t0 t24 t30 t34 t31 t6 t35 t3 t5 t0 t18 t33 t5 t3 t23 t31 t20 t5`.\n\nI notice that it's all lowercase 't's followed by numbers, which suggests each is a terminal symbol that doesn't expand further. So, the string is a series of terminals, each of which must correspond to the terminal productions of the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols in the grammar to see if they match the string. Looking through the productions, the terminals are:\n- t1, t2, t3, ..., t35, etc., but specifically from the given grammar, I can collect all terminals:\n  From the productions, NT7 expands to t1, t20, t24, t35, etc. Wait, actually, let me list each terminal production.\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n- NT7 \u2192 t1 (and from other rules, like NT77 \u2192 t34, NT35 \u2192 t18, NT55 \u2192 t67 (t67 is a terminal? Wait, no\u2014 looking at NT67 \u2192 't15', so that's a terminal. Let me make a list:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT7 \u2192 t24 (from NT74 \u2192 t31 t83, but wait, no\u2014 let me check each rule carefully.\n\nI might have to list all non-terminals and their direct terminal expansions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1 (from NT74 rule?) Wait, no, let me go step by step:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals and their production rules, every time a non-terminal is on the left, its right-hand side is two non-terminals. The exceptions are when a non-terminal is directly a terminal symbol, but in this grammar, all productions seem to split into two non-terminals except for some cases where an NT might expand into a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, most non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, but I see some cases where it might expand into a terminal, like:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't3' (so that's a terminal rule)\nSimilarly, NT98 \u2192 't31'\nNT20 \u2192 't16'\nNT90 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo some non-terminals directly expand into single terminals. That's important.\n\nSo to reconstruct the string, I need to see if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal production, and whether they can be linked through the production rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each token can be derived directly or via the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can work backwards from the string, using the grammar to see if each token can be replaced with a sequence that fits the grammar.\n\nGiven that, the string is a list of terminal symbols. To see if it's derived from S, we can attempt to parse it using the grammar, but since parsing is complex, maybe it's better to see if the string can be split into production steps.\n\nBut considering that the string is quite long, this might take a while. Alternatively, I can try to analyze each symbol in the string and see if it can be matched by any of the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt35, t29, t16, t15, t7, t0, t24, t30, t34, t31, t6, t35, t3, t5, t0, t18, t33, t5, t3, t23, t31, t20, t5.\n\nEach of these should correspond to a terminal that can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet me collect all the terminals from the grammar:\n\nFrom NT7: t1, t24, t31, t35, t43, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all terminals:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1, t20, t24, t35 (from NT77, NT7's rules, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let's list all terminal symbols present in the grammar:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1', 't16', 't20', 't24', 't35', 't43', 't55', 't3'\nLooking through each production:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' (from NT77)\nNT7 \u2192 't24' (from NT74)\nNT20 \u2192 't16' (direct)\nNT7 \u2192 't20' (from NT35's rule)\nWait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps the terminals are all the 't's with numbers in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me look at all the 't... ' symbols in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all production rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT77, which I think was an earlier mistake. Wait, perhaps I should list all the direct terminal productions:\n\nFrom the given list:\n\nLooking at each production, when a non-terminal appears on the right-hand side as a terminal symbol, it's denoted by a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1 (but wait, looking at the given production list, I don't see that.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, breaking down the grammar. It looks like all rules are left-regular, meaning each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except the ones that directly produce terminals. So, every production is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of t's with numbers. Each tX is a terminal symbol, I think, because they don't appear on the left side of any production. So, the start symbol is S, and we need to see if this string can be derived by expanding S and matching the terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S -> NT81 NT90. So, the string must start with a derivation that expands NT81 and NT90. Let me see what each of these produces.\n\nChecking NT81: From the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So, the first part would be NT95 and NT9. And NT9 is directly 't10', which is in the string. So, NT9 would produce 't10'.\n\nNow, NT95: Looking at the grammar, NT95 has two rules: NT95 -> NT25 NT60 and NT95 -> NT55 NT37. Since NT95 appears twice, I might need to check which one aligns with the string. Wait, the string starts with 't24', so let me see what each option for NT95 produces.\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60: Let's see what NT25 and NT60 give. NT25 -> NT15 (from NT25 -> NT51 NT... Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the grammar for NT25 is: NT25 -> NT51 NT37. And NT51's rules are NT51 -> NT67 NT37. Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost here. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to trace a possible derivation starting from S.\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nSo, NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nAnd NT90 -> ? Let me check what NT90 is. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT90 directly defined except as the end of S. Wait, NT90's production isn't listed except as part of S. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see a production for NT90 except in S. Is that correct? Or did I miss it?\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90. Then, looking for NT90's production. Scanning through the rules, I don't see NT90 on the left side. So does that mean NT90 is a terminal or is it undefined? Wait, that can't be. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nOh, no, I see that all non-terminals are on the left of the productions, except perhaps some are terminals. But looking through the rules, all the non-terminals (like NT81, NT90, etc.) appear only on the left. Wait, that can't be because the RHS must be terminals or other non-terminals. But wait, some of these rules have terminals on the RHS, like NT7 -> 't1' etc.\n\nWait, so each non-terminal (NTx) either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every time a non-terminal is on the left, its production is defined as either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT7 -> 't1' is a terminal production, so when we reach NT7, it just produces 't1'.\n\nBack to NT90. Since in the initial rule, S has NT90, and NT90 isn't defined as a production (since there's no 'NT90 -> ...' in the grammar), this might be a problem. Wait, perhaps the grammar was mistyped, or I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, I have:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90.\n\nCheck if any other production includes NT90. I don't see it. So, that's a problem because NT90 isn't defined anywhere. So, perhaps S can't be reached because NT90 is undefined. Or maybe it's a typo, and perhaps it's supposed to be NT98 or another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the grammar entries:\n\nNT81: NT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nWait, that's the only production for NT81. NT90 is S's production. Are there any other NT90 production? I don't see. So NT90 is a terminal, which it's not, but wait, in the initial production of S, S would need to expand into NT81 and NT90, which would require NT90 to be a terminal or a non-terminal with a production.\n\nBut in the grammar, there's no production for NT90, so I think it's a problem. Wait, perhaps that's a typo in the user input or in the initial grammar provided, but assuming it's correct, then the grammar isn't valid because S -> NT81 NT90 where NT90 isn't defined.\n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the grammar again carefully.\n\nThe grammar as given is:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90.\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39.\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82.\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88.\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74.\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26.\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83.\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77.\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88.\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18.\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37.\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28.\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55.\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13.\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60.\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37.\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55.\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35.\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT12 -> 't30'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT55 -> 't31'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nNT86 -> 't32'\n\nNT39 -> 't33'\n\nNT88 -> 't7'\n\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\n\nNT43 -> 't20'\n\nNT13 -> 't15'\n\nNT60 -> 't24'\n\nNT12 -> 't35'\n\nNT69 -> 't34'\n\nNT51 -> 't32'\n\nNT48 -> 't23'\n\nNT25 -> 't5'\n\nNT9 -> 't6'\n\nNT43 -> 't1'\n\nNT13 -> 't0'\n\nNT28 -> 't34'\n\nNT60 -> 't5'\n\nNT48 -> 't29'\n\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nNT83 -> 't23'\n\nNT90 -> 't14'\n\nNT7 -> 't20'\n\nNT98 -> 't24'\n\nWait, that last line about NT90 -> 't14' is a problem because earlier it's part of S -> NT81 NT90, and now it's said that NT90 -> 't14'. So that would make sense. So S would produce NT81 -> ... and NT90 -> 't14'.\n\nSo, in that case, the initial production S -> NT81 NT90 would expand into NT81 producing some symbols and NT90 producing 't14'.\n\nSo, the first step in the string is 't24 t32 t5 t30...', but according to S, the first part is NT81 and NT90, which produce their own components.

{"custom_id":"request-443","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate whether it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, each with exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. My task is to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is doing. I'll look at the production rules. All the non-terminals start with 'NT' followed by two digits, like NT7, NT9, etc. The right-hand sides of these rules are combinations of other NT rules or literals. For example, NT7 starts as NT48 NT35. Each production eventually leads down to a terminal symbol 't' followed by a number, or some other NT that breaks down further.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's with numbers: `t6 t13 t18 t32 t15 t16 t32 t1 t24 t24 t18 t14 t14 t29 t7 t22 t7 t23 t20 t30 t16 t24 t35 t15`.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two non-terminals. So, to parse the string, I can think of it as a binary tree where each node is either a terminal (if it's one of the 'tN') or a production rule. The question is, can I break down the string into a sequence that matches all the rules starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT81 NT90. So, the first step is that the string must be split into two parts that each can be generated by NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the start, the string begins with 't6', which is a terminal. So, I need to see if any production rule directly produces 't6'. Looking through the rules, NT7 produces 't1', NT69 't34', NT43 't1', NT13 't15', NT9 ... wait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal symbols from the grammar.\n\nLooking at each production, the terminal symbols (tN) are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT13 \u2192 t15\n- NT18 \u2192 t16\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\n- NT24 \u2192 t20\n- NT26 \u2192 t25, but wait, I see NT26 has multiple productions. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, a production can only go to two non-terminals, right? So, all the rules are non-terminals on the right.\n\nSo, the actual terminal outputs are:\n\nLooking at each 'tN' at the end of each production:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT13 \u2192 t15\n- NT18 \u2192 t16\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\nWait, that can't be. Let me go through each rule:\n\nWait, for each rule:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT77 \u2192 t34? Because I see NT77 in a production that leads to t34. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe production for NT7 is actually: NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, and eventually, I think NT48 leads to t23 and NT35 leads to t18, but that's the process.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the actual terminal symbols that appear in the right-hand sides. The string given has 't6', 't13', etc. Wait, I need to check if any non-terminals in the grammar produce 't6'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nWait, in the production rules, some non-terminals produce literals. For example:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't32', 't6', 't23', 't13', 't8', etc.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT82 \u2192 NT51 NT13\nNT51 \u2192 NT25 NT37\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me list all the rules where a non-terminal is followed by a literal.\n\nLooking through each production, the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a combination leading to a literal. So, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 \u2192 which eventually leads to t1.\n\nWait, perhaps the production rules that directly produce literals are:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't32'\nNT32 \u2192 't32'? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Wait, some rules end in literals, like:\n\nLooking through all the rules again:\n\nNT86 \u2192 't32'\nNT26 \u2192 't25'\nWell, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. The production rules where non-terminals produce literals are:\n\nLooking for any rule that has a terminal symbol on the RHS.\n\nWait, the problem is that in the given rules, most of the RHS are two non-terminals. So, for example, NT7 is NT48 NT35, but those are further down. The only rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal are, for example:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't24'\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\nNT37 \u2192 't9'\nWait, looking back: Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the rules where a non-terminal on the RHS leads directly to a 't' symbol.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83 \u2192 no literal.\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77 \u2192 77 is a literal, but 12 is not. So, no.\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88 \u2192 51 and 88 are non-terminals.\n- Wait, perhaps I need to look through all the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently.\n\nThe string given is: t6 t13 t18 t32 t15 t16 t32 t1 t24 t24 t18 t14 t14 t29 t7 t22 t7 t23 t20 t30 t16 t24 t35 t15.\n\nWait, I see 't6' as the first symbol. But is 't6' a terminal that appears in any production? Looking through the rules, I see that NT9 \u2192 't10', but 't6' isn't directly produced. Hmm, perhaps 't6' is produced indirectly. For example, let's trace how a non-terminal can produce 't6'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT25 \u2192 't15' (from NT26). Wait, looking again: The production rules include:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88. Both are non-terminals. So that might not help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each production for if it directly produces any of the 't's in the string.\n\nLooking for:\n\n- 't6' is in the string. Is there any production rule that directly has 't6' as the RHS? From the given rules, I see NT51 \u2192 NT25 NT37, but not sure.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I should list all the rule RHS that are literals. The rules provided include:\n\nLooking through all rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 \u2192 no literal.\n- NT82 includes 't32', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, let me spot all the 'tNs':\n\nNT82 \u2192 't32', 't6', 't23', 't13', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT74 \u2192 't31', 't83', etc.\n\nLooking at all the right-hand sides, the only literals are the 't' symbols.\n\nSo, looking for any NT rules that directly produce 'tN' in the string.\n\nWait, for example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1: So any production that eventually leads to NT7 can produce 't1'.\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT18 \u2192 't16'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT24 \u2192 't20'\n- NT26 \u2192 't25'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT37 \u2192 't9'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1', 't23', 't13'\n- NT51 \u2192 't25'\n- NT55 \u2192 't67' and another NT55... Wait, not helpful.\n- NT82 \u2192 't32', 't6', 't23', 't13', 't8', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is 't6', which must come from a production that ends in t6. From the rules, does any NT produce 't6' directly?\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't20'?\nWait, looking at the rules, NT20 is 't18', so I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list for each 'tN"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-466","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has various production rules for non-terminals NT, and some of these non-terminals expand into terminals like 't' followed by numbers or direct terminals like 't3', 't16', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: `t10 t0 t31 t23 t31 t33 t13 t3 t1 t33 t23 t34 t23 t33 t16 t16 t30 t35 t23 t7 t20 t1 t5 t22 t6`.\n\nFirst, I think I should map all the non-terminals to see which terminals they correspond to. Looking at the grammar rules, I can see each non-terminal expands into specific terminals or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT90 \u2192 t14, NT73 (wait, no, looking again, NT90 \u2192 t14). Also, NT82 \u2192 t6, NT39 \u2192 t33, and so on. It seems each NT rule maps directly to a particular terminal or pairs of non-terminals that further expand down the chain.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is short, which should allow for a systematic approach in determining the string's derivation.\n\nI think the best approach here is to see if the string can be split into the correct sequence of productions. Each terminal in the string must correspond to either a direct terminal production or the result of expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, but the given string is a list of terminals, so we need to see if that sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to construct the parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the leaves of the tree match the string. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the start is S = NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, the string has 25 tokens, and each application of a production rule in S would split it into two parts if we have to expand non-terminals. Alternatively, since each rule is binary, we might need to consider which non-terminals in the grammar produce which strings.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern or a way to break down the string based on the given rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t10. I need to find which NT rule produces t10. Scanning the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT12 \u2192 t35\nNT31 \u2192 t35\nNT67 \u2192 t15\nNT9 \u2192 t10\n\nOh, so NT9 \u2192 t10. So the first term t10 comes from NT9, which is straightforward.\n\nNext, the second token is t0. Let me check which NT produces t0. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT90 \u2192 t14\nNT25 \u2192 t15\nNT51 \u2192 t5\nLooking deeper, NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, and looking at the rules further down:\n\nWait, maybe I should list all NT rules that produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at all the grammar rules, the direct terminal productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT9 \u2192 t10\nNT12 \u2192 t35\nNT13 \u2192 t15\nNT16 \u2192 t16?

Wait, looking for direct terminals.\n\nLooking at each production rule:\n\n- NT90 \u2192 t14 (so NT90 \u2192 t14)\n- NT86 \u2192 t32 (so NT86 \u2192 t32)\n- NT39 \u2192 t33\n- NT88 \u2192 t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT82 \u2192 t6 (so NT82 \u2192 t6)\n- NT43 \u2192 t20\n- NT25 \u2192 t15 (NT25 \u2192 t15)\n- NT86 \u2192 t32\n- NT31 \u2192 t35 (NT31 \u2192 t35)\n- NT74 \u2192 t31\n- NT67 \u2192 t15\n- NT55 \u2192 t67 and then NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, which then NT67 \u2192 t15, NT55 \u2192 t67, but not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps some NTs are not directly producing terminals but non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. So I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string that I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm. Okay, the grammar is presented with production rules, each starting with something like S -> NT81 NT90, which means the start symbol S is replaced by two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. I remember that Chomsky normal form typically has production rules where the left side has two non-terminals or a terminal, but sometimes it's split into multiple steps.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how the string `t35 t33 t7 t29 t34 t3 t5 t30 t18 t14 t24 t10 t32 t13 t24 t1 t31 t29 t6 t16 t10 t22 t32 t34 t0` relates to the grammar. The string seems to be a sequence of t's followed by numbers, which are probably the right-hand sides of the production rules. So each tX probably represents a terminal symbol, where X is a number.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are like NT7, NT81, etc. The terminals are things like 't35', 't7', etc. Each production rule combines either two non-terminals (like S -> NT81 NT90) or a non-terminal expanded into two terminals or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so the grammar must generate that string when all non-terminals are expanded into terminals. So I need to see if there's a way to derive this string by expanding the non-terminals step by step until only terminals are left.\n\nThis might get complicated because the string is 25 elements long, and the grammar is a bit involved. Maybe I should try to see if the string can be built by following the production rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and see if I can break it down into parts that match the grammar. For example, the string starts with t35 and t33. Let me look at the grammar for any rule that produces t35.\n\nIn the grammar, NT35 production is NT37 -> NT9 NT82. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nWait, no, that's not NT35. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the production rules are:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules where the right-hand side is two non-terminals because the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice that many of them produce two non-terminals, but some produce a terminal. For example:\n\nNT7 -> 't1' \u2192 so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT82 -> 't3' etc.\n\nSo the terminals are when the production rule results in a single terminal symbol like 't35', or when a non-terminal is replaced by two terminals, but in Chomsky normal form, each step can only produce two non-terminals, so I think perhaps the terminal symbols are those that appear directly on the right-hand side without any non-terminals, meaning that each terminal is the result of a production that isn't split further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that each production either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals, and the string is a sequence of terminals. So to generate the string, we need to find a derivation where each non-terminal in the string is replaced by either a terminal or a combination that leads to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree from the string upwards, using the grammar rules to see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be viewed as a sequence of symbols that can be grouped using the grammar rules.\n\nLet's consider the string and see if it can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t35 t33 t7 t29 t34 t3 t5 t30 t18 t14 t24 t10 t32 t13 t24 t1 t31 t29 t6 t16 t10 t22 t32 t34 t0.\n\nI think that to check this, I need to see which parts of the string can be derived from non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the initial productions, S is NT81 NT90. So the entire string should be derived from S. Alternatively, maybe the string is the entire output of the grammar.\n\nSo, assuming that, let's see:\n\nS produces NT81 NT90. So the string should consist of two parts, each of which is the expansion of NT81 and NT90, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it starts with something that can be divided into two parts that correspond to NT81 and NT90.\n\nThe string is: t35 t33 t7 t29 t34 t3 t5 t30 t18 t14 t24 t10 t32 t13 t24 t1 t31 t29 t6 t16 t10 t22 t32 t34 t0.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the string as a binary tree where each split corresponds to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to compute the parse tree bottom-up or top-down. Since the string is quite long, perhaps I can split it into parts.\n\nLet me list the string's components as symbols: [t35, t33, t7, t29, t34, t3, t5, t30, t18, t14, t24, t10, t32, t13, t24, t1, t31, t29, t6, t16, t10, t22, t32, t34, t0].\n\nI think a better approach is to look for terminals that match the right-hand side of the grammar rules.\n\nFor instance, NT7 -> 't1' as a production. So in the string, when I see 't1', it corresponds to NT7.\n\nSimilarly, looking through the terminals:\n\nt35: let's find which non-terminal produces t35. Looking through the rules, I see NT35 -> NT12 NT77. But wait, that's producing two non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps t35 is created by a different production. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Because in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking back: For example, the production NT7 -> 't1' is a terminal. Similarly, NT82 -> 't3' is a terminal.\n\nBut for NT35, in the rules, it is NT35 -> NT12 NT77. That's producing two non-terminals, not a terminal. So 't35' must come from some other production where NT35 produces a terminal, but I don't see one. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all the production rules on the right-hand side are either non-terminals (e.g., NTx NTy) or a single non-terminal. Wait, no, I think I misread the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT7 -> 't1' is a production rule. So NT7 can produce 't1', which is a terminal. Similarly, other rules like NT82 -> 't3' allow NT82 to produce 't3'.\n\nBut for rules like NT37 -> NT9 NT82, that means NT37 can produce two non-terminals, which in turn can produce more.\n\nSo, in the string, any occurrence of a terminal symbol must correspond directly to a production rule of a non-terminal that produces that terminal.\n\nTherefore, for each terminal in the string, I should check if that terminal is the result of a production rule of some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t35, t33, t7, t29, etc.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- t35: Looking through the rules, I see that NT35 -> NT12 NT77. But is there any production that results in 't35' as a terminal? I don't see any, which makes me think that perhaps the string has a terminal that isn't allowed, which would make it impossible for the grammar to generate it. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, I think I need to double-check. Looking at the rules again, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me go through each production rule and see if any of them result in a terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S -> NT81 NT90\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT90 beyond the initial rule. It's only S that has NT90.\n\nWait, let me check again. The initial S rule is S -> NT81 NT90, and NT90 isn't further expanded in the rules provided. So is that the case? That would mean that the production for NT90 is only that rule, but that's not possible because context-free grammars require that each non-terminal has at least one production.

Wait, but NT51 also produces other things. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT51 -> NT48 NT22.\n\nSo 't22' is part of NT51's production. But 't29' comes from NT48, which is 't34 t32' from NT69 and NT74. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let's approach this by trying to parse the string top-down, starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with t29. Let's see how that can be generated. Looking at the rules, 't29' is produced by:\n\n- NT48: because NT48 -> 't29', according to the rule NT48 -> 't29'\u2014no, wait, checking the rules, I don't see NT48 producing 't29'. Wait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nWait, I see NT48 -> NT69 NT74, which are two non-terminals. Then, NT69 is a terminal 't34', and NT74 is 't32', so NT48 produces 't34 t32'. So 't29' isn't directly produced by any rule except perhaps by a non-terminal that eventually expands to 't29'.\n\nWait, so maybe 't29' is produced by NT51? Wait, NT51's rule is NT51 -> NT48 NT22, so it's 't29' followed by NT22, which is 't22'. So if the string has t29 t22 somewhere, that makes sense.\n\nBut in the given string, after t29 comes t14.

The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, like 't29', 't10', etc. Non-terminals are the ones starting with 'NT' like 'NT82', 'NT60', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t29 t10 t14 t5 t23 t13 t1 t30 t1 t13 t14 t18 t32 t7 t0 t24 t35 t6 t5 t20 t30 t18 t10 t5 t10 t22`. I notice there are 26 tokens here, each separated by spaces. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. Each step reduces the number of symbols by one, replacing a non-terminal with two symbols. So, starting from S, which expands to two non-terminals, each level doubles the number of symbols until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe key is to check if the string can be derived by the grammar. I'll start by looking at the starting symbol S, which produces NT81 NT90. So the string must start with the symbols that come from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81, from the grammar, I see that NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Similarly, NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88. So, S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 NT95 NT9 NT51 NT88. That makes four symbols. Each of these may need to produce more.\n\nBut the string starts with 't29', which is a terminal. So I need to see if any of the possible productions of the initial symbols can produce 't29'.\n\nLooking back at NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT29 is not among them. Wait, actually, let me check the grammar. Looking for the left-hand side that leads to 't29'. Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88, and also other rules, but I don't see an immediate production for 't29'. Wait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n't1', 't10', 't14', 't15', 't16', 't18', 't20', 't23', 't24', 't29', 't30', 't31', 't32', 't33', 't34', 't35', 't37', 't39', 't43', 't48', 't51', 't55', 't60', 't67', 't74', 't77', 't82', 't86', 't88', 't90', 't95', 't98'.\n\nLooking at 't29', I see that NT86 \u2192 't51' and 't37' in the production. No, wait, the right-hand side of NT86 is 't32' and 't37'? No, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT86 has two productions:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88,\n\nand also, looking again, another rule for NT86: NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nand\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nBut also, looking in the terminal rules, I don't see 't86' as a terminal. All the terminals are 't' followed by a number. So 't86' isn't a terminal, which makes me think the production rules for NT86 are not leading directly to terminals but rather non-terminals.\n\nSo, when the string has 't29', we need to find a non-terminal that can produce it via two steps. Let's look for NT82, which has a production to 't6' and 't5'. Wait, no, looking for 't29':\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see that NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55, but that's not helpful for 't29'. Wait, let me check all rules again:\n\nLooking for a rule where a non-terminal produces 't29' plus something. Hmm, maybe NT45? No, not in the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps NT25 is involved in producing 't29'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55. Not helpful. NT55 is in a rule: NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37. No. NT67 \u2192 NT35 NT37. Hmm, not getting 't29' here.\n\nWait, perhaps NT82's productions could lead to 't29'? But I don't see 't29' in NT82's rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT82's productions:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 't18'\n- NT82 \u2192 't32'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (same as before)\n- Wait, looking again: \n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\n\nNT82 -> 't18'\n\nNT82 -> 't32'\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nAh, here's NT82's productions:\n\nLooking back, yes, NT82 has three rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't18'\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't32' (I think I missed this one before)\n\nAnd another rule:\n\nNT82 is also produced by NT39: NT39 \u2192 't33'\n\nWait, but the main point is that NT82 has a rule that produces 't6', 't18', and 't32'. So 't29' isn't directly produced by NT82. But maybe by another non-terminal that eventually leads to 't29'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, perhaps NT48? Let's check NT48's rules:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT23 NT51\n\nBut 't29' isn't directly produced by any of these.\n\nWait, perhaps NT43 has a rule that could produce 't29'. Let me check:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT15 NT35\n\nAnd NT35 \u2192 't18'\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking again:\n\nNT43's rules:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT25 NT35\n\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n\n- Also, NT43 \u2192 't1' in some rule?\n\nNo, the grammar shows:\n\nNT43 -> NT25 NT35\n\nand\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\n\nand\n\nNT43 -> 't1'\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, yes, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't1'\n\nSo that means NT43 could directly produce 't1', but that's not helping with 't29'.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach. Let's see: The string starts with 't29'. So, can any of the non-terminals directly produce 't29'? Or does one produce a sequence that starts with 't29'?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S must produce a sequence that starts with 't29', but looking at S's production:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo the first symbol is either 't...' or 'n...'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't29', so the initial production must generate that. Wait, but S is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the left side is a non-terminal, and on the right, there's NT81 and NT90. So for the string to start with 't29', one of NT81 or NT90 must produce 't29' as the first symbol, but wait, non-terminals produce two symbols each time.\n\nWait, no, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So the initial expansion would be S \u2192 NT81 NT90, meaning the string would start with whatever NT81 produces at the start,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

However, I notice some entries in the grammar have terminals, but I'm not sure if they're always only single characters.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So every string generated by this grammar will start with something derived from NT81 and NT90. Each of these non-terminals seems to produce two other non-terminals, except maybe some that produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate has several parts, like 't30', which I think corresponds to a production like NT30 \u2192 t30. But from the given grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 't30', so NT12 is a non-terminal that directly translates to 't30'. That's useful because 't30' must come from NT12 in the derivation.\n\nSo the string starts with 't30', which comes from NT12. Looking at the grammar, NT12 \u2192 't30' only. That means NT12 must be the start of some production. Wait, in the grammar, the start symbol is S, so how is NT12 derived? Hmm, maybe NT12 is part of the expansion of a higher non-terminal. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT12 \u2192 't30', but NT69 also has a production involving NT12. Specifically, NT69 \u2192 NT51 NT88, but I don't see NT12 in any other higher productions. Wait, actually, NT12 is also used in NT60 and NT48. Let me see:\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55, among others. Wait, but NT12 isn't directly a parent of any higher non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to trace how NT12 is derived. If NT12 is part of the string, 't30', it can only come from NT12 \u2192 't30', which is the only production for NT12. So that means in the derivation, somewhere there must be a step where a non-terminal expands to NT12, which then becomes 't30'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT12 only has the production NT12 \u2192 't30'. So it must be a terminal itself. That suggests that in the overall derivation, the start symbol S must expand to a tree that eventually produces a substring with NT12.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the start rule produces two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. So any string generated must start with NT81 and NT90 expanded. So the string must start with something from NT81 and something from NT90.\n\nIn the given string, the first token is 't30' which is 't30'. But 't30' is only from NT12. So how can NT81 or NT90 produce 't30'? That's the first thing I'm confused about.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's check each production for terminal symbols. I see NT7 \u2192 't1', NT77 \u2192 't34', NT39 \u2192 't33', etc. There are many non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal. So, for example, NT25 \u2192 't15', NT60 \u2192 't5', NT74 \u2192 't31', and so on.\n\nSo the approach here is to see if the given string can be broken down into a sequence of terminal symbols that correspond to expansions of the non-terminals in the grammar, following the production rules.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step. The string is: t30 t29 t35 t32 t3 t29 t35 t18 t31 t18 t33 t35 t10 t6 t3 t14 t18 t15 t16 t14 t10 t14 t32 t34 t6 t34 t18.\n\nI'll process each token and see if I can find a production path leading to each. Let's start with the first token t30.\n\nt30 comes from NT12 \u2192 t30. So, in the derivation, somewhere there's an NT12 that expands to t30.\n\nBut how does NT12 get into play? Let's look at the grammar again. NT12 is a non-terminal, but in the given grammar, I only see NT12 \u2192 t30. Are there any productions that derive NT12 from other non-terminals?\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 t15, NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55, but not NT12. Wait, looking again, is there any production that includes NT12 as a child?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t30\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n\nAh, here we go. NT35 can be expanded to NT12 NT77. So, if a derivation step expands NT35, it could produce NT12, which then becomes t30.\n\nSo perhaps the string's origin starts with NT35 being expanded to NT12 and NT77, leading to t30 from NT12.\n\nBut let me check where NT35 comes from. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that creates NT35. Wait, perhaps it's created from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's trace this. Let's try to see if t30 can be part of a larger string. The string starts with t30, which is NT12. So in the derivation, there's a step where NT12 is produced, perhaps as part of another non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals have a production that includes NT12?\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT77 \u2192 t34\n- NT39 \u2192 t33\n- NT82 \u2192 t3\n- NT25 \u2192 t15\n- NT48 \u2192 t23\n- NT29 \u2192 t32\n- NT20 \u2192 t16\n- NT74 \u2192 t31\n- NT35 \u2192 t18\n- NT55 \u2192 t6\n- NT95 \u2192 t13\n- NT60 \u2192 t5\n- NT67 \u2192 t15\n- NT95 \u2192 t0\n- NT95 \u2192 t5 (wait, no, that's a duplicate)\nWait, looking again. Let's list all the productions to find where NT12 appears on the left-hand side.\n\nAh, here it is: NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77 is the production where NT12 appears on the left. So NT35 can be expanded into NT12 and NT77. Additionally, NT12 can produce t30 directly.\n\nSo, if the derivation is such that a non-terminal produces NT35, which then splits into NT12 and NT77, the first part would be t30 from NT12 and whatever comes from NT77.\n\nWait, but the entire string starts with t30. So if the entire string is starting with t30, that would imply that the first non-terminal to expand is NT35, because that's the only production that includes NT12, and NT12 \u2192 t30.\n\nBut then, the derivation for t30 starts with NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77. So that's a step where NT35 expands into two non-terminals: NT12 and NT77. But in the string, the next part after t30 is t29, so is there a way that NT77 produces something that leads to t29?\n\nWait, NT77 \u2192 t34. That's the only production for NT77. So the second token is t29, but NT77 can't produce t29, as its only production is t34. So that seems to be a problem. That would mean the string cannot be generated because after t30 comes t34, but the string has t29 next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. Let's think of the entire string as a sequence, and each token must come from a terminal derived from a non-terminal. So perhaps the string should be broken down as a sequence of non-terminals that when expanded, produce the given tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by expanding the start symbol S, which branches into NT81 and NT90.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, all the NT... symbols expand into two non-terminals except for some that end with 't', which are terminals.\n\nThe string to check is: `t24 t16 t1 t20 t30 t1 t23 t35 t24 t6 t22 t10 t7 t32 t13 t29 t18 t6 t15 t15 t18 t33 t30 t33 t33 t16 t0`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is defined as S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts since S generates two symbols, each of which must come from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is 't24' and the last word is 't0'. The middle seems to have a lot of words, so I need to figure out how to split it into two halves, but since it's all connected without spaces, it's a single sequence. That complicates things because each production in the grammar adds exactly two symbols, except for terminals which add one.\n\nWait, actually, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The stack approach might help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down recursively.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Starting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90, the first symbol must be from NT81, and the last must come from NT90. So the string must be the concatenation of the NT81-derived part and the NT90-derived part.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts. The length is 29 words. Let's see if the first part can be derived from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nFirst, for NT81: The starting point would be the first symbol 't24'. But in the grammar, NT81 is a non-terminal. Let me check if NT81 can produce 't24'. Looking through the productions, I see NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88, and NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55. But wait, NT81 is defined as NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 must derive from NT95 and NT9. So to get 't24', I need to see if any of these can produce 't24'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT95: It has multiple rules, for example, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. Wait, but NT95 also has a production NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. Hmm, but NT25 is another non-terminal. So perhaps we need to trace the derivation.\n\nWait, wait. Let's first list all the terminals in the string to see which ones are present: t24, t16, t1, t20, t30, t6, t22, t10, t7, t32, t13, t29, t18, t33, t35, t23, t30, t33, t33, t33, t16, t0.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT95 can produce 't13' directly (NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT37 \u2192 eventually t13). Also, NT95 can produce 't0' directly (since NT95 \u2192 t0 is a production? Wait, looking back: NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT25 -> NT55, NT60 -> NT98 NT55, but later in the list, I see NT95 -> 't13' and NT95 -> 't0'. So NT95 can produce 't13' or 't0'. So 't24' cannot come from NT95 because NT95's terminals are 't13' and 't0'. Hmm, but that's a problem because the first symbol is 't24', which is in NT86's production (NT86 \u2192 't32' or 't34'), but wait, NT86's production also is more complex.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at each non-terminal and see what terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 't1' or 't20' or 't1' (I think this was mentioned earlier, maybe earlier I said it had 't1' and 't20').\n\nWait, let me list the terminal productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' or 't20'\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\nNT35 \u2192 't18'\nNT95 \u2192 't13' or 't0'\nNT55 \u2192 't6' (wait, does it have 't6'?) Looking at NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37 \u2192 wait, but earlier I think NT55 \u2192 't31' or 't6'? Wait, in the given list, under NT55: 'NT55 -> NT67 NT37', but also under NT48 and others, looking for 't' productions. Wait, perhaps I need to check each rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a table of all non-terminals and check what terminals they can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the initial step, S generates NT81 and NT90. So the string is the concatenation of the derivations of NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo, first part must be derived from NT81, which is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So the first symbol must be the first symbol of NT95 or NT9.\n\nWait, but NT95 can produce 't13' or 't0'. Looking at the string, the first symbol is 't24', which isn't among NT95's terminal options. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated, right? Because NT81 starts with NT95 and NT9.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So the first terminal in the string is 't24'. But NT95 can't derive 't24' because its terminals are 't13' and 't0'. NT9's productions are either 't1' or 't20'. So 't24' is not derivable from NT81, meaning the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Maybe there's a longer derivation. NT95 might produce something that eventually produces 't24' via other rules. But looking through the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly or indirectly produces 't24'. NT86 can produce 't32' and 't34', but that's from NT86, which is another non-terminal. But in this case, the first symbol is 't24', which is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the NT rules given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mislooking. Let me scan all NT rules for terminal 't24'. Scanning through the rules, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't24'. So none of the NT symbols produce 't24' directly. So the first word 't24' is not possible, meaning the string is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But in this case, the start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So each production in the grammar ends with nt numbers or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the non-terminal symbols (NT*) eventually resolve to terminals, which are either 't' followed by a number or specific symbols like 't31', 't5', etc. So every production is a binary split into two non-terminals until we hit a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t22, t18, t6, etc., ending with t7. Since all the non-terminals eventually resolve to a single terminal, each token in the string must correspond to a result of one of the productions.\n\nMy approach is to represent the parsing process as a tree.

So, the first step is that S produces NT81 followed by NT90. That means the input string should ideally start with the symbols generated by NT81 and then NT90. Let me check the string: the first part is t34 t34... Hmm, I need to see which NTs generate t34.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NTs and their productions. For example, NT86 -> NT51 NT88, and NT51 -> t32, so NT86 can generate t32. But t34 seems to come from NT77 -> t34 and NT95 -> t34? Wait, looking back: Oh, no, actually, NT77 is a different symbol. Let me list out all the NTs that produce 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT98 -> t31\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT67 -> t15\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT82 -> t6\nSo, NT95 can eventually produce t31 and t6, but nowhere do I see NT77 or any NT that directly gives t34 except maybe NT7. But wait, looking at the productions, NT7 -> t1. Wait, no, that's not t34. Wait, let me look carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT98 -> t31\n- NT77 -> t34\n- NT74 -> t35\n- NT35 -> t34?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe productions are:\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nBut NT31 is producing t35. Wait, let me check each NT that ends with a 't'.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83; NT83 is a terminal? No, NT83 -> NT95 NT13. So NT83 eventually leads to t34 via NT95 -> NT55 -> NT67 (t15) wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, I think I need to trace which NTs lead to 't' tokens. Let me list them:\n\nLooking for all productions where the right-hand side is two NTs, and through their combinations, they produce the 't' symbols.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83; let's see NT31 -> NT86 NT28. NT86 -> t32. NT28 -> NT60 NT28. NT60 -> NT98 NT55. NT98 is t31, and NT55 -> NT67 NT37. NT67 is t15, NT37 -> NT9 NT82. NT9 is t10, NT82 can be t6 or more rules. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work backwards from the string. Each 't' token must come from one of the NT productions that directly produce 't', or from a longer production that resolves to 't' after several steps.\n\nLooking at each NT in the grammar, I can list which 't's they produce directly:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT77 -> t34\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55; NT98 is t31, NT55 is NT67 NT37, etc. Probably not a direct t.\nWait, maybe I should look for any production that directly starts with 't'. Hmm, no, all the NTs have rules that either split into other NTs or produce 't's.\n\nBut in the initial part of the string, I see t34, which is directly produced by NT77. So the first symbols would have to come from an NT that produces t34, which is NT77 -> t34.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT77 rule except NT74 -> NT31 NT83. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of all NTs that can produce 't's directly. Looking again:\n\n- NT77 -> t34 (directly)\n- NT74 -> ... which steps? Let me see NT74 -> NT31 NT83. Then NT31 -> NT86 NT28. NT86 has rules: NT86 splits into other NTs, which further split until they reach terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT31 -> NT86 NT28\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT88 splits into NT25 NT88, and so on. Wait, this seems too long. Maybe the direct 't's come from other NTs.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at each production, some produce 't's, others don't. For example:\n\n- NT98 -> t31\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37, etc. Probably does not produce 't's directly.\n- NT77 -> t34, so that's a direct t.\n\nSo the string starts with t34, which must come from NT77 -> t34. But looking at the grammar, is that correct? Wait, the grammar has NT77 -> NT74 NT33. Oh wait no, looking back: No, in the grammar provided, I have to check each production.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT77 in the production list except as part of NT74 and others. Let me check the full list again.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of productions, and looking for NTs that directly produce 't's:\n\n- NT98 -> t31\n- NT77 -> t34\n- NT74 has a production that's not directly a 't' but branches into other NTs, which may eventually produce 't's.\n\nSimilarly, NT72 doesn't seem to produce 't's. Maybe NT95 produces some 't's indirectly, but let's see:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60; NT60 -> NT98 NT55. So NT98 is t31, NT55 may end up as something else, but perhaps not 't'.\n\nHmm, maybe the first t34 in the string must come from an NT that directly produces t34, which would be NT77. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT77 rule except maybe a few lines down:\n\nLooking through the productions again, I see:\n\n- NT69 -> t34.\n\nWait, yes, that's right. Let me check: NT69 -> t34. So NT69 can directly produce t34. That makes more sense.\n\nSo the first 't34' in the string must come from NT69, which directly produces it.\n\nNow, in the grammar, S is derived from NT81 and NT90. So the initial split is S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, NT81 must derive a sequence of strings that leads to the rest of the input beyond the first part.\n\nWait, the entire string starts with t34 t34 t5 t30... but if the first part is from NT81, which is split into parts, perhaps NT81 produces two 't's, like t34, but looking at the grammar, NT81 splits into NT95 and NT9, right?

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided consists of a set of production rules. Each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and has two non-terminal symbols on the right. The only terminals in the grammar are strings like 't7', 't15', etc. So, the language consists of sequences of these terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t7 t15 t0 t29 t0 t18 t35 t10 t7 t23 t0 t35 t22 t16 t15 t7 t30 t32 t29 t34 t6 t22 t18 t29 t34 t10 t10 t7 t14`.\n\nLet me write down the production rules first to see the non-terminal nodes:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nWait, that seems a bit complex. Each non-terminal breaks down into other non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminals when they can't be broken down further. So, the plan is to see if the string can be generated by expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nBut looking at the string, it starts with 't7', which I need to see where it comes from. Let's look at which production rules produce 't7'. Looking through the production rules, I see NT86 -> 't32' and 't88', but 't7' is in another rule: NT82 -> 't7' and others. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see several entries where 't7' appears as a terminal:\n\n- NT82 -> 't6', 't22'\n- But wait, looking again: I see NT82 -> 't6' and 't22' in the grammar? Wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a series of lines, each line is a production. Let me look for any NT -> 't...' lines.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I notice:\n\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT26 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT98->'t31' etc.\n\nWait, I see that in the rules, there are multiple instances where NTs produce 't....', including some 't7's.\n\nSpecifically, looking for 't7' in the productions:\n\n- NT82 -> 't7' and 't15' as per one rule? Wait, no, let me find exact lines:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- NT82 -> 't7'\nYes, here:\n\nNT82 -> NT51 NT88\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n...\nLooking at each line, the NT productions are like:\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't7'\n\nSo, for example, NT82 can directly produce 't7'. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes, the line says NT82 -> 't7'. So, any occurrence of NT82 can generate 't7'.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't7 t15 t0 ...' So, the first token is 't7'.\n\nThus, the string must start with 't7', which means it must come from an NT82 production. But the string is a sequence of 't's and 'n's. Wait, the grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90, so the entire string must consist of a sequence of 't's and possibly 'nt's, but I'm not sure. Wait, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are two non-terminals, so each symbol is either a non-terminal that splits into two or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, no, in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nIn the given grammar, every rule on the left is a non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals or in some cases, a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nBut then, looking further, I see:\n\nNT35 -> NT18 't34'\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each production:\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nBut in the rules, some seem to go to terminals directly:\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\nNT82 -> 't7' \u2014 that's a production to a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> 't35'\n\nWait, but I'm not sure all the rules. Let me check a few more:\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT79? No, I think I listed something else.\n\nWait, let's look at the entire list again:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, some of them have terminals:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT26 -> 't35'\nNT82 -> 't7'\nNT95 -> 't13' \u2014 wait, no, in one rule NT95 -> NT25 NT60, but elsewhere:\n\nLooking at NT95 -> NT25 NT60 and NT95 -> NT37 NT18 etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify which NT productions lead to terminals.\n\nIn the given grammar, the right-hand sides of the production rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT7 -> NT48 NT35 (two non-terminals) and NT7 is also a production that may produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no, each production in the grammar is given as A->, and for each, the right-hand side is a sequence of symbols. For example:\n\nS->NT81 NT90\n\nNT81-> NT95 NT9\n\nNT95-> NT25 NT60\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74-> NT31 NT83\n\nNT37-> NT9 NT82\n\nNT86-> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95-> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81-> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31-> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60-> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82-> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95-> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55-> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26-> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7-> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82-> 't3'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the user's provided grammar, some of the rules have terminals on the right, and others have non-terminals. Wait, the user provided grammar is a list of lines, each starting with a symbol and two others. For example:\n\n```\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n...\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT82 -> 't7'\n...\n```\n\nSo, all these are production rules. Each line is of the form A->B C, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, some lines have a terminal, but it's unclear whether that's the case. For example:\n\nNT7 -> 't1' \u2014 that's a terminal.\n\nBut for lines like NT82 -> 't7' \u2014 yes, that would mean NT82 can produce the terminal 't7'.\n\nSo, each NT production can either produce a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. So in the string, each 't' must come from a rule where the NT produces that 't'.\n\nWait, but looking at the string: the first token is 't7', which must come from a production that leads to 't7'. Looking at the rules, I see that NT82 can produce 't7' (looking at NT82 -> 't7'). Wait, no, actually, let me look again.\n\nWait, the user provided rules have lines like NT82 -> 't7' \u2014 no, that's not the case. Looking back:\n\nThe lines are as follows, the user wrote:\n\nFor example, one line is:\n\nNT82 -> 't7'\nWait, no, looking at the user's input: oh, wait, the user has some lines where the rule ends with a terminal, like:\n\n```\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT82 -> 't7'\n...\n```\n\nYes, so some of the NTs can directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-542","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is immediately replaced by NT81 NT90 according to the first production: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. This suggests that the string must be a sequence of tokens generated from expanding NT81 and NT90.\n\nThe provided string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t34 t7 t7 t7 t32 t22 t14 t35 t0 t24 t6 t15 t14 t3 t1 t6 t0 t1 t30 t30 t24 t22 t1 t6 t16 t15 t0 t24 t33`. These seem to be the right-hand sides of the non-terminals or terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the string into a list of tokens for easier handling. The next step is to see if this string can be generated step by step through the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting from S, which splits into NT81 and NT90. Each of these needs to be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT81, according to the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 expands into two non-terminals. Then, looking at NT9, that's a terminal: 't10'? Wait, no. Looking back, the grammar has NT9 \u2192 't9'. Wait, actually, checking the grammar, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me cross-reference the grammar:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, and some lines are cut. For example, under NT9: `NT9 -> 't10'?` Let me check the lines provided.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see lines like:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, and then further down, NT7 is defined as 't1'. So, NT7 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo, let me find NT9. Looking through the provided grammar, I find:\n\n\"NT9 -> 't10'\"\n\nSo, yes, NT9 is a terminal that becomes 't10'.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 is in the grammar: \n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9.\n\nNow, looking at NT95: in the grammar, NT95 can expand in multiple ways. One is NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, another is NT95 \u2192 't13' and another perhaps, earlier in the list:\n\nLooking through, I see NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 't13'. So, NT95 can be a non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, but 't13' is a terminal. So, the last line for NT95 is `NT95 -> 't13'`. So, NT95 can be either NT25 NT60 or directly 't13'.\n\nWait, let me find the definition of NT95:\n\nYes, under NT95: \n\n\"NT95 -> NT25 NT60\"\n\n\"NT95 -> 't13'\"\n\nSo, yes, NT95 has two options: either the non-terminals NT25 and NT60 or the terminal 't13'.\n\nTherefore, expanding NT81: NT95 NT9 \u2192 either (NT25 NT60) NT9 or 't13' 't9'.\n\nWait, but 't9' is a terminal for NT9.\n\nWait, in the string, after t34 and t7, the next tokens are t7 again, but I need to map that.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a detour. Let me think differently. Since the string starts with t34, let me see which non-terminals produce 't34'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see where 't34' occurs. In the grammar lines:\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n\n- NT74 \u2192 't23'?\n\nWait, wait. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the lines, some NT lines end with t followed by a number. For example, under NT25, I see \"NT25 -> 't5'\". Similarly, under NT60: \"NT60 -> 't24'\". And under NT13: \"NT13 -> 't15'\".\n\nLooking through each line, I'm looking for any NT that expands to 't34'. Let's go line by line:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT73\n- Wait, let me look for 't34' specifically. \n\nLooking through each line, I notice that some NTs are defined as terminals:\n\nFor example, NT25 \u2192 t5.\n\nLet me list all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n- NT12 \u2192 t30\n- NT31 \u2192 t35\n- NT60 \u2192 t24\n- NT82 \u2192 t13\n- NT95 \u2192 t13\n- NT43 \u2192 t35\n- NT26 \u2192 t5 (wait, line says NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, but under NT43, it's t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n- NT37 \u2192 t18\n- NT43 \u2192 t1\n- NT51 \u2192 t32\n- NT60 \u2192 t24\n- NT69 \u2192 t34\n- NT25 \u2192 t5 (from earlier line, but wait, in the grammar under NT43, I see NT43 -> NT25 NT60, but under NT43 earlier: lines show NT43 in two places?\n\nWait, I might be complicating this.

Wait, no. Let me check: Oh, in the grammar under NT82, I see:\n\n\"NT82 -> 't3'\"\n\nalso\n\n\"NT82 -> NT51 NT13\"\n\nSo, NT82 can be 't3' or a combination of NT51 and NT13. So, 't3' is produced by NT82.\n\nOther terminals:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 t13\n- NT77 \u2192 t34\n- NT70? Not in the grammar as provided.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the lines, there's NT74 \u2192 t23.\n\nSo the terminals we have are:\n\nt1, t5, t10, t18, t23, t24, t32, t34, t6, t7 (from t7), etc.\n\nWait, in the provided string, we have t34, but looking back, the grammar has NT74 \u2192 t23 and another production for NT74: NT31 NT83. So, that's how 't23' is generated.\n\nAlso, NT77 \u2192 t34.\n\nWait, but I need to check which NTs eventually produce 't34'.\n\nSo, from the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for where t34 is produced:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 t34\n- NT74 \u2192 t23, so no\n- NT25's produce t5\n- NT82 \u2192 t3\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-567","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either a single terminal, a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. That should make things easier because the parsing would be straightforward, I think.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It consists of non-terminals (NT) and terminals (t followed by a number). The string to evaluate starts with t23 and ends with t18, and has 35 tokens in total. Let me count them: t23, t22, t13, t30, t0, t0, t35, t15, t0, t16, t22, t7, t30, t33, t24, t1, t30, t3, t31, t10, t20, t35, t0, t32, t31, t5, t6, t6, t35, t18. Yep, that's 35.\n\nNow, the grammar has non-terminals like S, NT98, NT37, etc., and the terminals are various tX. Each production in the grammar is two non-terminals except for the ones that produce a terminal. So, for example, S -> NT81 NT90. Then NT81 can be NT95 NT90, and so on.\n\nHmm, maybe the string is a sequence built by expanding the non-terminals into terminals. So I can think of it as parsing the string according to the grammar. Let's see if I can trace a possible derivation path.\n\nWait, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, a way to check if the string is generated is to see if it can be broken down into a sequence of rule applications that lead to the string. Since each production has two non-terminals, except for the terminals, it should generate a string where the number of terminals is 2^n -1 for n steps, but in this case, the string's length is 35, which is 2^6 -1 (64-1=63? No, 2^5 is 32, 32-1=31, 2^6=64-1=63). Wait, 35 isn't matching any 2^n -1. Maybe I'm wrong about that, perhaps because the grammar allows some productions to have more than two immediate symbols.\n\nWait, no, Chomsky normal form requires all productions except terminals to have exactly two non-terminals, so the parse tree should have a structure that could lead to the string's length being n where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation plus one. But in this case, the string is 35 tokens, which suggests that the number of nodes in the parse tree is 35, but not necessarily a pure power of two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each derivation step from S would result in more symbols, but the string is built by substituting non-terminals with other non-terminals until all are replaced with terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is better approached by trying to find a path through the grammar that can produce the string. It's a bit time-consuming, but let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t23. Let me see which non-terminal can produce t23. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT43 can produce 't35' and 't1', as well as 't30' in another production. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT43 -> 't35' | ... Wait, the grammar has several entries, like NT48, NT43, etc. Let me list all non-terminals that produce 't...':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT37 -> 't37'? No, wait, the grammar entries may not have 't' unless I check all of them.\n\nWait, let me go through each production and note if they directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT75: Wait, NT75 isn't in the grammar; no, check each line.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-560","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in a structured way with each production starting with a non-terminal and leading to other non-terminals or terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t7 t29 t20 t15 t33 t22 t30 t15 t10 t34 t16 t6 t33 t20 t31 t32 t18 t5 t22 t16 t16 t14 t14 t35 t20 t20 t6 t18 t18 t22`.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse this string from left to right using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step in the parsing should reduce two symbols at a time, except for the initial step where we might start with a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t7`. I need to find which production directly results in `t7`. Scanning the productions, I see that `NT46 -> t7`. Wait, no, the productions are listed with NT followed by numbers. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT46 isn't listed, but looking through, I notice that `NT46` might not be the right one. Alternatively, let me check each rule:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, let me see the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT7 -> 't1', 't20', etc.\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't35'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't0' Wait, that can't be right. Each NT should have only one production.\n\nWait, I see some entries:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each NT only goes to one production except for some that might be duplicated. Wait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT7 appears twice: once as NT7 -> NT48 NT35 and another as NT7 -> 't1'. So, the 't1' is the production for NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT82 has two productions: NT82 -> 't6' and NT82 -> 't33'. Wait, no, looking again, I think I misread it.\n\nWait, let me reconstruct the grammar:\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT12 -> 't35'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT55 -> 't31'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nNT86 -> 't32'\n\nNT39 -> 't33'\n\nNT88 -> 't7'\n\nAh, so NT7 can produce two things: the non-terminal NT48 NT35, or the terminal 't1'. Similarly, NT82 has two: producing NT95 NT13 and 't3'. So, for each step, a non-terminal can be expanded into either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with `t7`. So, the initial step must be applying the production for `t7`. Looking at NT7, it has two options. Wait, no: actually, NT7 is a single non-terminal that can produce either 't1' or NT48 NT35. So, in the string, the first symbol is `t7`. But wait, in the productions, 't7' is not present. Oh, wait, in the productions, I see NT88 -> 't7'. So, NT88 produces `t7`.\n\nWait, so perhaps the initial step is using NT88 -> 't7'. So, the first symbol is `t7`, which is from NT88. So, we need to reduce NT88 to `t7`. Then, the next symbol is `t29`, etc.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first element is `t7`, which is from NT88. So, that's one step. Now, after that, the next symbol is `t29`. So, after NT88 is processed, the next symbol is `t29`, which must come from another production.\n\nBut let's try to proceed step by step:\n\n1. The entire string is `t7 t29 t20 t15 t33 t22 t30 t15 t10 t34 t16 t6 t33 t20 t31 t32 t18 t5 t22 t16 t16 t14 t14 t35 t20 t20 t6 t18 t18 t22`.\n\nWe start with S, which is NT81 NT90.\n\nWe need to see if S can produce this string.\n\nBut since the string starts with t7, perhaps the first application is to NT88 -> t7. So, after S -> NT81 NT90, we now have NT81 NT90, and the first symbol is t7, so perhaps NT90 is not involved yet. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by using the string as the right-hand side and see if it can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the string as follows:\n\nEach step in the parse consumes either a terminal or two non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse will work by expanding non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nSo, the string is long, but let's try to parse it.\n\nStarting with the string:\n\nt7 t29 t20 t15 t33 t22 t30 t15 t10 t34 t16 t6 t33 t20 t31 t32 t18 t5 t22 t16 t16 t14 t14 t35 t20 t20 t6 t18 t18 t22.\n\nBut this seems very long, and with each step, we can only parse two symbols (a terminal and a non-terminal or two non-terminals). Wait, no, in CNF, when you expand a non-terminal, you replace it with two non-terminals, not terminals. So, the initial step involves expanding S into NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, let's model the parse as a list, starting with the string and trying to match it from left to right.\n\nLet me represent the parse as a list where each element can be a terminal or a non-terminal. I'll track which positions we're at and how they're matched by the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\n0: t7\n\n1: t29\n\n2: t20\n\n3: t15\n\n4: t33\n\n5: t22\n\n6: t30\n\n7: t15\n\n8: t10\n\n9: t34\n\n10: t16\n\n11: t6\n\n12: t33\n\n13: t20\n\n14: t31\n\n15: t32\n\n16: t18\n\n17: t5\n\n18: t22\n\n19: t16\n\n20: t16\n\n21: t14\n\n22: t14\n\n23: t35\n\n24: t20\n\n25: t20\n\n26: t6\n\n27: t18"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Parsing a string with a context-free grammar can be done using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since this grammar might get complex, maybe I can find a way to represent the string as a derivation tree.\n\nLet's list out the tokens in the string for clarity:\n\nt23, t5, t20, t34, t13, t33, t1, t35, t16, t33, t22, t33, t7, t20, t18, t3, t15, t32, t22, t14, t6, t33, t20, t29, t7, t31, t20, t29, t31, t31, t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that most non-terminals produce other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT7 -> NT48 NT35, which in turn might produce t23 or other tokens. Some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, which are things like NT31 -> 't35', NT77 -> 't34', etc.\n\nSo, the approach would be to see if the string can be derived step by step from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S -> NT81 NT90. So, the string should start with NT81 and NT90. Wait, no, because the string is a list of terminals, so S will produce two non-terminals, which in the string are the first few tokens. But this might not be accurate because the string seems to have a lot of terminals, each as separate elements.\n\nWait, no, in a typical grammar, each production is a tree that yields a string. So, the initial string is 't23 t5 t20 t34...' etc., and we're trying to see if this is generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me consider that S is the start symbol, and the first step is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the string must be constructed as (something generated by NT81) followed by (something generated by NT90).\n\nSo, the string must be split into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT81, and the second part by NT90. Perhaps, but how long is each part? It depends on the derivations. Since the string is quite long, maybe NT81 generates the first half and NT90 the second, but given the length is 35 tokens, that's more than 2, so maybe multiple derivations in between.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token 't23' is the result of some NT generating it. Let's look through the grammar for where 't23' comes from.\n\nLooking at terminals in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 isn't a non-terminal. Wait, the grammar has terminal 't23', 't5', etc. Let's check the rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't23'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15', 't5', 't32', etc. Wait, maybe I should list the non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\nFrom the given grammar lines, I can note down the direct productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13', 't9', 't1', 't0'\nWait, actually, let me go through each grammar rule and note where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nFrom the given lines:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT18 -> 't16'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT55 -> 't67' which is 't67'? Wait, no, the grammar lists NT55 -> 't67' 'NT37' but 't67' is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nEach production seems to have either two non-terminals or one terminal. So, when a non-terminal is directly producing a terminal, that's a leaf in the parser tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error. Let me look carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't67'\n- NT25 -> 't15', 't5', 't32'\nWait, no, most of these rules are like NT25 -> NT86 NT37, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse each line correctly. Let me re-examine each line:\n\n- S -> NT81 NT90\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88\n- NT48 -> NT69 NT74\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT35 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT95 -> NT37 NT18\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n- NT31 -> NT86 NT28\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT82 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31' (Wait, no: NT55 -> 't67' NT37. So 't67' is a terminal, and NT55 directly produces 't67' and NT37, which is a non-terminal. So NT55 can produce 't67' followed by what NT37 produces.\n\nBut looking back, for the given string, which terminals correspond to what.\n\nSo the first token is 't23'. Looking at the grammar, where is 't23' produced? I don't see a direct production for 't23'. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT43 -> 't35', which is 't35', and NT25 -> 't15', 't5', etc., but none seem to produce 't23'.\n\nWait, so if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't23', then 't23' can't be part of the language unless it's derived through a chain. But 't23' is a terminal token, so the grammar would need a production that results in 't23' being in the string.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is the issue. Let me check all the rules again to see if any non-termin non-termin produces 't23'. Looking at all the rules:\n\nDoes any rule have 't23' as the terminal production? I don't see any. So if that's the case, then maybe the string is not part of the language because 't23' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, so it can't appear in the string unless it's derived from a longer production.\n\nWait, but if a production can have two non-terminals or one terminal, then a string can contain terminals only if each terminal is directly produced by a non-terminal.\n\nSo if any of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-582","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's see. I remember that Chomsky normal form means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe grammar here consists of several NT productions and terminal symbols represented by 't' followed by a number. My task is to determine if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by following the grammar rules step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to write down the given string and see what it looks like. The string is: t23 t5 t5 t3 t0 t5 t34 t14 t0 t18 t31 t29 t20 t10 t5 t33 t31 t18 t33 t31 t23 t29 t29 t35 t20 t30 t34 t31 t30 t34 t33.\n\nWait, let me count the number of tokens. Each 't' followed by a number is a separate token, right? So let's count them:\n\n1. t23\n2. t5\n3. t5\n4. t3\n5. t0\n6. t5\n7. t34\n8. t14\n9. t0\n10. t18\n11. t31\n12. t29\n13. t20\n14. t10\n15. t5\n16. t33\n17. t31\n18. t18\n19. t33\n20. t31\n21. t23\n22. t29\n23. t29\n24. t35\n25. t20\n26. t30\n27. t34\n28. t31\n29. t30\n30. t34\n31. t33\n\nSo the string is 31 tokens long. Since each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of productions. Let me check: the string length is 31. 2^5=32, so 31 is 32-1. That suggests that the derivation took 5 steps beyond the start symbol, which would produce 31 terminals. So that seems consistent.\n\nNext, I'll try to trace back the string to see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar. Starting from the end, maybe a recursive descent approach would help, but I think a bottom-up approach would be more feasible here since I'm trying to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, most of them are two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT81 and NT90. Let's see what each of these NTs can produce.\n\nNT81 can produce:\n- NT95 NT9\n- NT98 NT31\nBut wait, NT81's production is shown as NT95 NT9 and NT98 NT31. So to get NT81, it breaks down into other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT90's production is NT86 NT23. Looking at NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT23.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is t23, which according to the grammar, is generated by NT23 \u2192 't23' (as per the rule NT23 \u2192 t23). So the first part of the string starts with NT90, which breaks down into NT86 and NT23. So the string starts with 't23', which can only be derived from NT23, and NT90 must produce NT86 and NT23.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT23, but NT23 is just a terminal 't23'. So to get 't23' as the first symbol, the first production must come from NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT23.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't23', which comes from NT23, and the second non-terminal is NT86. Now, looking at the string, after t23, the next token is t5, which is 't5'. Let's check what generates 't5'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT25 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo to get 't5' as the next token, the NT in that position must be NT25, which can only produce 't5'. So now, we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 ... Now, after NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT23, the next part is NT86. Let's see the string: after t23, we have t5, which is NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let's consider the string as a sequence of productions, starting from the left and seeing how each terminal can be produced by some NT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since I'm not familiar with all the production rules, perhaps I can try to find each terminal and see if it can be generated.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be generated starting from S and applying the productions. Let's start by noting that S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the string must start with NT81 generating some part and NT90 generating some other part.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: the first token is t23, which is generated by NT23. So perhaps NT81 generates t23, but looking at NT23's production, it's a single terminal. So we can see if there's a production for NT81 that produces t23. Wait, looking back, the grammar doesn't have a production for NT81 \u2192 t23 directly. Instead, NT81 can produce NT95 NT9 or NT98 NT31.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe the string doesn't start with NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT23 because NT86 is a non-terminal. Wait, but in the string, after the first t23, the next token is t5. So perhaps NT90 is generating NT86 (which is a non-terminal that will produce more tokens), and then NT23 is the next part.\n\nWait, let me lay out the steps more carefully.\n\n1. The string starts with t23. So this must be generated by some NT. Looking at the grammar, the only NT that produces t23 is NT23.\n\nSo the first production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and one of these two has to generate t23. But NT23 isn't in NT81 or NT90. Wait, no, NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals that generate other terms. So perhaps the first part of the string, t23, is generated by NT90 \u2192 NT86 NT23. So NT90 \u2192 NT86 (which is another NT) and then NT23 produces t23. So the first non-terminal in S is NT90, which then breaks down into NT86 and NT23.\n\nSo the string starts with the symbols from NT86 (the first part of NT90's production) and then the symbols from NT23 (which is 't23').\n\nWait, but the string starts with t23, which is from NT23. So maybe the NT86 produces some sequence that leads to the next token, t5.\n\nBut let's step through the string token by token.\n\nThe string is: t23 t5 t5 t3 t0 t5 t34 t14 t0 t18 t31 t29 t20 t10 t5 t33 t31 t18 t33 t31 t23 t29 t29 t35 t20 t30 t34 t31 t30 t34 t33.\n\nI'll index each token for clarity:\n\n1: t23\n2: t5\n3: t5\n4: t3\n5: t0\n6: t5\n7: t34\n8: t14\n9: t0\n10: t18\n11: t31\n12: t29\n13: t20\n14: t10\n15: t5\n16: t33\n17: t31\n18: t18\n19: t33\n20: t31\n21: t23\n22: t29\n23: t29\n24: t35\n25: t20\n26: t30\n27: t34\n28: t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, perhaps I should parse the grammar line by line to spot each non-terminal's productions.\n\nLooking at line 4: NT79 (assuming line numbers are off) is not clear, but let me list them all:\n\n1.

NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n3. NT79 ...? Wait, perhaps it's better to list each production correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial user's grammar is as follows (transcribed in the original message):\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90\n\nThen each line after that is a non-terminal and its production, for example:\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT79 -> NT7 NT39? Or perhaps my transcription is off.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each production correctly, ensuring to parse each line properly. But considering the confusion, perhaps it's better to approach this as follows: since the string starts with t20, which is a terminal, but in the grammar, the only NT that produces t20 is NT20 -> 't16'. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces a 't20'. Scanning through all lines:\n\nLooking for any line where a production is \"NT20 -> 't20'\". I don't see that. Instead, perhaps NT with a rule that eventually expands into 't20'.\n\nWait, I think I'm making this more complicated. Let me instead analyze the grammar step by step for each terminal in the string.\n\nFirst token: t20.\n\nWe need to see which non-terminal (NT) can produce 't20'. Looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't16' (line: \"NT20 -> 't16'\")?\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT79 -> NT7 NT39 (or wait, perhaps it's another number).\n\nWait, perhaps I misindexed.

{"custom_id":"request-602","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' terms with numbers, which probably correspond to terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules for clarity, focusing only on the relevant parts that might produce the string. The main starting symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. So, S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are 't32' and 't31'. Let me see if NT81 can produce 't32' and 't31'. Checking the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. Then NT9 is 't10', which doesn't match. Oh, wait, NT81's production is in the rules: NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and NT9 is 't10'. That means the second token should be 't10' instead of 't31'. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT86 -> NT51 NT88. Also, NT88 is 't7'. So, looking at the string again, the string starts with 't32 t31...', but earlier, I thought NT81's last part is 't10'. Maybe I should trace further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by breaking down the string step by step. Let me count the tokens:\n\nThe string is: t32 t31 t33 t35 t22 t34 t31 t18 t22 t34 t29 t16 t33 t16 t3 t3 t5 t33 t13 t32 t6 t18 t23 t15 t5 t13 t15 t0 t29 t22 t35 t10.\n\nThat's 32 tokens. Since the grammar uses CNF, each non-terminal production results in two terminals or non-terminals, and the process involves left or right derivations.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with 't32'. So, looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't32'? Checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35, but NT48 is 't23', and NT35 is 't18' \u2192 that would give 't23 t18' for NT7, not 't32'.\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88; NT43 is 't43' and NT88 is 't7', so NT26 produces 't43 t7' \u2192 no 't32'.\n\nNT82 -> 't3' as per the rule NT82 -> 't3'. Wait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT82 -> 't6' and 't33'. Wait, let me list the NT82 productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT82: 't3', 't6', 't18', 't33', 't3' again. So, NT82 can produce 't6' via some rule, but maybe I need to check each step.\n\nWait, maybe I should go step by step with the string:\n\nThe string is: t32, t31, t33, t35, t22, t34, t31, t18, t22, t34, t29, t16, t33, t16, t3, t3, t5, t33, t13, t32, t6, t18, t23, t15, t5, t13, t15, t0, t29, t22, t35, t10.\n\nSo, let's see. The starting symbol is S, which splits into NT81 and NT90.\n\nFirst, S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, NT81's production is: Looking at the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. And NT9 is 't10', so from NT81, we get 't10' and something else (something else is NT95, but since it's a non-terminal, we need to split that further). So, the first two symbols should be the components of NT81, which would require the first token to be from NT81's production.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't32', which is an output from NT81? Because NT81's production is NT95 NT9. Since NT95 can produce 't13', 't25', or another 't35'? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT95: NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and NT60 -> NT98 NT55. NT98 is 't31', and NT55 -> NT67 NT37, and so on. Alternatively, NT95 can produce 't13' and 't15' as in one rule, perhaps. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and NT25 -> 't5' (because NT25 -> 't5' in one rule). Hmm, but also, looking at NT95: there's a rule NT95 -> 't0' and another NT95 -> 't13'. Wait, checking all the NT95 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60,\n\nNT95 -> 't13',\n\nNT95 -> ... Wait, according to the given grammar, NT95 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking through:\n\nLines like:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60,\n\nNT95 -> 't13',\n\nand another?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the lines like:\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18,\n\nWhich is for NT18; so perhaps I'm missing some lines.

{"custom_id":"request-617","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of t-commands, which probably represent terminal symbols. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has at most two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is: t31 t1 t29 t32 t18 t0 t0 t1 t29 t10 t18 t23 t3 t15 t3 t23 t15 t5 t13 t22 t35 t7 t34 t35 t1 t22 t7 t23 t24 t33 t15 t30 t1.\n\nI notice that many of these are t-commands which seem to directly map to terminals, like t31, t1, etc. However, some non-terminals might expand into sequences of these t-commands. My goal is to trace through the grammar to see if this string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the string must start with NT81 and NT90, but in the string, it starts with t31, which is a terminal. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the productions start with non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I need to check which non-terminals expand into which terminals.\n\nLooking further, for each non-terminal, I see the rule, and some of them have terminals on the right. For example, NT90 \u2192 t14 (since there's a rule NT90 -> t14? Wait looking back, I see NT90 is defined as \u2192 t14. So NT90 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't14'.\n\nSimilarly, NT95 \u2192 some combination of other non-terminals and terminals. Wait, but in the rules provided, each non-terminal has a specific production. So for example, NT95 -> NT25 NT60. But looking through the rules, there's a NT95 -> t0 and others like NT95 ->NT25 NT60. But in the string, I see t0, which suggests that NT95 can directly produce t0. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nYes, under NT95 -> NT25 NT60 is one production, and another rule is NT95 -> t0. So NT95 can produce either 't0' or NT25 NT60.\n\nSo, in the string, the first part is t31 t1 t29 t32 t18 t0... So the initial non-terminals S \u2192 NT81 NT90 must expand into the string. Let me try to parse this.\n\nLet me try to map NT81 and NT90 to their respective terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 (from the rules: NT81 -> NT95 NT9).\n- NT90 \u2192 t14 (from NT90 -> t14? Let me confirm: Yes, in the rules, NT90 is defined as \u2192 t14).\n\nSo S \u2192 NT81 NT90 expands to NT95 NT9 followed by 't14'.\n\nBut in the string, after S is t31. So perhaps NT95 leads to 't31'? Wait, looking at the rules for NT95:\n\nNT95 has two productions: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 t0. So NT95 cannot directly produce 't31'; so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the paths that lead to the terminals in the string. Let's take the string and try to match the non-terminals and terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT81 NT90. As per the string starting with t31, perhaps NT81 must expand into something that eventually produces t31.\n\nLooking at DT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9. Both are non-terminals, so let me see what those can produce.\n\nNT95 has two options: either produce 't0' or NT25 NT60. NT9 -> NT NT82 perhaps? Let's look. NT9 -> NT7.\n\nWait NT9 \u2192 NT7. So NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 t0.\n\nBut in the string, the first t is t31. So perhaps NT95 expands into t31 indirectly.\n\nWait, looking for NT's that can produce 't31'. Let's check the rules where a NT \u2192 t31.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT60 \u2192 t51. No. NT18 \u2192 t18 which is a terminal. NT31 \u2192 t31? Let me check. Yes, under NT31 -> t31.\n\nWait, no. The rules list NT31 as producing t31 and others. Yes, looking at the list, the rules for NT31 and others:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 t35\nWait, no. Let me check the rules list provided:\n\nLooking for which NT rules produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT75 (if any) but looking through the list:\n\nWait, let me list all NT productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT31 \u2192 t35\nNT67 \u2192 t15\nNT12 \u2192 t30\nNT35 \u2192 t18\nNT43 \u2192 t20\nNT13 \u2192 t15\nNT60 \u2192 t98?\nWait no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37 etc. All these produce non-terminals.\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produce a terminal.

So NT31 produces t35.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t31. So how does NT produce t31?\n\nWait, check if there's any NT that directly produces 't31' or if any path leads to t31.\n\nWait, looking through the rules for t31:\n\nWait, no NT in the production list directly produces t31. Hmm, so how does t31 come into play?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each production.\n\nLooking at the productions, for NT78, etc., not sure. Let me check NT31's production: NT31 \u2192 t35. So NT31 can't produce t31. So maybe t31 comes from another NT.\n\nWait, searching for any NT production that includes t31 in its expansion.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNo, I don't see any NT production where a terminal in the string 't31' is directly produced. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the rules. Let me go through the production list again.\n\nLooking for any t31 in the terminals:\n\n- NT60: \u2192 t51? No.\n\n- NT18: \u2192 t18.\n\n- NT31: \u2192 t35.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1.\n\n- NT37 \u2192 t7.\n\n- NT74 \u2192 t35.\n\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production. Wait, in the production list, I see:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (NT82 \u2192 t6)\n\nWait, but looking for t31, maybe from NT18: NT18 \u2192 t20 NT26. But t26 is part of a production.\n\nWait, looking through the string: the first terminal is t31. The grammar starts with NT81 and NT90, so S \u2192 NT81 NT90. NT81 \u2192 NT95 and NT9. NT9 \u2192 NT7. NT7 has two productions: NT77 (I think: check the rules) \u2192 NT86 NT35. Wait, NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35.\n\nWait, from the rules: NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35.\n\nSo NT7 becomes NT48 and NT35.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74.\n\nNT69 \u2192 t34.\n\nNT74 \u2192 t35.\n\nWait, this seems complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-614","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of a bunch of rules that expand non-terminals into other symbols, including some terminal tokens like 'tX' and some that directly produce the actual terminal symbols in the string.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. It's a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol is on the left, and each production has no more than two symbols on the right. That seems to fit the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's actually more detailed than that. For example, the start symbol S first produces NT81 NT90. And the NT (probably non-terminals) produce either other NTs or sometimes an explicit 't...' symbol. So, my string is a sequence of these 't' symbols, and I need to see if they can be generated step by step by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t14 t1 t14 t15 t29 t31 t22 t31 t30 t23 t15 t14 t24 t23 t23 t33 t10 t1 t16 t30 t10 t5 t20 t34 t3 t30 t34 t32 t31 t5 t1 t0 t13`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. So, I need to check if this can be derived from S by applying the production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces one terminal symbol or two non-terminals. So, during parsing, each step splits the string into two parts, and each part is checked against the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the grammar provided includes a lot of rules. For example, NT7 can produce 't1', 't20', or 't0'. I should list out all the possible terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process, moving from the left to the right, splitting the string into chunks where each chunk is generated by a production rule.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string. It's quite a lot: 32 tokens, I think. Each token is a 't' followed by a number, except for the initial S, which is split into NT81 and NT90, each of which can lead to 't's or further non-terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for the string to be generated, it must parse into pairs of terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me think about how parsing works. In a bottom-up approach, starting from S, which is NT81 NT90. Each of these NTs can expand into other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I can build a parse tree. Let me see:\n\nThe string is [t14, t1, t14, t15, t29, t31, t22, t31, t30, t23, t15, t14, t24, t23, t23, t33, t10, t1, t16, t30, t10, t5, t20, t34, t3, t30, t34, t32, t31, t5, t1, t0, t13].\n\nI can split this into chunks where each chunk corresponds to a production rule. The idea is that each rule is either a single terminal (so a chunk of 1) or two non-terminals (so the next chunk would have two terminals or two non-terminals).\n\nBut since this is top-down, starting from S, which is NT81 NT90, each of those needs to produce the corresponding tokens.\n\nSo, for the string, I can split it into an array: tokens = ['t14', 't1', 't14', 't15', 't29', 't31', 't22', 't31', 't30', 't23', 't15', 't14', 't24', 't23', 't23', 't33', 't10', 't1', 't16', 't30', 't10', 't5', 't20', 't34', 't3', 't30', 't34', 't32', 't31', 't5', 't1', 't0', 't13']\n\nWait, the way CNF works is that the parse is done by looking ahead one step, considering the productions as two-step splits. So perhaps the string can be parsed by successively splitting into two parts, each part corresponding to one production step.\n\nLet me think of the first two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo starting with NT81, which produces either a terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nSo, to get the token 't14', we need NT81 to produce either a terminal or two non-terminals. If NT81 produces two non-terminals, each of those must generate a token or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the 't14' in the string, I see that NT9 can produce 't14', because NT9 is on the left-hand side and maps to 't14'.\n\nWait, NT9 -> 't14', yes.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, some entries have 'a' where it's a terminal, but in the given grammar, for example, 'NT95 -> NT25 NT60', 'NT7 -> NT48 NT35', but some directly map to 't3', 't16', etc.\n\nWait, no: Let me check the grammar. It seems that for NTs, the rules are either A->BC or A->a. For example:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nAnd so on. So any NT that has a rule ending in 'a' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT95, for example: NT95 -> NT25 NT60 and also NT95 -> 't13' or other rules. Looking at the detailed grammar, for NT95: it's written as NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT95 -> NT25 NT60 again? Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar entries provided are a list, some are 'a's, others are BCs.\n\nLike, NT95 has two production rules:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nAlso, NT95 -> 't13'\n\nAnd NT55 -> 't31'\n\nSo, that means in the parse, each step can choose between these productions.\n\nWait, no: I think that for a given NT, all of its productions are listed, some leading to terminals and others to non-terminals.\n\nSo for NT95, it can produce both NT25 NT60 or t13.\n\nWait, no: Wait, in the grammar provided, I should parse each line to see if it's a production rule or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nThen later:\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nSo that means NT95 has two production rules: one that produces t13 directly, and another that produces NT25 followed by NT60.\n\nSo when parsing, the input can be split such that the first option is choosing to have 't13' as a single symbol, or a split into NT25 and NT60, which would then each generate their tokens.\n\nSo, the initial step is to parse 'S' as NT81 NT90.\n\nOur string starts with 't14', which is generated by NT9 because NT9 -> 't14' as per the grammar.\n\nSo, from S, we have NT81 NT90. We parse the first token 't14' by taking NT9 -> 't14'. Then, the next part is NT81, which needs to generate the rest of the string after 't14'.\n\nWait, but this is the opposite. Wait, in a bottom-up approach, you might split S into NT81 and NT90, and each of those needs to generate their parts of the string.\n\nBut the entire string is a concatenation, so it's [t14, t1, t14, t15, ... t13]. So it's a single sequence of symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the parsing approach. Let me think of the standard way of parsing with CNF: you can use a recursive descent parser, where each non-terminal produces a sequence of terminal symbols or non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-633","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a single terminal symbol. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the non-terminals on the left (like NT7, NT86, etc.) produce two non-terminals, except for some that directly produce terminals like 't1', 't3', etc. The goal is to parse the given string and see if each token can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe string provided is: t10 t33 t10 t5 t10 t7 t30 t18 t20 t15 t22 t22 t22 t0 t33 t6 t24 t29 t31 t16 t3 t14 t10 t7 t6 t0 t6 t35 t16 t3 t7 t30 t33 t33.\n\nMy approach will be to attempt to parse this string step by step using the grammar, keeping track of which non-terminals can produce which sequences of terminals.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which according to the grammar is NT7 followed by NT90: S \u2192 NT7 NT90.\n\nSo, the first production is NT7 followed by NT90. Let's check if the first token matches the possible productions of NT7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 can produce either NT48 NT35 or 't1'. Since the first token is 't10', which doesn't match 't1', so I need to see if there's a longer chain.\n\nWait, actually, wait. NT7 can produce 't1', 't20', or 't1' via another production. Looking at the productions for NT7:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 or NT77, but wait, in the given grammar, looking back, it says:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, and looking at the list, also NT77 \u2192 NT31 NT83, and another NT7 \u2192 't1', but I think the initial entry is correct.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, there are multiple NT7 rules? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the grammar is a list, with each line being a production. So, lines starting with NT7 are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nand\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo, NT7 can either produce NT48 NT35 or 't1'. So, to match 't10', we need to see if 't10' is a terminal that can be derived from NT7 or any of its descendants.\n\nWait, 't10' is a terminal symbol in the grammar, but looking at the productions, the only terminals are those like 't1', 't3', etc., and we need to see if any of them is 't10'.\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see NT9 \u2192 't10'. So 't10' is indeed a terminal. But NT7 doesn't directly produce 't10'. So, to get 't10', the chain must start from NT9 or another non-terminal that can derive it.\n\nWait, so let me map out all possible derivations for each terminal in the string, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't10'. Since 't10' is a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that can directly produce it. Looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't9' and NT9 \u2192 't10', but wait, in the list, it says:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, line 95 seems to have multiple NT9 rules, but I'm focusing on NT9 and the terminals.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT12 -> 't35'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT55 -> 't31'\n\nWait, so maybe I'm miscounting.

The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol, which can produce a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT81 and NT90. Each of those non-terminals leads into more non-terminals until eventually, some of them expand into terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t33 t5 t10 t7 t5 t32 t14 t29 t1 t5 t34 t35 t18 t34 t18 t5 t7 t1 t24 t6 t0 t24 t22 t7 t20 t35 t34 t35 t30 t10 t1 t7 t30`.\n\nI notice that each 't' is a terminal symbol, and I need to see if the sequence of these terminals can be derived from the grammar's start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That means each step in a derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I can try to parse the string from the grammar, working backwards from the start symbol S. Alternatively, since the grammar may have certain patterns or the string length must fit, I can note that each non-terminal expansion consumes two symbols, except when it's a terminal.\n\nBut let me think about the structure more carefully. The string starts with t10, which comes from NT9 (as per NT9 -> 't10'). Wait, let me check the grammar rules again. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT25 -> NT15\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT37 -> NT18 NT77\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT95 also -> 't0' and 't13' through other paths, but in this string, t10 is involved.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules again, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- So, the start symbol S is NT81 NT90. Let's look at what NT81 and NT90 produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT90 -> NT51 NT88\n\nWait, no, looking back, actually:\n\nThe grammar starts as:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nThen,\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\nNT37 -> NT18 NT77\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT98 -> NT31 NT83\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\nNT... and so on.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of rules. Let me go through the given grammar step by step.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT81 NT90\n2. NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n3. NT90 -> NT51 NT88\nWait, actually, I think I need to check all the rules correctly. Let me list all the relevant rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the production rules, each rule on the right-hand side is either a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nFor example, 't1' is produced by NT7, 't2' (if any) by NT82, etc. Wait, looking through the rules, the terminals are as follows:\n\n- 't1' -> NT7\n- 't2' -> NT82 (from NT82 -> 't6')\nWait, no, looking at the rules, NT69 -> 't34'... Hmm, perhaps I need to collect all the rules where a non-terminal expands into a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1' (from NT7 -> 't1')\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT95 -> 't13' (from NT95 -> 't13')\n- NT55 -> 't31' (from NT55 -> 't31')\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n- NT12 -> 't35'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT74 -> 't23' (from NT74 -> 't23')\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 also -> 't0' and 't13' through different rules\n- NT86 -> 't32' (from NT86 -> 't32')\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- So, I can map each non-terminal to its terminal or to other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t10, which comes from NT9. So in the string, the first part is t10, which must come from NT9.\n\nSo the sequence starts as S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 ... but I'm not sure yet. Let's think of it in reverse: the string is a sequence of terminals. Each non-terminal in the grammar produces two terminals or non-terminals. So the total number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps in the derivation. Wait, not exactly. Because each step replaces a non-terminal into two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. So the total number of symbols in the string should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^k for some k.\n\nWait, but actually, the grammar is context-free, and in CNF, the minimum and maximum lengths of the string can be determined by the number of steps. For example, starting from S, each step can add 0 or more symbols, but since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each production produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and something else? No, wait: in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals. So each production results in either two non-terminals (which can be expanded further) or a terminal.\n\nWait no, if a production is A \u2192 a, then it's a terminal, else A \u2192 BC. So when expanding, each non-terminal in the current string is replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo starting with S, each expansion step replaces each non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the total number of symbols in the string would be 1 (if S \u2192 a) or 2 (if S \u2192 NT1 NT2). Each subsequent expansion would double (if all non-terminals are replaced by two non-terminals each) the number of symbols, or reduce it depending on how many terminals are added.\n\nBut in this case, the string has 36 symbols. Let's check:\n\nCounting the string:\n\nt10 t33 t5 t10 t7 t5 t32 t14 t29 t1 t5 t34 t35 t18 t34 t18 t5 t7 t1 t24 t6 t0 t24 t22 t7 t20 t35 t34 t35 t30 t10 t1 t7 t30\n\nThat's 36 tokens. So the length is 36.\n\nIf each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, starting from 1 (S), then the possible lengths after n steps are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. But 36 is not a power of two. Hmm, that's a problem because in this grammar, each step must replace each non-terminal with exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. But if all symbols are non-terminals, the number of symbols doubles at each step. But terminals can appear as direct results of the productions, so the total number of symbols can vary.\n\nWait, no. The initial string has length 1. Each application of a production in CNF can cause the string to grow or stay the same, depending on whether non-terminals are replaced. For example, if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal and another non-terminal, the total symbols increase by one. So the total number of symbols can vary more flexibly.\n\nBut in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit lengthy, so I'll need to carefully break it down. Here's what I'm thinking.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It seems each non-terminal (like S, NT98, etc.) produces two other non-terminals until the terminal symbols (like 't1', 't20', etc.) are reached. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given is: t14 t20 t23 t15 t34 t24 t22 t6 t6 t24 t15 t24 t13 t10 t6 t29 t30 t22 t33 t31 t35 t24 t0 t31 t5 t31 t7 t15 t32 t15 t0 t29 t0 t0 t10.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first two symbols in the string must come from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two are t14 and t20. Let's check if NT81 and NT90 can produce these.\n\nNT81's production is NT95 NT9. The terminal produced by NT9 is 't10' and NT95 \u2192 t95 or another non-terminal. Wait, actually, the production rules for NT81 and NT90 aren't directly given. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is provided, so I need to see the rules for NT81 and NT90.\n\nIn the grammar, NT81 is defined as NT95 NT9. And NT9 is 't10'. NT95's productions are NT25 NT60 and NT37 NT18, etc. Hmm, this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I should build a parse tree for the string or try to find the sequence of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to approach this by checking if each production step leads to the correct terminal symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see if each symbol in the string can be mapped to a terminal from a production chain.\n\nLet me note the possible terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nBut this might take a while since the grammar is extensive. Maybe I can start building the parse tree from the end.\n\nLooking at the string, it ends with 't10'. The terminals are t1 to t35 and t5. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't10'. Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT83 \u2192 't23'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT95 \u2192 't0' (among others)\n- NT8 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, NT9 is 't10'. So, NT9 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo, any production that includes NT9 will have 't10' in it.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see where 't10' appears. The last symbol is 't10', which must come from NT9. So before that, there must be a production that includes NT9 and another terminal before 't10'.\n\nLooking at the string, before 't10' there is 't0'. Wait, no, the string ends with 't10', so maybe I should check the position. Let me recount the string:\n\nThe string is: t14 t20 t23 t15 t34 t24 t22 t6 t6 t24 t15 t24 t13 t10 t6 t29 t30 t22 t33 t31 t35 t24 t0 t31 t5 t31 t7 t15 t32 t15 t0 t29 t0 t0 t10.\n\nWait, the last element is t10, which is the last symbol. The one before that is t0. So the last two symbols are t0 and t10. Hmm, but in the grammar, the terminals don't combine like that unless they are part of the same production.\n\nWait, each production in the grammar is two non-terminals or two terminals? Wait no, Chomsky Normal Form productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. So each production is either:\n\n1. A production where B and C are both non-terminals, leading to two symbols in the string.\n\n2. If either B or C is a terminal, then it contributes one symbol to the string.\n\nWait, but in this case, each production in the grammar seems to be A \u2192 BC where both B and C are non-terminals until they are resolved into terminals. So when we reach a terminal, it contributes one symbol to the string.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to the productions applied in order.\n\nTo parse the string, I can try working backwards from the end, trying to match each symbol to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is t10. In the grammar, t10 is produced by NT9. So before t10, we must have a production that ends with NT9, which comes from NT9 \u2192 ... So perhaps looking for a production that ends with NT9.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, NT9 is defined as 't10', so any production involving NT9 must have it, but NT9 is a single terminal symbol. So if a non-terminal A has a production A \u2192 ...NT9..., then in the string, after ... comes 't10'.\n\nSo the last symbol is 't10' which is from NT9. So before that, in the parse tree, there would be a non-terminal that produces NT9 plus something else.\n\nWait, but let's start building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't14' and 't20', which correspond to S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the first production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which translates to two symbols in the string.\n\nSo t14 and t20 are the first two symbols.\n\nLooking up NT81, the productions are:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo NT81 is 't14', which is produced by NT95 followed by NT9. But wait, NT95 and NT9 are non-terminals, so in the string, the next symbols after t14 (which would be the 3rd symbol: t23) need to form a production from NT81.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach production introduces two symbols in the string, either two terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal or two non-terminals. But given that each production is A \u2192 BC, and these are terminals or non-terminals, I can build a parse tree by choosing for each step which production leads to the required symbols.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, perhaps I can look for the order in which the terminals appear and see if they match the possible productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t14, t20, t23, t15, t34, t24, t22, t6, t6, t24, t15, t24, t13, t10, t6, t29, t30, t22, t33, t31, t35, t24, t0, t31, t5, t31, t7, t15, t32, t15, t0, t29, t0, t0, t10.\n\nWait, but let me note that 't14' comes first.\n\nLooking at NT81, which is the first symbol. NT81 is defined as NT95 NT9. So the production is A \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nBut NT9 is 't10', which is a terminal, so the first two symbols after S would be NT81's production, which is NT95 and NT9, but NT9 is 't10', but the first symbol in the string is 't14', not 't10'. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t14, which should come from NT81. But looking at NT81, how do we get 't14'?

It looks like each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow can produce two other non-terminals on the right side. For example, S -> NT81 NT90. So, S can generate NT81 and NT90.

Yes, under NT7, the production is 't1', which is 't' followed by 1. But the string given has a 't7', 't5', etc. But the problem is the string has a 't0', and the grammar may not have a production for t0 as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT that produces 't0' as a terminal, only 't1', so when the string contains 't0', that would be impossible because NT's only way to produce terminals are through certain ones.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT7 -> 't1' because the production is \"NT7 -> NT48 NT35\", right? Wait, no, looking again, no. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines, some have two NTs on the right, others have a terminal.\n\nLike \"NT95 -> NT25 NT60\", so it's NT25 and NT60 on the right, etc.\n\nBut I don't see a line where NT7 -> 't0'. So 't0' cannot appear in any generated string because there's no rule that directly produces 't0'. Unless it's through a chain of productions, but in a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, each production is A->BC or A->a, so 't0' would only appear if a non-terminal directly produces it.\n\nSo if the string contains 't0', but the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that produces 't0' as a terminal, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I don't see any rule that has just 't0' as the RHS. The closest is \"NT7 -> NT48 NT35\", which produces two non-terminals, which then will have their own productions, but they don't result in 't0' as a terminal.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me scan the grammar lines carefully:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't35', 't1', 't20'\n\nBut wait, no 't0' or 't0' only appears as part of another NT's production. Or wait, I'm looking for a line where RHS is a single terminal. Let's go through each line:\n\n- NT7 <- no, it's NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT13 -> 't0'?

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of NT symbols and terminals that represent letter codes like t1, t2, etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t33 t32 t35 t7 t35 t3 t32 t15 t18 t23 t3 t15 t5 t3 t7 t3 t34 t22 t6 t5 t6 t1 t30 t3 t15 t29 t34 t35 t1 t30 t1 t24 t23 t7 t34 t16`.\n\nFirst, I think about how the string was formed. Each terminal corresponds to a production in the grammar. So, the entire string is a derivation path from the start symbol S to the terminal string. \n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90. So the first step is that S expands into NT81 and NT90. Each of these non-terminals will then expand further, each into their respective parts until we reach all terminals.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the parse tree. But wait, this might take a while because the string is quite long. Alternatively, I can map the sequence of terminals to the non-terminals' productions and see if they fit.\n\nStarting with NT81 and NT90. So the string starts with t33, which I notice in the productions. Looking at the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. Oh wait, that's right. NT81 is transformed into NT95 and NT9. So the first two symbols should correspond to NT95 and NT9.\n\nLet's see: the string starts with t33. Does any production for NT95 start with t33? Looking through the grammar, NT95 has productions like NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT95 -> NT37 NT18, NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT55 -> NT67 NT37, etc. Wait, looking for a production leading to a terminal t33.\n\nI think NT33 isn't present in the grammar. Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals expand directly into terminal symbols. For example, NT7 -> t1, NT77 -> t34, NT35 -> t18, etc. But looking through the list, I don't see any production that expands to t33. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. NT33 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar. The productions only go to two non-terminals, except for those ending with 't'. So for NT33 to appear, there must be a production NT33 -> something, but I don't see it. The only terminal codes are things like t1, t33, etc., but their definitions must come from non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, the production NT33: there is no NT33 in the grammar. The productions are all for NT1, NT2, up to NT98 or higher codes. So if the string has t33, it must have come from a non-terminal that expands to t33. But I don't see any non-terminal in the grammar with a production ending in t33.\n\nLet me double-check. The productions list includes NT7 -> 't1', NT82 -> 't6', NT9 -> 't10', NT37 -> 't35', etc. Wait, looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT35 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT12 -> 't35'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18' (from NT35)\nWait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> t1\n- NT77 -> t34\n- NT35 -> t18\n- NT95 -> t13\n- NT55 -> t31\n- NT25 -> t15\n- NT86 -> t32\n- NT39 -> t33\n- NT88 -> t7\n- NT9 -> t10\n- NT82 -> t6\n- NT43 -> t35\n- NT28 -> t34\n- NT60 -> t24\n- NT12 -> t35\n- NT69 -> t34\n- NT51 -> t32\n- NT48 -> t23\n- NT25 -> t5\n- NT43 -> t1\n- NT13 -> t15\n- NT28 -> t34\n- NT60 -> t5\n- NT48 -> t29\n- NT51 -> t22\n- NT83 -> t23\n- NT90 -> t14\n- NT7 -> t20\n- NT98 -> t24\n\nSo in the productions, the terminals appear in specific positions. Each non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals has no direct terminal production, but those that lead directly to terminals are as listed above.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminal is t33. From the productions, the only way to get t33 is if a non-terminal X has X -> 't33'. But in the provided grammar, I don't see any such production. The closest is NT33, but that's not present. NT35 can go to t18, NT37 to t35, etc.\n\nWait, but let's see if t33 can be produced by any combination. For example, maybe NT33 is produced by two other non-terminals. For example, if NT33 is derived from NT37 and NT18, but NT37 expands to NT35 and NT3, which further expand. But no, because NT35 produces t18, which is 't18', which is 18, not 33.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if NT33 is present in the grammar. Looking through the production list, I don't see 't33' as a terminal, so no non-terminal in the grammar has that. Therefore, the presence of 't33' in the string implies that it must have come from a production that leads directly to t33, which doesn't exist.\n\nWait, maybe the non--terminal 'NT33' is in the grammar. But looking again, the first production is S -> NT81 NT90, then NT81 -> NT95 NT9, etc. So I don't see NT33 anywhere in the productions except as a terminal. So NT33 is not in the grammar's non-terminals. Therefore, if the string has 't33', it's impossible because there's no way to generate it. So the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains 't33', but no production in the grammar generates 't33' as a terminal. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I need to determine whether this string is generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. Each production rule has the left side as a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side as two non-terminals or a terminal. Also, all non-terminals are in the rule, and there are no epsilon productions. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow Chomsky normal form because each production on the right has exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t32 t32 t30 t16 t13 t7 t34 t13 t1 t18 t24 t31 t30 t15 t13 t33 t10 t0 t24 t23 t22 t35 t1 t16 t34 t16 t15 t6 t29 t18 t35 t23 t32 t16 t18 t32`.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to identify the non-terminals and the terminals. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT1, NT2, etc., except for the terminals, which are everything else, including 't' followed by numbers and some letters like 'S'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t35 t35 t7 t1 t34 t6 t30 t14 t14 t15 t5 t5 t20 t13 t16 t5 t30 t20 t20 t3 t3 t3 t35 t20 t24 t7 t29 t3 t34 t16 t30 t1 t3 t10 t1 t20`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me start by breaking down the string into individual symbols:\n\nt23, t35, t35, t7, t1, t34, t6, t30, t14, t14, t15, t5, t5, t20, t13, t16, t5, t30, t20, t20, t3, t3, t3, t35, t20, t24, t7, t29, t3, t34, t16, t30, t1, t3, t10, t1, t20.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first two symbols should be the terminals derived from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT81 and NT90:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\nSo, tracing back, NT81 would derive to a string ending with 't10', but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT9 \u2192 't10'. Hmm, maybe I need to parse this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's start by trying to parse the string using the grammar. I'll use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first two symbols must be the results of NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t23. Let's see if t23 can come from NT81 or NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81's rules: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. The terminals reachable here would be the combination of what NT95 and NT9 derive to. NT9 \u2192 't10'. So NT81 would end with 't10'. But in the string, the first symbol is t23, so that doesn't match. Maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each production step involves non-terminals, and the terminals are the leaves. So, I should start by identifying the leftmost non-terminal and replace it with its right-hand side.\n\nLet me list the rules again for clarity:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT25 \u2192 NT5\nNT5 \u2192 NT...\nWait, no, looking at the rules, each rule is a production for the non-terminal. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by digits, except those that are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each production:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT25 \u2192 NT5\nNT5 \u2192 NT67 NT37\nNT67 \u2192 't15'\nNT37 \u2192 NT12 NT77\nNT12 \u2192 't30'\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree.\n\nLet me start with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, the first part is NT81 and the second is NT90.\n\nLooking at the string's first symbol: t23. So, I need to see how t23 is derived.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I need to see if NT81 can produce anything related to t23.\n\nLooking through NT81's rules, it's NT95 NT9. Then, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. NT25 \u2192 NT5. NT5 \u2192 NT67 NT37. NT67 \u2192 't15'. So NT5 would produce t15. Then NT37 \u2192 NT12 NT77. NT12 \u2192 't30' and NT77 \u2192 't34'. So, putting together, NT5 would derive t15, NT37 would derive t30 t34, so NT12 would be t30, NT77 t34. So, putting all together, NT81 is NT95 NT9. NT95 is NT25 NT60: NT25 is t15, NT60 is NT98 NT55. Wait, but NT98 and NT55 don't seem to directly produce t23.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each production step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t23, which must be the result of some NT... rule. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, which NT rules can produce t23?\n\nt23 is a terminal. Let's see the rules that produce terminals:\n\nWe have several NT rules ending with 't' something.

NT69 \u2192 't34', NT74 \u2192 't7'. But in the rules above, looking again, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the provided grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I can find:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'! Oh, here it is: NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74. Then NT69 \u2192 't34', NT74 \u2192 't7'. So NT48's derivation would be 't34' 't7'. Wait, that would produce 't34t7' not t23. Hmm, is there any rule that directly gives 't23'?\n\nWait, looking again: \n\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, but none of these produce 't23'. Maybe I'm missing a rule.\n\nWait, let me look line by line:\n\nAfter NT74 \u2192 't33', there's NT35 \u2192 't18', NT95 \u2192 't13', NT55 \u2192 't31', NT95 \u2192 't0', NT43 \u2192 't20', NT13 \u2192 't15', NT60 \u2192 't24', NT12 \u2192 't30', NT25 \u2192 't5', NT48 \u2192 't23'.\n\nAh, wait there's a rule: NT43 \u2192 't20', but also look: in the rules, perhaps NT43 can derive 't23'? No, I think I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see NT48 \u2192 't23'? Is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol shouldn't appear on the right side of any production. This structure simplifies the grammar and makes it easier to analyze, especially for certain parsing algorithms.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice it consists of several non-terminal symbols like S, NT7, NT81, and so on. The production rules all seem to be in the form of two non-terminals on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. So, that checks out with CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t0 t30 t1 t6 t14 t6 t16 t23 t33 t7 t1 t35 t35 t1 t35 t34 t24 t31 t5 t32 t14 t35 t5 t22 t31 t18 t0 t6 t18 t35 t13 t13 t3 t13 t5 t14 t30`.\n\nI need to parse this string using the given grammar and see if it can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing, which is efficient for such cases. CYK parses strings in polynomial time by building a table where each cell represents a substring and what non-terminals can generate it.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can approach this more methodically by looking for the production rules that would generate the terminals in the string. Alternatively, I could try to see if each terminal is covered by some rule in the grammar, and work my way up to the start symbol.\n\nLet me list down the terminals in the string: t0, t30, t1, t6, t14, t16, t23, t33, t34, t24, t31, t5, t32, t22, t35, t34 again, t24 again, t31 again, t5 again, t22 again, t35 again, t14 again, t35 again, t14 again, t30 again.\n\nWait, that's a lot of terminals. Let me see which non-terminals correspond to these terminals. Looking back at the grammar, each non-terminal has a production rule that either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT95 -> NT25 NT60, but also NT95 -> 't13'. So any occurrence of 't13' in the string must be matched by applying the production rule NT95 -> 't13'. Similarly, others like 't30' must correspond to a rule that has that terminal.\n\nLet me make a list of all the terminals in the string along with their possible non-terminals:\n\n- t0: NT9 -> 't0'\n- t1: NT7 -> 't1' and NT13 -> 't13'... Wait, t1 is 't1' and t13 is 't13'. But in the string, there's t1, t14, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, I see 't0' which matches NT9 -> 't0'. So that's good.\n\nt30: Looking at the grammar, NT12 -> 't30'. So any occurrence of 't30' must come from NT12.\n\nt1: NT7 -> 't1' and NT18 -> 't1' isn't listed. Wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35 or NT1 (t1). So 't1' is produced by NT7.\n\nt6: NT90 -> 't14', but t6 is another terminal. Wait, looking back, NT9 -> 't6' as per the grammar: NT9 -> 't6'.\n\nt14: Looking through the grammar, I see NT7 -> 't1' and 't14' is from NT90. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT90 is a production: NT90 -> 't14'. So t14 is produced by NT90.\n\nWait, but also NT18 -> 't1'. So any 't18' would come from NT18. Wait, no, in the string I see 't18' once.\n\nWait, let me clarify each terminal:\n\n1. t0: NT9 -> 't0'\n2. t30: NT12 -> 't30'\n3. t1: NT7 -> 't1' or NT18 -> 't1'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT18 -> 't1'?\n\nWait, the grammar has NT18 -> NT20 NT26. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nThen, for example, NT37 -> NT9 NT82, and so on.\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35 or 't1'\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT90 or others?\nWait, let me write down the list of terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n- t0: NT9\n- t1: NT7\n- t30: NT12\n- t6: NT9\n- t14: NT90\n- t16: NT20\n- t23: NT25\n- t33: NT31\n- t34: NT51\n- t24: NT60\n- t31: NT74, etc.\nWait, let me check each one step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to represent the entire string as a series of terminals and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation is replacing a symbol with exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and another symbol, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal). Wait, no, CNF allows only productions of the form A -> BC (two non-terminals) or A -> a (terminal).\n\nSo, to parse the string, each symbol (including terminals) can be part of a production.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to build the parse tree. Since every production is a binary tree, each terminal in the string corresponds to a leaf node.\n\nWait, let me consider that each production can contribute to the string. For example, a production like A -> B C would mean that if B and C can generate substrings of the string, then A can generate the concatenation of those substrings.\n\nSo, starting from S -> NT81 NT90. So the string must be a concatenation of what NT81 can generate and what NT90 can generate.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the entire string can be split into two parts: a string from NT81 and a string from NT90.\n\nLooking at the given string: `t0 t30 t1 t6 t14 t6 t16 t23 t33 t7 t1 t35 t35 t1 t35 t34 t24 t31 t5 t32 t14 t35 t5 t22 t31 t18 t0 t6 t18 t35 t13 t13 t3 t13 t5 t14 t30` \n\nI'll split this into two parts. Suppose the first part is from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nWait, but what's NT81's production? NT81 -> NT95 NT90 or perhaps another rule. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the top-level production is S -> NT81 NT90. So according to this, S generates the string by concatenating what NT81 can produce and what NT90 can produce.\n\nTherefore, the given string should be a concatenation of NT81's part and NT90's part.\n\nSo let's see if we can split the string into two parts: first n symbols from NT81 and the remaining from NT90.\n\nWhat's NT90's possible output? Looking at the grammar, NT90's rules:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, the only rule I see for NT90 is NT90 -> 't14'. So NT90 can produce the string 't14'. So any string generated by NT90 must be just 't14'.\n\nWait, so in the given string, looking for 't14's: the string has t14 at positions 4, 12, and 33 (if I count correctly starting from 0).

{"custom_id":"request-684","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of productions that replace non-terminals with other non-terminals and terminals. The string to check is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like t34 t24 t23 and so on.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production either generates two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, parsing the string can be done by building a parse tree from the bottom up using these productions.\n\nThe string given is: t34 t24 t23 t35 t14 t35 t13 t31 t5 t33 t20 t10 t6 t10 t32 t33 t29 t18 t29 t24 t1 t18 t13 t32 t0 t14 t20 t14 t22 t34 t1 t29 t7 t23 t13 t29 t30 t23.\n\nI notice that the string consists solely of terminals, no non-terminals. So, every terminal in the string must be the result of some production in the grammar. My task is to check if each terminal in the string can be derived via some production.\n\nLet me see. The first step is to list all the terminals used in the string: 34,24,23,35,14,13,31,5,33,20,10,6,32,33,29,18,19 (wait, wait, 19? Let me check the string again. The string is: t34 t24 t23 t35 t14 t35 t13 t31 t5 t33 t20 t10 t6 t10 t32 t33 t29 t18 t29 t24 t1 t18 t13 t32 t0 t14 t20 t14 t22 t34 t1 t29 t7 t23 t13 t29 t30 t23.\n\nLooking again, I think I miscounted. Let me list them properly:\n\n1. t34\n2. t24\n3. t23\n4. t35\n5. t14\n6. t35\n7. t13\n8. t31\n9. t5\n10. t33\n11. t20\n12. t10\n13. t6\n14. t10\n15. t32\n16. t33\n17. t29\n18. t18\n19. t29\n20. t24\n21. t1\n22. t18\n23. t13\n24. t32\n25. t0\n26. t14\n27. t20\n28. t14\n29. t22\n30. t34\n31. t1\n32. t29\n33. t7\n34. t23\n35. t13\n36. t29\n37. t30\n38. t23\n\nSo the terminals are t34, t24, t23, t35, t14, t13, t31, t5, t33, t20, t10, t6, t32, t18, t19... Wait, wait, is there a t19 here? Let me count again. Hmm, the 18th terminal is t18, 19th is t29, then t34, t1, t18, t13, t32, t0, t14, t20, t14, t22, t34, t1, t29, t7, t23, t13, t29, t30, t23. No, I don't see a t19. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Wait, the string starts with t34, t24, t23, t35, t14, t35, t13, t31, t5, t33, t20, t10, t6, t10, t32, t33, t29, t18, t29, t24, t1, t18, t13, t32, t0, t14, t20, t14, t22, t34, t1, t29, t7, t23, t13, t29, t30, t23.\n\nSo no t19; instead, there's t29, t18, t13, etc. I need to check each terminal to see if it's present in the grammar as terminal symbols.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that some symbols like t34, t24, etc., are terminals because there are productions that map them directly. For example, there's a production NT7 \u2192 t1, NT77 \u2192 t34, NT35 \u2192 t18, NT55 \u2192 t31, NT25 \u2192 t15, etc. So some of the t's correspond to non-terminals, while others are terminals.\n\nWait, no: in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So any symbol on the right-hand side that isn't a non-terminal (i.e., appears as a terminal in the grammar) must be a terminal in the language.\n\nSo, first, I need to identify which symbols in the string are terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT77 \u2192 t34\n- NT35 \u2192 t18\n- NT55 \u2192 t31\n- NT25 \u2192 t15\n- NT86 \u2192 t32\n- NT39 \u2192 t33\n- NT88 \u2192 t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n- NT43 \u2192 t20\n- NT13 \u2192 t15\n- NT60 \u2192 t24\n- NT12 \u2192 t35\n- NT69 \u2192 t34\n- NT51 \u2192 t32\n- NT48 \u2192 t23\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t6\n- NT43 \u2192 t1\n- NT13 \u2192 t0\n- NT28 \u2192 t34\n- NT60 \u2192 t5\n- NT48 \u2192 t29\n- NT51 \u2192 t22\n- NT83 \u2192 t23\n- NT90 \u2192 t14\n- NT7 \u2192 t20\n- NT98 \u2192 t24\n\nWait, I think I need to parse this correctly. Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT7 \u2192 t1 means that NT7 can be replaced by the terminal t1. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 t34 means NT77 can be replaced by t34.\n\nSo any occurrence of these t's in the string must correspond to a production that directly generates them. For instance, if the string has t34, I need to check if there's a production that outputs t34. Looking at the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 t24, NT12 \u2192 t35, NT69 \u2192 t34, NT60 \u2192 t5, and NT28 \u2192 t34.\n\nSo t34 is a terminal generated by NT69, NT28. So in the string, every occurrence of t34 can be linked back to either NT69 or NT28.\n\nSimilarly, t24 is generated by NT60 (from the production NT60 \u2192 t24) and other productions may generate t24 through other means, but in this case, it's directly t24.\n\nSo now, going back to the string. The string has t34, t24, t23, t35, t14, and so on. Each of these must be a terminal in the grammar. I need to check if each t in the string is present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar's productions only have some of these t's. Let me list all the t's with their numbers to see if they are covered.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt1, t10, t6, t15, t18, t20, t23, t24, t29, t31, t32, t33,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar rules, I can see that NT25 produces t15 and NT37. Wait, but looking through the rules, NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88, and among the terminals, NT86 can produce 't32'. Hmm, maybe I need to break this down step by step.\n\nThe string has a lot of tokens, so I think it's helpful to parse it step by step using the grammar. Parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm can be useful here. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to find a way to decompose the string into the non-terminals.\n\nI'll list all the NT rules again for clarity:\n\n- S -> NT81 NT90\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88\n- NT48 -> NT69 NT74\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT35 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT95 -> NT37 NT18\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n- NT31 -> NT86 NT28\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't29'\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n- NT83 \u2192 't23'\n- NT90 \u2192 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't20'\n- NT98 \u2192 't24'\n\nWait, some rules seem to have the same left-hand side, like NT86 has two different rules: NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88 and NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37. So maybe when I parse, I need to choose the applicable rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has multiple rules for the same NT, so during parsing, I have to consider all possibilities.\n\nLet me try to find a way to parse the string. I'll start with the first token, 't24'. Looking at the grammar, 't24' is produced by NT60 \u2192 t24. So, the first part could be 'nt60'.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S, which is NT81 NT90. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Each of these can further expand until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is long, perhaps it's a good idea to structure it as a series of production steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm. But that's complicated without a systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use memoization and recursive parsing, but again, time-consuming manually.\n\nWait, another approach: see if the string can be broken down into the terminal symbols by matching the grammar.\n\nLooking for the string:\n\nt24 t7 t22 t16 t16 t34 t24 t31 t30 t5 t29 t14 t20 t22 t16 t24 t23 t29 t7 t32 t14 t35 t35 t24 t13 t18 t30 t35 t15 t20 t30 t0 t32 t29 t1 t20 t5 t24 t3.\n\nLet me start by looking for the first occurrence of 't24'.\n\nThe first token is 't24', which is generated by NT60. So, I have NT60 on the left. Now, looking at the rules for NT60: it's NT98 NT55. So NT60 expands into NT98 and NT55.\n\nSo, the string 't24 ...' could be the right expansion for NT60. So, that would consume t24, and then I'm left with parsing the rest of the string starting from NT98 and NT55.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is 't24', so that would correspond to the right-hand side of NT60's production: it's 't24' because according to the rules, NT60 \u2192 t24.\n\nSo, the first step is NT60 \u2192 t24, so the string starts with t24. Then, the next part is the rest of the string, which is everything after t24.\n\nWait, but actually, in the grammar, NT60 can produce 't24' directly. So, the first 't24' matches the production of NT60, so we can consume 't24' as the expansion of NT60. Then, proceed to parse the remaining string.\n\nSo, after 't24', the remaining string is: t7 t22 t16 t16 t34 t24 t31 t30 t5 t29 t14 t20 t22 t16 t24 t23 t29 t7 t32 t14 t35 t35 t24 t13 t18 t30 t35 t15 t20 t30 t0 t32 t29 t1 t20 t5 t24 t3.\n\nSo, now, what about the next step? Let's look at NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55. So, after 't24', we've got NT98 and NT55 to parse. So, the next symbols would need to be the expansion of NT98 and NT55.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't24' is 't7', so 't7' is the next symbol. Let's see if 't7' is generated by NT98 or NT55.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT55 can produce 't31'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT55's rules: NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37. NT67 \u2192 t15, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. NT9 produces 't10', NT82 can produce 't6' (from NT82 \u2192 't6') or 't3' (from NT82 \u2192 't3').\n\nWait, but NT9 is 't10' and NT82 can produce t3 or t6. So, if we have NT67 (which is t15) followed by NT37 (t10 and NT82)."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF has two main characteristics: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That means every production either generates a single terminal symbol or exactly two non-terminals. That's important for building a parsing table or using algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to be pretty extensive with many non-terminals and their respective productions. Each non-terminal seems to be defined by an arrow to either two other non-terminals or a terminal string. That aligns with CNF, so that's good.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: \n\n`t30 t20 t31 t20 t33 t15 t20 t7 t7 t5 t24 t23 t16 t23 t20 t5 t30 t18 t7 t29 t35 t5 t29 t7 t34 t34 t14 t31 t0 t18 t10 t10 t30 t7 t22 t3 t10 t31 t20` \n\nI need to figure out if this entire string can be generated by the given CFG.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a dynamic programming approach like the CYK algorithm might be effective. But since I'm doing this manually, I can try to work through the string step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminal symbols in the string and note their order: t30, t20, t31, t20, t33, t15, t20, t7, t7, t5, t24, t23, t16, t23, t20, t5, t30, t18, t7, t29, t35, t5, t29, t7, t34, t34, t14, t31, t0, t18, t10, t10, t30, t7, t22, t3, t10, t31, t20.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals produce t-values (like NT7 \u2192 t1, NT39 \u2192 t33, etc.), but others have multiple terminal productions, but wait, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So in this case, most of the productions are A \u2192 NTb NTc, but some are A \u2192 t, which would be single terminals. Wait, but in the given grammar, it's mostly A \u2192 NT a NT b, but some are A \u2192 t (like NT7 \u2192 t1, etc.). Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the grammar has, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, but also NT7 \u2192 t1. So yes, some productions for NT7 generate a single terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT13 \u2192 t15, and others are two non-terminals.\n\nSo to parse, each step in the CYK algorithm would consider whether the substring can be matched by any production, either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut since the string is quite long (54 symbols), it's going to be tedious to do this manually. Maybe I can find patterns or find a way to parse the string using the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the grammar is structured in a way that certain non-terminals produce specific terminals or non-terminals, I can map the string to the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is t30. Let me check which non-terminals produce t30.\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT12 \u2192 t30. That's correct because in the grammar, NT12's production is 't30'.\n\nSo to produce t30, the non-terminal must be NT12.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the end of the string, the last symbol is t20. So let's see which non-terminal produces t20. From the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't20', right? Wait in the grammar, the production is written as NT20 -> 't20' \u2013 wait no, checking above:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 t1, NT77 \u2192 t34, etc. Wait, for example, NT73 \u2192 t30? Wait let me check the productions.\n\nWait in the provided grammar, the specific production is: NT55 -> NT67 NT37.\n\nBut looking for which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55 (doesn't help for t30)\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 t10? Or no, because NT95 \u2192 t0, t9, etc. Wait NT95 has two productions: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 t13. Wait, wait.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule and note which non-terminals produce t-values.\n\nLooking one by one:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT77 \u2192 t34\n- NT82 \u2192 't3' (Wait, NT82 \u2192 't3'? Or NT82 has two productions: one to t3 and another to 't3'? Wait the provided grammar has NT82 -> 't3' but also appears again as NT95 \u2192 't13' under a different production.

Wait original list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- Also, NT7 \u2192 t1\n\nSo NT7 can produce a single terminal t1 or a combination NT48 NT35.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals:\n\n20. NT82 \u2192 t3\n21. NT20 \u2192 t16\n22. NT98 \u2192 t31\n23. NT67 \u2192 t15\n24. NT12 \u2192 t30\n25.

{"custom_id":"request-703","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar provided has a bunch of production rules, and the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. That aligns with the given grammar. Now, the string provided is a series of terminal symbols, and I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t3 t15 t13 t30 t6 t13 t33 t0 t29 t22 t23 t31 t29 t14 t6 t7 t33 t18 t1 t16 t30 t31 t0 t10 t3 t24 t0 t20 t33 t6 t30 t23 t23 t5 t3 t6 t33 t31 t31 t3`.\n\nI notice that in the grammar, several symbols end with 't', like 't1', 't2', etc., which are likely terminal symbols. The goal is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S produces NT81 and NT90: S -> NT81 NT90. So the first step is to check if the string starts with NT81 or NT90.\n\nWait, no, because in the grammar, S is NT81 followed by NT90. So the string should start with NT81 and then NT90. Looking at the string, the first symbol is 't3'. Wait, no\u2014the string has 't3' as the first symbol, but NT81 might produce a sequence of terminals starting with something else.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules for NT81 and NT90. Oh, looking back, I see that NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and NT60 -> NT98 NT55, and so on. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this as a parsing problem, trying to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's probably better to look for a systematic way. Maybe I can represent the string as a list of tokens and see if each can be matched by the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string tokens as they are:\n\nt3, t15, t13, t30, t6, t13, t33, t0, t29, t22, t23, t31, t29, t14, t6, t7, t33, t18, t1, t16, t30, t31, t0, t10, t3, t24, t0, t20, t33, t6, t30, t23, t23, t5, t3, t6, t33, t31, t31, t3.\n\nNow, each of these is a single terminal symbol except when they might be part of non-terminals. But since all the symbols in the string are t followed by numbers, they are terminal symbols unless they are part of a non-terminal that's been expanded into these.\n\nWait, no. The grammar consists of production rules where each non-terminal expands into other non-terminals or terminal symbols. Terminal symbols in the grammar are the ones that end with 't', like t3, t15, etc. So each of these is a terminal symbol. So the string we have consists of a sequence of terminals, each of which must be matched by some production.\n\nThe challenge is to see if this exact sequence can be generated by expanding the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nI can model this as a top-down parsing problem, starting from S and trying to generate the string.\n\nFirst, S expands into NT81 and NT90. So the string should start with NT81 followed by NT90. But in the string, the first symbol is 't3', which corresponds to the terminal tokens. So I need to see how NT81 and NT90 might generate these.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent each terminal symbol and see which non-terminals they can be produced by. For example, t3 could be produced by NT81, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT81 directly producing t3. Instead, NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9. So that would mean that the first two symbols in the string should be from NT95 and NT9, respectively.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify. Each step of expansion is based on the production rules. For instance, S -> NT81 NT90. So the first expansion is generating two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. The string starts with t3, which is a terminal symbol. So in the derivation, after S, the next step would be to expand NT81 and NT90. But since NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals, each must be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, but NT81 and NT90 are part of the S expansion. So I need to see how NT81 and NT90 can expand into the terminal symbols. From the grammar, I can see that some of these non-terminals may produce a terminal token directly. For example, looking for production rules where a non-terminal produces a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules provided, for example:\n\nNT7 -> t1\nNT77 -> t34\nNT55 -> t6\nNT74 -> t31\nNT26 -> t33\nNT25 -> t5 (Wait, no, looking back: NT25 -> t15 in another rule.)\n\nWait, let me parse the production rules correctly. The grammar is provided in a format where each line is a rule like NTxyz -> A B or NTxyz -> tnumber.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> t1\n- NT77 -> t34\n- NT55 -> t6\n- NT74 -> t31\n- NT26 -> t33\n- NT25 -> t15 or t5?

{"custom_id":"request-706","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of symbols separated by spaces, and each symbol probably represents a terminal or non-terminal variable based on the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar to understand the structure. Each rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, which is typical for CNF. terminals are lowercase letters, and non-terminals are uppercase.\n\nLooking at the rules, all the non-terminals eventually break down into terminals. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT81 NT90. So each step takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two others until we get to the terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like t18, t3, etc. The idea is that each 'tX' corresponds to a terminal rule. For example, looking at the rules, NT7 can become t1 or t20. Similarly, each non-terminal has specific expansion rules into two terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, I should create a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT88. Each of these continues until we get to the terminals.\n\nBut parsing this manually is complicated, especially with a string of 40 symbols. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can map each part of the string to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can start from the string and try to apply the reverse process. Starting from the beginning of the string, see if each pair of symbols can be matched by a right-hand side of some rule.\n\nWait, the string is a concatenation of 't's and digits. So, for example, 't18 t3' would correspond to the expansion of NT18 \u2192 't18' followed by NT3 \u2192 't3'. But in the grammar, are there rules that lead to such a combination?\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to see if there's a rule that has terms 't18' and 't3' as part of it. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by chaining together expansions from the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that each symbol in the string is a terminal, so we need to see how each 'tX' is derived. For instance, 't18' comes from NT18 \u2192 NT77 | NT7. But NT77 is another rule: NT77 \u2192 NT35 | NT34. Wait, looking at the rules, NT77 is NT77 \u2192 NT34. Hmm, that might lead to t34 or t77, but I don't see NT34 being a terminal. Wait, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check:\n\nIn the rules, for NT77 \u2192 NT34. Oh, right, so if NT77 \u2192 NT34, and NT34 is... Looking through, I don't see NT34 in the rules. Wait, let me check the full list.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT77 \u2192 NT34. Then, does NT34 have a rule? Let me see the list. Scanning through, I don't see any NT34 definition. Wait, that's a problem because if NT77 \u2192 NT34, and there's no rule for NT34, that would mean NT34 is unproductive. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, looking back: The original grammar has rules like NT77 \u2192 NT34, but in the provided list, I don't see any rule for NT34, so maybe it's supposed to be a terminal. Looking through the list, I see that NT22, NT33, etc., are terminals. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT73 isn't there, but for example, NT18 \u2192 NT77. If NT77 \u2192 NT34, but there's no rule for NT34, that's a problem. Maybe I'm mislooking. Wait, maybe NT34 is a terminal? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the rules starting from the top:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT34\n- NT34? I don't see NT34 defined. So unless NT34 is a terminal, but the only terminals I see in the input string are 't' followed by numbers. Since NT34 is supposed to be a terminal if it appears in the string as 't34'.\n\nWait, in the string, I see 't34' appearing multiple times. So if NT34 \u2192 't34', then when NT77 \u2192 NT34, that would produce 't34'. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nBut in the given grammar, for NT77, the rule is NT77 \u2192 NT34. But where is NT34's rule? Looking again, I don't see any rule for NT34 in the provided list. That could mean that NT34 is a terminal, possibly 't34', as it's present in the string.\n\nBut without a rule for NT34, how does the parser handle that? Maybe it's assumed that if a non-terminal isn't expanded further, it's replaced by a terminal. Or perhaps the grammar is ill-formed, but since the string contains 't34' and 't77', I think NT77 \u2192 NT34 is allowed, and NT34 must be a terminal, which is 't34'.\n\nSo, when parsing, whenever we encounter NT77, we can replace it with 't34'.\n\nSo, let's reconstruct the parse step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nThen, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 is replaced by 't9'? Wait, looking at the rules, there's NT9 \u2192 't9' (from NT9 \u2192 't9').\n\nSimilarly, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, which then needs to be broken down.\n\nEach non-terminal is expanded step by step until we reach terminals.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but maybe I can approach it by trying to map the string from the start, ensuring each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to the sequence S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 ... expanding all the way down. But considering the length, the string is 35 symbols long, which is quite long, so I need a systematic way.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each 't' in the string must come from a terminal rule. So, every 't' must have come from an NT that has a rule leading to that 't' directly.\n\nLet me check for 't18' in the string. 't18' occurs as the 1st symbol. Which NT could produce 't18'? Looking at the rules, NT18 \u2192 NT77 and NT35. So NT18 \u2192 't77' or 't35'. But the string starts with 't18', which is different. So wait, that's a problem. If NT18 can only produce 't77' or 't35', but the string has 't18', that would mean that 't18' isn't possible.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Did I misread the grammar? Looking back: The rules for NT18 \u2192 NT77 | NT35. So NT18 expands into either NT77 or NT35. Then, NT35 \u2192 't35' and NT77 \u2192 't34' as earlier. So NT18 can't directly produce 't18'. Therefore, the first symbol 't18' cannot come from NT18.\n\nThis suggests that the string 't18 t3 t18 t35 t16...' is invalid because 't18' is not produced by any rule in the grammar. Thus, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, am I making a mistake here? Let me verify the rules again. The given grammar has NT18 \u2192 NT77 | NT35. So NT18 can't produce 't18' because neither NT77 nor NT35 produce 't18'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't18', which would require a rule that outputs 't18'. However, in the grammar, no such rule exists. NT35 produces 't35', NT25 \u2192 't25', etc. So the first term 't18' can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step. \n\nFirst, let's understand what I'm dealing with. The grammar is given with a bunch of production rules, each of the form A -> BC, except for the terminals which are just 't' followed by numbers. For example, some rules are S -> NT81 NT90, and others are things like NT7 -> 't1'. So each non-terminal is replaced by two other non-terminals except when they're terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t22 t3 t6 t3 t30 t7 t7 t5 t34 t7 t18 t13 t20 t16 t13 t15 t18 t29 t10 t6 t22 t30 t18 t20 t23 t14 t33 t16 t33 t35 t33 t7 t20 t5 t31 t33 t7 t1 t30 t32 t13`. That's a lot of tokens, but let's see.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in a derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. Starting from S, each production replaces a non-terminal with two others, but when a non-terminal is a terminal (like 't3'), it's added to the string.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I can try to parse it using the grammar. Parsing strategies include the CYK algorithm or recursive descent. But since the grammar is small, maybe I can find a leftmost derivation or use the fact that in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. \n\nWait, let me think about the properties of CNF. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. That simplifies the parsing because each step adds exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal). Since our string is a sequence of terminals, I might need to build up pairs of terminals through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol in the string (except the initial S) is either a terminal or part of a production. But all the symbols here are terminals, which suggests that each production must lead directly to a terminal at some step.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, non-terminals can be expanded into other non-terminals. So maybe I need to track how the symbols in the string can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me look at the first symbol in the string: 't22'. Looking at the grammar, let's see if any non-terminal expands to 't22'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT73 says that NT7\u2192't1', but wait, I don't see a rule for NT22. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of productions. Let me scan through them properly.\n\nHmm, looking through the list, several rules have 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT82 \u2192 't6', NT95 \u2192 't13', etc. So 't22' must come from some NT that produces 't22'. Let's look through all the terminals:\n\nLooking at 't22' in the string, the first 't22' is in position 1 of the string (assuming the first token is index 1). So, I need to find which non-terminal produces 't22'.\n\nLooking through the given productions, does any NT rule produce 't22'? Scanning through:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't18', which is 't18'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15' (from NT13 -> 't15'?)\nWait, let me check each terminal:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' (line 17)\nNT77 \u2192 't34' (line 22)\nNT35 \u2192 't18' (line 25)\nNT95 \u2192 't13' (line 27)\nNT55 \u2192 't6' (line 28)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me go through each one:\n\nLooking through each production line, the terminals are at the end:\n\nLines like:\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\nNT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n...\nNT25 -> 't15' (line 24)\nWait, yes, looking at line 24: NT25 \u2192 't15' (from NT25 -> 't15')\nSimilarly, NT9 \u2192 't1' (line 10)\nLooking for 't22', I see NT22 is not a terminal. Wait, no, I don't see a definition for NT22. Wait, maybe a non-terminal produces 't22' as a result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In the given grammar, are any non-terminals producing 't22' directly? Or is 't22' part of a production? Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (line 17)\n- NT77 \u2192 't34' (line 22)\n- NT35 \u2192 't18' (line 25)\n- NT95 \u2192 't13' (line 27)\n- NT55 \u2192 't6' (line 28)\n- NT25 \u2192 't15' (line 24)\n- NT86 \u2192 't32' (line 8)\n- NT43 \u2192 't20' (line 12)\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (line 17)\n- NT98 \u2192 't31' (line 4)\n- NT86 \u2192 't22' (line 5)\nWait! Oh, look at line 5: NT86 \u2192 't22'. There we go. So NT86 expands to 't22' and something else. So 't22' must be the result of NT86 \u2192 't22' followed by something else, but in the string, after 't22', the next token is 't3'.\n\nWait, no, in the string, it's 't22 t3 ...', so 't22' is followed by 't3'. But if NT86 expands to 't22' and something else, then the next symbol would have to be from the other part of the production. Let me check what NT86 expands to.\n\nFrom the given grammar, looking at NT86:\n\nNT86 is defined in multiple places. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88 (line 5: 'NT86 -> NT51 NT88')\n- Also at line 20: NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n- And at line 16: NT86 -> NT32 (wait, no, line 8 is NT82 -> 't6'\n\nWait, line 5 says NT86 -> NT51 NT88\nLine 20: NT86 -> NT25 NT37\nLine 5 again: NT86 -> NT32? Wait, line 5 says 'NT86 -> NT51 NT88' and line 20 says 'NT86 -> NT25 NT37'. Wait, perhaps a typo in the question. Or maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, in the question's grammar, it says:\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\n...\nLooking again, the given grammar has NT86 -> NT51 NT88 (line 5), and NT86 -> NT25 NT37 (line 20), and perhaps another line where NT86 -> 't32'?\n\nWait, the user's grammar ends with... the last line is 'NT77 -> 't34''. So in the grammar provided, is there a production for NT86 that results in 't22'? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nThe rule for NT86 is:\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\nNT86 -> NT32 (is this correct? Wait, line 8: 'NT82 -> 't6'.

{"custom_id":"request-715","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm staring at this problem, and honestly, it's a bit overwhelming. But let's try to break it down step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me remind myself what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol cannot be a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking closer, some rules have two terminals on the right side. For example, NT31 \u2192 't86' NT28, which is a terminal and a non-terminal. That might complicate things because in CNF, each production should have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But the initial statement said it's in CNF, so perhaps I'm mistaken. Alternatively, maybe the grammar uses a mixed form, but that might complicate the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this grammar, the productions allow for a terminal followed by a non-terminal or a non-terminal followed by a non-terminal, but I'm not sure if that's considered CNF. Wait, no, standard CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So in the given grammar, some productions have terminals on the right side, like NT7 \u2192 't1', which is a single terminal. So that's acceptable. However, other productions have two terminals on the right, like NT82 \u2192 't6' and 't22'? Wait, no, looking again, actually, some rules have three symbols on the right. For example, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT90. Each production has two non-terminals. Hmm, but wait, the example given in the question has a rule like NT82 \u2192 't6' but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the user provided the grammar with lines like NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT83, but some rules have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, looking carefully, the problem statement includes some rules like NT82 \u2192 't6' which is a terminal, so that's fine. But there are also rules like NT86 \u2192 NT51 't37' or something else? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the grammar given:\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\nNT13 \u2192 't15'\nNT28 \u2192 't34'\nNT39 \u2192 't33'\nNT88 \u2192 't7'\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\nNT55 \u2192 't67'\nWait, no, for example, NT55 \u2192 't67' NT37. Hmm, but in the grammar provided, some non-terminals are being rewritten into a terminal followed by a non-terminal. So, for example, NT55 \u2192 't67' NT37. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production should have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So perhaps this grammar isn't in strict Chomsky Normal Form because some productions have a terminal followed by a non-terminal. But the problem states it's in CNF, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar uses a different form but is somehow equivalent to CNF. But for the purpose of solving this problem, I'll proceed.\n\nThe next step is to parse the given string using the grammar. The string is: \n\nt30 t13 t18 t16 t10 t35 t13 t31 t18 t34 t0 t6 t22 t20 t33 t0 t3 t10 t20 t10 t34 t14 t18 t18 t13 t5 t7 t7 t34 t23 t15 t29 t31 t32 t6 t24 t0 t18 t10 t22 t18.\n\nSo, each 'tX' is a terminal symbol, meaning it's a leaf node in the parse tree.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of any string must be such that the length of the string (in symbols) is one more than the number of productions. So, for example, a string of length n must have a derivation involving (n-1) productions, each expanding a single non-terminal symbol into two others, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the grammar's productions can have two non-terminals each, each step would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, increasing the length by one each time. But in CNF, actually, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, when you expand a symbol, it's replaced by two symbols, thus increasing the length of the string.\n\nWait, let me think: in a typical CNF grammar, each production expands a single non-terminal into two symbols. So starting with the start symbol, S, each step increases the number of symbols by one. Therefore, the length of the derived string would be equal to the number of steps taken plus one.\n\nIn our case, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT90 and NT81 (from the first production: S -> NT90 NT81). So, the initial string is two symbols: NT90 and NT81. Each of these can be expanded into two non-terminals each, so the next step would produce four non-terminals, but eventually, when they are replaced by terminals, the total length would be a sum based on the number of expansions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as a parse tree and see if the given string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, considering the complexity, maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but given the size of the string, that's impractical. So maybe instead, I can try to see if each token in the string can be matched by the grammar starting from the given non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the grammar is given for all the non-terminals, I can map each terminal token in the string to its corresponding non-terminal and see if they can be generated.\n\nBut wait, every non-terminal is defined as a production of other non-terminals and terminals. So, each non-terminal in the grammar is a node that, when encountered, must be replaceable by the rules defined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each terminal as being generated by a specific non-terminal, and see if the entire string can be broken down into these non-terminals that have productions that can derive the string.\n\nSo, let's map each 'tX' token in the string to the non-terminal that generates it.\n\nFirst, let's reference the grammar to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT18 \u2192 't16'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT20 \u2192 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6', 't22'?\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, some rules have a single terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, I see:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't86' NT28\nWait, so actually, the rule is NT31 \u2192 't86' NT28, which is a terminal and a non-terminal. But according to Chomsky Normal Form, that should just be two non-terminals, but one of them is a terminal, which is against CNF. So this might imply that the grammar is not in proper CNF, which is confusing because the problem states it is.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me check the grammar again in the problem statement. Looking at each line:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT88 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't67' NT37\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, perhaps some are like NT55 \u2192 't67' NT37, meaning they generate a terminal followed by a non-terminal. That would not fit CNF, but the problem says it is in CNF. So perhaps the terminals are being handled differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is not a binary tree grammar but allows for terminals at the leaves. So, the productions can have a terminal followed by a non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. I notice that every production rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and produces two non-terminals on the right. That makes sense for CNF. The start symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. So, every string generated by this grammar will start with two parts corresponding to NT81 and NT90.\n\nNow, I need to look at the string to evaluate: `t34 t30 t31 t18 t34 t18 t29 t13 t13 t32 t34 t20 t10 t7 t33 t3 t1 t6 t14 t23 t23 t23 t1 t6 t22 t3 t0 t35 t16 t3 t7 t6 t5 t0 t33 t20 t5 t13 t14 t16 t1 t33`. \n\nI think the approach here is to see if the string can be broken down into the symbols produced by each non-terminal in the grammar.

Each production rule is in the form of Non-terminal -> Non-terminal Non-terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So every substitution must produce two parts. Now, the given string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are terminal symbols.\n\nSo the approach is to parse the string from left to right, replacing two terminal symbols (since they come from the productions) with the non-terminal that produces them, and then continue this process until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to do that step by step.\n\nThe string given is: \n\nt34 t30 t31 t18 t34 t18 t29 t13 t13 t32 t34 t20 t10 t7 t33 t3 t1 t6 t14 t23 t23 t23 t1 t6 t22 t3 t0 t35 t16 t3 t7 t6 t5 t0 t33 t20 t5 t13 t14 t16 t1 t33.\n\nI'll write this as a sequence of tokens: [t34, t30, t31, t18, t34, t18, t29, t13, t13, t32, t34, t20, t10, t7, t33, t3, t1, t6, t14, t23, t23, t23, t1, t6, t22, t3, t0, t35, t16, t3, t7, t6, t5, t0, t33, t20, t5, t13, t14, t16, t1, t33]\n\nNow, I'm going to try to parse this using the grammar rules. I'll start from the beginning and try to see if each pair of tokens matches any of the productions.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Let's see if the first two tokens match NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking through the terminal list I made earlier:\n\n- NT81: t30\n- NT90: t14\n\nSo, the first two tokens are t34 and t30. Does t34 match NT81? No. Wait, in the grammar, NT81 produces t30, so t30 is NT81. But the first token is t34, which is not NT81, which is t30. So, maybe I need to see if the first token can be part of another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The productions are Non-terminals on the left, so for example, NT81 could produce t30, but in the string, the first token is t34. So, perhaps t34 is in the right-hand side of some production.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals and which NT they correspond to:\n\nTerminals:\n\n- t34: NT82 (as seen in NT82 \u2192 t6 and others, but t34 is from NT82 \u2192 t34? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some terminals are connected. For example, NT28 \u2192 t34, so t34 is NT28. Similarly, NT51 \u2192 t32, but wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to actually list each terminal and which NT it corresponds to.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\n\nNT77 \u2192 t34\n\nSo, for NT7, the production is t1, and for NT77, it's t34. So, the terminal t34 is produced by NT77.\n\nSimilarly, looking at all the production rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT77 \u2192 t34\n- NT35 \u2192 t18\n- NT95 \u2192 t13\n- NT86 \u2192 t32\n- NT90 \u2192 t14\n- NT18 \u2192 t20\n- NT81 \u2192 t30\n- NT98 \u2192 t31\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n- NT43 \u2192 t35\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n- NT48 \u2192 t23\n- NT51 \u2192 t32\n- NT83 \u2192 t23\n- NT95 \u2192 t0\n- NT43 \u2192 t1\n- NT13 \u2192 t15\n- NT60 \u2192 t24\n- NT48 \u2192 t29\n- NT51 \u2192 t22\n- NT83 \u2192 t23\n- NT90 \u2192 t14\n- NT7 \u2192 t20\n- NT98 \u2192 t24\n- Also, I noticed that NT95 has multiple productions, like NT95 \u2192 t13, t1, t0.\n\nWait, so each terminal is tied to a specific NT.

{"custom_id":"request-730","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string is a series of \"t\" followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. \n\nLet me try to understand the structure of the problem. The grammar consists of multiple productions, each starting with a non-terminal and breaking down into smaller non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be generated by starting from the start symbol S and expanding it according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT81 NT90. Looking at each of these, NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals. So, the string must be built from expanding these non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string to analyze it better: the string is `t22 t35 t18 t30 t35 t30 t30 t23 t10 t35 t31 t16 t7 t0 t24 t0 t14 t31 t34 t20 t33 t6 t35 t34 t29 t16 t20 t34 t32 t23 t33 t13 t15 t29 t14 t34 t23 t6 t29 t1 t16 t7`. \n\nThis is quite long, 47 tokens. Each production in the grammar seems to split a non-terminal into two parts, some of which might be terminals or more non-terminals. So, the string's length must be compatible with the number of steps in the derivation.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps from the start symbol. For example, if it's a derivation of depth 3 (n=3), the string length would be 2^3 = 8. Wait, n is the number of steps in production, so the length increases exponentially.\n\nBut the string here has 47 tokens. Hmm, let's see. Let me count the number of tokens: after splitting, it's 47. But 47 is not a power of 2, so that suggests that maybe the string can't be generated by this grammar, right? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the counting is different because each non-terminal can break into more parts, but in this case, it's always two parts per production.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Chomsky Normal Form allows each production to split into two, but when you have a full derivation, the length of the string is 2^n, starting from the start symbol. So, if the start symbol S produces two symbols, then each step doubles the number of symbols. So, from S (length 1), after one step it's two symbols (length 2), after two steps, four symbols, etc. So, the total number of tokens must be a power of two.\n\nLooking at 47, it's not a power of two. The nearest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). So, 47 is in between. Therefore, since 47 isn't equal to any 2^n, this suggests the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Maybe each production can produce two elements, but some of them might be terminals, so the actual string length can be more complicated. Hmm, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So when you expand all non-terminals, the string's length would be exactly the number of non-terminals converted to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Each non-terminal might produce a fixed number of terminals when expanded, but I think it's more complicated. Let's take the start symbol S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S generates two non-terminals, which then each expand. NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals, each of which could produce one or more terminal symbols or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, each production is A \u2192 BC, so each non-terminal must be broken down step by step into terminals and other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo, each step in the derivation increases the count by a factor of two if the non-terminals are replaced by two others. But since some might end in terminals, perhaps the length could be built in a way that isn't restricted to powers of two.\n\nWait no, each production is exactly two parts, so each step from a non-terminal would replace it with two items. So, the total number of items in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps starting from the start symbol. So, for example, if S is replaced at step 0, then at step 1, it becomes NT81 NT90, so two items, at step 2, each could produce two more, so up to four, etc.\n\nThus, any string generated would have a length that is a power of two. Therefore, a string of length 47 cannot be generated because 47 is not a power of two. So, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me count the number of tokens again. The given string is a space-separated list of 't' followed by numbers. So, each part is a token.\n\nLooking at the string again: it's written as a sequence like t22, t35, t18, etc., each separated by spaces. So that would be 47 tokens. Since 47 isn't a power of two, the string can't be formed by a grammar that expands each non-terminal into exactly two parts each time. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the given grammar.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the grammar cannot generate this string because the length isn't a power of two. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 47 tokens, which is not a power of 2, so it cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-737","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like \"t32 t10 t10 t30...\", and the grammar consists of several non-terminals that seem to be expanding into these t<...> tokens.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, the terminals are the t followed by a number, like t32, t10, etc.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of these terminals, so each part of the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. My task is to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT81 NT90. So the string must start with whatever NT81 produces and then NT90 produces. Let's check the string: it starts with t32 t10. So NT81 must expand to produce \"t32\" and NT90 must produce \"t10\". Let's check the productions for NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81:\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT9 -> 't10' (from the given rules)\nNT95 -> 't0' or more specifically, in the grammar, NT95 has several productions but the one relevant here is NT95 -> 't10' (from the last lines where NT95 -> 't10' is stated). Wait, no, looking back, the production for NT95 is actually in two places: one as NT95 -> NT25 NT60 and another as NT95 -> 't10'. So NT95 can produce 't10' directly.\n\nSo, let's see, if NT81 -> NT95 NT9, then the production would be NT95's expansion followed by NT9's expansion. NT9 is 't10' and NT95 can be 't10' as per one of its productions. So NT81 would expand to 't10' 't10'.\n\nNext, NT90's production is NT90 -> 't14', as per the last line given: NT90 -> 't14'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t10 t10, which matches \"t32 t10...\" Wait, no, the string starts with t32 t10. So there's a mismatch because according to the grammar, S -> NT81 NT90 would produce NT81 expanded as t10 t10, followed by NT90 as t14. So the start should be t10 t10 t14, but the string starts with t32 t10, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that suggests that either I'm missing something or the string doesn't start correctly. Let's double-check the grammar. NT81 is indeed S's first production: S -> NT81 NT90. And NT81's expansion is either NT95 NT9, which when followed by NT9 (t10) gives t10 t10. Unless there's another way for NT81 to expand. Wait, looking at the grammar, is there another production for NT81? I don't think so; the only rule is NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So NT95 is either a terminal or further expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me look again. Each line is a production. So for NT81, the production is written as NT81 -> NT95 NT9, which are non-terminals. So NT81's expansion is two non-terminals. Therefore, it cannot directly produce terminal symbols like t32 or t10. Instead, those terminals must come from further expanding those non-terminals.\n\nThat makes the initial approach flawed. The string starts with t32 t10, but that would require that NT81 expands into a production that results in t32 followed by something else, and then NT90 expands into t10. But based on the grammar, NT81 only expands into two non-terminals, so t32 must come from NT81's expansion chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach. Let's start by trying to parse the string step by step, considering all possible production chains.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt32 t10 t10 t30 t15 t7 t18 t18 t30 t29 t16 t34 t10 t10 t10 t29 t23 t29 t1 t13 t20 t7 t22 t18 t18 t1 t7 t1 t23 t24 t0 t35 t10 t14 t6 t30 t0 t34 t6 t0 t13 t13 t30.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which is NT81 NT90. Therefore, the string must start with NT81 expanded and followed by NT90 expanded. So the first two parts of the string (after S) must come from the expansions of NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo, let's see what NT90 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT90 -> 't14' (from the last line: NT90 -> 't14'). So NT90 must directly produce t14. But the string starts with t32, which can't be t14. That suggests that maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is not NT81 NT90 but some other derivation. No, the start symbol is clearly S -> NT81 NT90. So the first part must be NT81's expansion, then NT90's. Therefore, the string's first part should start with NT81's expansion, which ends with t10 t10, but the string starts with t32 t10. That's a conflict.\n\nWait maybe I'm getting the ordering wrong. S is NT81 followed by NT90. So when expanding, it's NT81's expansion followed by NT90's. So the string starts with NT81's expansion, then NT90's. Thus, the entire string must be a concatenation of what NT81 expands to and what NT90 expands to. But since S is the entire thing, the string is exactly NT81's production followed by NT90's.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Each non-terminal in S's production is expanded into its own string, and the entire string is the concatenation of those two parts. So the first part comes from NT81, the second part from NT90.\n\nSo NT81's expansion must start with t32, and NT90's must start with t10. But let's see NT90's expansion: NT90 -> 't14' as a terminal. So if the string starts with t14, but it doesn't, it starts with t32. Therefore, the only possibility is that the string is not derived from S, meaning the answer is No. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing that NT90 is a non-terminal that's being expanded in the string. Wait, in the string, the first segment is t32 t10, so perhaps the first t32 comes from NT81, and the next t10 comes from NT90's something else. But according to the grammar, NT90's only production is a terminal t14. Therefore, NT90 cannot produce anything else, so the string cannot start with t10 after NT90, because NT90 must produce t14. Therefore, the string starting with t32 t10... is incompatible with NT90's production.\n\nWait, unless there's a different path. Let me see if there's any other way NT90 could expand. Looking through the grammar, yes, there is NT90 -> 't14' (from the last line: NT90 -> 't14'), so that's a terminal. So if NT90 must produce 't14' directly, then the string cannot start with anything else for NT90. Therefore, the string's first few terms must come from NT81 expanding into something that starts with t32, which would have to be part of NT81's expansion.\n\nBut let's go back to NT81. Its production is NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So NT95 followed by NT9. Now, NT9 is 't10' as a terminal because in the lines, NT9 -> 't10'. So NT95's expansion would start the sequence from NT81, which is part of the string. So, for NT81 to produce t32, the NT95 must expand into t32, and then followed by 't10'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT95 expand into t32?

So, first, I'll split the string into two parts. \n\nWait, no\u2014the start symbol S produces two non-terminals: NT98 and NT90. Each of these will generate their own strings, and the combined result should be the input string. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of the string generated by NT98 and the string generated by NT90. So, the first step is to see if the given string can be divided into two parts where the first part is generated by NT98 and the second by NT90. \n\nSo, let's check: does the string start with t1 followed by terms that fit the production starting with NT98, and then the remaining terms fit NT90? \n\nLooking at the grammar, let's look at NT98 and NT90 rules.\n\nStarting with NT98: It's defined as NT7 and NT39, per NT98 -> NT7 NT39. Then NT7 is defined as NT48 NT35. And NT48 is NT69 NT74. NT90 is another rule? Let me check: looking at the grammar, there are multiple rules, so I need to see which NTs can generate certain sequences. \n\nFirst, I should maybe try to break down each part of the string. Let's start by looking at the string as a whole. The first symbol is t1, which according to the grammar, some NTs produce 't1'. Looking through the grammar, I see rules like NT77 -> t34, NT35 -> t18, NT7 -> t1, etc. Hmm, wait, in the provided grammar, some terminals are given, like:\n\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT95 -> 't0' [Wait, is that the same NT55? Or is this a typo? Let me check.]\n\nWait, looking deeper into the grammar, I notice a conflict for NT95. The rules given include:\n\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT95 -> NT0 (Wait, not sure about this\u2014it might be NT95 -> t0, but in the grammar line provided, I have 'NT95 -> t9'? No, looking back, the grammar as presented has some lines ending with t followed by a number, for example:\n\n- NT33 -> t34\n- NT13 -> t15\n- Wait, perhaps it's better to re-examine the grammar.\n\nLet me try to list all the rules and see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> 't34'\n- NT55 -> 't5'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't23'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT51 -> 't22'\n- NT83 -> 't23'\n- NT90 -> 't14'\n- NT7 -> 't20'\n- NT98 -> 't24'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't35' (Wait, earlier lines like NT12: it's possible, but looking at production NT12, perhaps it's on the left side? Wait, in the grammar, the lines start with NT37, etc. So NT12 -> 't35'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, one line is:\n\n- NT12 -> 't35'\nAnother line: NT95 -> 't0'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-746","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this grammar can generate the given string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because I know each production rule is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The top symbol is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the start symbol S produces NT81 and NT90. Each of these symbols must have a derivation that ends with the appropriate symbols to generate the entire string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t10 t16 t3...\" and ends with \"t33 t16 t3...\", so it's a long sequence of t's. I need to see if each production rule can break down into these t's.\n\nI'll list the production rules for each NT symbol if possible. For example, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT82 \u2192 't3', and so on. Wait, some NT symbols directly produce a 't', like NT82, NT90, etc., so those are terminal symbols.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some NT symbols are non-terminals because they have production rules. For example, NT1, NT2, etc., but in the provided, all NT symbols have some production except maybe the top-level ones.\n\nWait, the NT symbols include numbers like NT7, NT81, etc. Each of these either produce two other NT symbols or a 't' followed by a number, or a 't' alone. For instance, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, which in turn, according to the grammar, maybe have their own productions.\n\nBut wait, looking closer, some non-terminals seem to have both NT productions and 't' productions. For example, NT12 appears twice: NT12 \u2192 't30' and NT12 \u2192 't35'. Hmm, so each occurrence of NT12 in the string would need to be replaced by either 't30' or 't35'. So the string may have inconsistencies if multiple NT12's are used but result in different t's.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice several instances of t10. For example, the string has \"t10 t16 t3 t14 t3 t32 t0 t15 t29 t18 t24 t18 t5 t29 t33 t6 t14 t20 t18 t32 t0 t0 t13 t31 t24 t23 t10 t30 t32 t30 t10 t18 t18 t32 t34 t33 t16 t3 t5 t20 t14 t10 t20 t1.\"\n\nFirst, let's count how many times t10 appears. It appears multiple times, so each of these must come from either a specific production rule or from a terminal. But in the grammar, are there any production rules that directly produce t10? Looking through the NTs: NT10 is not listed, so t10 must come from a product derivation that eventually ends in t10.\n\nLooking further, NT7 \u2192 't1', and other NTs seem to have specific t symbols, but t10 doesn't seem to be a terminal directly. So how is t10 being generated? Maybe through a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t10 comes from a specific non-terminal. Let me check the NTs. Looking through the rules, I see NT77 \u2192 NT34 NT37, but that doesn't lead to t10. Let's see if any NT has t10 as a terminal. Wait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't10'. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT77 \u2192 NT34 NT37\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (in the lower part)\nOh, wait, in the lower part: NT7 \u2192 't1'. So NT7 can produce 't1'. Similarly, looking at NT55 \u2192 't31', etc.\n\nBut for t10, I don't see any NT directly producing it. Hmm. So maybe t10 is derived through a chain where non-terminals eventually lead to t10 via a series of rules. Alternatively, perhaps t10 is reachable through other paths, but I might not have the rules in the given data.\n\nWait, another approach: the string starts with t10, so the first part of the string is t10 t16 t3... So perhaps the initial part of the derivation is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, each of these must be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So to get t10, let's see where NT95 and NT9 go.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. NT25 is another non-terminal. NT25's production? Looking through, NT25 \u2192 NT5 (but wait, no, the given NT25 production is: NT25 \u2192 NT5. Is that correct? Wait, let me check the data again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\nNT25 \u2192 NT5\nWait, no, in the grammar, looking back, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, looking again: the grammar has:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\nNT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\nNT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the full list. Let me check the grammar data given.\n\nThe grammar seems to consist of lines like:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n NT37 -> NT9 NT82\nand so on.\n\nBut wait, for example, looking at NT25: one production is NT25 \u2192 't15'. Similarly, NT60 \u2192 't6', etc.\n\nBut NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, and NT67 \u2192 't15', NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT37 might produce something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me approach this by building the parse tree.\n\nThe string starts with t10. To get t10, it has to come from somewhere. Since the grammar doesn't seem to have any NT directly producing t10, perhaps it's impossible, and hence the answer is No.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. In the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10' \u2192 Oh, wait, in the lower part of the grammar, there's NT9 \u2192 't10'. Yes!\n\nSo NT9 \u2192 't10' directly.\n\nNow, does any production rule have NT9 as a component? Yes, looking at NT37: NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. So NT37 \u2192 't10' 't3'. Therefore, NT37 can directly produce 't10 t3'.\n\nSo if a production has NT37 as a component, it can produce 't10 t3'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the second token is t16. So after t10, we have t16. Let's see how that could happen.\n\nLooking at the beginning, the initial part is t10 t16. So how can 't16' appear after 't10'? Maybe from another NT that has 't16' as part of its derivation.\n\nWait, but looking through the NTs, is there any NT that produces 't16'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see that NT86 \u2192 't32', and maybe NT98 \u2192 't31'. Wait, in the lower part, NT98 is listed: NT98 \u2192 't31'. But that's under NT74: NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, and NT31 \u2192 't35'; wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the grammar data, the lower part of the rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't18'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-751","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's see. The grammar is provided, and the string is a series of tokens like 't13', 't1', etc. Since it's CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. My goal is to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. I see that S starts with NT81 and NT90. So, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Now, each NT symbol seems to be a non-terminal that expands into two other non-terminals, except when it's a terminal like 't1' or 't3'. For example, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 't10'. So, each NT rule is either splitting into two non-terminals or leading directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t tokens. My task is to check if this sequence can be formed by substituting the non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by t's.\n\nLet me break down the string:\n\nt13 t1 t16 t30 t31 t6 t15 t22 t3 t13 t24 t32 t7 t10 t6 t31 t32 t34 t0 t35 t13 t20 t5 t13 t3 t6 t34 t1 t14 t33 t22 t0 t30 t23 t31 t7 t16 t18 t5 t23 t32 t14 t24 t6.\n\nThat's quite a long string, but let's see if I can map it to the grammar. Each production in CNF either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for each production, the left side must be a non-terminal that directly expands into the corresponding output.\n\nOne approach is to start from the string and try to reduce it by matching the right-hand sides of the productions. Let's look for the right-hand sides in the string to identify where a non-terminal expands into two other strings.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the entire string must be derived from NT81 and NT90. Let's see if the string can be divided into two parts that are each derived from NT81 and NT90.\n\nBut wait, the string is a single list of tokens, so we need to partition it accordingly. Maybe the first half could go to NT81 and the second half to NT90, but it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps one NT produces a part of the string and the other produces another part.\n\nWait, but since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT81 and NT90. So, for example, if NT81 produces a sequence and NT90 produces another sequence, the string is the concatenation of these two sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of symbols that must be produced by NT81 and then NT90.\n\nWait, the string starts with t13, which is a terminal. Let's look at where t13 occurs in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT13 \u2192 NT60 NT13, but wait, wait.

{"custom_id":"request-759","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit that structure. Each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal string.\n\nNext, the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. The string is: `t34 t34 t23 t0 t15 t18 t31 t30 t24 t31 t24 t20 t24 t23 t30 t32 t13 t5 t1 t31 t13 t32 t33 t7 t14 t10 t29 t14 t24 t23 t5 t5 t13 t23 t0 t35 t32 t32 t14 t7 t5 t30 t10 t16 t10`. \n\nI notice that 't' represents terminals, and each 't' is followed by a number. My goal is to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions until I reach the terminals. Alternatively, I can create a parse tree to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts as S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first step of the derivation should be S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which would require that the string starts with the concatenation of the sequences that NT81 can generate and NT90 can generate.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terms are t34 t34. So, I need to see if nt81 can derive t34 t34 and nt90 can derive the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no, because S is a combination of two non-terminals, so the string should be split into two parts corresponding to each non-terminal. So maybe the string is split into S1 S2, where S1 is derived from NT81 and S2 from NT90.\n\nBut this seems a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the top-down approach, trying to split the string into parts that match the production rules.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, for each non-terminal, when you derive it, you either produce two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, which is a binary production. So, the part of the string corresponding to NT81 must be the concatenation of the results of NT95 and NT9.\n\nIn the given string, the first part is t34 t34 t23 t0 t15 t18 t31 t30 t24. If I stop here, it's 9 terminals, which seems like a lot. But maybe I need to see how it can be broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start building the parse tree from the start symbol S and see if all the terminals in the string can be covered.\n\nStarting with S, which splits into NT81 and NT90. Let's handle NT81 first.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, I need the next part of the string to be the concatenation of what NT95 can produce and what NT9 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, after S, the next symbols are t34 t34 t23 t0 t15 t18 t31 t30 t24. Hmm, but S is two non-terminals, so the string starts with NT81's derivation and then NT90's.\n\nWait, maybe I should split the string into two parts, each part matching the derivation of NT81 and NT90 respectively.\n\nBut without knowing the exact split point, this approach might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can reverse the process and see if each production leads to a terminal.\n\nLet me start from the leaf nodes (terminals) and see if they can derive up to S.\n\nLooking at the string: the first term is t34, which must be derived from some NT. Looking at the grammar, several non-terminals produce t34. For example, NT82 \u2192 t3, but t34 is a terminal for NT34. Wait, but in the grammar, I see that NT77 \u2192 t38, wait no: let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar rules. The user provided a list of productions. Let's see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT34 NT18\nBut NT34 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal. So wait, but in the given string, we have t34, t34. So where does t34 come from?\n\nLooking at all the production rules, I see that some NTs produce t34. For instance:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't34' or wait no, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, let me go through each production in the grammar and note when a terminal is used:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT34 NT18 \u2192 but NT34 isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal since there's no production for NT34. Similarly, NT51 \u2192 t32, etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to list each NT that directly produces a terminal and note which terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1, t4? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT18 NT77\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT20 \u2192 t16\n- NT31 \u2192 t35\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT35 \u2192 t18\n- NT95 \u2192 t13\n- NT55 \u2192 t67; wait, NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, but that's not a terminal. NT77 \u2192 NT34 NT18, so NT34 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some rules have 't' followed by a number. So, NT95 \u2192 t13, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT88, which are non-terminals, but looking further, I think NT88 \u2192 t7, so for example, NT88 is a non-terminal but produces t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier to apply parsing techniques like CYK. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the string to parse: \n\n`t1 t34 t15 t29 t34 t20 t14 t6 t20 t29 t24 t30 t14 t22 t24 t15 t23 t20 t0 t10 t30 t32 t22 t7 t0 t15 t23 t18 t14 t14 t16 t3 t24 t24 t6 t33 t24 t24 t10 t29 t7 t10 t0 t10 t7`.\n\nThis string has 59 tokens. Since each rule in the grammar produces exactly two non-terminals except for the terminals, I'll need to construct a parsing table or use CYK to see if all tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S is only rewritten into NT81 and NT90. So, the starting point is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. My first token to match should be these NT81 and NT90 steps, but wait, the grammar seems a bit complex with multiple productions for each NT. \n\nI'll approach this step by step. Each step involves expanding a node into two other nodes. Let's see if the first token in the string corresponds to the start symbol's production. The string starts with 't1', which in the grammar is derived from NT7\u2192 't1'. So, NT7 must be part of the left or right side. \n\nLooking back, NT7 appears on the left side of other productions, like S\u2192NT81 NT90, and on the right side in several NT rules. So, perhaps the initial NT is part of a branch. \n\nI think the problem might involve a lot of recursion, and manually tracing this would be time-consuming. Instead, I can use the CYK algorithm steps. \n\nThe CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell corresponds to a substring and tries to find which non-terminals can generate that substring. \n\nFirst, I'll list all the terms in the string. There are 59 of them, which is a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to see if all tokens can be matched by the productions. \n\nI can start by identifying the non-terminals (NT) in the string. Each NT must have a production that directly corresponds to a terminal. For example, 't1' is produced by NT7. So, I can check if NT7 has a production that includes 't1'. Looking at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 and NT7 \u2192 't1'. So, for 't1', the NT7 can be used, which requires having the other symbol as well.\n\nSimilarly, I can check other tokens. For each token, I'll see if there's a NT that can produce it. For example, 't34' is produced by NT31 and NT74. Let's check NT31 and NT74 in the grammar. NT31 has a production NT86 NT28, but also direct rule NT31 \u2192 't35' (I think I might have misread earlier). Wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't35' and NT74 \u2192 't34'. So, 't34' comes from NT74, which is used in production NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83.\n\nWait, but 't34' can also come from NT31 if NT31 has a production that includes 't34', but I think in the grammar, NT31 only goes to 't35'. So, to produce 't34', we must have NT74, which is used in that position.\n\nSimilarly, each token should correspond to a terminal that is directly derived by some NT, possibly through expansion.\n\nSince it's tedious to go through all 59 tokens, perhaps I can try to find a few tokens that might cause a problem. For example, the string starts with 't1' and ends with 't0', which is a high probability as terminals exist in the grammar.\n\nAn alternative approach is to attempt a partial parse. Starting from the beginning, see if the first token can be produced by a NT, then see if the remaining token can be produced by another NT, and so on.\n\nBut this might not work as some steps require combining two non-terminals into a single token. Perhaps I can simulate a few steps of the CYK algorithm.\n\nLet's consider the first token: 't1'. From the grammar, NT7 can produce 't1' via NT7 \u2192 't1'. So, position 1-1 can be matched by NT7.\n\nNext, the second token 't34'. In the grammar, 't34' is produced by NT74 (NT74 \u2192 't34').\n\nSo, we have NT7 \u2192 ... and NT74 \u2192 't34'. But in the grammar, the left-hand side of S is NT81 and NT90, so we need to see how these can be expanded into parts of the string.\n\nWait, the structure of the grammar is such that each S must split into NT81 and NT90, which means the generated string must be a sequence where NT81 and NT90 are used to expand, each possibly to their own trees.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to the NT81 and NT90 trees. But with 59 tokens, that's quite a few and hard to manage manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if all the tokens correspond to some terminal in the grammar. Let's go through the string step by step.\n\n1: t1 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 exists (NT7 \u2192 't1')\n2: t34 \u2192 NT74 \u2192 exists (NT74 \u2192 't34')\n3: t15 \u2192 NT86 \u2192 NT86 can be via NT51 NT88, but also NT86 \u2192 't32' (wait, looking at grammar, NT86 \u2192 't32' and NT86 also has other productions. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking up NT86: NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88, and also NT86 \u2192 't32'. \n\nSo, t15 is 't15' which is used in NT60 as the direct production (NT60 \u2192 't6' and others? Wait, let's look:\n\nNT60's productions: NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55. Also, NT60 \u2192 't24' (I think I saw earlier that NT60 can produce 't24'). Wait no:\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT60 \u2192 't24'? Wait, looking at the grammar again, I'll check:\n\n grammar includes: \nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\nNT60 \u2192 't24'? No, wait, looking again, it's NT60->'t24'? Let me check the grammar lines:\n\nHere's the grammar:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT35 NT34\n\nHmm, perhaps I got some wrong. Wait, in the initial set, NT60 is defined as: \n\n\"NT60 -> NT98 NT55\" and \"NT60 -> 't24'\". So yes, NT60 can produce 't24'. But in the string, token 3 is 't15'. So, 't15' must come from a NT that can produce it. Checking the grammar, which NT produces 't15'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT12 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT74 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, 't15' is 't15' which could come from NT86 (because NT86\u2192't32' and in its productions, it also does NT86\u2192NT31 NT83, so maybe 't15' is part of NT31 or NT83. Hmm, but wait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT with 't15', the only place is NT28 \u2192 't34' not that.

{"custom_id":"request-767","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and one on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. So all the rules here are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for cases where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S is composed of two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Each of these NTs must expand further until we reach terminals.\n\nNow, the string we need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't18 t16...'. My goal is to find out if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to reconstruct the parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be broken down into the expansions allowed by the grammar. Since the grammar is CNF, each step in the parse tree will split each non-terminal into two parts, following the production rules.\n\nLet me try to visualize the parse tree for the given string. We have S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the string must start with the expansion of NT81 and NT90. Let's see:\n\n- NT81 is a non-terminal, so it needs to be expanded into two other non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So it splits into NT95 and NT9.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT82 't10' according to the rule NT99 \u2192 NT82 't10'... Wait, no, looking back, I see NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT95 \u2192 't0' among others. Hmm, I think I might have misread that. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, the production rules for NT are all two non-terminals except for those that map to terminals. So for NT9, the production seems to have a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, I see NT9 \u2192 't10'... Oh no, I'm getting confused. Let me list out the rules properly.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10' (from the line NT95 -> NT25 NT60 NT95 -> 't0'... Wait, no, actually, looking through the list, it's more like:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 (and other productions like NT95 -> 't0'), but NT9 itself has a production like NT95 -> NT37 NT18, and NT95 \u2192 't0'. Wait, no, perhaps I should list all NTs with their productions.\n\nActually, it's better to list each NT and its possible productions to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me list all NTs and their productions:\n\n1.

So the string is a sequence of these terminals. To see if it's generated by the grammar, I need to find a derivation path that results in this exact sequence.\n\nStarting from S (which produces NT81 and NT90). Let's see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nNow, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT9 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking up NT9's productions, it seems NT9 is derived from NT55 and NT37?

Wait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking back, line 24: NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n\nLine 19: NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let me see:\n\nWait, looking at the initial list, maybe I mislisted the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-765","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar starts with a single non-terminal, and all strings generated are of the form a^n with n \u2265 0. However, in this case, I think each production leads to terminals and non-terminals that eventually produce terminals, so the string can be a combination of these.\n\nGiven the grammar provided, it's a bit complex with multiple non-terminals and production rules. My string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nThe string is: t7 t23 t30 t16 t0 t10 t13 t33 t33 t34 t14 t32 t7 t18 t20 t24 t35 t10 t13 t14 t33 t29 t20 t32 t14 t29 t31 t35 t5 t34 t20 t10 t6 t35 t31 t3 t34 t3 t5 t13 t24 t24 t34 t7 t22 t34.\n\nWait, actually, I might have missed something. The structure seems a bit repetitive, but perhaps it's a parse tree issue. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently by building parse trees for the given string.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I should convert the grammar into a parse tree approach. Since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string can be broken down into pairs of terminals or non-terminals. So the first step is to split the string into pairs, but I need to make sure the length of the string is a power of two, which it isn't here. Wait, the length of the string is 54, so that's not a power of two, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a production that can be extended further. Hmm, maybe I should check if the string can be built from the top-down approach.\n\nWait, perhaps starting with the start symbol S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string should start with NT81 and NT90. But looking at the string, the first part is t7 t23... Hmm, so the first part is a series of t's. Let me map the string parts and see what the top-down approach would generate.\n\nLet me try to split the string into the two main parts from the top rule S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first part is t7 t23 t30 t16 t0 t10 t13 t33 t33 t34 t14 t32 t7 t18 t20 t24 t35 t10 t13 t14 t33 t29 t20 t32 t14 t29 t31 t35 t5 t34 t20 t10 t6 t35 t31 t3 t34 t3 t5 t13 t24 t24 t34 t7 t22 t34.\n\nWait, actually, maybe that's too long. Alternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step from the top down.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then each NT81 and NT90 needs to be matched with the next portion of the string. Let me write the string as a list for easier handling:\n\n['t7', 't23', 't30', 't16', 't0', 't10', 't13', 't33', 't33', 't34', 't14', 't32', 't7', 't18', 't20', 't24', 't35', 't10', 't13', 't14', 't33', 't29', 't20', 't32', 't14', 't29', 't31', 't35', 't5', 't34', 't20', 't10', 't6', 't35', 't31', 't3', 't34', 't3', 't5', 't13', 't24', 't24', 't34', 't7', 't22', 't34']\n\nNow, starting with NT81. Looking at the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, according to the production rules. So NT81 is replaced by NT95 and NT9. So the next two parts of the string should correspond to NT95 and NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT9's production is listed as NT9 \u2192 't10'. So NT9 is a terminal string 't10'. Therefore, the next part of the string should be 't10'. But looking at the first few elements, the first element is 't7', which doesn't match 't10'. That's a problem\u2014so maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm not considering all possible productions correctly. Let me check the grammar again. For NT9, the production is given as NT9 \u2192 't10'. So NT9 is just 't10'. Then NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, which would mean after NT95, we have NT9, which we know is 't10'. So the first part of the string after S \u2192 NT81 NT90 would be NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, which is NT95 followed by 't10'. Then the string should start with NT95 and then t10.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t7, which would correspond to NT95 if possible. But NT95's production isn't straightforward\u2014let me check the grammar for NT95.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT95 can go to multiple things:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT43 NT25\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT95 (wait, that's recursion)\n- And some others.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should draw a parse tree from the top down step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'. So the first sub-problem is that the string must start with NT95 followed by 't10'.\n\nLooking at the string, the next element after 't7' (if any) would be 't23', but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me index the string:\n\n1. t7\n2. t23\n3. t30\n4. t16\n5. t0\n6. t10\n7. t13\n8. t33\n9. t33\n10. t34\n11. t14\n12. t32\n13. t7\n14. t18\n15. t20\n16. t24\n17. t35\n18. t10\n19. t13\n20. t14\n21. t33\n22. t29\n23. t20\n24. t32\n25. t14\n26. t29\n27. t31\n28. t35\n29. t5\n30. t34\n31. t20\n32. t10\n33. t6\n34. t35\n35. t31\n36. t3\n37. t34\n38. t3\n39. t5\n40. t13\n41. t24\n42. t24\n43. t34\n44. t7\n45. t22\n46. t34\n\nWait, the string is given as a list of 46 elements.

{"custom_id":"request-783","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the grammar structure. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So every production is either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals. This structure helps in parsing because it implies that each step in a derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with exactly two symbols, which could themselves be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t24 t7 t16 t33 t30 t14 t7 t18 t34 t0 t31 t15 t15 t23 t6 t0 t16 t32 t33 t31 t32 t29 t20 t6 t20 t20 t7 t30 t1 t10 t23 t13 t33 t10 t1 t6 t23 t7 t7 t5 t1 t18 t30`.\n\nEach token is separated by a space, so the string has 77 tokens. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nGiven the grammar, the start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, S must derive into two parts: NT81 and NT90. Each of these is a non-terminal, so I need to check if each can derive into the corresponding part of the string.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, the string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps each terminal in the string corresponds to a production's terminal. Each symbol in the string must match a terminal in the grammar, and the structure must fit the way the non-terminals can split.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, every production either ends in a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. So the string must be such that it can be broken down starting from S as NT81 NT90, and each part must correspond to the respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, it's S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the entire string must start with the expansion of NT81 and then NT90. Each NT can potentially be further expanded until we reach the terminals.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the entire string can be constructed by expanding S correctly.\n\nBut first, let me check if all the tokens in the string are present as terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet's check the possible terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see terminals like t1, t2, t3, up to t35, and some others like 't7', 't10', 't14', etc. Wait, the grammar's productions that produce terminals are things like NT7 \u2192 't1', NT77 \u2192 't34', etc. So all the tokens in the string must be either terminals or can be derived from non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the string to see if they match any terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t24, t7, t16, t33, t30, t14, t7, t18, t34, t0, t31, t15, t15, t23, t6, t0, t16, t32, t33, t31, t32, t29, t20, t6, t20, t20, t7, t30, t1, t10, t23, t13, t33, t10, t1, t6, t23, t7, t7, t5, t1, t18, t30.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't1', 't2', 't3', ..., up to 't35', and some others. Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't0' (Wait, two productions for NT95: one to 't13' and another to 't0' \u2014 I think in CNF, each non-terminal can only have one production. So this might be a typo or error, but perhaps it's allowed in the grammar as multiple productions.)\n\nWait, but for our purposes, each non-terminal can only have one production, so perhaps I need to check if the grammar provided is correctly specified. But I'll proceed, assuming that the grammar is as given, even if some non-terminals have multiple productions, which isn't standard in CNF. Maybe this is allowed in the way the problem is presented.\n\nBut back to the string. All tokens in the string are 't's followed by numbers. I need to check if these correspond to any 't's in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, all possible 't's are up to 't35', so the tokens in the string range from t0 up to t35, except maybe some like t24, t29, etc. So I think all these 't's are covered.\n\nSo each token in the string is a terminal from the grammar. Now, the next step is to see if the structure of the string can be built by expanding the start symbol S correctly.\n\nThe structure must start with S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the string must start with the expansion of NT81 and then NT90.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t24, t7, t16, etc., so let's check what NT81 and NT90 expand into.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking for NT81: I see NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then NT95 has two productions: one to 't13' and another to 't0'. So NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and then NT95 is expanded to either 't13' or 't0', and NT9 is 't10'.\n\nSo:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT95 \u2192 either 't13' or 't0'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo the expansion of NT81 would produce (if NT95 is 't13'): t13 followed by 't10', making 't13 t10'.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct. Because each step produces exactly two symbols, until we reach terminals. So NT81 first splits into NT95 and NT9. Then, for each of these non-terminals, we can expand them further until we get terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the first step, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So we can think of the string as being built by first expanding NT81 and NT90, each into their respective sequences, concatenated together.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT81 and NT90. Therefore, the entire string must be equal to the expansion of NT81 followed by the expansion of NT90.\n\nSo, I can split the string into two parts: first part is the result of NT81's expansion, and the second part is NT90's expansion.\n\nBut what's the expected structure of each?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT95 \u2192 either 't13' or 't0'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo, NT81's expansion starts with NT95 and NT9. Then NT95 can be a terminal or split further, and NT9 is a terminal 't10'.\n\nBut the structure is rightmost-recursive, meaning that the first non-terminal is the first to be expanded. So the steps are:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nThen, if NT95 is expanded first, let's say NT95 \u2192 't13', then NT81 becomes 't13' 't10'. But wait, no, because each step has to be recursively applied until all non-terminals are expanded.\n\nWait, actually, in the case of NT81, it can produce a string by first expanding NT95 and NT9. But NT95 has two possible productions: 't13' or 't0'. So NT81's expansion is (NT95Expanded)(NT9Expanded).\n\nSimilarly for NT90.\n\nSo, let's consider NT81's possible expansions:\n\nOption 1: NT95 \u2192 't13' and NT9 \u2192 't10'. So the contribution is 't13 t10'.\n\nOption 2: NT95 \u2192 't0' and NT9 \u2192 't10'. Contribution is 't0 t10'.\n\nBut wait, wait, looking again: NT95 has two productions, so each expansion step must choose which one to take. So NT95 can be either 't13' or 't0'.

{"custom_id":"request-780","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the structure of both the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Since all productions are two symbols on the left and two on the right, except for some that produce terminals directly. Wait, no, looking again, most of the productions seem to have two non-terminals on the left, except for some which produce a single terminal, like NT82 \u2192 't3', which would be a production that directly outputs a terminal. That's possible in Chomsky Normal Form, but sometimes CNF requires productions to have two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form allows A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC. So some of these rules may produce terminals, which would correspond to the string's symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: 't23 t32 t30 t15 t14 t22 t1 t1 t34 t13 t18 t31 t29 t24 t30 t3 t35 t3 t13 t34 t1 t31 t7 t5 t10 t7 t16 t16 t5 t14 t24 t1 t34 t6 t5 t13 t30 t13 t34 t6 t22 t30 t5 t30 t5 t16 t22'.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the unique terminals in the string to understand the possible paths in the grammar. The terminals are: t23, t32, t30, t15, t14, t22, t1, t34, t13, t18, t31, t29, t24, t7, t5, t10, t16, t35.\n\nNow, I'll start from the start symbol, S, which is NT90. Each production for NT90 is NT95 NT98.\n\nBut looking back, the grammar for NT90 is only defined as S \u2192 NT90. Wait no, wait: looking at the grammar, the production is S \u2192 NT90 NT81. Wait, what's the structure of the grammar? S is derived from NT90 followed by NT81, as per S\u2192NT90 NT81.\n\nNo, wait. Wait, the grammar is S \u2192 NT90 NT81. Then each of these non-terminals (NT90, NT81) will have their own productions.\n\nSo to break it down:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT90 NT81\n2. So each of these needs to be expanded into sequences leading to the terminals in the string.\n\nI'll need to explore the tree starting from S and see if a derivation leads to the string.\n\nLet's look at the productions:\n\nNT90: Looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT90? Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nHmm, the initial lines:\n\nS \u2192 NT90 NT81\nNT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n...\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\nNT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nNT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\nNT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT43 \u2192 NT25 NT25\n...\nWait, let me list all the productions to see which non-terminals can lead to which terminals.\n\nBut that might take too long. Maybe a better approach is to see if we can build a tree that decodes to the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't23'. Let me check what non-terminals can produce 't23'.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions, I see that NT25 has a production: NT25 \u2192 t5. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, some of the entries have a 't' followed by a number, which seems to be terminal symbols. For example, NT7 \u2192 t1.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (among others)\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13', 't1', 't0'\n- NT43 \u2192 't20', 't35'\n- NT26 \u2192 't32', 't5'\n- NT18 \u2192 't20', 't16'?

The start symbol is S, which is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string starts with NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, let me look at the string again: it starts with 't14' 't31' 't22' ... and ends with 't0 t14 ...'

For example, looking at the productions, NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83. And NT83 is a terminal 't23'. Wait, but in the string, I see 't23' isn't present. Hmm, no, looking back: the string doesn't have 't23' in it except in 'NT83 \u2192 t23', but the string has 't23'?

Let me check: NT39 \u2192 't33' and NT88 \u2192 't7'.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be derived if all tokens are in the grammar. Let me list all tokens in the string and see if each corresponds to a production.\n\nLooking at the start symbol: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, NT81 and NT90.\n\nWhat's NT81? NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT90. Wait, but S produces NT81 and NT90. So NT81 is another production. Let me see what NT81 produces. Looking at the rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 splits into NT95 and NT9.\n\nWhat about NT95? NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. Hmm, wait, maybe I should draw a tree or list the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to parse the string starting from the root S.\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, each NT in the string must be produced by some NT rule.\n\nLooking at 't14': which NT production leads to t14? Let me check all the rules.\n\nWait, let me check all the nt productions and see which terminals they produce.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' and 't20'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT83 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't1', 't20', 't35'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't5', 't15'\n\nNT95 \u2192 several, including 't0', 't13', 't18', 't23'\n\nWait, in the string, do I see any 't23's?

So if a production like NT43 \u2192 't1' 't5' 't18' 't23' isn't present in the string, then that path might not be valid.\n\nWait, but NT43 produces several terminals. So, perhaps if a part of the string can't be generated by any NT rule, then the entire string is invalid.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\nt14: possible via NT7 (t1 or t20). Wait, does any NT produce t14?\n\nWait, looking through all rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't14'. So how does t14 get generated? Let me see: NT7 \u2192 't1' and 't20'; NT14 isn't a node in the grammar. So, can t14 be generated from other NTs?\n\nLooking at the rules, is there any NT that can produce something that leads to 't14'? Hmm, maybe via a series of productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking for any production that ends with t14. Suppose I look through all the terminals:\n\nI don't see any NT directly producing t14, so t14 must be the terminal 't14' in some production. But I don't see any production that directly gives t14 as a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, looking through the given NT rules, none of the NTs directly produce 't14'. That means t14 cannot be part of the derived string because there's no rule that produces it as a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a rule. Let me double-check all the 't' rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, all 't's are from specific NTs:\n\nt1: NT7\n\nt10: NT9, NT43, NT77, NT82, NT13, NT69\n\nt14: ?\n\nt15: NT28, NT67, NT74\n\nt16: NT20, NT25, NT88, NT98, NT60, NT48\n\nt18: NT43, NT86, NT95\n\nt20: NT98, NT26\n\nt22: NT82, NT86, NT95\n\nt23: NT13, NT43, NT95\n\nt24: NT48, NT55, NT77\n\nt29: NT48\n\nt3: ? Not sure, but looking for 't3' in the string, I don't see it.\n\nWait, in the given string, I don't see 't3', 't4', etc. So any 't's that are not covered by the grammar would cause the string to be invalid.\n\nSince 't14' is not produced by any NT in the grammar, the string is invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-790","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to be in CNF because all the rules on the left side have a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90 is in CNF because it's A \u2192 BC. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't1' is A \u2192 a.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't's and numbers. From the grammar, I see that some of these numbers correspond to terminals. For example, NT82 \u2192 't3' means that 't3' is a terminal. So each 't' followed by a number in the string is a terminal symbol, and the other symbols are non-terminals.\n\nSo, the plan is: parse the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with their terminals or other non-terminals, and see if we can reduce the entire string to all terminals, matching the given string.\n\nLet me write down the string: \"t29 t5 t0 t15 t14 t35 t24 t18 t20 t20 t34 t15 t10 t7 t16 t32 t15 t33 t7 t10 t3 t14 t1 t15 t30 t24 t31 t16 t7 t0 t30 t34 t22 t22 t15 t34 t35 t34 t29 t29 t33 t18 t18 t32 t13 t16 t35 t23\"\n\nI need to map each number to the corresponding rule. For example:\n\n- t29: Looking at the grammar, does any A \u2192 't29'? Let me check the production rules for each NT. Oh, I see NT51 \u2192 't32' and NT83 \u2192 't23', but I don't see a rule for 't29'. Wait, looking again, NT25 \u2192 't15', NT48 \u2192 't23', NT51 \u2192 't32', NT43 \u2192 't1', but where is 't29'?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT95 \u2192 't13', NT55 \u2192 't6', NT95 \u2192 't0'\u2014wait, no, those are separate rules, but they don't produce 't29'. Alternatively, perhaps NT95 \u2192 't0' is part of a different production. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has, for example, NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88 and also NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55. So NT26 can generate both. I think I need a way to see which rule leads to which terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parsing strategy, like recursive descent parsing, where each NT is a function that can be replaced by their rules.\n\nSo, let's take the string and try to replace non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe string is: t29 t5 t0 t15 t14 t35 t24 t18 t20 t20 t34 t15 t10 t7 t16 t32 t15 t33 t7 t10 t3 t14 t1 t15 t30 t24 t31 t16 t7 t0 t30 t34 t22 t22 t15 t34 t35 t34 t29 t29 t33 t18 t18 t32 t13 t16 t35 t23\n\nWait, but the grammar uses NT symbols like S, NT98, etc., so perhaps the string is a sequence of these NT symbols replaced by their terminals. So each t followed by a number in the string corresponds to the terminals in the NT productions.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the terminals generated by applying the grammar rules. So each 't29' in the string must come from some NT that can derive 't29' via their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string represents the intermediate symbols in the grammar, but it's a bit unclear. Wait, the problem says the string may or may not be in the language defined by the grammar. So it's the string to test, which is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals? Or perhaps the entire string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's initial symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90, which are both non-terminals. So the entire string is built by expanding these non-terminals until we get all terminals.\n\nSo the string provided is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if it's possible to derive it by expanding S.\n\nGiven that, the string is a list of terminals: t29, t5, t0, etc. So each of these terminals should come from some production in the grammar. So let's check if each terminal is defined in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that all the terminals are of the form 't' followed by a number, except for the NT symbols which are all followed by non-terminals or numbers like 7, 83, etc. Wait, wait: in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, others produce other non-terminals. For example, NT82 \u2192 't3', so 't3' is a terminal.\n\nSo each 'tX' in the string must be produced by some non-terminal. For example, 't29' must come from ANTL \u2192 't29' where A is a non-terminal that eventually produces 't29'.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't29'. Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through each production, the terminals are:\n\n- 't3' (NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, but those are non-terminals; wait no, actually, for example, NT39 \u2192 't33', etc. Wait, looking carefully, NT51 \u2192 't32', NT83 \u2192 't23', NT60 \u2192 't98 NT55' but I'm looking for which NT directly produces 't...' terminals.\n\nWait, no, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So a terminal is when the right-hand side is a terminal. So for example, NT39 \u2192 't33' ( productions like NT39 \u2192 't33' ). So 't33' is a terminal.\n\nIn the string provided, I see 't33', which is a terminal because there is a rule NT39 \u2192 't33'.\n\nSimilarly, 't35' appears in the string. NT35 is involved. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't18'\n\nYes, so 't18' is a terminal. So 't35' is a terminal because of some NT35's production.\n\nWait, no. Let me list all the right-hand sides that are terminals:\n\nLooking at each production, when the RHS is a single terminal (like 't1', 't3', etc.), then that's a terminal.\n\nLet me list all the 'a's (terminals) in the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't...

The string is: t5, t7, t34, t7, t0, t16, t18, t32, t14, t5, t13, t22, t7, t23, t6, t33, t0, t20, t34, t22, t24, t16, t35, t30, t32, t0, t31, t33, t18, t29, t33, t24, t16, t1, t0, t14, t3, t29, t15, t24, t20, t30, t20, t0, t24, t3, t29, t15, t0.\n\nLooking at the rules, each rule has either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, each token in the string corresponds to either being a terminal or being two non-terminals. But since all the rules on the right have terminals on the right-hand side, every production rule in the grammar is a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, some rules have terminals like NT7 -> 't1'. So, each step in the parse will involve matching a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string, the total number of tokens is 52. Since each production either adds two terminals or two non-terminals, the length must be a number that allows for a binary split. However, since the string has 52 tokens, and each step can expand into two tokens, the number of tokens should be 2^n for the derivation. But 52 isn't a power of two, which suggests that the string might not be directly possible, but maybe I'm missing something because some rules might generate multiple terminals in one step.\n\nWait, no. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single symbol on the left, and on the right, either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in the parse tree, each non-terminal will expand into either two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the number of symbols produced at each step increases by one each time a non-terminal produces two non-terminals. If a non-terminal produces a terminal, that's a leaf node.\n\nBut the parsing process starts from S and splits into NT81 and NT90. Each of these can further split into their respective RHS.\n\nLooking more closely, I'll check if the first token t5 is generated by any rule. Looking through the rules, I see NT25 -> 't5' and NT26 -> 't5'. So, either NT25 or NT26 can produce 't5'.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t5. So, it must come from either NT25 or NT26. Let's consider how these non-terminals can be derived.\n\nLooking at NT25: It appears in Rules like NT25 -> 't5', NT86 -> 't32' which is part of NT86's rules. Wait, actually NT25 has a rule ND25 -> 't5', and another rule? Let me check: the given rules have NT26 -> NT25 NT55, NT25 -> 't5', and other rules like NT25 in different parts? Wait, I see in the rules section, NT25 is present as NT25 -> 't5' and NT25 is also in the production rules for NT98 -> 't31' etc. Wait, looking back, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, looking at the rules: I see NT25 -> 't5' and another production is NT25 -> 't15'? Wait, no, let me check. The rules provided are:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> 't5' (multiple times, like in NT20 -> ... ? Wait, no.

Let me check: NT86: There are two rules. One is NT86 -> 't32' and another is NT86 -> NT25 NT37? So the 't6' must be from a different rule. Wait, looking back: I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules: \n\nI see NT86 appears in two places:\n\n1. NT86 -> 't32'\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to take it step by step. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the grammar and the string look like. The grammar has a series of rules where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT98, NT37, etc.) is rewritten into combinations of other non-terminals until they eventually produce terminal symbols, which are things like 't1', 't2', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t16 t32 t22 t35 t29 t7 t33 t35 t13 t29 t33 t10 t35 t33 t5 t35 t1 t18 t10 t29 t22 t30 t18 t22 t29 t29 t23 t10 t32 t35 t35 t15 t15 t35 t31 t0 t3 t1 t0 t1 t23 t0 t7 t10 t20 t7 t30 t15 t20`.\n\nI remember that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided looks to be in CNF because each rule on the left-hand side (like S, NT98, etc.) has exactly two non-terminals on the right except for some rules that directly produce terminals, like NT82 \u2192 't3' and NT98 \u2192 't31'.\n\nThe approach I think I should take is to simulate how the string could be derived from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation either combines two symbols into another or reduces a non-terminal to a terminal. \n\nLooking at the string, it's quite long: 67 terminals in total. So, I need to see if these terminals can appear in the correct order when expanding the grammar. It might help to see how each terminal in the string is formed from the non-terminals. \n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Starting from S, which is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Each of these non-terminals will need to produce pairs of terminals. For example, NT81 and NT90 each need to generate sequences that, when combined, match the string.\n\nStarting with NT81, looking at the productions for NT81, it's `NT81 -> NT95 NT9`. So, NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9. Then, NT95 is `NT95 -> NT25 NT60`, so that would expand further into NT25 and NT60. Each of those continues until it becomes terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 is `NT9 -> NT6`. So, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 \u2192 NT25 NT60 \u2192 and so on, until all non-terminals are expanded to their terminals.\n\nI wonder if I can find a way to match the string by breaking it down into chunks that correspond to each production rule. Since each production in CNF has exactly two symbols on the right, except for the terminals, the string should be constructed by pairs of non-terminals, each of which eventually produce their own sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string in pairs or chunks. Starting from the beginning:\n\n- The first part is 't16 t32 t22 t35 t29 t7 t33 t35 t13 t29 t33 t10 t35 t33 t5 t35 t1 t18 t10 t29 t22 t30 t18 t22 t29 t29 t23 t10 t32 t35 t35 t15 t15 t35 t31 t0 t3 t1 t0 t1 t23 t0 t7 t10 t20 t7 t30 t15 t20'\n\nI think it might help to represent this as a tree structure, but it's going to be quite large. Alternatively, perhaps I can use recursive descent or memoization, but that might be complicated manually.\n\nAnother approach is to use dynamic programming: for the string s, check if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. So, the string should be split into two parts, each generated by NT81 and NT90, respectively, in that order.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part must be generated by NT81 and the second by NT90. So let's see if that holds.\n\nFirst, NT81: the initial production is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 NT95 NT6. Let's see what NT95 generates. \n\nLooking up NT95, it's NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. So NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. \n\nNT25 \u2192 NT25 NT55 from the rules, wait, no: looking back, NT25 is `NT25 -> NT15 NT5`, but in the provided rules, I don't see that. Wait, let me check the provided grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for example, NT26 is `NT26 -> NT43 NT88`, NT25 is `NT25 -> NT25 NT55`, wait, no, actually, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT25: in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, NT25 \u2192 NT25 NT55.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Let me recheck.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT74 \u2192 't33' (Wait, no, looking again, in the rules, are there multiple productions for the same non-terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-814","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. That should make parsing easier, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t20 t5 t31 t16 t13 t22 t20 t10 t20 t13 t3 t23 t22 t10 t32 t16 t35 t16 t18 t33 t13 t15 t14 t6 t34 t14 t34 t13 t15 t32 t31 t35 t14 t10 t1 t15 t3 t24 t6 t18 t23 t31 t5 t16 t32 t29 t13 t30 t6 t16`.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar and see how it can generate this string. Each terminal is a 't' followed by a number. The non-terminals are 'S', 'N', 'T', etc., with various letters and numbers.\n\nThe starting symbol is S. S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first step is to produce two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90.\n\nLet me break down the string into tokens to see how they might match the grammar.\n\nThe string is long, so I'll split it into each 't' followed by a number:\n\nt20, t5, t31, t16, t13, t22, t20, t10, t20, t13, t3, t23, t22, t10, t32, t16, t35, t16, t18, t33, t13, t15, t14, t6, t34, t14, t34, t13, t15, t32, t31, t35, t14, t10, t1, t15, t3, t24, t6, t18, t23, t31, t5, t16, t32, t29, t13, t30, t6, t16.\n\nThat's 62 tokens. Since each production in CFG generates exactly one symbol, the number of symbols in the string should be one more than the number of productions. But actually, for a string with n terminals, the number of steps in the derivation is n. Each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal generated by a non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT81 NT90, each of these non-terminals (NT81 and NT90) needs to generate sequences that when concatenated, form the given string.\n\nLet's look at NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 [various productions] and eventually, NT95 can produce 't0', 't13', 't1', etc.\n\nWait, I need to map each non-terminal to the possible terminals they can produce.\n\nLet me make a list of all the non-terminals and what terminals they can directly produce:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1 | t48 | t20 | t1 | t77 | t18 | t34 | t15 | t1 | t35 | t13 | t0\nWait, let me correct that.

Wait no, some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking carefully, any production where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal symbol. For example:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't3', NT26 \u2192 't32', NT60 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some rules produce terminals directly. Others produce other non-terminals. So each non-terminal may have a mix of productions leading to terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSo, for NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Hmm, but NT95 might produce 't95' or other terminals. Wait, in the grammar, looking for NT95 productions:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 | NT37 NT18 | NT55 NT2 | NT25 NT60 | NT95 NT0 (wait, looking back:\n\n grammar has:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 | NT37 NT18 | NT55 NT2 | NT25 NT60 | NT43 NT1 | NT13 NT0 | NT28 \u2192 etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nEach line is a production.

{"custom_id":"request-812","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, and it starts with S -> NT81 NT90. So, the derivation begins with S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t5 t3 t32 t22 t0 t22 t20 t24 t5 t35 t7 t10 t29 t24 t34 t30 t24 t32 t14 t6 t15 t18 t0 t33 t0 t16 t22 t6 t10 t7 t3 t5 t7 t10 t24 t10 t1 t23 t34 t1 t35 t22 t34 t13 t3 t33 t14 t0 t33 t14`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. Each token in the string must correspond to either a terminal or a non-terminal that can generate that token through the grammar rules, working my way backward or forward through the productions.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S, let's see what S can produce. S -> NT81 NT90. So, the first step is that S will generate two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. Each of these will need to produce their respective terminals.\n\nThe first token is 't5', which is a terminal. Looking in the grammar, I see NT51 -> 't32', but also NT25 -> 't5'. So, 't5' must come from NT25. So, the first production step must involve NT25 -> 't5', which would result in 't5'.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, the first token is 't5', so the initial production must start with 't5'. However, S starts with NT81 and NT90. So, unless there's a rule that directly produces 't5', or unless some non-terminal can derive 't5' in a chain, but S itself doesn't produce 't5'.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The string starts with 't5', so the first token must be generated by S, but S only produces NT81 and NT90. So, unless one of these non-terminals can derive 't5' through some sequence of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT25 -> 't5'\n\nSo, if NT25 can be one of the parts, then perhaps the initial S can split into NT81 and NT90, and one of them can derive to 't5'. Let's see:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nSuppose NT81 can generate 't5', then the first token would be 't5'. Let me check what NT81 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nSo, NT81 must split into NT95 and NT9. Each of these needs to generate tokens.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't5', so perhaps NT95 or NT9 must directly produce 't5' or chain to it.\n\nLooking at NT95 in the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nWait, but NT25 -> 't5', so if NT95 can lead to NT25, then NT95 could generate 't5' as a terminal. Let's see:\n\nWait, no, NT95 is a non-terminal, so it must produce sequences. So, NT95 can only produce 't5' if there's a production rule that says NT95 -> 't5'. But according to the grammar provided, I don't see a production rule where NT95 is a terminal; instead, it's being split into NT25 and NT60.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar again. The right-hand sides are all two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal is directly a terminal (i.e., the rule equals a single terminal symbol). So, looking through the productions:\n\nYes, for example, look for 't' symbols:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nWait, but 't5' is actually:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any rule that directly gives a terminal as 't5'; however, NT25 directly gives 't5'. So, to have 't5' as a terminal, one of the non-terminals must eventually derive it.\n\nSo, in the case of NT95 -> NT25 NT60, if NT25 can derive 't5', and NT60 can produce other terminals, then perhaps NT95 can generate a sequence including 't5'. But let me not get ahead of myself.\n\nLet me try to model the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't5', so that would need to come from NT25, which is a terminal. So, where does 't5' appear in the grammar? It's under NT25.\n\nSo, perhaps in the derivation, one of the non-terminals, say NT81 or NT90, must somehow produce NT25 and another non-terminal that can produce the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but S is NT81 NT90. So, S generates NT81 and NT90. So, to have 't5' as the first token, either NT81 or NT90 must generate 't5' or a sequence that eventually leads to 't5' as the first terminal.\n\nLet's explore NT81:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nSo, NT81 must split into NT95 and NT9. Each of those will split further.\n\nLooking at NT9:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT98 -> NT7 NT39 and others, but wait, wait, let me check NT9:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nYes, there's a rule NT9 -> 't10'?\n\nWait, let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT9 -> 't10' yes.\n\nWait, no, wait, let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nWait, in the grammar above, the user listed the productions as:\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\n...\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any rule where NT9 is directly mapped to a terminal.

I see:\n\nNT9 appears on the left-hand side:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT9:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'? Let me check.\n\nLooking again, I don't see NT9 -> 't10'. Wait, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's broken down into three tokens: \"t0\", \"t6\", and \"t14\". Since the string is a sequence of these tokens, I need to see if the grammar can produce this exact sequence by deriving through the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let's note that each terminal token is formed directly by a non-terminal. For example, NT7 is 't1', NT9 is 't10', and so on. So each terminal corresponds to exactly one production where a non-terminal is directly replaced by that terminal.\n\nTo generate the string, the entire string must be derived from the start symbol S.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t13 t6 t14\". I need to figure out whether this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the grammar correctly. Context-free grammars consist of a start symbol, non-terminal symbols, and production rules. Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production to have either two non-terminals or one terminal. Looking at the given grammar, each rule is either a non-terminal breaking down into two other symbols or a non-terminal that produces a single terminal string. So, that checks out.\n\nNow, the string in question is a sequence of terminals: \"t13 t6 t14\". Wait, but the way it's written might be a bit confusing. I think in this context, the string is separated by spaces, so each \"t\" followed by a number is a single terminal symbol. So, the string is actually the three terminals t13, t6, t14.\n\nMy task is to find a way to derive this string starting from the start symbol S. Let me look at the grammar rules to see how these terminals can be produced.\n\nThe start symbol is S, according to the grammar: S -> NT81 NT90. So, the first step is that S must expand into NT81 and NT90. So, the string must eventually derive to two parts: one that starts with NT81 and another with NT90.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals. I need to see if each of these can eventually derive to the respective part of the string.\n\nWait, but the string is t13 t6 t14, which is three terminals. So, S is a non-terminal that produces two symbols: NT81 and NT90. Each of these could produce sequences of terminals. But the string has three, so perhaps one of them needs to produce two terminals and the other one.\n\nWait, let me see: NT81 and NT90\u2014let me check their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT90 is only mentioned in the start symbol as S -> NT81 NT90, so NT90 doesn't have further productions besides being a leaf. Wait, but let me check: in the given productions, is there anything for NT90? The user provided a list, and I need to scan through them. The only mentions are in S and NT98, etc. Let me go through each line.\n\nThe grammar includes:\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nSo NT81 produces two non-terminals.\n\nNT90 only appears once in the start symbol S, so perhaps it's a terminal? Let me see if there's a production for NT90 as a terminal. Scanning through the list, I don't see NT90 being a terminal. It's in the production S -> NT81 NT90, but that doesn't mean it's a terminal. So, perhaps NT90 is a non-terminal that doesn't have a production. That would mean it's not possible to derive any terminal sequence from NT90, which is a problem because the string ends with t14, which is a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again. The grammar is:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't30'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'\nNT95 -> 't0'\nNT43 -> 't35'\nNT25 -> 't15'\nNT86 -> 't32'\nNT39 -> 't33'\nNT88 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't20'\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT60 -> 't24'\nNT12 -> 't35'\nNT69 -> 't34'\nNT51 -> 't32'\nNT48 -> 't23'\nNT25 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't34'\nNT60 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> 't29'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT83 -> 't23'\nNT90 -> It's only in the production S->NT81 NT90. So, perhaps NT90 is a terminal here. Let me see what's next.\n\nLooking through the other productions, do any others end with a terminal? Wait, the last line is NT90: It seems none, except perhaps I missed it. Wait, no, the last line of the grammar as given is:\n\nNT90 -> It doesn't have a production beyond being part of the start symbol. So, perhaps NT90 is a leaf. But since it's not defined as a terminal, I can't derive anything from it. That would mean that NT90 must be a string of terminals that produce nothing, which is impossible. So, that's a problem because in the given string, we have t14 which is a terminal, and if NT90 can't produce it, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me double-check. The grammar rules include all possible productions. So, if NT90 is a non-terminal that does not produce anything, then it's not possible. So, S -> NT81 NT90, where NT90 is a non-terminal that can't expand into anything\u2014meaning we have two symbols to derive, which would mean the string should have two terminal symbols, one from NT81 and one from NT90. But in the given string, we have three terminals: t13, t6, t14.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT90 somehow can expand into a terminal. But looking at the grammar, none of the productions seem to produce a terminal except where the non-terminal is the same as a terminal symbol, like NT7 -> 't1', etc. So, perhaps if NT90 is a terminal 't14', but in the grammar, it's nowhere defined as such. So, perhaps NT90 can't produce t14.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Let me see if any non-terminal expands into t14. Looking at the grammar, t14 is written as a terminal in the production NT83 -> 't23', so yes, some non(terminals) do produce t14.\n\nLooking for t14 in any production: I see\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> ... t31,...\n\nNT95 -> ... t13,...\n\nAnd so on. Wait, in NT18: NT18 -> NT20 NT26, and looking into that, perhaps it can produce t16 and t35.\n\nWait, but looking for t14. Wait, is there any rule that produces t14? Yes, in the production:\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\nWait, does any other non-terminal produce t14? Let me check.\n\nLooking at all the rules, do any of them directly produce 't14'? From the list, I see:\n\nNT39 -> 't33'\n\n'NT20' -> 't16'\n\n'NT98'-> 't31'\n\n'NT81' -> 't95 nt9' (but nt9 is 't10', so nt95 expands to 't13 t18', etc.\n\nWait, actually, no production seems to directly produce t14. Hmm, except looking again, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at NT25: NT25 -> 't15'.\n\nHTH: So, no production in the grammar directly produces t14.

So each line is a separate production, so NT26 appears twice. So for NT26, the two possible productions are NT43 NT88 and NT25 NT55. But wait, that can't be right because in CNF each non-terminal should have only one production. Maybe the user made a mistake in listing, or perhaps it's a mistake.

Or is it a different rule? Because usually, a non-terminal can't have two rules leading to the same symbol unless it's a mistake. Let me check the provided grammar again:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\nNT43 -> 't20'\n\nSo yes, NT43 has two productions. That's possible if it's part of the given grammar, perhaps as a necessary structure for the string. But then, that could complicate things because to derive 't20', NT43 must derive to 't20', which is correct. Alternatively, it could be that I need to handle the ambiguities.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach the problem by trying to parse the string token by token, from left to right, trying to see if each token can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nThe string is t15, t5, t6, t14.\n\nLet me start by assuming the entire string is generated by the grammar. So we can model it as pushing symbols onto a stack and trying to reduce them.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the derivation tree. Since the string has four symbols, the leftmost derivation would involve starting with S and expanding until we have four symbols.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by some non-terminal's productions.\n\nLet's process each token in order:\n\n1. t15: Which non-terminals can derive t15?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT67 -> t15 (line: NT67 -> t15). So NT67 can derive t15. So the first symbol must come from NT67.\n\n2. t5: Next symbol is t5. Which non-terminals can derive t5? Looking at the rules, I see NT25 -> t5 (line: NT25 -> t5). So NT25 can derive t5.\n\n3. t6: Next symbol is t6. Which non-terminals can derive t6? Looking through, I see NT88->t6 (line: NT88-> 't6'), so NT88 can derive t6.\n\n4. t14: The last symbol is t14. Looking for non-terminals that derive t14: Looking through, I see S -> NT81 NT90, but that might not be useful here. Wait, are there any direct productions for t14? Checking the list, I don't see any NT directly producing t14. So perhaps t14 is derived via a non-terminal that eventually reduces to it.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, maybe some long derivation path. Let me check: Does any NT directly produce t14? Looking through all the lines, I don't see a rule like NTx -> t14. So perhaps t14 is derived from a non-terminal that eventually reduces to it via some steps.\n\nWait, this is a problem because none of the non-terminals directly produce t14. Hmm, but let me cross-check to make sure. Let's scan the entire list:\n\n- Looking for productions where the right-hand side is 't14': I don't see any. So perhaps t14 can't be directly produced by any non-terminal.\n\nBut that can't be, because strings are generated by the grammar if they can be derived. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking at the rules again, I notice that S is defined, and perhaps S could be part of the derivation. Alternatively, maybe the string ends with t14, so there must be a non-terminal that can derive it. Since it's not directly produced, perhaps it's derived through a chain.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules, perhaps s can lead to t15, t5, etc., but that seems unlikely because s is a start symbol and it's production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So perhaps the string is something like NT81 ... NT90 ... .\n\nWait, but the first token is t15. So in the leftmost derivation, the first step is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nThen NT81 is expanded as nt81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 (from nt81 -> nt95 nt9), and NT90 is nt90 \u2192 NT82 (from S's rule).

Since the target string has four t's, the derivation needs to produce exactly four t's in total.\n\nNow, let's examine each NT symbol in the starting production and see if they can produce the required t's.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNT81: Looking at the production rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 can derive a sequence starting with NT95 and ending with NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT90: Let's check its productions. The rules include NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT37, and from the list, NT25 can produce different nt symbols, but the specific production for NT25 isn't directly obvious. Wait, looking back, I see NT25 \u2192 't15'? No, wait, the rules given only show NT25 -> 't15'? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\nNT25 -> 't15' (Yes, I see that under NT25's production: NT25 -> 't15').\n\nSo, for NT90, if it's derived as NT25 NT37, then let's see:\n\nNT90 \u2192 NT25 NT37. Now, NT25 \u2192 't15' (from the rule above), and NT37 has several productions.\n\nLooking at NT37: It can produce NT9 NT82, NT12 NT77, or other combinations. Let me check the specific production that leads to a 't' token.\n\nFor example, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. Then, NT9 can expand, looking at the rules, there's NT9 \u2192 't10'. So, if NT9 \u2192 't10', that would give us a 't10' token.\n\nBut wait, let me trace how this would work for the string.\n\nWait, the target string is `t5 t5 t10 t14`. So, the first part comes from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90, each of these needs to expand into t tokens.\n\nLet's break down NT81 first:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nLooking at NT95, the rules say NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18 and also NT95 \u2192 't13', and another rule NT95 \u2192 't0'. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, under NT95: The rules are:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60,\n\n- Also, from NT95, I see:\n\n   NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60,\n\n   NT95 -> 't13',\n\n   NT95 -> 't0'.\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing because it seems NT95 can produce 't13' and 't0' directly, but it also can produce other NT combinations. So, if possible, to generate a 't' token, we might choose the direct production.\n\nSo, for NT95, we could have either:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13' or NT95 \u2192 't0', but either way, if we take a direct 't' token, that would give us a t13 or t0. But in our target string, we need a t5, t5, t10, t14. So, using 't13' or 't0' doesn't fit because they're different. Hmm, maybe that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT95 can produce other NTs. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the NT81 and NT90 don't both have to produce t tokens directly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should track down the entire expansion.\n\nWait, let's see: S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nThen, each of these needs to be expanded further.\n\nBut wait, the string has four t's. So, perhaps each of these NT symbols (N1 and N2) in S \u2192 N1 N2 need to produce parts of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the target string backward, seeing if I can match it to the grammar.\n\nThe target string is `t5 t5 t10 t14`. Let's consider the entire string as a sequence to match with the grammar.\n\nStarting from the end, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform a top-down expansion of the grammar to see if I can derive the target string.\n\nLet me start with S.\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, NT81 needs to expand into parts of the string. NT90 needs to expand into other parts. Let's try to see what each can produce.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 is one of the symbols, and looking at NT9: There's a production NT9 \u2192 't10'. So, one of the possible expansions is that NT9 can produce 't10'.\n\nSo, for NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 NT95 't10'.\n\nSimilarly, for NT95, as we saw, it can produce 't13' or 't0', but also other NT combinations.\n\nWait, but if we choose NT95 \u2192 't10', that doesn't match with our target because NT95 is a symbol that's further apart.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can generate the target string by expanding both NT81 and NT90 into parts that combine to make the t's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to represent each NT's possible expansions and see how the target string can be built.\n\nBut maybe another approach would be to look at all the possible ways the target string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree for the target string and see if it follows the grammar.\n\nBut given the limited time, perhaps it's better to focus on the key points.\n\nFirst, let's note that NT25 \u2192 't15'.\n\nAlso, NT26 \u2192 several possibilities, including 't35'.\n\nWait, but the target string has a 't10' and 't14', so let's see:\n\nWait, looking for where 't10' comes from. In the grammar, NT9 has a production to 't10'.\n\nSo, if any NT symbol expands to NT9, which then becomes 't10'.\n\nSimilarly, NT14 appears to be produced by NT90? Wait, in the provided rules, looking for NT14, perhaps it's produced by NT90. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT37, but nowhere in the rules do I see NT90 \u2192 't14' directly, but perhaps via another route.\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT55 \u2192 NT12 NT35, and also NT48 \u2192 T23, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find where t10 comes from and where t14 comes from.\n\nWait, the target string is `t5 t5 t10 t14`. There are two t5's. So, somewhere, two different NT symbols would have to expand to produce t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any NT that can expand into 't5'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't5'. Hmm, perhaps that's an issue because t5 might need to come from some other NT symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again to see if any NT can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37.\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'.\n\n- Wait, not 't5'.\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77.\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'.\n\nHmm, looking for 't5', but I don't see any NT that produces 't5' in their productions.

For example, NT26 has two productions: NT43 NT88 and NT25 NT55. Also, NT43 appears more than once with different rules.\n\nNow, looking at the string: `t15 t31 t31 t6 t14`. \n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and each corresponds to some production. I need to find a derivation path that exactly matches this sequence.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The string is t15, t31, t31, t6, t14.\n\nLet me map each to non-terminal rules:\n\n- t15 corresponds to NT67 -> t15, so NT67 must be on the left side of that production.\n- t31 corresponds to NT98 -> t31, or NT31 -> t35 (no, wait, NT31 is 't35', but NT98 is 't31'). Wait, looking at the grammar, NT98 is a non-terminal that produces 't31' directly. Similarly, NT31 produces 't35'. But in the string, we have two t31s, so perhaps we need to derive t31 somehow.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT31 production rule is: NT31 -> NT86 NT28. But NT86 has a production that sometimes results in t32, but in other cases, like NT86 -> NT51 NT88, and NT51 -> t32, etc. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking at the NT86 productions:\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88 (and it also appears elsewhere with different NTs)\nand another production is NT86 -> NT25 NT37.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nTherefore, when we have t31 in the string, it must come from NT98 which directly produces t31. So in the string, the first t31 comes from NT98. So we can consider that part.\n\nNow, the string is t15 t31 t31 t6 t14.\n\nEach t15 comes from NT67, so if we have NT67, which produces t15, then that's straightforward.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT67's production is NT67 -> t15. So, to get a t15, we need to have NT67 as the production. How do we get to NT67?\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any production that produces NT67? Let's check the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT67 appears on the left side in: NT67 -> t15. So NT67 is a terminal production, not a non-terminal, because it's written in quotes. So NT67 is a terminal symbol that directly produces 't15'.\n\nWait, that changes things. So in the string, t15 comes from NT67 directly. Similarly, t31 comes from NT98.\n\nBut wait, how can a non-terminal NT67 be a terminal? The initial definition of Chomsky Normal Form is that each production is either to a single terminal or two non-terminals. If NT67 has a production to 't15', it's actually not a non-terminal because it can be directly written. Or is it?\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, every non-terminal has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if a production is A \u2192 a, then A is a non-terminal that produces 'a'. Therefore, in the grammar, NT67 is a non-terminal because it has a production to a terminal. So, in the string, when we see t15, it must be derived from NT67. So that implies that in the left-hand side, there is an NT67 that must be in the current string.\n\nBut how can NT67 derive to t15? That seems a bit confusing because usually, non-terminals derive to other non-terminals or terminals. But in this case, NT67 is directly a terminal. So, perhaps in the context of this question, the NTs are both terminals and non-terminals, but based on the grammar presented, any rule with 'a' on the RHS is a terminal.\n\nWait, no. The grammar starts with S, which is a non-terminal, all others are either non-terminals or terminals. The way the grammar is written, only the left-hand sides are non-terminals. Wait, the initial problem statement says it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which allows rules like A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, but in the given grammar, it seems that every rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, for example:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90: Two non-terminals on RHS.\n\nNT7 -> 't1': So a non-terminal on LHS producing a terminal.\n\nTherefore, in the string, whenever we encounter a 't' term, it's because a non-terminal (like NT7, NT98, etc.) directly produces that t.\n\nSo the string is built by expanding non-terminals until all are replaced with t's. Therefore, to get t15, it must come from NT67 -> t15, which is a production. Similarly, t31 comes from NT98 -> t31.\n\nSo now, the string is t15 (from NT67) t31 (from NT98) t31 (another NT98) t6 (needs to check) t14 (needs to check).\n\nSo the full string can be represented as:\n\nNT67 -> t15\n\nNT98 -> t31"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-53","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t5 t31 t31 t10 t14`, and I need to figure out if it can be derived from the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a context-free grammar where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for certain types of parsing and algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the non-terminals have productions that result in non-terminals (e.g., S \u2192 NT81 NT90, each NT is a non-terminal that further splits into other NTs). Some of these NTs eventually produce a terminal symbol (like t7, t16, etc.), but the ones with terminal symbols are given in the production rules as 't...' or a single terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t5, t31, t31, t10, t14. So I need to see if this sequence can be derived by the grammar.\n\nMy approach will be to work backwards, starting with the string and trying to find a derivation from the start symbol S. So I'll attempt to parse the string using the given grammar rules, checking each step for consistency.\n\nLet's start by looking at the top-level production for S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. This means to derive S, we need two non-terminals producing t81 and t90, respectively, but wait, wait\u2014that's not right. Wait, no: In CNF, each production produces two non-terminals. So S produces NT81 and NT90, each of which are non-terminals, which then produce further things.\n\nWait, but when we're looking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so we need to trace back where these terminals come from.\n\nSo the string is t5 t31 t31 t10 t14. Let's try to break it down.\n\nLooking at the end, t14 is the last symbol. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce 't14'. For example, S90 (but in the grammar, S was S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so maybe 90 is S90, but I have to check the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's list all the productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT90 \u2192 't14' (from the given list)\nNT7 \u2192 't1' (for example)\nNT82 \u2192 't6'\nNT60 \u2192 't24'\nNT86 \u2192 't32, 't35, etc.\nNT25 \u2192 't15, 't5'\nNT43 \u2192 't20, 't1, etc.\nNT13 \u2192 't15'\nNT28 \u2192 't34'\nNT51 \u2192 't32'\nNT83 \u2192 't23'\nNT95 \u2192 't13, 't9, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I can see multiple NTs that produce different terminals. So, let's see:\n\nThe last symbol is 't14', which comes from NT90 \u2192 't14'. So, the last production must be NT90 \u2192 't14'. That means the second part of S \u2192 NT81 NT90 must be NT90 \u2192 't14'.\n\nSo, for the string to be derived, the part ending with t14 must come from NT90 \u2192 't14'. Therefore, in the derivation, the last symbol must come from NT90.\n\nSo the string is t5 t31 t31 t10 t14.\n\nSo the last part is t14, which must come from NT90.\n\nThe rest of the string before t14 is t5 t31 t31 t10.\n\nSo, this part before t14 comes from NT81, since S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So NT81 needs to derive t5 t31 t31 t10.\n\nWait, no, wait: No. Wait, S derivation is NT81 \u2192 something and NT90 \u2192 something else. So the string is NT81's derived string followed by NT90's derived string.\n\nSo the full string would be NT81's result followed by NT90's result. But in the string given, it's t5 t31 t31 t10 t14. So let's see: Suppose NT81 \u2192 t5 t31 t31 t10, and NT90 \u2192 t14. Wait, but t14 is a single terminal, so NT90 \u2192 't14', which is a single symbol. So the entire string's length is 5 symbols: t5, t31, t31, t10, t14.\n\nBut that would mean that NT81's derivation is t5 t31 t31 t10, and NT90 is t14. So let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, but NT81 is a non-terminal. So how can it produce t5 t31 t31 t10? Because in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So to produce a sequence of multiple terminals, we must have a chain of productions breaking them down into each terminal via a series of productions.\n\nSo, for example, if NT81 \u2192 A B, and A \u2192 t5, B \u2192 NT31, then NT31 \u2192 t31, etc. But perhaps let's think step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo the string is the concatenation of NT81's derived string and NT90's derived string.\n\n2. NT90 \u2192 't14' \u2192 so that's done.\n\n3. NT81 needs to derive t5 t31 t31 t10, which is four symbols. Since terminals can only come from terminals in one step, but we have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, we need to see if this is possible through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So a non-terminal can only expand into two things each time. So to get t5, t31, t31, t10, the structure must involve breaking down into these terms.\n\nLet me attempt to see how t5, t31, t31, and t10 can be produced from NT81.\n\nLet's consider NT81's production. Let's check the grammar: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 as per the given, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo NT81 can't directly produce a terminal; it must go through NT95 and NT9 first. So let's look at NT95 and NT9.\n\nNT9: according to the grammar, several NTs produce t9. Looking through the production rules, I see NT95 \u2192 't0', 't13', etc. Wait, and looking at NT9, let me see the productions: I don't see NT9 having any production in the given list, but wait: NT95 is in the productions as NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. Hmm.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me make a table of all the NTs and their productions to see possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree. Let me try to analyze the possible steps.\n\nGiven the string t5 t31 t31 t10 t14, let's see:\n\n1. The first symbol is t5. So it must come from a production where a non-terminal directly produces t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't20' and 't1'.\n\nNT13 \u2192 't15'.\n\nNT28 \u2192 't34'.\n\nNT51 \u2192 't32' and 't22'.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, let's check which ones directly produce t5.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nWait, looking through the given rules:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't15' and 't5' (from NT25's production?)

Hmm, let's see. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form grammars have productions where each rule is either of the form A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems extensive with various non-terminals and terminals. Each production either generates a terminal or combines two non-terminals. Since the string consists solely of terminal symbols, I should work backwards from the string and see if I can trace back using the provided productions to reach the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is `t15 t1 t33 t31 t6 t14`. Let's list them in order: t15, t1, t33, t31, t6, t14.\n\nSince each terminal in the grammar is only produced by one production, I can try to find which non-terminal each terminal comes from. Let's make a list:\n\n- t15: Looking at the grammar, NT67 -> 't15'. So t15 is from NT67.\n- t1: NT7 -> 't1'.\n- t33: NT39 -> 't33'.\n- t31: NT31 -> 't31'.\n- t6: NT9 -> 't6'.\n- t14: NT90 -> 't14'.\n\nSo the breakdown is: t15 (NT67) \u2192 t1 \u2192 t33 (NT39) \u2192 t31 \u2192 t6 (NT9) \u2192 t14 (NT90). Now, we need to see how these non-terminals can be tied together based on the productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning of the string, t15 is NT67. What can NT67 produce? Looking through the productions, NT67 \u2192 NT60 NT55. So to get NT67, it must come from NT60 and NT55.\n\nNow, t1 is NT7. Looking at NT7's productions: NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 or NT77, etc. Specifically, one of the productions is NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35. Also, there might be others, but let me check.\n\nWait, the productions include NT7 -> NT48 NT35, and also NT7 appears in other places like NT74 -> NT31 NT83. Hmm, but t1 is only produced by NT7, which is via NT7-> NT48 and NT35, I think. Let me check the productions for NT7.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT7: NT7 -> NT48 NT35 and also NT7 -> NT77. So, NT7 can be either NT48 followed by NT35 or just NT77. But since we have t1, which is from NT7, and if there's a production where NT7 leads to a terminal, let's see. Wait, no. In the grammar, NT7 appears as a left-hand side only in rules like NT79 -> NT43 NT60, but NT7 itself doesn't directly produce terminals. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT7 is a non-terminal, and looking again, all productions for NT7 either split into two non-terminals or something else. Wait, checking the given productions:\n\nLooking back, I notice:\n\nNT79 is not in the provided productions, perhaps that was a typo. Wait, no, looking carefully, the productions listed are all the rules.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT7, there's NT7 -> 't1'. Oh, yes, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nSo, that's the production NT7 \u2192 't1'. So, t1 comes directly from NT7.\n\nSo, going back, the breakdown is:\n\nt15 (NT67) \u2192 t1 (NT7) \u2192 t33 (NT39) \u2192 t31 (NT31) \u2192 t6 (NT9) \u2192 t14 (NT90).\n\nSo, breaking down each terminal:\n\n1. t15 \u2192 NT67 \u2192 which is from NT60 and NT55.\n2. t1 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 from NT7.\n3. t33 \u2192 NT39 \u2192 which is 't33', so NT39.\n4. t31 \u2192 NT31 \u2192 which is 't31'.\n5. t6 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 which is 't6'.\n6. t14 \u2192 NT90 \u2192 which is 't14'.\n\nSo, starting from the left end:\n\nt15 must be from NT67, which requires NT60 and NT55.\n\nLooking at NT60: the productions for NT60 include NT98 NT55. So, NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nBut wait, NT98 is in the grammar, and looking at NT98's productions: NT98 \u2192 NT99 NT43 or something? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, under NT98, the production is NT98 \u2192 NT79 NT83.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let's re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT98: NT98 -> NT79 NT83?

Let me double-check some of these.\n\nFirst, let's look for t14, which is NT90. In the grammar, NT90's production is... wait, according to the list above, there is a production NT90 -> something? Let me see: looking at the list, the last production before the string is NT98 -> 't24', and earlier ones, but I don't see NT90 in any production. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, the last two productions in the grammar are:\n\n- NT83 -> 't23'\n- NT90 -> 't14'\n\nYes, so NT90 is part of the grammar as well.

{"custom_id":"request-95","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t5 t23 t18 t33 t31 t10 t14\". The grammar provided seems quite extensive, with all the terminals and non-terminals defined in a detailed way.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have certain properties: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, many of the production rules fit this structure, except for some which directly produce terminals like 't1', 't10', etc. So, this should be manageable.\n\nThe string consists of a series of tokens separated by spaces: t5, t23, t18, t33, t31, t10, t14. My task is to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I think about the parsing process. In CNF, the top-down parsing method (like the CYK algorithm) is typically used, which builds a table to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol. But since I might not remember the exact steps, I'll try another approach: working from the string backwards to see if each token can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t5 t23 t18 t33 t31 t10 t14\". Each token is a terminal, so I need to find a path from the start symbol S down to these terminals, following the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first two symbols in the string should be the results of NT81 and NT90's derivations. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part should be nt81, and the second part should be nt90.\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals which might produce multiple terminals. So, perhaps the string is a sequence of 7 tokens, which might be generated by expanding NT81 and NT90 into these tokens.\n\nLet me first look at each NT and see how they are structured.\n\nStarting with NT81: looking at the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT95 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT95's productions: it can go to NT25 NT60, NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55, and so on. Hmm, this could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps looking for direct terminal productions.\n\nLooking at NT7: in the grammar, it has several productions, one of which is NT7 \u2192 't1'. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't10', NT90 \u2192 't14', etc.\n\nSo, the string ends with t14, which is from NT90. Looking at NT90's productions, it's NT90 \u2192 NT95 NT18. Then, NT95 can produce several things, including NT25 NT60, but also some direct terminal productions: NT95 \u2192 NT13 (I think, but looking back, let me check).\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT95 has production rules like NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, but also NT95 \u2192 NT0 (from one of the productions I see: \"NT95 -> NT0\"). Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\nNT95 -> NT0\n\nAnd NT0: I don't see a NT0 in the grammar, but looking further, I see NT95 \u2192 't13' and NT95 \u2192 't0'. Oh, right. Wait, in the grammar, I see \"NT95 -> 't13'\" and \"NT95 -> 't0'\". So, NT95 can produce 't13' or 't0'. Also, in another production, I see NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT25 \u2192 't5', and NT60 \u2192 't5' as well. Wait, no: looking back, let's list all the NT productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look for where the terminals are.\n\nThe terminals in the string are t5, t23, t18, t33, t31, t10, t14.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can list which NTs produce which terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT37 \u2192 't37' [Wait, no, looking at the productions, let me check.]\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: for example, NT37 has a production NT37 \u2192 't18' and others? Let me find each terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't16' (NT18 production)\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\nWait no, looking more carefully, let me list all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't1' (seems it's just one production, but actually I think it's multiple)\nWait, let me reorganize:\n\nLooking at each NT rule:\n\nNT7: production list includes NT48 NT35, NT86 NT28, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT77 \u2192 't34', and maybe others?

{"custom_id":"request-89","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if the given string \"t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t10 t14\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, or a non-terminal to a terminal. All the productions here seem to be either two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or a non-terminal to a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar. Each rule is of the form NT_X -> NT_Y NT_Z, except some are directly to terminals like 't6', 't3', etc. The goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. \n\nThe string is \"t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t10 t14\". Since we're dealing with a string of terminals separated by spaces, I can think of it as a sequence of symbols: ['t6', 't3', 't16', 't5', 't31', 't10', 't14'].\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90. So whatever the string is, it must start with the combination of NT81 and NT90. Let me check the productions for NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81, it's defined as NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So that would split the string into two parts: something from NT95 and something from NT9.\n\nFor NT9, I see looking at the productions, it's either 't10' or maybe I need to check. Wait, looking back, NT90 is S's other part. Let me look up NT90.\n\nWait, the grammar given has S -> NT81 NT90. So the entire string must start with NT81 and NT90. Then, breaking it into two parts: NT81 and NT90. So the first production from NT81 is NT95 NT9, and NT90's production\u2014if I check\u2014is 't14' because in the list of productions, NT90 -> 't14'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t10 t14', so splitting into two parts based on S's production, I'm not sure yet, but perhaps the first part comes from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nWait, no, because S's production is NT81 and NT90. So during parsing, the string is broken into two parts: one that matches NT81 (leading to 't6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t10') and then another that matches NT90, which is just 't14'. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t10 t14\n\nSince S starts with NT81 NT90, the parsing process would first consume the part that NT81 produces and the part that NT90 produces.\n\nLet's look at NT90. The production for NT90 is 't14'. So the last symbol in the string is 't14', so the second part of the string (from NT90) is just one symbol: t14. But the string has seven symbols, so if the last one is from NT90 (t14), then the first six symbols come from NT81.\n\nWait, that doesn't match because the split from S is NT81 followed by NT90. So the entire string is a sequence where the first part is from NT81 and the second part is from NT90. So the string must be split into two parts: NT81 and NT90. But the string is seven symbols. So let's see.\n\nIf the string is seven symbols long, then perhaps the NT81 produces the first part, and NT90 produces the last symbol. So let me see what's on the right-hand side of NT81 and NT90.\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nSo to produce something from NT81, we need to break it into NT95 and NT9. Let's see what each of them produces.\n\nLooking at NT95, its productions include 't0', 't1', 't14', among others. For example, NT95 -> NT25 NT60, which may further break down.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree starting with S and see if it can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reverse the string and see if each step of the grammar can be reversed. But that might take time.\n\nMaybe I should try to see if the string can be derived by working from the start symbol and building up to the given string.\n\nStep 1: S starts as NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, from S, we have [nt81, nt90]. The string to match is ['t6', 't3', 't16', 't5', 't31', 't10', 't14'].\n\nWait, but NT90 is a terminal, 't14', so that's the last part. So the string up to 't14' would be parsed by NT90.\n\nSo, the string up to 't14' is t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t10. That needs to be generated by NT81. Let's see: NT81 can split into NT95 and NT9. So NT95 and NT9 need to generate ['t6','t3','t16','t5','t31','t10'].\n\nLooking at NT9: productions include 't10' and others. So NT9 can generate 't10' directly. So perhaps the last symbol from NT9 is 't10', meaning the first five symbols must be generated by NT95.\n\nWait, NT95 has multiple productions: 't0', 't1', 't5', 't14', etc.\n\nLooking at NT95 -> t25 t60 (earlier) or other combinations.\n\nThis seems complex. Let me try a top-down approach.\n\nStart at S: NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the string must be [from NT81] followed by [from NT90], which is 't14'.\n\nSo the remaining string is ['t6', 't3', 't16', 't5', 't31', 't10'].\n\nNT81's production: NT95 NT9.\n\nSo, we break this into NT95 and NT9.\n\nNow, NT9 can directly produce 't10' as an option. So 't10' is one symbol.\n\nSo the next part after NT95 and NT9 must generate the first five symbols: ['t6', 't3', 't16', 't5', 't31'].\n\nNT95's productions include 't14' (but that's not part of these), 't15', 't5', etc. Wait, NT95 -> NT25 NT60, for example. Or maybe NT95\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea7\u751f\u67d0\u4e9b\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u50cf't5'\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u3002\n\nWait, NT95's productions include multiple options, including 't5' when NT5 is matched. For example, looking at NT5: does it have 't5' as an option? Looking back, yes: NT55 -> NT67 NT37, but other rules?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. Let's see the productions:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nSo S must produce NT81 followed by NT90. Both are non-terminals, which means I need to expand them further.\n\nLooking at NT90, from the list, I see NT90 -> 't14'. Great, so the last part of the string is 't14', which matches NT90. So the string ends with T14, which is correct.\n\nNext, NT81. Checking the productions, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. Let's expand NT95 and NT9.\n\nNT9 -> 't10' directly, as per the grammar. So that's the 't10' part.\n\nNow NT95: It can be expanded in multiple ways, like NT95 -> NT25 NT60, among others. Let's pick the one that leads us closer. Wait, from the grammar, I see NT95 has several productions, let's list them:\n\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT95 -> NT55 NT37\n- NT95 -> NT67 NT35\n- NT95 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT95 -> NT51 NT60\n- NT95 -> NT51 NT60\n\nHmm, let's see which one fits. The string so far is t10, and after that, we might have NT51, which would give us another part. Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nSo, S -> NT81 NT90. NT81 -> NT95 NT9. NT9 is 't10', so that gives us 't10'. Then NT95 must produce some two non-terminals that will give us the other parts.\n\nLooking at the string: after t10, we have t0, t15, t16, t15, t31, t6. So after t10 (from NT9), we need to expand NT95 into something that starts with t0.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions again. For example, NT95 -> NT25 NT60. Let's see what NT25 gives. NT25 -> 't15' as per the grammar. So NT25 could be 't15'. Then NT60 could produce something. NT60 can be 't24' (from NT60 -> NT98 NT55 or NT60 -> ...), but let's check NT60's productions:\n\nWait, according to the grammar:\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nBut that's a two-step expansion. Let me check NT98's productions.\n\nNT98 can be 't31' or 't34'. Hmm, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT98 -> 't31' and also NT98 -> 't34' (wait, no, looking at the list again, let's check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35, etc., and eventually some produce t31 or t34. But more directly, do any NT98 productions give terminals? Yes, NT98 can become 't31' via NT98 -> NT67 NT35, because NT67 produces 't15' and NT35 produces 't18'\u2014wait, no, that gives 't15 t18', which isn't a single terminal. Wait, maybe another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each NT and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1', 't20', 't43', etc., no, most of them go to non-terminals except NT7 is used as 't1' or 't20', etc.\n\nLooking for NT95 -> ... and that can produce 't0' in the string.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT95. From the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT12 -> 't35'\n\nNT77 -> NT67 NT35\n\nBut NT67 -> 't15' and NT35 -> 't18', which is not a terminal. So that would give t35 followed by t15 t18, which doesn't fit.\n\nLooking for when NT95 can produce a terminal. Let's check:\n\nNT95 -> NT55 NT37\n\nNT55 -> 't6' (wait, no, according to the grammar, NT55 -> 't31' not 't6'). Wait no, looking:\n\nWait, in the grammar list:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37 (I think I misread before). Let me recheck.\n\nWait, no, the grammar lists:\n\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nBut NT67 -> 't15' (from NT67 -> 't15'), so NT55 would be 't15'something'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. Maybe we should start from the string and see if it can be split into parts according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6 t14\n\nLength is 8 tokens.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6 t14\n\nWait, let's see the end: the last t14 comes from NT90, so the last part is NT90, which is 't14'.\n\nSo the last token is 't14' from NT90. So the string up to t14 must have been produced by NT90, which is the second symbol in S's production (S -> NT81 NT90). So S is NT81 followed by NT90, which is t14.\n\nNow, before that, before NT90, the second part is NT81, which must produce the remaining part up to 't6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6'.\n\nWait, NT81 is 't6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6', followed by 't14'.\n\nSo we need to see if NT81 can produce 't6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6'.\n\nLooking at NT81's production: NT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nSo NT81 is two non-terminals, NT95 and NT9.\n\nNT9 is a terminal: looking at the grammar, NT9 -> 't10'.\n\nSo that gives us 't10' as part of the string. But wait, in the string before 't14', we have 't6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6'. So 't10' isn't part of that, which is a problem because NT9 produces 't10', which would have to be in the middle of the string.\n\nWait, that suggests a mismatch. Because according to the string, after the start NT81 and NT90 parts, the string is 't6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6 t14'. But if NT81 is NT95 followed by NT9, which is 't10'... but the string before 't14' is 't6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6', which includes 't0' but not 't10', which is produced by NT9.\n\nHmm, that suggests a conflict because NT90 is 't14' and the part before that would have to be NT81, which is NT95 NT9 (t10), but in the string provided, before the last t14, there is a 't10' at position 2 (if counting from 0). Wait, let's count the tokens:\n\nt6 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6 t14 \u2014 that's 8 tokens.\n\nWait, the entire string is: 't6', 't0', 't15', 't16', 't15', 't31', 't6', 't14'.\n\nSo the structure is: S starts with NT81 and NT90.\n\nNT90 is 't14', so the last token is 't14'.\n\nNT81, according to the grammar, is NT95"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. In CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol. The given grammar has all rules like S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and other non-terminals (NT) with two right-hand sides. The start symbol is S. \n\nLooking at the string to check: `t5 t24 t15 t10 t13 t0 t10 t14`. So it's a sequence of t tokens followed by numbers. From the grammar, I see that certain non-terminals produce these t tokens. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT18 \u2192 't20', etc. So each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol derived from a specific non-terminal.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the string through a series of productions. Since the string is all terminals, I need to derive each t token step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. According to the rule, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first two parts of the string should come from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, the first t token is t5. Let's see where t5 comes from. From the grammar, I see that NT25 \u2192 't5'. So NT25 must produce t5. So I can have NT25 as one of the left-hand sides. How do I get NT25?\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a rule NT25 \u2192 't15' and another that's NT25 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 't6' and another NT25 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't34'. Hmm, none of these produce t5. Wait, I'm seeing NT25 in two different places. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT25 \u2192 't15' (is this correct? Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT25 \u2192 't5' perhaps? Let me check the grammar provided. Yes, the user wrote:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\nand\nNT25 -> NT9 -> 't6'\nand also NT26 -> NT25...\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar as provided:\n\nNT25 is defined as:\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT25 -> NT9 -> 't6' (Wait, no, the grammar shows NT25-> 't15'? Let me look again.\n\nUser's grammar:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\nAnd another production for NT25 as NT9? Or is it NT9 that produces 't6'?\n\nWait, no, the user's grammar is:\n\nThe grammar provided has several NT productions, each with two non-terminals except for when it produces a terminal. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1'. So for NT25, the rule is NT25 -> 't15'.\n\nWait, no, looking again: The provided grammar for NT25 is:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nSo NT25 directly produces 't15', which is t15.\n\nBut in the string, the first t is t5, not t15. Hmm, that seems problematic. Because according to the grammar, NT25 can only produce t15. So how does t5 come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nSo the production for NT25 is directly 't15' and that's it. There are no other rules for NT25 except that. So that means in the grammar, NT25 can only generate 't15', not 't5'.\n\nWait, but looking back at the user's input, under NT28: NT28 -> 't34'\n\nAnd for NT25, it's only defined as 't15' and also another line: \"NT25 -> NT9\" \u2014 wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, looking again, the user wrote:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nand\n\nNT25 -> NT9 -> 't6'\n\nWait, that's not accurate. Each rule has two non-terminals except when it's producing a terminal. So for NT25, the rule is:\n\nNT25 -> 't15' \u2014 meaningNT25 produces t15.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nIn the grammar, each production is a NT X \u2192 NT Y NT Z.\n\nExcept for when a NT X is directly assigned a terminal, like NT7 \u2192 't1', NT18 \u2192 't20', etc.\n\nSo looking at NT25 in the grammar:\n\nThe grammar shows:\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n\nSo NT25 can only produce t15. There's no other rule for NT25. Therefore, any 't' tokens derived from NT25 must be 't15'.\n\nWait, then in the string, the second token is t24, but let's see. Maybe I confused the order.\n\nWait, the string is: t5 t24 t15 t10 t13 t0 t10 t14.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the string is: `t5 t24 t15 t10 t13 t0 t10 t14`\n\nSo the first token is t5. So from S, we need to derive t5. But how? S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first two non-terminals must generate t5 and something else. But wait, the first part of the string is t5, which would have to come from NT81 or NT90, right?\n\nBecause S is broken into NT81 and NT90, so the first two steps would be NT81 producing t5, and NT90 producing something else.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT81's production is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Let's see how that goes.\n\nSo NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Let's see what those NTs produce.\n\nNT95 has a production: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55, and so on.

Wait, earlier I thought NT25 -> 't15'. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nYes, that's what it says. So NT25 can only produce t15.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the string has t5 as the first token. So unless I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT25 is part of a larger chain. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nThe grammar has NT25 defined as:\n\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nWait, so it's direct. So how can we get t5? That's an issue because NT25 can't produce t5. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT25, it's directly 't15'. So unless the string has t5, which the grammar can't produce, then the answer would be 'No'. But that doesn't make sense because the user included a string that includes t5, but if the grammar can't produce t5 from any of the non-terminals, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread earlier.

I need to see if each of these can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nI think I should map each terminal to the non-terminals that produce it, then see if starting from S, I can reach this string.\n\nLet me create a list of each terminal and what non-terminal it comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- t6 -> NT82 (from NT82 -> 't6')\n- t16 -> NT98 (NT98 -> 't16')\n- t5 -> NT97? Wait, but in the given grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce t5? Looking through the rules, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal produces 't5'. Let me check: NT9 is 't10' (from NT82 rules), NT13 -> 't15', so for t5, I don't see a production. Wait, am I missing something?\n\nWait, looking again: the grammar rules include NT48 -> 't23' and NT25 -> 't5'. Yes, so NT25 -> 't5'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- t3 comes from NT7 (looking at NT7 rules) like NT7 -> 't1', 't16', 't20', etc. So for t3, let's see: looking at the rules, NT77 -> 't34', NT37 -> 't9 no, wait, let's see the NT rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each terminal to their possible sources:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- t3: Let me check if any NT rule produces t3. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't1', 't16', 't20'\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT7 has some terminals like 't1' (from NT7 -> 't1'), 't16' (from NT7 -> 't16'), and 't20', but where is 't3'? Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see an NT rule that produces 't3'. Wait, the initial string includes t3, but if the grammar doesn't produce t3, then the answer is No.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules:\n\nNo, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal produces 't3'. The rules that produce terminals are:\n\nNT82 -> t6, t8, t16, etc. Specifically:\n\nLooking at NT23, wait, no. Wait:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT74 -> 't31' (NT74 -> 't31')\n- NT31 -> 't86' and t28\n- Wait, but in the string, t3 is present.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look through all the productions for terminals:\n\nThe string is t6, t6, t16, t5, t15, t6, t3, t10, t14.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me see which terminals are covered.\n\n- t6 comes from NT82\n- t16 comes from NT98\n- t5 comes from NT25 (since NT25 -> 't5')\n- t15 comes from NT60? (Wait, NT60 -> 't98' and 't5')\n- t3: Looking for a terminal 't3' production, but I don't see any NT rule producing 't3'. Wait, where is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let's look again:\n\nThe rules given are:\n\nLooking through each NT rule, I don't see any producing t3. For example, NT7 -> 't1', 't16', 't20' but no t3. So if t3 is in the string, and the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal that produces 't3', then the string cannot be generated, so the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and overlooked a rule that would produce t3. Let me cross-verify.\n\nLooking again through the list:\n\nThe rules that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT82 -> t6, t8, t16, t5, etc. Yes, t6 and others.\n\nLooking for 't3', I don't see any production in the grammar where a non-terminal directly gives 't3'. So if the string has t3, and that's not possible, then the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but perhaps t3 is generated by a longer derivation. For example, maybe through multiple steps, a non-terminal can produce t3 as a substring. But wait, no, in context-free grammars, each production is strictly on non-terminals or terminals. So unless a rule exists, t3 cannot be derived.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed some NT production that generates 't3'. Let me list all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT74 -> t31\n- NT7 -> t1, t16, t20\n- NT25 -> t15, t5\n- NT98 -> t31, etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me list all NTs and their terminals:\n\n1. NT7 -> 't1', 't16', 't20'\n2. NT25 -> 't15', 't5'\n3. NT48 -> 't23', etc.\n4. NT13 -> 't15', 't0', etc.\n5. NT77 -> 't34', etc.\n6. NT26 -> t25, t55, etc.\nWait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to create a list.\n\nFrom the given rules, let's extract all the NTs that directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-128","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string `t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the goal is to see if starting from S, after a series of derivations using the productions, we can derive the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. So the first step is to parse the string from the start symbol S and check if each part can be derived step by step.\n\nThe string is: t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14. Let's split this into tokens to process each part step by step.\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so we need to derive this exact sequence from S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation builds on the previous, combining non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals that can themselves be broken down.\n\nLet's start by looking at the overall structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the first production rule is:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo S directly produces two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90.\n\nTherefore, the string must be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo, the string can be split into two parts: the first part must come from NT81, and the second from NT90.\n\nLooking at the given string: t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14\n\nWe need to determine if the first part (t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7) is produced by NT81, and the second part (t6 t14) by NT90.\n\nBut wait, let's check the production for NT90.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT90 -> t14\n\nSo NT90's production is just t14, which is a single character. So the second part of the string is just t14, which matches, but we need to ensure that the preceding part (before t14) is derived from NT81.\n\nSo NT81's production is:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nSo NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nThen NT95 and NT9 must be derived, with NT9 being a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at NT9 in the grammar:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo NT9 is a single terminal symbol, which is t10. Wait, but in the string, after t16, the next is t35, and before that is t7. Wait, but the split I suggested earlier may not align correctly. Let me reevaluate.\n\nLet me think again. The string is t6, t15, t5, t0, t16, t35, t7, t6, t14.\n\nBut NT90 is directly t14, so the last token must be t14, which it is. So the entire string is: (t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7) followed by t14.\n\nSo the prefix of the string (before t14) must be derived from NT81, which is NT95 NT9.\n\nSo the first part, t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7, must come from NT95 NT9.\n\nBreaking it down, NT95 is N95, and it can produce:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 OR NT25 NT60\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT95, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nWait, but the grammar entry is:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nSo NT95 produces NT25 and NT60.\n\nBut also, from elsewhere, NT95 is also:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60 (duplicate?)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided:\n\nI see:\n\nNT95 appears twice:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nand\n\nNT95 -> t13 (I think I made a mistake earlier; let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT95: There's a line that says NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and another line says NT95 -> NT0, but wait, I need to look carefully.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the grammar entries:\n\nFirst entry is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nThen NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39.\n\nContinuing down, I see:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60.\n\nAnother entry is NT95 -> NT55 NT9 ?\n\nWait, no, the grammar has:\n\nLooking again, the grammar entries are:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60,\n\nand also:\n\nLooking further down:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37,\n\nNT25 -> t15,\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 -> t13,\n\nand NT95 -> t0.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, let me parse all the rules:\n\nThe grammar entries are:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT12 -> 't30'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT55 -> 't31'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nWait, so there are two productions for NT95:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nand\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 again?

{"custom_id":"request-150","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two terminals or non-terminals. The given grammar follows this structure, all rules look like NTxx -> NTyy NTzz or something ending with a terminal, except for the initial rule S -> NT81 NT90. Also, each production has the left-hand side being a single non-terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t5 t29 t18 t33 t15 t10 t0 t15 t6 t14.\n\nI remember that the CYK algorithm is typically used for parsing strings with CNF grammars. But since I'm a bit rusty, let me try to approach this by breaking down the string and seeing if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and their expansions:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can produce t-terminal. The direct terminals are: t1, t2, ..., t5, etc. So I'll need to see which non-terminals can produce these t's.\n\nFirst, let's see which t's are produced by each non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT37\nBut looking at the rules, NT86 also produces t32. Let's check: looking at the grammar, NT86 has a rule that produces t32, right? Wait, looking back: \n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT86 -> 't32'. So when a non-terminal can reach a terminal, that's a direct production.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, which each must be produced by the grammar. Let me check each terminal:\n\nt5: Does any non-terminal produce t5? Looking through the rules, I see NT25 -> 't15', NT25 also has another production as NT25 -> 't5'? Wait, checking the rules, no:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> NT18 NT35\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\nWait, maybe I need to find each terminal's derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each t-terminal to the non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nt1: Found where?\nLooking at the rules, I see NT77 -> NT34, but wait, the string has t1. Let me check: actually, the rules have NT7 -> 't1'. So NT7 can produce t1. Also, looking at other rules that may produce t1, like NT43 -> 't1' ?\n\nWait, looking through each production:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT43 -> 't1' yes, so NT43 can produce t1.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nt2: Looking for any rules that end with t2. From the rules, I don't see any; maybe through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some, but it's better to see step by step.\n\nLet me try each terminal in the string and see how they can be derived.\n\nThe string is: t5, t29, t18, t33, t15, t10, t0, t15, t6, t14.\n\nEach term must be the result of a production. Let me check if each is present as a terminal or can be reached.\n\nt5: Looking at the rules, which non-terminals produce t5? Let's look. I see NT43 -> 't1', NT13 -> 't0', NT25 -> 't15' and 't5'?\n\nWait, checking again:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT25 has some production to 't15'? Let me see:\n\nLooking, I see NT25: 't5'? Or maybe NT13 -> 't15' and others. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to map each t-terminal to its source in the grammar.\n\nt5: Does any rule directly produce t5? Looking through all the rules: yes, for NT25, one of the rules is NT25 -> 't5'. So NT25 can produce t5. Or wait, checking the grammar provided:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- Is there a rule that produces t5? Hmm, no, so maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all rules again to see if any produce t5.\n\nLooking through each production, for example:\n\n- NT25 production:\n  -> NT48 NT60 and also -> 't15'? Wait, I'm looking for t5. Let me scan each rule.\n\nWait, the given grammar's rules are a long list, perhaps I should parse the exact rules:\n\nLooking through all NTxx productions:\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\nNT25 -> 't15'\nNT86 -> 't32'\n\nWait, so it seems none of the rules directly produce t5 in the list. So maybe t5 can't be produced by any rule directly, which would mean the string is invalid because there's a t5 in the string that's not producible from the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\nNT25 -> 't15'\n\nDoes any other NT produce a t5? I don't see it. So 't5' as a terminal would require that it's produced by some NT.\n\nBut from the rules, no NT directly produces 't5'. So that's a problem because t5 is in the string.\n\nIf the string contains a t5 that's not producible, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. So that would mean the answer is 'No' because 't5' is missing from the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. Because some terminals are only reachable via multiple steps.\n\nWait, no, because the string is a sequence of terminals. Each term in the string must be directly produced by a production step.

{"custom_id":"request-156","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string I need to check if it's generated by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules that are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production only has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it does seem to fit CNF because each side of the \u2192 has either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is `t5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t15 t24 t0 t10 t14`. So, it's a sequence of terminal symbols: t5, t20, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, S produces two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Since the string starts with t5, I need to see if t5 can be derived from NT81 or NT90, and what the production would look like.\n\nLooking at NT90 in the rules, I see NT90 \u2192 NT31 NT83. So NT90 becomes NT31 and NT83. Then, I check the rules for NT31 and NT83.\n\nNT31 is in two rules: NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28 and NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55. Wait, no, looking again, the N-rules: NT31 is only in NT86\u2192... Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, let's list out all the NT rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT35\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, that last line seems conflicting. NT43 is listed twice with different rules. First, NT43\u2192NT1, but then again, I'm not sure if it's a typo or part of a different rule. Let me read it again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't35' is one rule, and then it appears again: NT43\u2192 't1', which can't be right. That must be a mistake. Maybe the original is supposed to have NT43\u2192NT25 NT37? Wait, looking back, I think I may have mixed up the NT43 rules. Let me check the original list.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake while copying. Let me recount the rules correctly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT86 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't33'\n\nNT88 \u2192 't7'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT60 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT51 \u2192 't32'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, that can't be correct. It seems that NT43 is being defined in two different ways, which is confusing. Maybe I misread the original grammar. Let's check the original list carefully.\n\nLooking again at the original grammar, under NT43:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't35' and then again NT43\u2192 't1'\u2014this seems like a duplication or an error. Perhaps the correct rule is NT43 \u2192 NT25 NT37, but in the original list, it's written twice. Alternatively, maybe one of them is a typo. Hmm, perhaps it's supposed to be NT43 \u2192 NT1, but then that's conflicting. I think I might have made a mistake earlier, so I'll need to clarify that.\n\nWait, no, perhaps in the original grammar, NT43 has two separate production rules: one that ends in 't35' and another that ends in 't1'. That can't be correct if it's in CNF because each non-terminal would have only one production. So maybe I misread. Let me check the original:\n\nLooking at the original rules, I see:\n\nNT43 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't1'\n\nThat can't be right because a non-terminal can't have two alternative productions. So perhaps this is a mistake, but assuming that the grammar is correct as given, maybe it's a formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps the second NT43 rule was meant to be something else, like NT43 \u2192 NT43... but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe one of them is a different terminal. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as best as I can, assuming that the rules are correctly given.\n\nWait, in the initial list, I might have copied the rules incorrectly. Let me go through the list again correctly.\n\nHere's the correct list of NT rules as provided:\n\n- S -> NT81 NT90\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88\n- NT48 -> NT69 NT74\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT74 -> NT31 NT83\n- NT35 -> NT12 NT77\n- NT86 -> NT51 NT88\n- NT95 -> NT37 NT18\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT86 -> NT25 NT37\n- NT31 -> NT86 NT28\n- NT60 -> NT98 NT55\n- NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT35\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT82 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't30'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT95 -> 't0'\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I know means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This should make parsing easier, maybe with algorithms like CYK, but since I'm just trying to figure it out manually, I'll have to see.\n\nLet me start by writing down the grammar again to have it clear in my mind. The start symbol is S, and it produces NT81 NT90. Each of those NTs leads to other combinations until some point where we get terminal symbols like 't3', 't16', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t10 t5 t5 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10 t14`. Let me see how many tokens that is. Counting them: t10, t5, t5, t15, t16, t15, t15, t6, t3, t10, t14. So that's 11 tokens. \n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, it's likely that the parsing process will involve building a derivation tree where each step splits into two non-terminals. Given that, the number of symbols in the string after full expansion should correspond to a certain pattern based on the grammar's structure.\n\nI should check what the start symbol S can produce. S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string should be the concatenation of what NT81 produces and what NT90 produces.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, let me see what NT81 and NT90 derive into. From the grammar, I see NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Hmm, so NT81 becomes NT95 NT9. Then, NT95 has some options. Looking at NT95, it's productions are NT25 NT60 and also other rules. It appears NT95 can go to NT25 NT60 or to NT37 NT18, etc. But looking at the end of the string, after t10, we have t14. Let me see NT95 \u2192 't13' in one of the productions.

So, perhaps NT95 must derive into a combination that eventually leads to terminals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT95 is used in several productions. So, for example, NT95 can produce NT25 NT60 or NT37 NT18, etc.\n\nWait, in the string to parse, after some steps, there's a t14. Looking at NT90, it's a terminal production? Let me see: NT90. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT90 directly going to a terminal, but wait, in the given lines:\n\nI see NT90 \u2192 't14'\u2014yes! So NT90 can produce t14 directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then NT9 is 't10'. So NT81 \u2192 t10 ... ?\n\nWait, let me clarify. When parsing, we need to see if we can split the string into two parts that each match the two non-terminals in the top-level production, S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo S generates a string that is the concatenation of what NT81 generates and what NT90 generates.\n\nTherefore, the entire string should be partitioned into two parts: Part A is generated by NT81, and Part B is generated by NT90.\n\nSo the string to parse is t10 t5 t5 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10 t14.\n\nThe first step would be to see if the string can be split into A and B such that A is generated by NT81 and B by NT90.\n\nLooking at NT90, which is the second part of S. NT90 can produce 't14' directly, as per the line NT90 \u2192 t14. So B is just t14. That means Part B is a single token, so it must be at the end, and the string must end with t14.\n\nLooking at the given string: the last token is t14, so that part is satisfied. So Part B is simply t14.\n\nTherefore, Part A must be t10 t5 t5 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10. And this part must be generated by NT81.\n\nNow, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo Part A is the concatenation of what NT95 generates and NT9 generates.\n\nLooking at NT9, it's a terminal: 't10'. So NT95 must generate the string t10 t5 t5 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10.\n\nSo the entire Part A is t10 followed by the rest, which should be generated by NT95.\n\nWait, no, more precisely: since NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT9 is 't10', then Part A is (NT95 generated string) followed by 't10'. But the entire string is Part A followed by 't14'. So, actually, the initial string is (NT81 generated string) which is (NT95 generated string) + 't10' followed by 't14'. So that might not make sense unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe entire string is t10 t5 t5 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10 t14.\n\nSince the start is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the overall string is (what NT81 generates) + (what NT90 generates).

{"custom_id":"request-171","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see. The grammar is provided with various non-terminals and their productions, and the string I need to evaluate is `t5 t20 t33 t15 t6 t15 t31 t31 t15 t10 t14`. \n\nFirst, I should check if the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a single non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals. So all productions except the start symbol should have exactly two non-terminals on the right, and the start symbol can have one non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, every production seems to have either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which is two non-terminals. NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39, another two non-terminals. The only ones that might have a terminal are those like NT7 \u2192 't1', which is a terminal on the right. I think that's how it works because in CNF, the only way to produce a terminal is a production of a non-terminal to a single terminal.\n\nSo the grammar seems to be in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to see if the given string `t5 t20 t33 t15 t6 t15 t31 t31 t15 t10 t14` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 11 tokens, so the parse tree would have a depth of 5 levels because each step in the parse tree splits each non-terminal into two, so the number of tokens (which are leaves) is 2^depth. Here, 2^4=16, which is more than 11, so maybe a different approach is needed, or perhaps the string is a result of some left or right-associative rules, but since it's CNF, it's more likely a left-associative structure.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions generate two symbols at a time. So for a string of length n, the number of production steps needed would be n-1, assuming each step adds one token. Hmm, but that's when the string is built up by one symbol at a time. Wait, perhaps the steps would be n-1 because each step could produce two symbols, but I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to build the string step by step using the given grammar, starting from S and expanding until I reach the target string.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string starts with NT81 and NT90. But in the given string, the first token is t5, which is a terminal. So in the string, the production must have started with a terminal, but according to the grammar, S starts with NT81 and NT90, both of which are non-terminals. Therefore, S cannot directly produce t5, but maybe one of these non-terminals can.\n\nWait, let me look at the productions for NT81, NT90, etc. From NT81, according to the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So that's two non-terminals. So if we expand NT81, it becomes NT95 and NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT90 is a production that I don't see in the initial list; checking the grammar, yeah, it's there: NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88. So NT90 expands into NT51 and NT88.\n\nSo the start symbol S expands into NT81 NT90, which becomes NT95 NT9 NT51 NT88. That's four non-terminals. Now, each of these non-terminals can expand further.\n\nLooking at NT95, the productions are:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 (duplicate)\n- NT95 \u2192 NT0 (terminal)\nSo, one of the NT95 can produce 't0'. Similarly, let's see NT9. From the grammar, NT9 is a non-terminal that produces 't10' directly: NT9 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo let's see: If we take NT95 as 't0', then NT9 becomes 't10', so we have 't0' 't10' so far from NT95 and NT9.\n\nNow, looking at NT51: NT51 \u2192 't32' (from grammar, I think it's NT51 \u2192 't32' right? Let me check: Yes, in the grammar, NT51 \u2192 't32'. So NT51 produces 't32'.\n\nSimilarly, NT88 \u2192 't7'. So that would be 't7'.\n\nPutting this together, from S, we have:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 (t0)(t10)\n- NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88 \u2192 (t32)(t7)\n\nSo the entire string would be t0 t10 t32 t7. But our target string is t5 t20 t33 t15 t6 t15 t31 t31 t15 t10 t14. That's not matching. So perhaps a different path in the grammar is needed.\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me try another approach. Maybe the string isn't directly generated by expanding S in one pass but requires a more detailed breakdown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each token in the target string and see if they can appear as leaves in the parse tree, generated by the grammar.\n\nThe target string is: t5 t20 t33 t15 t6 t15 t31 t31 t15 t10 t14.\n\nSo, 11 tokens. In a binary tree, the number of nodes would be 11, and the height would determine how many productions are needed. But perhaps a better approach is to construct the parse tree.\n\nLet me start from the leaves and work my way up, matching the tokens to the productions.\n\nThe last token is t14. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88. Then, looking at NT88, in the grammar, NT88 \u2192 't7'. But we have t14 as the last token, so that must come from somewhere. Wait, looking through the grammar again, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't14'. The closest is maybe NT70 \u2192 NT14, but looking at the list, I don't see that. Wait, the grammar provided ends with NT90 \u2192 't14'. So yes, NT90 \u2192 't14' seems to be the production.\n\nSo, in our target string, the last token is t14, so that must come from NT90 \u2192 't14'. So the entire string ends with NT90, which is the second part of S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So we can break the string into parts: the first part is generated from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is t20. Let's look at the productions that generate t20. Looking through the grammar, I find: NT77 \u2192 't34'; NT25 \u2192 't5'; NT43 \u2192 't35'; NT13 \u2192 't15'; NT26 \u2192 't15'; NT86 \u2192 't32'; NT31 \u2192 't35'; NT7 \u2192 't1'; NT98 \u2192 't24'; NT67 \u2192 't15'; NT12 \u2192 't35'; NT69 \u2192 't34'; NT51 \u2192 't32'; NT48 \u2192 't23'; NT25 \u2192 't5'; NT9 \u2192 't10'; NT43 \u2192 't1'; NT13 \u2192 't0'; NT28 \u2192 't34'; NT60 \u2192 't5'; NT48 \u2192 't29'; NT51 \u2192 't22'; NT83 \u2192 't23'; NT90 \u2192 't14'; NT7 \u2192 't20'; NT98 \u2192 't24'. Oh, I see that NT7 \u2192 't1'; but wait, no, there's also NT74 \u2192 't20' (as per the last section of the grammar: NT74 \u2192 't32'?), no, wait, I might be getting confused. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided has multiple entries for the same non-terminal. For example, NT7 appears here: NT7 \u2192 't1' (under NT7: NT74 \u2192 't32').

I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has a left-hand side that's a single non-terminal and a right-hand side that's either two terminals or two non-terminals. The grammar provided has these productions, so that's good. CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing, and I might use a method like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if that's the easiest way here, especially since the string has multiple terms.\n\nI see that the grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90. So, the first two tokens must be derived from NT81 and NT90. Looking at the string, it starts with `t5 t31 t15 t6 t15 t31 t15 t10 t3 t0 t10 t14`. Wait, no. Wait, the string is a sequence of tokens, each representing a terminal symbol. So the input is a list of tokens: t5, t31, t15, t6, t15, t31, t15, t10, t3, t0, t10, t14.\n\nBut I think the input might be processed as pairs. Let me see: the first token is t5, then t31, t15, t6, t15, t31, t15, t10, t3, t0, t10, t14. Wait, that's 12 tokens. So, the string is 12 tokens long. The grammar starts with S producing two non-terminals, so each step would split into more non-terminals and finally into terminals.\n\nI think I should try to parse the string by seeing each non-terminal and checking if it can derive the corresponding tokens.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules relevant for each non-terminal. Each rule has a production that can either split into two non-terminals or into two terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT81 NT90. So, the input must start with the tokens generated by NT81 and NT90. The string starts with t5, which is part of NT81's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT81 can produce 't95' and 't9.' Wait, no, let me check. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT81: in the rules, I see NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So, NT81 can only split into two NTs. Then, those would further split until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me see the structure of the grammar. Starting from S, which splits into NT81 and NT90. Each of these would split into other NTs until we reach terminals. The string is a series of these terminal tokens, so each non-terminal must derive a sequence of these tokens.\n\nSo, the first non-terminal, NT81, must derive a sequence that starts with t5, t31, etc. But let me see NT81's rules. From the grammar:\n\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60 or other rules? Wait, looking at the grammar, I think I missed some NT95 rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n...\nWait, no, NT95 has two rules:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT95 -> NT0 (Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar as given, the last part says:\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nWait, no, wait, looking more carefully, the last few lines in the grammar:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT25 -> NT5\nNT86 -> 't32'\nNT39 -> 't33'\nNT88 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't10'\n...\nBTW, I think I might have misread the grammar earlier.

The string is \"t10 t10 t6 t16 t20 t7 t0 t16 t5 t31 t6 t14\" and the grammar is a bunch of production rules, all of the form A -> BC except for the terminals. \n\nFirst off, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, my approach is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first step is to split S into NT81 and NT90. Each of these would generate parts of the string. But wait, the string starts with t10 t10, so maybe both NT81 and NT90 will generate something that can lead to t10s, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to parse the string back into the grammar. If the string can be decomposed into the rules systematically, then it's likely generated by the grammar. Let me write down the string: t10, t10, t6, t16, t20, t7, t0, t16, t5, t31, t6, t14.\n\nI know that in a CFG, each step doubles the number of symbols, but in the processed form (Chomsky normal), each step increases the number by one if it's a binary split. However, since the string is a sequence of terminals, the parse tree should consist of a root with two children, each of which is a parse tree for the respective part.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts: the first part is \"t10 t10 t6 t16 t20 t7 t0\", and the second part is \"t16 t5 t31 t6 t14\".\n\nWait, that's a random split, but the actual way is to look for rules that can produce these parts. Alternatively, maybe looking for the rules that start with t10. Let's look at the grammar rules that directly correspond to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several rules where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT9 \u2192 't10', etc. So to get a t10, we can look at NT9 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo perhaps NT9 is part of the structure. Now, looking back, we have S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So assuming NT81 and NT90 each produce a sequence that starts with t10, I'd need to check how those can happen.\n\nLooking at NT81, what produces it? The rules for NT81 are: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 and another rule? Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see any other rule for NT81 except NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 is derived from NT95 NT9. \n\nNow, NT9 \u2192 't10', so the second part is t10. For the first part, NT95. Looking at the grammar, NT95 has multiple production rules. Let's see: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, NT95 \u2192 NT67 NT37, etc. But wait, looking at the rule list, I notice that NT95 has a rule NT95 \u2192 't13'. Is that correct? Let me check the last few lines:\n\nWait, looking again:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT55? Or other? Wait, the last line has NT95 \u2192 't0' and another line says NT95 \u2192 't13'. Wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLines:\nNT7 \u2192 't1' \nNT77 \u2192 't34' \nNT35 \u2192 't18' \nNT60 \u2192 't95 NT55' \u2192 Wait, no, NT60 \u2192 NT82 (wait, no, actually, let me look:\n\nWait, the grammar given is a long list. I think a better way is to look for the rules where the non-terminals on the right go to a terminal. Let me scan:\n\nI see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT37 NT25 \u2192 (but then NT25 may be further split)\nNT95 \u2192 't13' \u2192 Yes, there's a rule where NT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nSimilarly, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT9 \u2192 't10', NT77 \u2192 't34', etc. So for NT95, one of its rules is to 't13'.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought NT95 can produce t13, but from the production NT95, I also have other rules like NT95 \u2192 NT67 NT37. So if we choose the rule NT95 \u2192 't13', that directly gives t13, which is part of our string. Hmm, but my string starts with t10, which comes from NT9, not NT95. I think I need to correct myself.\n\nWait, no. Because S \u2192 NT81 NT90. If NT90 \u2192 't31' and 't30' and such, perhaps. Let me clarify the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a top-down parse, trying to match the string against the grammar. Since the string starts with t10, t10, etc., we can see if the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nFirst, the string is length 12. Since S splits into two parts, each part would need to correspond to the two non-terminals. Each part halves the tokens as we go deeper.\n\nSo the first token is t10, which must come from the first part of the split of S. Let's focus on the left side: \"t10 t10 t6 t16 t20 t7 t0\".\n\nWait, let me note down the entire string structure. Maybe in the form of parse tree levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write the string as a list and then process it from the front, trying to match each part to the grammar.\n\nLet me write the string: [t10, t10, t6, t16, t20, t7, t0, t16, t5, t31, t6, t14]\n\nStarting from S, which produces NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, the first symbol of the string must be the start of NT81's derivation, and the second symbol starts with NT90's derivation.\n\nSo, the first token is t10, which should be part of NT81's derivation. Let's look at NT81's rules. From the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and that's it. So NT81 can't directly produce a terminal symbol, it must split into NT95 and NT9.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must be the expansion of NT95 NT9.\n\nWait, but NT9 is 't10' directly. So if NT9 generates t10, which is the first token, that's fine. So let's see: the first token is t10, so that's NT9. Then, the next token must be the left side after the split of NT95.\n\nBut wait, NT95 is a non-terminal, so it must be expanded into two parts, which could produce terms that form the rest of the string.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to see if the given string can be split into the left and right parts recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to reconstruct the parse tree, I should consider looking for non-terminals that can produce certain terminal sequences.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t10, which must come from some path in the grammar. Let me see which non-terminals produce t10.\n\nLooking through the rule list, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35', etc.\n\nSo the only way to get t10 is from NT9. So the first token t10 must come from NT9, which is part of the NT81 production.\n\nSo, in the root, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first token is from NT81, which is split into NT95 and NT9. So the first token is NT9's t10.\n\nThen, the next few tokens must come from NT95 and NT90.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the entire string as a sequence and see how it can be split into two parts from the root's split.\n\nThe string is t10 t10 t6 t16 t20 t7 t0 t16 t5 t31 t6 t14.\n\nSince S splits into two, the first part is the first N symbols, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier to parse. Since each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the starting symbol, I think I'll need to use a recursive descent parser or perhaps apply the CYK algorithm. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar and the string to analyze it better. The grammar consists of several non-terminals, like S, NT7, NT98, etc., each expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. Some of the non-terminals expand into terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. So, each production either breaks down into more non-terminals or directly provides a terminal.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol, S, I see it expands into NT81 and NT90. So the string must start with the concatenation of the symbols that NT81 and NT90 can derive. Let me check what NT81 and NT90 expand into. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9.

For example, NT95 has two different production rules: one where it's NT25 NT60, and another where it's 't0'. Also, NT7 has two rules: one mapping to NT48 NT35, and another to 't20'. Similarly, NT98 is mapped to 't31' but also to NT31 NT83, which could potentially expand further.\n\nThis suggests that some rules might not be correct, or perhaps there's an error in the provided grammar. For instance, NT95 can't be both a non-terminal and a terminal. That might complicate things because it could lead to contradictions.\n\nLooking at the string to be checked: `t10 t10 t0 t15 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t20 t7 t6 t14`.\n\nI should break it down into individual tokens and see how they can be generated from the grammar.\n\nStarting from the top symbol S, which is NT81 NT90. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nFrom the rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT90 is just 't14'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT81 NT90 becomes NT95 NT9 t14.\n\nNow, let's expand NT95. The rules for NT95 are two:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo NT95 can become either 't0' or NT25 NT60.\n\nIf it's 't0', then we have t0 t9 t14. But t9 is not in the string. So maybe we need to expand NT95 further using NT25 and NT60.\n\nLooking at NT25, it has two rules: NT25 \u2192 't15' and NT25 \u2192 NT5 (wait, not sure, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, rule 50 says NT25 \u2192 't5'. That's correct. So NT25 can be 't15' or 't5'. Similarly, NT60's rules are:\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT60 \u2192 't5' (rule 40).\n\nSo let's try expanding NT25 NT60.\n\nLet me consider first expanding NT95 as NT25 NT60, then each can expand.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT95 NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT60 NT90.\n\nNow, NT25 can be 't15' or, if we choose the other rule, which is 't5'. Let's see.\n\nIf we choose NT25 \u2192 't15', then NT60 can be 't5' or continue expanding.\n\nWait, let's try step by step.\n\nLet me try to derive t10 t10 t0 t15 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t20 t7 t6 t14.\n\nSince S is NT81 NT90, which is t10 t10 (because NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, which needs to produce t10, but NT9 is 't10') and then NT90 is 't14'. Wait, maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, the string starts with t10 t10, which matches NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and both NT95 and NT9 should produce t10. But looking at the rules, NT9 \u2192 't10' (rule 36). So NT9 expands to 't10'.\n\nBut NT95 has two options: either 't0' or NT25 NT60. If NT95 is expanding to 't10', that would be conflicting with rule 36, which says NT9 \u2192 't10'. Wait, no, rule 36 is NT9 \u2192 't10', so if NT95 is expanded as 't10', that's possible. So perhaps S \u2192 NT81 NT90 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 't10' 't10' 't14'? But the string is longer, so that's just the first three tokens, but the string is longer.\n\nWait, actually, let me get this straight.\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT90 \u2192 't14'.\n\nSo so far, S can produce NT95 NT9 followed by 't14', leading to a structure where the first part is NT95 NT9 t14.\n\nBut wait, the overall string is longer.

{"custom_id":"request-229","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that means each production rule has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky Normal Form actually requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this case, all the productions seem to be in that form.\n\nThe given string is `t6 t6 t16 t5 t15 t10 t5 t31 t15 t6 t3 t15 t6 t14`. So I need to break this down into the terminal symbols and see if they can be derived from the start symbol S via a series of productions.\n\nFirst, let's write down the start symbol: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string must be a combination of symbols starting with NT81 and NT90, but wait, NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals. So the string must be a sequence of terminals that these non-terminals can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT90 \u2192 't14'. So the last token 't14' must come from NT90. Similarly, NT81 \u2192 't9' as per the rules? Wait, let me check the grammar. I see NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Hmm, that's a non-terminal. So NT81 breaks down into NT95 and NT9, which are themselves non-terminals. Similarly, NT90 is a direct terminal 't14'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't6', but wait, the start symbol S produces NT81 and NT90, so the entire string must be formed by concatenating the terminals produced by NT81 and NT90. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string: t6, t6, t16, t5, t15, t10, t5, t31, t15, t6, t3, t15, t6, t14.\n\nThat's a total of 14 tokens. So I need to see how these can be split between NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, NT81 and NT90 are separate non-terminals, each producing a sequence of terminals. So the string is a concatenation of the sequences derived from NT81 and NT90. So I need to split the string into two parts, say, first n tokens from NT81 and the rest from NT90.\n\nSo I can try different splits and see if any of them work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is produced by the concatenation of NT81 and NT90, so I can model this as the string S = NT81's string + NT90's string. So perhaps we can see if the string can be divided into two parts where one part is generated by NT81 and the other by NT90.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, let's see what each NT can produce:\n\nStarting with NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT95 can go to NT25 NT60 or 't0' (multiple options). NT9 \u2192 't10'.\n\nLet me try to see what NT81 can produce.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT95 can go to multiple things:\n- NT55\n- 't0'\n\nLooking at NT55, it goes to 't34' (wait, NT55's productions: NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37 or 't31' or 't15' or 't6'... Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37 | NT25 NT2 | NT31 NT23 | ... Hmm, no, let's check each production.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit complex, but perhaps it's easier to build a tree for the string given.\n\nThe string is: t6 t6 t16 t5 t15 t10 t5 t31 t15 t6 t3 t15 t6 t14.\n\nLet me write this as a list: ['t6', 't6', 't16', 't5', 't15', 't10', 't5', 't31', 't15', 't6', 't3', 't15', 't6', 't14']\n\nI need to find a way to parse this string into a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see what NT81 and NT90 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT90's productions: NT90 \u2192 't14'. So the last token must come from NT90, which is 't14'. So looking at the string, the last token is 't14', so that must come from NT90. So the string up to the 13th token must come from NT81.\n\nWait, so the first 13 tokens are: t6, t6, t16, t5, t15, t10, t5, t31, t15, t6, t3, t15, t6.\n\nWait, no, the string is 14 tokens long. Since S is NT81 followed by NT90, the entire string is the concatenation of the derivations of NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo, the first part is derived from NT81, and the second part from NT90. Since NT90 ends with 't14', the last token is 't14', so the second part is just one token: 't14'. Therefore, the first 13 tokens must come from NT81.\n\nSo, we can check if the first 13 tokens can be derived from NT81.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe NT81 can produce a longer string, but let's try this approach.\n\nSo, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT95 can produce several things, such as NT25, NT60, 't0', etc.\n\nLet's take the first token: 't6'. So perhaps NT95 \u2192 't6'?\n\nLooking at NT95's productions:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 | NT95 NT18 | NT55 NT25 | NT25 NT60 | ...

The starting symbol is `S`, and it's rewritten as `NT81 NT90`. So, any valid string generated by this grammar must start with two elements, `NT81` and `NT90`, according to the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t5 t24`. I need to check if these terms can correspond to `NT81` and `NT90`.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a typo. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n- `NT95 -> NT25 NT60`\n- `NT95 -> NT25 NT60` again? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Looking:\n\nNo, in the provided grammar, under `NT95`, there's `NT95 -> NT25 NT60` and also `NT95 -> NT37 NT18`. Wait, no, that doesn't seem to align. Let me recount.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe production rules include:\n- `NT95 -> NT25 NT60`\n- `NT95 -> NT37 NT18`\n- Also, `NT55 -> NT67 NT37`, etc.\n\nSo, `NT95` can go to `NT25 NT60` or `NT37 NT18`.\n\nNow, for `NT25`, looking through the productions:\n- `NT25 -> NT5` (from `NT25 -> NT5`)\nWait, let me confirm. In the grammar, under `NT25` there's `NT25 -> NT5`, for example.\n\nSimilarly, `NT60` can produce `NT98 NT55` or `NT86 NT28`? Let me check. The `NT60` rules are:\n- `NT60 -> NT98 NT55`\n- Also, `NT60 -> NT86 NT28`? Wait, checking the given grammar, I see under `NT60`:\n  - `NT60 -> NT98 NT55`\n  - `NT60 -> NT86 NT28`\n\nSo, going back, `NT81 -> NT95 NT9`, and `NT9` is a terminal. Looking at the `NT9` rules, under `NT9` we have `t10`, `t18`, `t6`, etc. Specifically, in the grammar, under `NT9`:\n- `NT9 -> t10`\n- `NT9 -> t18`\n- `NT9 -> t6`\n- `NT9 -> t10`\n- `NT9 -> t6`\nSo, `NT9` can produce any of these `t` values.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider `NT90`. The production for `NT90` is `NT74 NT37`. So, `NT90` must lead to two non-terminals, `NT74` and `NT37`.\n\nLooking at `NT74`:\n- `NT74 -> NT31 NT83`\nSo, `NT74` leads to `NT31` and `NT83`.\n\n`NT31`:\n- `NT31 -> NT86 NT28`\nSo, `NT31` leads to two non-terminals again.\n\n`NT86`:\n- `NT86 -> NT25 NT37` or `NT26 NT37` or `NT37 NT32` or `other? Wait, let's see:\nThe `NT86` productions:\n- `NT86 -> NT25 NT37`\n- `NT86 -> NT26 NT37`\n- `NT86 -> NT37 NT32`\n- `NT86 -> NT43 NT88`\nWait, but looking at the grammar, under `NT86`:\n- `NT86 -> NT25 NT37`\n- `NT86 -> NT26 NT37`\n- `NT86 -> NT37 NT32`\n- `NT86 -> NT43 NT88`\nBut actually, looking back, in the provided grammar, under `NT86` we have:\n- `NT86 -> NT25 NT37`\n- `NT86 -> NT26 NT37`\n- `NT86 -> NT37 NT32`\n- `NT86 -> NT43 NT88`\nSo, four possibilities.\n\nNow, let's build the tree for the string `t5 t24 t15 t6 t5 t23 t18 t33 t15 t10 t3 t15 t10 t14`.\n\nSince the string must be the concatenation of the results of the NT symbols, let's see if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nStarting with `S -> NT81 NT90`, which gives us two parts: the first part from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nThe string has `t5 t24 ...`, so perhaps NT81 produces `t5` and NT90 produces the rest.\n\nLooking at NT81:\n\n`NT81 -> NT95 NT9`\nSo, the first part must be NT95 followed by NT9.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT95 can be:\n\n- `NT95 -> NT25 NT60`\n- `NT95 -> NT37 NT18`\n\nSo, for the first part of the string, `t5`, which comes from NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and then from NT95 we get a value that should be consistent with the first token.\n\nBut wait, the first token is `t5`. So, perhaps the first part comes from NT81, which breaks into NT95 NT9. So, the first token t5 would come from NT95. So, let's see.\n\nIf NT95 is `t5`, what leads to `t5`?\n\nLooking at NT95's productions again:\n\n- `NT95 -> NT25 NT60` (so that would produce two tokens, but we have `t5` as a single token. That doesn't fit, so perhaps this path doesn't work.)\n- Alternatively, `NT95 -> NT37 NT18` perhaps leading to another path.\n\nWait, maybe I need to rethink this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT81 produces `t5` and `t24`, but since S is `NT81 NT90`, that would mean that `t5` is from NT81, and `t24` is from NT90. Let's see.\n\nSo, NT81 -> producing `t5` would require that the production of NT81 leads to `t5`. Looking at NT81's productions:\n\n- `NT81 -> NT95 NT9`\nSo, each of these non-terminals will produce some strings. Let's see if NT95 and NT9 can produce `t5` and another token.\n\nWait, but NT81 -> NT95 NT9 would produce two non-terminals, so NT95 would produce a string ending in `t5`, and NT9 would produce another, but in our case, the first token is just `t5`, so perhaps that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe NT81 itself can be a terminal, but in the given grammar, NT81 is a non-terminal and only produces NT95 NT9, so the very first symbol can't be a terminal, so this approach might not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-255","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string \"t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t7 t0 t10 t14\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by production rules, and Chomsky normal form (CNF) is where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC for non-terminals A and terminals B, C, or A \u2192 a where A is a terminal. The given grammar seems to mostly fit CNF, except for the productions that directly go to terminals like NT82 -> 't3' or NT7 -> 't1'. \n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S according to the grammar rules.\n\nThe string has 15 elements, so I'm thinking the parsing process might involve multiple steps, splitting the string into smaller parts each time, checking the productions, and making sure each step is valid.\n\nI start by looking at the first few tokens. The string begins with \"t6 t6\". Looking at the grammar, I see that NT9 -> NT7 NT90, and one of the rules is NT7 -> 't1'. Also, NT26 is defined as NT43 NT88, and NT26 -> 't6'. Wait, actually, NT9 starts with NT7 and NT90, but NT90 is defined as a terminal 't14'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider larger substrings first to see if they match any non-terminal's production. But in this case, the string starts with \"t6\", so I check which non-terminals produce 't6'. Looking at the grammar, NT26 can produce 't6'. So the first token \"t6\" could come from NT26. But since NT26 is a non-terminal, the part 't6' would be the first token, but that would require the previous symbol to be generated by some production before it. Hmm, maybe I should think about sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me write down the entire string as a list for clarity:\n\n[\"t6\", \"t6\", \"t16\", \"t15\", \"t15\", \"t6\", \"t10\", \"t13\", \"t15\", \"t16\", \"t20\", \"t7\", \"t0\", \"t10\", \"t14\"]\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into possible non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S produces two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90.\n\nNext, I need to check if \"t6 t6\" can be represented as NT81 and NT90's productions. Wait, no, that's the first production, but the entire string is longer than that. Alternatively, perhaps each part of the string can be broken down into sequences generated by the non-terminals.\n\nBut maybe starting from the top-level productions and seeing how they can match parts of the string would help.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t6 t6\". Let's see if \"t6\" can be part of a non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT26 can produce \"t6\" (NT26 \u2192 't6'). So perhaps the first \"t6\" comes from NT26. Let's consider that.\n\nBut NT26 is defined as NT43 NT88, according to the grammar: NT26 -> NT43 NT88. So if the first token is \"t6\", which is NT26 \u2192 't6', then the rest of NT26 would require more tokens. Wait, no, that's not how it works. NT26 is a non-terminal, so when you expand it, it's replaced by the right-hand side of its production. So if the first token is \"t6\", which is the result of expanding NT26, then the entire sequence that corresponds to NT26 would just be \"t6\", which doesn't make sense because NT26's production is two symbols (NT43 and NT88). Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated as a series of non-terminals and terminals that expand into each other. Let me see the first few tokens:\n\nFirst token: \"t6\" \u2013 from NT26\nSecond token: \"t6\" \u2013 another NT26?\n\nWait, but how would multiple \"t6\"s come into play. Maybe the string is a result of multiple expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. Let's see the entire string and see if it can be built step by step.\n\nI notice that the string starts with \"t6 t6\". Looking at the grammar, NT26 produces \"t6\" as one of its possible outputs. So perhaps the first two tokens could come from two different NT26s? But then, the production for S is NT81 NT90, so each S generates two parts. So perhaps the entire string is broken down into S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and then each of NT81 and NT90 generates a part.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should try to split the string into chunks that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string starting from the entire sequence and see if it can be broken down according to the productions. Let me attempt a top-down approach.\n\nThe entire string is \"t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t13 t15 t16 t20 t7 t0 t10 t14\".\n\nGiven that S produces NT81 and NT90, perhaps the string can be divided into two parts, each generated by NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, it's quite long. The first two tokens are \"t6 t6\", which makes me think about NT26 producing \"t6\" each time. But since NT81 and NT90 are separate, maybe each has a part that starts with \"t6\".\n\nWait, but perhaps this is not the right approach. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce \"t6\": NT26 can produce \"t6\". Also, NT95 \u2192 't0' is a terminal, so not helpful here. DT10 is 't10', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps better to look for the longest possible match for each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for sequences that match the non-terminals.\n\nWait, another thought: each production rule is length 2 or 1 (terminals). So for a string to be generated, each symbol must correspond to either a terminal production or the second symbol in a two-symbol production.\n\nWait, considering the initial step, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first symbol must be the first part of NT81's expansion, and the next symbol must be the first part of NT90's expansion. But since the entire string is a sequence of terminals, perhaps each non-terminal is expanded in turn.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the string as a list and try expanding each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to check if the string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me try to see if the entire string can be derived by considering the sequences.\n\nLooking for the beginning of the string, \"t6 t6\". Suppose the first \"t6\" comes from NT26, which is defined as NT43 NT88, but wait, NT26 can also directly produce \"t6\". So yes, NT26 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, but then the next part would have to be the remainder after NT26. But since NT26 is a single terminal, the rest would have to come from another non-terminal. Hmm, this seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by multiple NT26s, but that's not how it works because each NT26 would expand into multiple symbols, so perhaps it's more of a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the entire string as a concatenation of sequences generated by NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81, the production is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 expands into two symbols: a non-terminal NT95 and another non-terminal NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT90 is a terminal 't14', according to the grammar: NT90 \u2192 't14'.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar, some rules are 'a \u2192 b', like NT90 \u2192 't14'. So sometimes non-terminals directly go to terminals, sometimes to other non-terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S becomes the concatenation of NT81 and NT90. Now, NT90 is a terminal 't14', so the first part of the string after S is whatever NT81 produces, followed by 't14'.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string, it's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-252","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t10 t0 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t3 t16 t5 t31 t0 t10 t14`. \n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means every production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a single terminal, and the start symbol is also a single non-terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, I notice that most non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals, and some directly produce terminals like 't' and numbers. The terminals in the string are 't10', 't0', etc., which are specific terms that should be matched by the productions.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from the start symbol S, I want to see if it can derive the string by expanding each non-terminal step by step until I reach terminals matching the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the given grammar is: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first step is to produce two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. Each of these will be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. From NT95, I see it can produce multiple things, including terminals. But to get 't10', I need to check if any of the productions for NT95 result in 't10'. Looking through the productions, I see NT95 can produce 't10' via NT95 \u2192 NT13 NT18. Wait, let me check: looking at the productions, NT95 has multiple options, but looking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 't10'. So if NT95 produces 't10' directly, then NT9 can become t10.\n\nWait, no, NT95 is a non-terminal. Let me clarify. The grammar shows NT95 has several productions, including NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and others. But perhaps I should list all productions for each non-terminal to know exactly their options.\n\nLet me list some key non-terminals that lead to terminals:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT16 \u2192 't16' (Wait, looking at the productions, NT20 \u2192 't16'; perhaps there's an NT16? Wait, no, looking back: the productions include NT20 \u2192 't16', but does any other non-terminal directly produce 't16'? Yes, NT20 \u2192 't16', and perhaps others via intermediates.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT20 \u2192 't16', so NT20 is a terminal. But wait, some non-terminals might expand into NT20, which then produces 't16'. Hmm, but let me check the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at NT20: NT20 \u2192 't16'. So NT20 is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't16', so any production of a non-terminal leading to NT20 would then produce 't16'.\n\nBut in our string, we have several 't's with numbers. We need to see if each can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first part is NT81 and the second is NT90.\n\nWe need to expand NT81 and NT90 into sequences that, when combined, form the string.\n\nLet's take NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNow, expanding NT95 and NT9.\n\nNT95 can produce several things: NT55 NT67, NT37 NT18, NT25 NT60, etc. Let's see if any of these can produce 't' terms.\n\nLooking at NT95: there's a production NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and also NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18 (though that's for NT25 in another case). Wait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't5', because on one line, NT25 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar has:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'?\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see multiple lines. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nHere are some key ones:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT43 \u2192 't20' (Wait, looking for 't's, so checking each production):\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in terminals. Let's list:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't20' from one line, but wait, no: in the grammar, line says NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, and NT7 \u2192 't20' on another line. So NT7 can produce 't20'. Similarly, other non-terminals have terminals.\n\nWait, let me list all NT productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT7 \u2192 't20' (line: NT7 \u2192 't20')\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT16 \u2192 't16' (Wait, is there an NT16? Or does any NT produce 't16'? Looking at NT20 \u2192 't16'. So NT20 is a terminal, but if there's a non-terminal that can eventually produce NT20, then it can produce 't16'. But looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce NT20 directly? It seems only NT20 is defined to produce 't16', so only NT20 can directly produce 't16'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37 (so this is further expansion, not terminal)\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28 (also expansion)\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55 (expansion)\nWait, but NT55 has a production that goes to NT67 and NT37, etc. But perhaps some of the deeper productions result in terminals.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let's try a different approach. Let me consider that each non-terminal either leads to a terminal or further expansions.\n\nThe string to derive is: t10 t0 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t3 t16 t5 t31 t0 t10 t14.\n\nBreaking it down: the string has 15 tokens, each representing a terminal, in the order they appear.\n\nI need to see if these 15 terminals can be generated by expanding S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and then each of those non-terminals recursively expanding until all are terminals matching the string.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to model this as the leftmost derivation. Let's try that.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the current string to generate is [NT81, NT90]. We need to see if their expansions, after some steps, will result in the given string.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo expand NT81 first, so now we have [NT95, NT9, NT90].\n\nNext, the first symbol is NT95. Let's expand NT95.\n\nNT95 can produce multiple options, such as NT55 NT67, NT37 NT18, NT25 NT60, etc.\n\nLooking for a production of NT95 that can start the sequence with 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 't10'. So if NT95 can produce something that, when partially expanded, can reach NT9 which then becomes 't10'.\n\nLooking at NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18.\n\nWait, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. But that would produce NT9 (which is 't10') and NT82 (which we can check).\n\nNT82 has a production that includes 't6' (line: NT82 \u2192 't6'), and other productions like NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13 and others. So perhaps NT82 can produce 't6' via one of its productions.\n\nWait, let's see if NT82 can produce 't6' directly. Looking at the productions, yes: NT82 \u2192 't6' is one option (line: NT82 \u2192 't6').

Hmm, that sounds a bit daunting at first, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules for a non-terminal to terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, and each production seems to split the non-terminals into two parts, which is typical for Chomsky normal form. Some of these non-terminals are further broken down until they hit terminals like 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14`. That's a sequence of thirteen 't' terms. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some symbols like NT7, NT9, etc., produce terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT9 \u2192 't10', etc. So each of these non-terminals is a single terminal symbol.\n\nTo parse the string, perhaps I should construct a parse tree starting from S and see if the leaves of the tree match the given string. Let's start with S. From the production:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo the root of the parse tree is S, which has two children: NT81 and NT90.\n\nNow, each of these NT symbols can be broken down further or directly produce a terminal. Let's look at NT81 and NT90.\n\nStarting with NT81:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nWe can see that NT81 breaks down into NT95 and NT9. Now, NT9 is a terminal symbol, 't10' according to the production rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nSo the rightmost symbol in the string starts with 't10', which matches NT9. That's good. Now, NT95 can be further broken down:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nAgain, let's check their productions:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't15'\n\nWait, no. Let's check the rules. Looking at the grammar, NT25 has the production:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, no, let me check. The production rules for NT25 is actually in the list: NT25 \u2192 't20'? Or wait, I might be mixing up the rules. Let me scan the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT25 \u2192 't15' is not present. Wait, no, maybe I'm missing something. Looking at the production rules:\n\nWait, under NT25: looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't5'\n\nIs that correct? Let me check again. Looking at the productions, yes, there's NT25 \u2192 't5' and also other rules like:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT28? Or wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me list some productions for NT25:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThere's NT25 \u2192 't5', and also another rule: NT25 \u2192 NT43 NT28. So it can produce a terminal or be split further.\n\nWait, so when processing NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, each of these can be either terminals or split more.\n\nBut in the string, after 't10' (NT9), we have 't3' next. Let's see, after 't10', 't3', 't16'...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which splits into NT81 and NT90.\n\nFirst, let's process the leftmost symbol NT81:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\nNT9 is 't10' (matches the 5th element in the string). Then, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nNow, evaluating NT25 and NT60.\n\nNT25 can be 't5' or further split. But in the string, after NT95, the next symbol is 't16' (the 6th element). So, after NT81's decomposition into NT95 and NT9, we have 't10' from NT9. Now, we need to process NT95. From the string, after 't10' comes 't16'. Let's see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nSo NT25 and NT60 should produce 't16' and what comes next.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't10' we have 't3', 't16', etc. Wait, maybe I should start constructing the parse tree in order.\n\nThe string is t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14.\n\nWait, that's 15 tokens, but the start is S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which would give us two branches.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Let's consider the string length. Each production in the grammar either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the parse tree adds one non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nIn this case, the string has 15 tokens. Each 't' is a terminal symbol except when it's part of NTs, but no, each NT is a single terminal. So, the grammar's leftmost derivations would produce a string where each production adds two non-terminals until they're broken down into terminals.\n\nWait, the number of symbols in the string should be equal to 2^n - 1 for n productions, but perhaps that's not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, since each Non-terminal production in CNF can produce two non-terminals, the parse tree depth would be 2^k where k is the number of splits, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe string is: t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14.\n\nWait, wait, the string is 15 tokens, but when I look back, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n1 t10\n\n2 t3\n\n3 t16\n\n4 t15\n\n5 t15\n\n6 t10\n\n7 t10\n\n8 t6\n\n9 t16\n\n10 t15\n\n11 t15\n\n12 t6\n\n13 t3\n\n14 t0\n\n15 t10\n\n16 t14\n\nWait, no, the user wrote:\n\n`t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14` \u2014 that's 16 tokens. Hmm, that could complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me count again: each word here is a token.\n\nSo:\n\n1. t10\n\n2. t3\n\n3. t16\n\n4. t15\n\n5. t15\n\n6. t10\n\n7. t10\n\n8. t6\n\n9. t16\n\n10. t15\n\n11. t15\n\n12. t6\n\n13. t3\n\n14. t0\n\n15. t10\n\n16. t14\n\nWait, that's 16 tokens. So the entire string is t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the length and the number of non-terminals in the parse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree bottom-up, starting from the string, would be helpful, but that's more complex.\n\nAnother approach is to check each symbol in the string and see if they can be derived from the start symbol via leftmost derivations.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is t10. Let's see:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nBut NT81 is supposed to be split into NT95 and NT9. So in the parse tree, the left subtree would be NT95, and the right would be NT9."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol as in the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the grammar to see the relationships between the symbols and the terminals. Each production leads to either another symbol or a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the symbols step by step, ensuring that at each step, the production rules are respected.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see a path through the grammar that produces this exact sequence. I'll start by breaking down the string into individual components to see how they might be linked.\n\nLet's list the string parts:\nt10, t6, t6, t16, t15, t15, t6, t5, t24, t15, t0, t16, t35, t7, t10, t14.\n\nI'll try to find the possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals.

Wait, looking back: Yes, under NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and NT9 -> 't10'. So t10 comes from NT9.\n\n- t6: Let's see which non-terminals produce 't6'.

So NT25 can be either 't15' or produce two NT9 symbols, which can each be 't10' or other things.\n\nLet's see the string sequence and try to backtrack.\n\nThe string starts with t10, which is produced by NT9.\n\nSo the first symbol is NT9 -> 't10'.\n\nSo the string is generated as: NT9 \u2192 't10' ... \n\nSo the first step is to replace S \u2192 NT81 NT90. But we're starting from S, so we need to see where the string starts.\n\nWait, no. The entire string is the output of S, so starting from S, we need to see if S can produce this string.\n\nBut S transforms into NT81 NT90. So the first part would be replacing S with NT81 NT90 and producing the start as a sequence of symbols.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't10', which is produced by NT9, so we can look at NT9's production.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT9 can be either 't10' or NT43 NT77.\n\nSo 't10' is produced by NT9 \u2192 't10', so we can match that.\n\nNow, after 't10', the next part is 't6' as in the string. Let's see how to get 't6'.\n\nLooking through NT's that produce 't6': I don't immediately see any. Wait, let's look:\n\n- NT12: 't35' or NT31 NT77\n- NT67: 't15' or NT69 NT37\n- NT88: 't7' or NT51 NT88\n- NT35: 't18' or NT12 NT77\n- NT77: ... let's see, in the grammar, NT77 appears in:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT77 being a terminal, but perhaps NT77 has a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking back, let's see:\n\n- NT37: NT9 NT82\n- NT98: NT7 NT39\n- NT79: Not present, but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t10 t0 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t15 t10 t14`. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all the rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. CNF is helpful because it allows for efficient parsing, like with the CYK algorithm. But since I'm trying to figure this out manually, I'll look for possible paths that can generate the string.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which expands to NT81 NT90. So S can only produce two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Each of these non-terminals must expand completely to terminals, and since the string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, I need to check if the string can be built by expanding S correctly.\n\nLet me first see what NT81 and NT90 expand to. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT90 -> NT26 NT37\n\nSo NT81 expands to NT95 and NT9, and NT90 expands to NT26 and NT37.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT95 and NT26, NT37 expand to.\n\nStarting with NT95:\n- NT95 -> NT37 NT18\n- Also, NT95 has a rule that directly goes to 't13' and another to 't0'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT95 -> NT55 NT37, and also NT95 -> 't13' and NT95 -> 't0'. So NT95 can expand in four ways: two to non-terminals, and two to terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 expands to NT12 NT77, and also to 't18' and another rule I'm not seeing, but wait, NT37: Wait, checking the rules, I don't see NT37 having more terminals except for NT12 NT77. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT37 is defined as:\n- NT37 -> NT12 NT77\n- Also, NT37 might expand to 't18' based on another rule.

Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT37 -> NT12 NT77\n- Also, checking the provided rules, I see NT18 -> NT20 NT26, but does NT37 have any terminal expansions?

Let me see:\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n- NT35 -> NT18 NT33\n- NT35 -> NT95 NT18\n\nWait, so NT35 can expand to two non-terminals, but there's a rule I might have missed.

{"custom_id":"request-296","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a task to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t6 t6 t10 t3 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t1 t7 t15 t16 t20 t7 t6 t14`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and how it generates strings. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol S can produce more non-terminals. Terminals are the strings of single symbols, like the 't's and numbers here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a series of productions where non-terminals break down into other non-terminals or sometimes terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, meaning S is broken into NT81 and NT90. Each of these is further broken down until you reach terminals.\n\nThe string to check consists of 17 tokens. Let's see what each token is:\n\n- t6\n- t6\n- t10\n- t3\n- t16\n- t35\n- t7\n- t0\n- t16\n- t1\n- t7\n- t15\n- t16\n- t20\n- t7\n- t6\n- t14\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, S expands to NT81 and NT90. So the string must start with these two non-terminals. Let's see what each of them expands into.\n\nLooking at NT81: It appears in the productions as NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 is two non-terminals: NT95 and NT9.\n\nSimilarly, NT90 is in the production NT90 \u2192 NT24. Wait, wait no, looking back. The user input provided the grammar lines, so I have to check each line carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar provided has lines like:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nAnd so on. Wait, in the initial user message, some NT95 productions are listed twice, which might be a mistake. Let me scan the productions.\n\nI notice that NT95 appears in multiple productions, such as NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37. Also, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 is listed again. This repetition might be typographical, perhaps a mistake. I'll have to consider that.\n\nBut regardless, each non-terminal must be expanded until we reach the terminals. So, for each token in the string, it should correspond to a terminal derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t6. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production that results in t6. Scanning through the productions, I see:\n\nLooking for 't6': \n\nYes, 't6' appears in several productions listed:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 't6'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT74 \u2192 't14'\n- NT16 is 't16' but wait, no, the grammar is for non-terminals, and 't' tokens are terminals. So perhaps some non-terminals expand to these t tokens.\n\nWait, the grammar does have some non-terminals mapping directly to 't's. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT82 \u2192 't3', and others. So some non-terminals produce a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, I think each terminal is a single 't' followed by a number, like 't3', 't16', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce these.\n\nFor example, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT55 \u2192 't34' (but wait, perhaps different)\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple lines, some perhaps incorrectly duplicated. Let me look again at the grammar provided:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT18 NT7\nWait, but no, actually, looking back:\n\nHere's a corrected list of the grammar productions for better understanding:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3' (Wait, does NT82 have multiple productions? Or is this a mistake?)\n\nLooking further, looking for NT82's productions:\n\n- NT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\n- NT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nWait, the provided grammar has:\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nWait, in the user's message, under the grammar, some lines have 't' as a terminal followed by a number, e.g., NT82 -> 't3', which is a production to a terminal 't3'.\n\nI think the key is to work backward by trying to find paths that result in the given string.\n\nThe string starts with t6, so one of the terminal steps is to have a non-terminal that produces t6. Let's look for any non-terminal that can directly produce t6.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT86 -> 't6' (since NT86's production includes 't6' as one of its terminal productions)\n\nYes, so NT86 can produce t6. So at the end of a derivation, if we have NT86, it can output 't6'.\n\nSo the string starts with t6, which could be the result of NT86 expanding to 't6'. \n\nSo let's consider that the first part of the string, t6, comes from NT86. Since this is part of S's expansion (S \u2192 NT81 NT90), perhaps the first NT81 produces something, and the NT90 produces something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a direct child.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a parse tree step by step to see where the string can come from.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt6, t6, t10, t3, t16, t35, t7, t0, t16, t1, t7, t15, t16, t20, t7, t6, t14.\n\nFirst, let's see how many tokens there are: 17.\n\nThe number of tokens can give an indication of the depth of the derivation. Each non-terminal production breaks down into two non-terminals, leading to an exponential growth in the number of nodes, but each terminal production consumes one token.\n\nGiven that, it's better to work backwards, starting from the end of the string, and see if we can factor it into the grammar's productions.\n\nUsing the reverse approach (top-down"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-317","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is `t10 t5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t16 t35 t7 t10 t14`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, especially using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not using that, I'll try a different approach.\n\nThe given grammar has a set of non-terminals (NT) and terminals (like 't1', 't2', etc.) with production rules. My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the production rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first step is to split the input string into two parts: the sequence produced by NT81 and NT90. If the string can be divided into two parts that each can be derived from NT81 and NT90 respectively, then it's possible.\n\nLooking at the string, the first thing I notice is that the string starts with 't10', which is a terminal. I need to check which non-terminal can produce a string starting with 't10'. Checking the production rules, NT9 has 't10' as a terminal, so one option is that NT81 could produce a string starting with 't10'. Similarly, let's see if the second part of the string (after 't10') can be produced by NT90.\n\nWait, the actual division might not be 't10 t5 ...' because each production is split into two parts. So first, for S \u2192 NT81 NT90, the string must be split into two parts where the first part is derived from NT81 and the second from NT90.\n\nLet me parse the string: It's `t10 t5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t16 t35 t7 t10 t14`. That's 19 tokens.\n\nSince S produces two non-terminals, the string must be split into two parts. Let's consider possible splits. The split can be anywhere between the tokens. The first part must correspond to NT81 and the second to NT90.\n\nWait, but how do I know where the split is? Maybe I should look for the production of NT81 and NT90. Let's check the production rules for NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the NT81 rule: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 first becomes NT95 followed by NT9. NT9 is 't10', so the end of NT81's production is at least 't10', but maybe more.\n\nWait, no: NT81 is a non-terminal that can be expanded into other non-terminals. So each step, the non-terminals produce sequences until terminals are reached.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be matched step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the string must be split into two parts: NT81 yields the first part, NT90 yields the second part.\n\nLet's find out what NT81 and NT90 can produce.\n\nFirst, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 is 't10'.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and also other options. Wait, looking back, NT95 has multiple productions: it can go to NT25 NT60, NT67 NT37, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60; NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37; NT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55; NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35; etc. Wait, but the given grammar is in CNF, so every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see that some NT have multiple production rules. For example, NT7 can go to NT48 NT35, which are both non-terminals. So, each of these is a step in the production.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe using the CYK algorithm would be better, but since I can't implement it here, I'll try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the method of checking if each split point is possible.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the parse from the end. Or perhaps, model the possible derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the entire string and see if it can be generated by the grammar. Since all rules are in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals.\n\nThe string must be a series of terminals, each matching the end of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the possible splits.\n\nEach production rule starts with a non-terminal that can be split into two parts. So, for the entire string, the entire string can be represented as a binary tree where the root is S, and each node can split into two parts according to the production rules.\n\nWait, but with 19 tokens, that would require multiple splits. It's going to be time-consuming, but let me try to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach it step by step, treating each terminal and seeing how it can be generated.\n\nStart with the start symbol S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the string should be divided into two parts: the first part generated by NT81 and the second by NT90.\n\nLet me look at the string: The whole string is 't10 t5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t16 t35 t7 t10 t14'\n\nIf I split after the first token, NT81 has to produce 't10 ...' and NT90 produces the rest.\n\nLooking at NT81's production:\n\nNT81 can produce NT95 followed by NT9. NT9 is 't10', which matches the first token. So the first token is definitely part of NT81, which is NT9.\n\nSo the remaining part is 't5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t16 t35 t7 t10 t14'\n\nNow, NT81 also has other productions, like NT7\u2192NT48 NT35, but this would likely start with other terminals. Since our next token after 't10' is 't5', let's see if that can be generated by NT95 or another NT.\n\nWait, but NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, which would produce terms like 't5 t6' as in t5 is NT60's production and t6 is NT... Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nMaybe I should map out the productions and see which NT can produce which terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to list all the non-terminals and their possible terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So the first token should be 't10' because NT9 is 't10'. So that's correct.\n\n- The first part after S is 't10 ...', which matches NT9.\n\nThen, the second part is the rest of the string after 't10', which is 't5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t16 t35 t7 t10 t14'\n\nNow, this entire string should be generated by NT90.\n\nSo let's check NT90's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT90's productions are:\n\n- Not listed, but wait. Wait, looking through the provided grammar, do any NT have production to NT90? Or perhaps in the given grammar, NT90 is on the RHS somewhere.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the grammar is provided, but I need to parse it correctly. Let me look again:\n\nThe grammar has production rules like S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo NT90 must be a non-terminal that can be split into two parts. Let's look for NT90's productions in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, after NT90, I don't see it. Maybe it's generated by another rule.\n\nWait, hold on. The grammar is provided as a set of production rules in CNF. So for each NT, their productions are listed.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\n- NT81: NT95 NT9 | (other productions if any?

{"custom_id":"request-314","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t10 t10 t6 t0 t15 t16 t20 t7 t15 t16 t1 t7 t15 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. CNF means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I can see that most of the rules are non-terminals splitting into two other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the rules, many non-terminals directly map to 't' terms. For example, NT7 \u2192 t1, NT9 \u2192 t10, and so on. So, each production either leads to a terminal or continues breaking down into more non-terminals. \n\nThe target string has several 't' terms. Let's list them: t10, t10, t6, t0, t15, t16, t20, t7, t15, t16, t1, t7, t15, t16, t35, t7, t6, t14.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I should work backward from the string by trying to find the corresponding grammar rules that could produce it.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar splits into two symbols. So, starting from the beginning of the string, the first part should correspond to the start symbol S, which is NT81 NT90. \n\nBut the string starts with t10, which is the result of NT9. So, let's see NT9's production: NT9 is only split into 't10', so it's a terminal. Wait, but NT9's production is given as NT9 \u2192 't10'. But in the grammar provided, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice that NT12 \u2192 't30', NT13 \u2192 't15', etc. Wait, actually, looking at the rules listed, it's easier to make a quick reference.\n\nI think it's better to create a list of each non-terminal and what it produces.

Or maybe one is incorrect? Let me check.]\n\nLooking closer, NT95 has two rules: one \u2192 NT25 NT60, and another \u2192 't13', and another \u2192 't0'? Wait, no, actually, looking at the original input, I see NT95 appears three times. Let me check the original grammar:\n\nThe original grammar has:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo, there are three production rules for NT95? That can't be right because in CNF each non-terminal should have only one production. Maybe I've misread it. Oh, wait, in the initial problem statement, the grammar is presented with multiple NT95 productions.\n\nWait, the problem statement has:\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nAnd then:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nThat can't be correct because a non-terminal can't have multiple production rules in CNF. So perhaps I misread. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal grammar provided:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nWait, that would imply NT95 has three productions, which isn't possible in CNF. That's a problem. Maybe the grammar as provided is incorrect, or perhaps it's a formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps some lines are indented wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be that NT95 has multiple productions, but I thought each non-terminal is split into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the original grammar:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nSo, looking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, that's 3 rules for NT95: two productions to non-terminals and two to terminals. That can't be right. In Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal should produce exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps the user input has a mistake, but for the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that maybe the three rules for NT95 are a typo, perhaps only two are intended, and maybe one is a duplicate or incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended NT95 to have two non-terminal productions and another production to a terminal, making it a chain, but I'll proceed assuming that perhaps the rule NT95 \u2192 't0' is correct.\n\nBut this might complicate things because NT95 can be a terminal or a non-terminal. However, since the start symbol is S, which produces NT81 and NT90, and we can see that NT81 and NT90 must be expanded into terminals.\n\nBut let's get back to the problem. The string starts with multiple terminals, so probably starting from the start symbol S, which expands to NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, the first part of the string is t10 t10 t6 t0 ... So, perhaps NT81 produces t10, but looking at the grammar rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo, NT81 expands into two symbols, which themselves must expand until we get terminals.\n\nLooking at NT95 and NT9.\n\nNT95, as per the rules, could expand into 't13' or 't0', or into NT25 NT60.\n\nAssuming NT95 \u2192 't13', which would give t13, but in the string, we have t10.\n\nWait, but let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 (if that's one of them)\n\nAlso, NT95"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't' followed by a number.

I'll probably need to work backwards, starting from S and seeing if I can derive each part of the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production rule is S -> NT81 NT90.

That's the second token in our string, which is correct. So far, so good.\n\nNow, looking at NT95. From the grammar, NT95 can produce:\n\n- Option 1: NT25 NT60\n- Option 2: NT55\n- Option 3: NT25 NT60 (same as first option)\n- Option 4: NT95 could be derived further? Wait, NT95 only has these production rules, and applying them as needed.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT95 has two production rules:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nand\n\nNT95 -> NT55\n\nSo, for NT95, it can be either split into NT25 and NT60 or replaced by NT55. Let's see which path makes sense here.\n\nLooking at the first token in our string: it's 't6'. So the first token is 't6', which comes from NT81. Let's look at NT81's production: NT81 -> NT95 NT9. We've deduced that NT9 is 't10', which matches the second token. Then, the first token is 't6', which comes from NT81. Let me see how NT95 is derived.\n\nGiven that the first production starts with 't6', which is 't6', that comes from NT81. Let's look at NT81's production: it's NT95 and NT9. We saw that NT9 is 't10', so the first part is 't6' as the first token, which comes from NT95.\n\nSo, NT95 must produce a terminal sequence that starts with 't6'. Let's check NT95's options.\n\nNT95 can be:\n\n1. NT25 NT60\n2. NT55\n\nSo, both options are either two non-terminals or a single non-terminal.

For example, NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82, etc., and some directly go to 't' followed by a number, like NT39 \u2192 't39'.\n\nMy plan is to work backward from the string, trying to find a path through the grammar that can generate each token in order. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step (except for the terminals) should be a production of two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can eventually expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLet's break down the string token by token and see how each could be derived from the grammar.\n\n1. Starting token: t10\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't9', but I don't see a NT90 production. Wait, there's NT90 \u2192 NT51 NT88, and looking further down, NT10 might be somewhere else. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT90 \u2192 't10' right there! Yes, NT90 \u2192 't10'. So t10 can be directly produced by NT90.\n\n2. Next token: t6\nLooking for NT6 somewhere. Checking the grammar, I spot NT12 \u2192 't12', but that's not it. Wait, NT67 \u2192 't15', NT51 \u2192 't51', which is expanded as NT51 \u2192 NT69 NT22, but I'm trying for t6. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I misread. Let's check all NT rules ending with 't6'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT67 \u2192 't15', NT88 \u2192 't7', NT50 \u2192 't50' (if exists) but I don't see that. Wait, the grammar doesn't have an NT6, but I see NT67 \u2192 't15' and NT51 \u2192 't24'? No. Wait, no NT6 production directly. Or maybe via another path.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. There's a production NT90 \u2192 't10', which is correct for t10. Next, t6. Oh, I see NT69 \u2192 't34' and NT28 \u2192 't34', and NT86 \u2192 't32', but t6 isn't directly there. Wait, looking back, maybe NT98 \u2192 't31' and other NT... Hmm, perhaps I need to look for N terminals that expand into 't6'. Looking through all the N terminals, I see there's NT67 \u2192 't15', NT28 \u2192 't34', NT51 \u2192 't24', NT50 \u2192 't50' isn't there, and others. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan each NT rule to see which ones produce 't6'.\n\nLooking through each rule, the only 't's present are:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT18 \u2192 't20'\n- NT26 \u2192 't5'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT43 \u2192 't20'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT55 \u2192 't67' \u2192 no, wait, NT55 is 'NT67' \u2192 but wait, in the grammar, NT55's production is 'NT67 NT37', but that's not terminal. Wait, no: looking back, for NT55, I see 'NT67 NT37', not a terminal. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, the last few rules are:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't35'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'  <<--- Wait, no, NT55 -> 't31'? Let me check: the line is \"NT55 -> NT67 NT37\". Oh, that's a non-terminal, I misread earlier. So no NT55 directly. So where does 't6' come from?\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps NT25 \u2192 't5'. Let me check. Yes, in the grammar, NT25 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo, t6 might need another look. Hmm. Maybe I was too quick to dismiss it. Let me list all non-terminals that directly produce 't-something':\n\n- NT39 -> 't39'\n- NT74 -> 't34'\n- NT37 -> 't35'\n- NT18 -> 't20'\n- NT26 -> 't5'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13', 't0', etc.\n- NT98 -> 't31', 't30', 't24'\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n- NT82 -> 't6', 't3'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT51 -> 't24'\n- NT28 -> 't34'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT95 -> 't13', 't14' (Wait, in the grammar, there's \"NT95 -> 't13'\", but then later \"NT95 -> 't14'\". No, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar lines:\n\n- \"NT95 -> 't13'\"\n- \"NT95 -> 't14'\"\n\nWait, that can't be correct unless it's a mistake. Probably, it's either 't13' or 't14', but not both. Given that, I'll proceed assuming it's one or the other, but given the string, perhaps 't14' isn't present yet.\n\nLooking back, the second token in the string is t6. None of the direct production rules end with 't6' except maybe I'm missing one. Wait, perhaps NT25 \u2192 't5' is correct. Maybe I missed another non-terminal that directly produces 't6'. Let me go through each rule:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't9'\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\nNT86 \u2192 't32'\nNT3 \u2192 't3' (from NT31 \u2192 't35', but that's 't35')\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nThe rules that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT74 -> 't34'\n- NT37 -> 't35'\n- NT18 -> 't20'\n- NT26 -> 't5'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13' (or 't14', unclear)\n- NT55 -> 't31' (wait, no, original line is \"NT55 -> NT67 NT37\", so that's not a terminal)\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking down the list, I might have missed some.

{"custom_id":"request-351","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided grammar to understand the structure. The grammar has several non-terminals (like S, NT7, NT81, etc.) and terminals (like 't3', 't16', etc.). Each production seems to split a non-terminal into two other non-terminals until it eventually breaks down into terminals, which are the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t6 t6 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t0 t0 t16 t1 t7 t15 t15 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14`. That's a long string of 19 tokens. I need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the structure of the grammar. The top-level production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the start symbol S starts with NT81 and NT90. Both of these are non-terminals, so I'll need to break them down further.\n\nLooking at NT81, the production is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 is a terminal 't9' but wait, looking back at the grammar, NT9 isn't one of the terminals listed. Wait, the grammar shows NT9 \u2192 't10'. So NT9 is a non-terminal that produces 't10'. Okay, that makes sense. Similarly, NT81 breaks down into NT95 and NT9. Then NT95 breaks down into more non-terminals until finally it produces terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT90 breaks down into NT25 and NT88. Let me check their productions. NT25 can go to NT5 (I think, maybe NT25 \u2192 NT51 is a rule? Wait, the grammar shows various productions for NT25. Let me list them out.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT25 -> NT51 NT37\n\nNT51 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT67 -> NT5\n\nAnd so on, until it eventually goes down to terminal 't15' in some cases. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes NT25 seems to produce same things as other non-terminals, like NT25 \u2192 NT55, but then there's NT25 \u2192 NT51 NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out all the production rules step by step to see what each NT25 leads to. Let me make a list:\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT51 NT37\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT6\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT24\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, it's NT67 -> NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the full list:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT98 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT67 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT55 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, I think I missed some entries. For example, NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37. Then NT67 \u2192 NT5. Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought NT67 is a terminal, but according to the grammar, NT67 \u2192 NT5, and NT5 might be a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe the grammar has some non-terminals that finally resolve to terminals. For example, in the initial list, there are entries like NT7 \u2192 't1', which means NT7 produces terminal 't1'. Similarly, NT82 produces 't3', and NT20 \u2192 't16', etc.\n\nSo, each production either leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. The goal is to break down the string into the sequence of non-terminals that produce the terminals, matching the given string.\n\nThe string is 19 tokens, so I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar in 19 steps, breaking down the non-terminals into the correct terminals.\n\nLet's start from the start symbol S, which produces NT81 and NT90. So the string must be a concatenation of the results of NT81 and NT90. So the string should start with whatever NT81 produces and then whatever NT90 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't6 t6 t3...'. So the first part should be 't6', and the second part maybe 't6' again, or perhaps not. Let's see how NT81 and NT90 can produce their respective parts.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT81's breakdown and NT90's breakdown. So first, the string starts with the outcome of NT81, then the outcome of NT90.\n\nSo, let me see how NT81 can produce something starting with 't6'. Looking at the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 leads to 't10', right? Because NT9 \u2192 't10'. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT9 is a non-terminal, and the rule for NT9 is not listed here. Wait, in the initial grammar, it says NT9 \u2192 't10', right? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the grammar has NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT88, and other rules. But more importantly, the first entry for NT9 is: NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, but then in the grammar at the bottom, there's NT95 \u2192 't0', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up NT9 and another rule.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nWait, no, looking through the grammar, not all non-terminals are terminals. For example, there's a line:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nThen, further down, there's NT67 -> 't15'\n\nSo NT67 produces a terminal. But for NT9, the rule is not explicitly there, unless it's among the provided productions. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see a production for NT9 directly, but I do see NT95 \u2192 't0', which is a terminal. But the NT95's production comes from NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, and then NT7 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps this is confusing. Maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their production rules.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\n2. NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n\n3. NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT88\n\n4.

That's a lot of tokens, but the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing easier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the single-term rules where a terminal is directly defined. So, for each symbol on the left, production is either two symbols on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which is defined as NT81 NT90. So the start would be two symbols, NT81 and NT90. Each of those has further productions, so I can expand them step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it's all terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived by expanding S using the grammar rules down to the symbols in the string.\n\nLet me start by noting that the string has 20 tokens.

Wait, no, when looking at the rules, some follow as A \u2192 term, others as A \u2192 B C.\n\nI think I need to list all the rules and see which are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as:\n\nS->NT81 NT90\n\nNT98->NT7 NT39\n\nNT37->NT9 NT82\n\nNT26->NT43 NT88\n\nNT48->NT69 NT74\n\nNT18->NT20 NT26\n\nNT74->NT31 NT83\n\nNT35->NT12 NT77\n\nNT86->NT51 NT88\n\nNT95->NT37 NT18\n\nNT81->NT95 NT9\n\nNT86->NT25 NT37\n\nNT31->NT86 NT28\n\nNT60->NT98 NT55\n\nNT82->NT95 NT13\n\nNT95->NT25 NT60\n\nNT55->NT67 NT37\n\nNT26->NT25 NT55\n\nNT7->NT48 NT35\n\nNT82->'t3'\n\nNT20->'t16'\n\nNT98->'t31'\n\nNT67->'t15'\n\nNT12->'t30'\n\nNT31->'t35'\n\nNT7->'t1'\n\nNT77->'t34'\n\nNT35->'t18'\n\nNT95->'t13'\n\nNT55->'t31'\n\nNT95->'t0'\n\nNT43->'t35'\n\nNT25->'t15'\n\nNT86->'t32'\n\nNT39->'t33'\n\nNT88->'t7'\n\nNT9->'t10'\n\nNT82->'t6'\n\nNT43->'t20'\n\nNT13->'t15'\n\nNT60->'t24'\n\nNT12->'t35'\n\nNT69->'t34'\n\nNT51->'t32'\n\nNT48->'t23'\n\nNT25->'t5'\n\nNT9->'t6'\n\nNT43->'t1'\n\nNT13->'t0'\n\nNT28->'t34'\n\nNT60->'t5'\n\nNT48->'t29'\n\nNT51->'t22'\n\nNT83->'t23'\n\nNT90->'t14'\n\nWait, so NT90 is a terminal because it's mapped to 't90'? Or wait, in the grammar, the right-hand side can be a single terminal or two symbols. So, the rule NT9\u2192't10' means that NT9 can produce the terminal t10. Similarly, the rule S\u2192NT81 NT90 suggests that S can produce NT81 followed by NT90. But from the rules above, NT90 is not directly defined as a terminal, but in the full list, I see that NT90 is a terminal because the last rule says \"NT90 -> 't14'\". Wait, no, the initial S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and then NT90 is in the rules as follows:\n\nLooking back, the last two lines are:\n\nNT90 -> 't14'\n\nNT90 is defined as producing t14. So S \u2192 NT81 NT90 would expand to NT81 followed by NT90, which would be t10 (since NT81\u2192t95 t9, and NT9\u2192t10, but wait no. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I need to step through an example. Let me take the string and see if each terminal can be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t10 t10 t13 t0 t16 t5 t31 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t35 t7 t0 t10 t14\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 20 tokens.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the first expansion is two symbols: NT81 and NT90.\n\nFrom the rules, NT81 can be expanded. Looking at the rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 is a non-terminal that can be expanded. Looking at the rules, NT9 \u2192 't10' (from NT9 \u2192 't10'). So that's a terminal.\n\nSo, when we expand S, the first step yields NT81 \u2192 t10 followed by NT9. But wait, no. Wait, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and then both NT95 and NT9 can be further expanded.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should model this as a tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the given grammar and see if it can be derived.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. The string starts with t10, which is NT81. So, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Therefore, the first part of the string is derived from NT81, and the second part from NT90.\n\nBut wait, in the rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT90 is a terminal 't90'? Or is NT90 a non-terminal?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the last rule is NT90->'t14'. So yes, NT90 is a terminal, 't14'. Wait, no, in the rules, the 19th rule says NT98 \u2192 't31'. So, in general, the NTs that end with ->'t' are terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, each occurrence of t followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-369","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding what each part represents.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string correctly. The string is `t6 t10 t3 t16 t5 t15 t10 t5 t24 t15 t6 t3 t15 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t6 t10 t14`. It seems like it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each 't' represents a terminal symbol with a number following it, like t6, t10, etc. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because the parsing can be done using a method like CYK, but since I'm not implementing that, I'll try to see if I can trace a possible derivation.\n\nEach production starts with S and eventually breaks down into non-terminals and terminals. The end goal is to reach the string provided.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the string to see how they can be generated. The terminals are t6, t10, t3, t16, t5, t15, etc. Each of these must be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can decompose it into the string step by step, making sure each token is matched.\n\nLooking at the first production of the grammar: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S is replaced by NT81 and NT90. Now, I'll need to see how NT81 and NT90 can be decomposed.\n\nNT81: I see in the rules that NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT81 becomes NT95 and NT9. Then, NT9 is a terminal 't10'. So 't10' is one of the tokens, which matches the third token in the string (third token is t10). Wait, but looking back, the string is t6, t10, t3, t16, ... So the first token is t6, so maybe this is correct.\n\nWait, let me make a table or something. Maybe I should list all the possible non-terminals and see their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to map each 't' token to the non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each terminal is on the right side of a production, either as part of a non-terminal that itself can derive it, or directly.\n\nFor example, t6 is in NT43 \u2192 't35' and also in NT25 \u2192 't15', but wait, let me check all the terminals.\n\nWait, I think I should start from the given string and see if each token can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar. Because, in a top-down approach, each non-terminal must expand to a sequence that matches the string.\n\nBut maybe a bottom-up approach would be better here: start from the terminals and see if they can be grouped into non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string must be built by starting from the start symbol and repeatedly applying rules.\n\nPerhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of symbols that must be a result of expanding S.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, I can check each token in the string to see if it's allowed in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the terminals, each is in the form 'tX' where X ranges from 0 to 39, as seen in the grammar. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT25 \u2192 't15', etc.\n\nNow, let's list the tokens in the string and see if each can be derived by some non-terminal:\n\n1. t6: Looking at the grammar, NT95 \u2192 t6? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT95 is defined as NT25 \u2192 t15, which doesn't produce t6. Wait, let me check the NT95 rule.\n\nWait, the grammar is structured, let me list all the non-terminals and their productions that result in a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT18 \u2192 't20'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't20'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't6' (wait, that's another one)\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't29'\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n- NT83 \u2192 't23'\n- NT90 \u2192 't14'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, I think I might be getting some of these mixed up. Let me go through each terminal and see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\nt6: Looking at the grammar, any non-terminal that can produce t6 is:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (from NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13 in the grammar)\n\nWait, no, wait: looking through the rules, NT82 is either 't6' or can split into more non-terminals. Let's check the actual rules.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT82:\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n\nWait, does that mean NT82 can produce 't6' directly? Or is that rule part of a larger production?\n\nWait, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT82, it's defined as:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6' (which is a terminal production) or NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13 (which is two non-terminals).\n\nSimilarly, NT39 \u2192 't33' and NT95 can derive t10, etc.\n\nSo, if the string contains t6, that could come directly from NT82 \u2192 't6' or from a larger rule. But the string has t6 as the first token. So, S starts as NT81 NT90. Let's think about how to get t6 from S.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So the first part becomes NT95 and NT9. NT9 is a terminal 't10'.\n\nSo the beginning of the string is t10. But the string starts with t6, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, but that suggests that the first symbol in the string is t6, but the expansion of NT81 only produces t10 first.\n\nWait, that means the string starts with t6, which is the first token. But according to our grammar, the first production of S is NT81 and NT90. So the first symbol of any string derived from S must come from NT81 or NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, which leads to t10, not t6. So that would suggest that the first symbol t6 cannot be derived by NT81.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT81's productions again. NT81 is defined as NT95 NT9, and NT9 is 't10'. So NT81 can't produce t6 directly.\n\nSo if the string starts with t6, and our start symbol S branches into NT81 and NT90, then t6 can only come from NT90, perhaps.\n\nLooking at NT90, perhaps it can produce t6. Let me check the productions of NT90. I need to look back at the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT90: I see NT90 \u2192 't14' and NT90 \u2192 NT67 NT28. So, NT90 can produce 't14' directly, or as two non-terminals.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT81 NT90, then NT90 can produce t14 as the first token, but the string starts with t6.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the string isn't generated by the grammar, because the first symbol can't be t6.\n\nWait, unless I missed something.

Each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for those that end when a terminal is reached.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to try to derive the string step by step using the given productions. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual terminals to see how they can be generated. The string has 21 elements, so the derivation path should also account for all these steps.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S:\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nSo, the derivation starts with NT81 deriving t6 and NT90 deriving t14. But wait, looking at the productions, NT81 -> NT95 NT9 and NT90 -> NT51 NT88. Let me check if these can lead to t6 and t14.\n\nLooking at NT9: it's a terminal, which is 't9', so NT90 is NT51 NT88.\n\nLooking at NT88: from the grammar, it's NT95 NT13, which are both non-terminals. Then, NT51 is a non-terminal; let's see its production: NT51 -> NT67 NT37. Both are non-terminals again. NT67 is a terminal 't15', which is not matching, as NT67 is 't15'? Wait, the grammar says NT67 -> 't15', yes. So NT51 would derive t15 and something else.\n\nWait, but let's go back. The string's first element is t6. Let me see what produces t6. Looking at the productions, there's NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and NT95 has a production NT95 -> NT25 NT60. Then, NT25 -> NT9 -> 't6', right? Because NT9 is 't9' no, wait, NT9 is a terminal 't9'?\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar. The productions include NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and NT25 -> NT15 NT9. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT25 -> NT15 NT9\n\nAnd NT15 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal that expands. Let me check: NT15 -> NT48 NT74? No, NT15 is in the grammar as: oh wait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT77 -> NT35 NT34\n\nNT35 -> NT18 NT77\n\nBut I'm looking for NT15. Let's see: Is NT15 a non-terminal? Yes. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT15 being a terminal, so it's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the terminals and non-terminals.\n\nThe terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, except those with 't' which are terminals.\n\nSo looking at NT15: is there a production for NT15? Checking the grammar, I don't see it. So NT15 must derive to something else. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but in any case, I'm trying to see how the string can be generated.\n\nLet me think about the string and see which parts can be formed by the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt6 t6 t5 t31 t15 t6 t6 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t5 t24 t15 t0 t16 t1 t7 t6 t14\n\nFirst, t6: looking for non-terminals that produce t6. From the grammar, I see NT81 has productions: looking for which NT derive to t6. Wait, looking through the productions:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9. So if NT95 can derive t6, then NT81 could contribute t6.\n\nLooking at NT95's productions: NT95 -> NT25 NT60. So to get t6 from NT81, NT95 would need to produce t6, but NT95 is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals, so it must expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let's try to see which terminals appear in the string and whether they can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string's elements: t6, t5, t31, t15, t0, t16, t15, t15, t10, t5, t24, t15, t0, t16, t1, t7, t6, t14.\n\nI need to see for each terminal in the string if it's present in the grammar as a terminal, and then track backward to see if they can be connected via the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are as follows:\n\nt1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t15, t16, t20, t24, t25, t26, t30, t31, t33, t34, t35, t37, t38, t39, t43, t48, t51, t55, t60, t67, etc. Wait, let me list all the terminals from the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT95 -> 't0' (but that's another production)\n- NT43 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't15'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't20' (another production)\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n- NT12 -> 't30'\n- NT69 -> 't34'\n- NT51 -> 't32'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't6' (Wait, no, in the grammar, NT9 is 't9' as per NT9 -> 't9'?

{"custom_id":"request-392","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific way of structuring the rules where each production is left-hand side (LHS) as a single non-terminal and the right-hand side (RHS) as either two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production should have exactly two symbols on the RHS, either two terminals, a terminal and a non-terminal, or two non-terminals. Oh right, that's what CNF requires: each production has exactly two symbols on the RHS, except for the start symbol which can have one. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems to be in CNF because each rule's RHS has two symbols. For example, S -> NT81 NT90, both NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals, so that's two symbols. Some rules have a mix, like NT82 -> 't3', which is a terminal and a terminal? Wait, no, actually, 't3' and 't6' are terminals, right? So maybe some rules result in terminals, indicating leaves in the parse tree. So, the grammar is set up so that each rule either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals that need to be further expanded.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t6 t13 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t1 t6 t6 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t10 t14. Wait, wait, the string provided in the question is written as a sequence of 't...' tokens separated by spaces, right? So the string is a sequence of these tokens: t6, t13, t0, etc.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding the non-terminals through the given production rules until we get the string of terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT81 NT90. So the string must start with whatever NT81 can derive and then whatever NT90 can derive. Similarly, each NT can expand further until we get terminals.\n\nLet me try to map out the possible steps. Maybe I should start from the string and see if it can be broken down into parts that match the expansion rules. Alternatively, build a parse tree from the string up to the start symbol.\n\nThe string is: t6 t13 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t1 t6 t6 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t10 t14.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens: 20 tokens. Hmm, that's even? Wait, no, 20 is even, but each production either produces two symbols or something else. Since the grammar is in CNF, each rule splits into two, but the start symbol's first expansion is into two non-terminals. So each expansion step could potentially double the number of symbols, or perhaps that's not the only way.\n\nWait, no, in a context-free grammar, each expansion can choose which production to use. So the parsing process will involve starting from the string and recursively splitting into smaller parts according to the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work from the string backwards, trying to find which rules can produce the given string. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me consider the grammar rules and see which non-terminals can produce sequences of the given tokens. Let's list the production rules and see which ones lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nBut then NT48 -> NT23 NT69, which might go further. Wait, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Looking through, I see some rules like:\n\nNT86 -> 't32', NT82 -> 't6', NT60 -> 't5', NT90 -> 't14', NT77 -> 't34', NT74 -> 't31', etc. So several of the non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nI think the strategy is to work from the string backward, trying to find parts that match the immediate productions. For example, starting from the end, seeing if the last part can be matched by a production.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if the entire string can be split into a structure that matches the S's expansion, which is NT81 NT90. So the string must be split into two parts where the first part is what NT81 can generate and the second part is what NT90 can generate.\n\nLet me first check if the string can be split into two parts such that the first part starts with t6, as the S's first production is NT81 and NT90. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me look at the first few tokens.\n\nWait, the first token is t6. But in the grammar, NT7 produces 't1', which is a terminal. Let me check other non-terminals. Looking through, NT25 -> 't15', NT9 -> 't10', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a better approach: the entire string is made up of t tokens, each with different numbers. Each non-terminal in the grammar either produces two terminals, or two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal (but in the grammar I don't see any rules that produce a single terminal except the 't' cases). Wait, no, the grammar seems to have specific rules where some produce a single terminal, like NT82 -> 't3', but in other cases, the RHS is two symbols.\n\nWait, let's clarify: in the grammar, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a single terminal. For example, NT77 -> 't34', so that's a terminal production. NT82 -> 't6', which is another terminal. But other rules have two non-terminals, like NT86 -> NT51 NT88. So, each non-terminal is either a symbol that can produce two non-terminals (thus needing further expansion) or a terminal when applicable.\n\nSo, for example, NT7 -> NT48 NT35, so expanding would require expanding both NT48 and NT35.\n\nGiven that, maybe the string can be broken down by looking for the immediate children in the hierarchy.\n\nAnother approach: build up the string step by step, starting from S. However, since the string is already given, a bottom-up approach might be feasible, but it's a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string starts with t6. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can derive t6.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 Not in the rules. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the rules:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15' (Wait, looking back: NT25 -> 't15'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT25 -> 't15', yes. So NT25 can derive 't15'. Then, NT95 -> NT25 NT60. So NT95 can derive 't15' and NT60, which may derive more.\n\nLooking further, NT60 -> 't98'? No, let's check:\n\nWait, NT98 -> 't31' as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking for which non-terminals produce t6. Wait, t6 is produced by NT25: wait, yes, NT25 -> 't15' and another rule says NT26 -> NT43 NT88.\n\nWait, looking for t6:\n\nI see NT25 \u2192 't15', but that's t15, not t6. Wait, where does t6 come from? Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal producing t6 except perhaps in some productions. Wait, let me re-examine the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'; NT43 can produce 't35'\n\nWait, let me check all the rules to see which ones produce t6:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT25 -> 't15' (so produces 't15')\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT69 -> 't34'\nNT51 -> 't32'\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT95 -> \"t13\", I think.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier.

So all the production rules in the given grammar should follow this structure, and they do.\n\nThe string provided consists of a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, like `t5`, `t1`, etc. My initial thought is that these 't' tokens might represent terminal symbols, and the numbers could be the results of combining non-terminal symbols according to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a lot of non-terminals like NT7, NT81, etc. Each non-terminal seems to expand into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, S -> NT81 NT90, which is the start symbol.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of 't's and numbers, I suspect that each 'tX' corresponds to the terminal symbol TX, derived from a production rule that sends a non-terminal symbol to a terminal X. So, each 'tX' in the string must be matched by a rule in the grammar that has TX as the terminal.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string back into non-terminals using the grammar. Since the string is a series of terminals, I can assign each 'tX' to a non-terminal rule that directly produces TX.\n\nAlternatively, I could work from the starting symbol S and see if I can derive the string by expanding the non-terminals step by step. However, the string length is 21, which seems rather long. Since the grammar's productions involve only a few non-terminals, I might need a more systematic approach.\n\nAnother method is the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing strings in CNF grammars. But implementing it would be time-consuming, especially on a string of length 21. So, perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the initial part is 't5 t1 t33 t15 t10 ...'. Let me see if any of the grammar's production rules result in a sequence starting with t5, t1, etc. \n\nFor example, looking at NT7 -> NT48 NT35. From the start symbol S, it goes to NT81 and NT90. Let me see what NT81 and NT90 expand into.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT90 -> NT51 NT88\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, it's defined as:\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n...\nBut wait, in the grammar provided, it's a single production for each non-terminal. For example:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37, etc.\n\nSo each non-terminal is defined by exactly one production rule. That means it's a finite set of rules where each non-terminal maps to a fixed sequence of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, each 't' must be produced by a production where the non-terminal on the LHS is directly replaced by a terminal. So, the right-hand sides of the productions that include terminal symbols must be the ones generating the 't's.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, for example, NT7 -> NT48 NT35. There are several non-terminals here, but no terminals. Then, other non-terminals do have terminals. For example, NT55 -> NT67 NT37, and looking further, NT37 -> NT15 NT74, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production either leads to two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nBut looking again, the top-level productions start with S, which is NT81 and NT90. Both of these expand into combinations of non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps no production in the given grammar has a terminal on the RHS except for some I can't see yet. Let me list all the rules for NTs:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT77 -> NT34 NT... Hmm, looking through the list:\n\nWait, let me list all RHS that include terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35 (no terminal)\n- NT18 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT37 -> NT9 NT82\n- NT26 -> NT43 NT88 (looking at NT26's rules, no terminals)\n- NT48 -> NT69 NT74\n- NT55 -> NT67 NT37\n- NT25 -> NT5 NT55 (is 55 a terminal? No, 55 is a NT number. Wait, 55 in the RHS is NT55, which is a non-terminal.)\n\nWait, perhaps looking at each rule more carefully:\n\nNT9 -> 't10' \u2014 wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> 't10' \u2014 yes, so this production is NT9 -> t10. So, if a non-terminal can expand to 't10', then when that node is replaced, it contributes 't10' to the string.\n\nSimilarly, looking through:\n\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT69 -> 't34'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT95 (multiple rules) -> 't0', but that's a conflict unless it's allowed, but in CNF, I think each rule must be unique.\nWait, in the grammar, is there a conflict for NT95?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nAlso, earlier it was NT95 -> NT25 NT60, and later I see \"NT95 -> NT25 NT60\", but in the given problem, there might be a duplication.

For example, NT95 seems to appear twice.\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT95 -> NT0 \u2192 so that's conflicting, which can't be since it's a grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake, but assuming the provided grammar is correct, perhaps some NTs have two rules.\n\nThis complicates things because in CNF, each non-terminal should have only one rule.

Oh wait, no, actually, in CNF, a production can have two non-terminals, but in some definitions, a rule can directly produce a terminal symbol. Hmm, maybe the rules can have terminal symbols directly on the right-hand side as well. So each production is either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that each rule on the left side is a non-terminal, and on the right side, there are two non-terminals OR sometimes a terminal symbol. Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at some of the rules:\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- And so on.\n\nBut then I see some rules like NT7 \u2192 't1', which is a terminal. So yes, some productions produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t13 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t0 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t0 t15 t6 t14`.\n\nHmm, the string consists of a sequence of t followed by numbers, which seems to match the terminals in the grammar. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production (except for the terminals) generates exactly two non-terminals. So the derivation must consist of a series where each step expands a non-terminal into two others, until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string's structure, each step would involve replacing a non-terminal with two others, and so the string length should be 2^n where n is the number of steps. Let me check the length of the string.\n\nThe string has 23 tokens (assuming each 't' is a single symbol). Wait, wait, let me count:\n\nLooking at the string: it's \"t10 t13 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t0 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t0 t15 t6 t14\". Let's break it down into parts:\n\n- t10\n- t13\n- t0\n- t16\n- t5\n- t15\n- t10\n- t10\n- t0\n- t15\n- t16\n- t15\n- t15\n- t10\n- t6\n- t3\n- t16\n- t5\n- t31\n- t0\n- t15\n- t6\n- t14\n\nThat's 23 instances of 't' followed by a number. So each is a separate symbol. If the grammar is in CNF, then the derivation would produce a full binary tree where the number of leaves is equal to the length of the string. So for a string of length 23, that would require 23 terminal symbols. However, in a binary tree, the number of leaves must be one more than the number of internal nodes. So if I have 23 leaves, the number of internal nodes would be 22, making the total number of symbols (leaves + internal) 45. But that's probably not the issue here; I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree's leaves form the string. So starting from S, each replacement step adds two symbols. But how does that work for 23 symbols, which is an odd number?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think: the start symbol is S. Each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So the number of non-terminals after each step could decrease as we replace non-terminals with terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if all the terminals in the string are present in the grammar. From the grammar rules, I see that several terminals are used, like t1, t2, t3, up to t35. Let me list all the terminal symbols in the string:\n\nLooking at the string, we have t10, t13, t0, t16, t5, t15, t6, t3, t31, t34, t35, t7, t8, t9, t82, t86, t90, etc. Wait, no, the string only has t numbers: t10, t13, t0, t16, t5, t15, etc.\n\nWait, the string provided is: `t10 t13 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t0 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t3 t16 t5 t31 t0 t15 t6 t14`.\n\nSo all the terminals are in the range t0 to t35, but actually, t10, t13, t0, t16, t5, t15, t6, t3, t31, t14.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for each terminal, is there a production that produces it? For example, NT83 is a non-terminal, but t3 is present. So looking for NT3's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT31 \u2192 't35' and NT35 \u2192 't18', but I'm not sure if t3 is present. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26, but let me check if any NT rule produces t3.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT77 \u2192 't34', NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82, but no direct production for t3. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nI see NT34: Not sure, let me scan for 't3' anywhere. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n\nNT85 \u2192 't86'\n\nWait, looking for 't3', I don't immediately see it. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the grammar, look at rules like NT25 \u2192 NT26 NT28? No. Let me scan down:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7?\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT25 \u2192 NT26 NT28\n- NT48 \u2192 NT23\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\nWait, yes! Looking at the list, there's NT25 \u2192 't5' in the second part.\n\nWait, in the rules, yes:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 t31.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't5'\n\nYes, that's present.\n\nSimilarly, NT13 \u2192 't15'\n\nLooking at the rules, yes:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT60 \u2192 't5'\n\nYes.\n\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't0'\n\nYes, that's in there.\n\nSo, let me list all the terminals in our string:\n\nt10, t13, t0, t16, t5, t15, t10, t10, t0, t15, t16, t15, t15, t10, t6, t3, t16, t5, t31, t0, t15, t6, t14.\n\nSo the distinct terminals here are t0, t1, t3, t5, t6, t10, t13, t14, t15, t16, t31.\n\nNow, looking back at the grammar, I'll check if each of these terminals has a production rule.\n\nLooking for each:\n\n- t0: Yes, NT95 \u2192 't0'.\n\n- t1: Yes, NT7 \u2192 't1'.\n\n- t3: Hmm, looking through the rules, do any NT produce 't3'? Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74.\n\nWait, is there any rule that directly produces t3?

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of various production rules starting from S and ending with terminals (t-something) and non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals in a specific order.\n\nThe string is: `t15 t1 t33 t15 t6 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t15 t10 t13 t0 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14`.\n\nI'll try to break this down into a sequence that matches the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that 'S' starts as NT81 NT90. Let's see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to these.\n\nThe string starts with t15, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT55 -> t6 and NT25 -> t15. Wait, NT7 is t1, but in the string, the first term is t15.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to split the string into the left-hand sides of the production rules. Let's try to find a possible breakdown.\n\nThe string can be split into pairs of NTs followed by 't's. Let me list all the tokens:\n\nt15, t1, t33, t15, t6, t10, t10, t6, t16, t5, t15, t10, t13, t0, t15, t16, t5, t15, t6, t3, t0, t10, t14.\n\nHmm, that's 22 tokens. Since each production seems to generate two terminals, but some may generate more? Wait, no, the grammar has productions like NT37 -> NT9 NT82, which are two-terminals, and others like NT55 -> t6, which is a single terminal.\n\nWait, wait, let me check the grammar again. Some NTs produce two non-terminals, others produce two terminals. For example, NT7 -> t1.\n\nWait, but the initial S is NT81 NT90. So the entire string must be generated by applying the grammar rules until only terminals are left.\n\nMaybe I can try to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see if t15 can come from any NT. From the grammar, NT55 -> t6 (as NT55 -> t6 is in the rules). Wait, but looking back, NT55 is under NT77: NT77 -> NT34 and so on. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, the grammar rules as provided are:\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't30'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> 't13'\nNT55 -> 't31'\nWait, I see that NT55 can produce 't6' as per NT55 -> t6? Wait, no, looking back, the initial rules don't directly say that. Wait, from the provided rules, let me look again.\n\nLooking more carefully, the provided grammar includes lines like:\n\nNT86 -> 't32'\nNT39 -> 't33'\nNT88 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't20'\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT60 -> 't24'\nNT90 -> 't14'.\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. For example, NT82 is one of the rules: NT82 -> t3 (line: NT82 -> 't3'), and NT86 -> t32, NT39->t33, etc.\n\nSo let's correct that. The terminals are generated by NTs:\n\nNT82 -> t6? Wait, looking again:\n\nThe rules provided are:\n\nNT9 -> t10,\n\nNT82 -> 't6',\n\nand NT13 -> 't15',\n\nNT60 -> 't24',\n\nNT90 -> 't14',\n\nNT7 -> t1,\n\nNT82 -> t6,\n\nYes, I think in the provided grammar, NT82 can produce 't6', which is in the second position of the string.\n\nSo let's see the first few tokens:\n\nt15, t1, t33, t15, t6, t10, t10, t6, t16, t5, t15, t10, t13, t0, t15, t16, t5, t15, t6, t3, t0, t10, t14.\n\nSo the first three tokens are t15, t1, t33.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, to get t15, which NT can produce that.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT15 is not present. Wait, looking at the rules, 't15' is produced by NT67: NT67 -> 't15'.\n\nSo to get t15, we need NT67. But how do we get NT67?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT67 is generated by NT55 -> NT67 NT37. Wait, no, looking again, I think I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, the rule is:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nWait, no, from the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37.\n\nSo to get t15, we need NT67 -> t15. So, for NT67, it's a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t15, which suggests that we have a production that starts with NT67.\n\nSo, let's try to parse the string as S = NT81 NT90, and then see if we can derive the string.\n\nSo the first two tokens in the string are t15 and t1. Wait, but t15 is from NT67 and t1 is from NT7. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's consider the full string and try to split it into possible non-terminal steps.\n\nAn alternative approach is to try to match the string step by step through the productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe first part of the string is t15 t1 t33 t15 t6 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t15 t10 t13 t0 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t3 t0 t10 t14.\n\nWait, perhaps I can group tokens into pairs where possible.\n\nLooking at the start, the first terminal is t15. Looking for a production that can generate t15. From the rules, that's NT67.\n\nBut NT67 is a non-terminal. So where does NT67 come from? Looking at the rules, NT67 is a terminal in the production of NT55: NT55 -> NT67 NT37. So that production produces two non-terminals, which will need to be further expanded.\n\nAdditionally, NT55 has another production: NT55 -> t6. So NT55 can produce either NT67 NT37 or t6.\n\nHmm, but the string starts with t15, which is only possible if the first NT67 in the parse tree is expanded as a terminal. So that would require that the production used is the one where NT55 -> NT67 NT37, and then NT67 is the one that produces t15.\n\nWait, but that production would produce two non-terminals, which would then need to be expanded. So, for example, if S is NT81 NT90, and then we have to expand each of those.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-430","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way to structure CFGs where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I look at the grammar provided. It's a bit long, so I need to map each production to see if it fits the CNF rules. The grammar seems to consist of multiple non-terminals, each expanding into other non-terminals and sometimes terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine for CNF as long as each non-terminal on the right also follows CNF rules.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t6 t5 t24 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t6 t3 t16 t20 t7 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t13 t15 t0 t10 t14`. This string is a sequence of terminals, which are likely the result of applying the production rules step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the first two symbols in the string should be the results of NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 from the grammar. So NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9. Similarly, NT90 is part of S, so let's see NT90's production. Looking through the grammar, NT90 isn't listed as a parent in any other production except S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nNo, in the grammar, S is the top symbol, and it directly expands into NT81 NT90, but the other non-terminals have their own productions. So for the string to start with t6, which is a terminal, we need to follow the productions of the non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each non-terminal and see what terminals they can generate.\n\nLet's take S first. S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the first step is to expand both NT81 and NT90. Let's see what NT81 can do.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nLooking at NT95: From the grammar, NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. Both NT25 and NT60 need to be expanded.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT15 NT55.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37.\n\nNT67 \u2192 NT15, which is NT15, which is NT25 NT55 again. Hmm, that might loop. Wait, no, let's see NT67 \u2192 NT15, which is NT25 NT55. So, this could lead to loops unless something else happens.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. Also, NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nNT98 \u2192 NT31 NT39.\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28.\n\nWait, I'm getting lost. Maybe I should look at the string step by step, trying to match each token.\n\nThe string starts with t6, so I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t6. Looking through the grammar, I see NT86 \u2192 't32' when it's in the production for NT48 \u2192 NT23 NT88, but wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar at the end, there are some lines like NT88 \u2192 't7', NT12 \u2192 't30', etc. So I need to match each token to a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all terminal productions first. From the grammar:\n\nNT88 \u2192 t7\n\nNT69 \u2192 t34\n\nNT51 \u2192 t32\n\nNT25 \u2192 t5\n\nNT86 \u2192 t32\n\nNT39 \u2192 t33\n\nNT82 \u2192 t6\n\nNT43 \u2192 t20\n\nNT13 \u2192 t15\n\nNT60 \u2192 t24\n\nNT12 \u2192 t35\n\nNT69 \u2192 t34 (already listed)\n\nNT51 \u2192 t32 (already listed)\n\nNT48 \u2192 t23\n\nNT25 \u2192 t5\n\nNT9 \u2192 t10\n\nNT43 \u2192 t1\n\nNT13 \u2192 t0\n\nNT28 \u2192 t34\n\nNT60 \u2192 t5\n\nNT48 \u2192 t29\n\nNT51 \u2192 t22\n\nNT83 \u2192 t23\n\nNT90 \u2192 t14\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\n\nNT98 \u2192 t31\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n\n- NT86 \u2192 t32\n\n- NT39 \u2192 t33\n\n- NT88 \u2192 t7\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n\n- NT43 \u2192 t1 (appears twice, once as NT43 and again in NT13)\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t6, so that must come from a production that ends in t6. Looking at the grammar, NT82 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token t6 must be the result of NT82. So, the first non-terminal in the expansion must be NT82, but wait, the grammar's S is NT81 NT90. So the first two symbols should come from NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6, which is the result of NT82. But S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so how does t6 appear as the first symbol?\n\nThat's confusing because S first produces NT81 and NT90. So unless one of them can produce a t6 as the first symbol, but none of the productions of NT81 or NT90 start with a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions that end in terminals:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n\n- NT86 \u2192 t32\n\n- NT39 \u2192 t33\n\n- NT88 \u2192 t7\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n\n- NT43 \u2192 t1\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t0\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n\n- NT98 \u2192 t31\n\n- NT60 \u2192 t24\n\n- NT12 \u2192 t35\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t34\n\n- NT51 \u2192 t32\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t23\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t10\n\n- NT43 \u2192 t1\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t0\n\n- etc.\n\nSo, for the string to start with t6, we must have NT82 being expanded first. But in S, the first expansion is NT81 and NT90, so how can t6 come first? That suggests that either the string does not start correctly with S, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the productions, so maybe S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and NT81 expands into t6, but that doesn't make sense because NT81's first production is NT95 and NT9, which are both non-terminals. So, that can't end in a terminal directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is being built by a series of productions that might include some terminals along the way, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's look for the entire string in the grammar's terminals. The string is: t6 t5 t24 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t6 t3 t16 t20 t7 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t13 t15 t0 t10 t14.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are: t6, t5, t24, t0, t16, t33, t32, t7, t31, t34, t35, t10, t1, t0, t14.\n\nSo, for example, t33 comes from NT39 \u2192 t33, and t34 from NT69 \u2192 t34, etc.\n\nNow, let's try to see if the string can be a linear derivation starting from S.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, we need to find how NT81 and NT90 can produce the string.\n\nBut NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. So, the first symbol would be from NT95, which would be NT25 and NT60. Then NT25 is t5, but wait, NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like all the non-terminals (NT) are broken down into other non-terminals and terminals ('t' followed by numbers). The start symbol is S, which goes to NT81 NT90. So the string starts with these two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will produce parts of the string.\n\nI should probably parse the string step by step. Starting with T, the top-down approach might work, but it's a bit complicated. Alternatively, checking if all the terminals are produced by the non-terminals correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals break down into other non-terminals or 't's. Each production is in the form NTXY -> NTX NTY. So I can map each of these to parts of the string.\n\nLet me break down the string into the sequence of t's. The string is: t10 t10 t10 t6 t3 t16 t5 t15 t6 t6 t15 t16 t5 t31 t0 t16 t20 t7 t0 t16 t20 t7 t6 t14.\n\nWait, actually, the string is a sequence of 't's with numbers, separated by spaces. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so the entire string is a concatenation of these terminals. \n\nI think each time a non-terminal is used, it should expand into a sequence that matches the corresponding production. So maybe I can represent the string as a list of these terminals and see if the grammar can generate that order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe represent the string as a parse tree. For example, starting with S-> NT81 NT90. Then each of these NTs will expand into their components, and so on, until we get terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work backwards. Let me see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe first three t10s. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT95-> NT25 NT60. And also, NT77-> NT34 (t34), but that might not be relevant here. Let's think about t10. Checking the grammar, I see NT90->NT82 t3, so NT82 is involved. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT7-> NT48 NT35. NT7 also has a production nt7 -> t1. Oh, wait, nt7 has two productions: nt7-> NT48 NT35 and nt7-> t1.

Wait no: look at the string, it's just a sequence of these 't's with numbers. So all the elements are terminals because each is 't' followed by a number, so no non-terminals in the string itself, only the sequence of terminals.\n\nWait no, I think I'm misunderstanding. The grammar consists of productions where some non-terminals produce other non-terminals and\/or terminals. So the problem is to determine whether the given string can be derived from the grammar, meaning that it must be a string of terminals generated by expanding the start symbol S according to the productions.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. So the first step is that S expands into NT81 and NT90. Then each of those NTs must expand in turn, until we reach terminals only.\n\nBut the input string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, so each element is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-455","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the string \"t5 t34 t15 t10 t6 t34 t23 t18 t33 t15 t10 t15 t31 t15 t6 t10 t0 t0 t16 t15 t31 t15 t15 t10 t14\" is in the language defined by the grammar. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for certain algorithms, like the CYK parsing algorithm, but since I'm just trying to determine if a string is generated, I can approach it by analyzing the productions and seeing how the string can be broken down.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice it's quite extensive. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT81 NT90. So, the string starts with \"t5 t34 t15 t10 t6 t34...\" and the last part ends with \"t14\". Wait, but S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the generated string should be something that can be derived from NT81 and NT90. Let me check if the given string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, let's split it into two substrings. Let's see:\n\nPart 1: t5 t34 t15 t10 t6 t34 t23 t18 t33 t15 t10 t15 t31 t15 t6 t10\nPart 2: t0 t0 t16 t15 t31 t15 t15 t10 t14\n\nWait, the original S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT81 and NT90, right? So I need to check if the first part corresponds to NT81 and the second to NT90.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, let's see how NT81 and NT90 are defined.\n\nFrom the production rules:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n\nWait, this seems complex. Maybe it's easier to model the string as a sequence of terminals and see if it can be built by the non-terminals expanding according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can generate the string. But since the string is relatively long, that might take a while.\n\nLet me start by trying to see what the string represents. Each token is a terminal (like t5, t34, etc.), so the string is a sequence of these terms. Since S produces two non-terminals, I expect the string to be the concatenation of two derived sequences from NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, let's check if the first part of the string corresponds to NT81 and the second to NT90.\n\nFirst, I'll look at NT81. The production NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Let's see what NT95 and NT9 produce.\n\nLooking at NT95: its productions are NT25 NT60, and NT60 is NT98 NT55. So NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, which in turn \u2192 NT98 NT55, and NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT9's productions are NT12 NT77 and NT77 \u2192 NT35 NT18, NT35 \u2192 NT18 NT95, and so on.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be written as a sequence of terminals that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to reverse-engineer the string by mapping each token to terminal symbols and seeing if they align with the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can construct the parse tree from the string upwards, but that might take time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a step-by-step breakdown of how the string can be generated.\n\nFirst, the string is: t5 t34 t15 t10 t6 t34 t23 t18 t33 t15 t10 t15 t31 t15 t6 t10 t0 t0 t16 t15 t31 t15 t15 t10 t14\n\nI need to see if this can be split into two parts from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the first part: t5 t34 t15 t10 t6 t34 t23 t18 t33 t15 t10 t15 t31 t15 t6 t10\n\nAnd the second part: t0 t0 t16 t15 t31 t15 t15 t10 t14\n\nLet me consider the second part first. The last few tokens are t14. Looking at the grammar, what produces t14? From the given productions, NT90 \u2192 t14, so the second part must be the result of expanding NT90.\n\nLooking at NT90: the production is S \u2192 NT90. Wait, wait: the given grammar for NT90 is just t14, so the second part must be derived from NT90. So the entire second part must correspond to NT90.\n\nNow, NT90: looking at the production rules provided, I don't see a production for NT90. Wait, hold on. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, the initial S is NT81 NT90, but the individual NT90's are defined as S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Wait, no, that's not part of the given grammar. Wait, the given grammar seems to be a list of productions for various non-terminals. So looking at the list, the NT90 is used as part of S's production, but does NT90 have a production?\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nI see NT90 in the productions, specifically the string ends with t14, and in the grammar, I see that one of the productions is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe given grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo each production is like Non-terminal -> something.\n\nLooking at the beginning, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S is the start symbol, and it expands into NT81 and NT90.\n\nNow, looking in the productions, I don't see a production for NT90. Is that correct? Wait, no, in the production list, I have:\n\nNT90: does it have a production? Let me scan through:\n\nLooking at the list, there's NT90's presence in the context of S, but not as a non-terminal with a production. So does NT90 have a production? Or is it perhaps that the user provided some productions, and maybe NT90 isn't directly defined?

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex, and the string to check is a series of tokens: t10, t6, t13, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to remember what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. So, looking at the grammar provided, I can see each rule starts with a non-terminal on the left, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That fits the CNF structure.\n\nNow, the main task is to see if the given string can be derived by this grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each token in the string should correspond to the application of a production rule. Each rule produces exactly one terminal or two non-terminals, and since the string is a linear sequence of terminals, the parsing should be straightforward if possible.\n\nI think a good approach here is to construct a parse tree or a derivation starting from the start symbol S. The original grammar starts with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the string should start with the concatenation of what NT81 and NT90 derive to.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Starting with S, we have two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Each of these must produce a string ending with t... according to the productions.\n\nLooking at NT81: the rules for NT81 are NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9. \n\nNext, NT9: according to the rules, NT9 \u2192 't10'. Wait, no, looking back, I see NT9's rules. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar provided, looking for NT9, I see that NT9's productions are not directly listed. Wait, perhaps I need to check if I have all the rules for NT81.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT81, it's written that NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, let's see what NT95 and NT9 expand to.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60. So, NT95 expands into NT25 and NT60.\n\nThen NT25 \u2192 NT5, and NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nNT5 is a terminal, but looking through the grammar, I see NT5's rules: I don't see any, so perhaps it's not present. Wait, no, maybe I missed it. Wait, the grammar only lists rules where the non-terminal is on the left. So, for example, NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28. Wait, so perhaps some non-terminals are leaf nodes (i.e., they produce terminals directly if they aren't further expanded). Hmm, but that depends on the rules.\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, for example, NT35 \u2192 't34', NT35 appears in some productions as the terminal. So, perhaps some non-terminals directly expand to terminals, while others expand to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the productions for each non-terminal to see if any expand to terminals.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see their productions.\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't20'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't29'\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n- NT83 \u2192 't23'\n- NT90 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, so some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT82 \u2192 't3', NT20 \u2192 't16', NT98 \u2192 't31', etc. Others, like NT81, produce other non-terminals. So, the goal is to see if the given string can be built by expanding the non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string: t10, t6, t13, t15, t16, t5, t15, t10, t5, t24, t15, t10, t6, t6, t16, t35, t7, t0, t0, t15, t16, t20, t7, t10, t14.\n\nWait, that's 24 tokens. Hmm.\n\nBut each production can generate either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the minimal number of steps required would be such that each step reduces the count of non-terminals by one, starting from S which produces two non-terminals, then each of those could produce two more, etc. The string length is 24, so a possible derivation could have up to 23 productions. But that's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down parsing approach can be used, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet's first check the start symbol: S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, the generated string should start with the concatenation of what NT81 and NT90 produce.\n\nSo, first token: t10 (from NT81), next should be t6 (from NT90), but looking at NT90, which appears in the given grammar as S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and the production for NT90: I don't see it listed. Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, S is defined as NT81 NT90. But then I need to check what NT90 produces. Wait, in the provided grammar, do I see any production for NT90 beyond S involving it? Looking through the list, I don't see any production for NT90 except when S is involved. So, that's a problem. Because without a production for NT90, we can't know what it produces. Maybe I've missed a production.\n\nWait, let me check again. The initial grammar is provided as:\n\nGrammar: S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nThen the other productions follow, but I don't see NT90 being defined. So, perhaps NT90 is a terminal. Because in the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and unless NT90 has a production, it's treated as a terminal.\n\nBut in the provided rules, I don't see NT90 being on the left side of any production except in S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, it's likely that NT90 is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in that case, in the string, the second token would be NT90's terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-472","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to check is \"t10 t10 t10 t13 t15 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t0 t0 t16 t15 t31 t15 t6 t14\". Each non-terminal in the grammar eventually resolves to a specific terminal string, which are labeled with 't' followed by a number. My task is to see if this specific sequence of tokens can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal (like S, NT7, NT90, etc.) expands into two non-terminals, except for those that directly expand into terminals. So, the structure is binary, and each production is of the form A -> BC where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals, except when a non-terminal expands directly to a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first production, expands into NT81 NT90. So, S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nNow, I need to see if the given string can be derived by applying these production rules.\n\nLet me break the string into tokens for clarity:\nt10, t10, t10, t13, t15, t16, t35, t7, t0, t16, t35, t7, t0, t16, t5, t15, t10, t10, t0, t0, t16, t15, t31, t15, t6, t14.\n\nThis is a sequence of 28 tokens. So, the derivation should result in exactly these tokens in order.\n\nSince each production step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals, the length of the string increases with each step. However, in this case, the string is given, and I don't know the number of steps, but each step should produce exactly two tokens, except when a non-terminal is replaced by a single token.\n\nWait, no, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, meaning each production step increases the string length by one, turning one non-terminal into two. So, the number of symbols (non-terminals and terminals) increases by 1 with each production step.\n\nGiven that, starting from S, each step adds one token. Therefore, the number of steps needed to reach a certain length is equal to the length minus 1. For example, starting from S, after one step, you have two symbols; after two steps, three symbols, etc.\n\nThe given string has 28 tokens. So, to get from S to this string, we need 27 expansions.\n\nBut instead of trying to reconstruct the entire derivation, perhaps it's easier to work backwards using the reverse process.\n\nEach production has a reverse that can be checked. For each terminal token, there's a non-terminal production that generates it. So, if I can reduce the string step by step by replacing the generated tokens with their corresponding non-terminals, I can attempt to reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet's try this approach.\n\nStarting with the string: t10 t10 t10 t13 t15 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t0 t0 t16 t15 t31 t15 t6 t14.\n\nLet me list all the tokens and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nt10 \u2192 NT82\nt13 \u2192 NT43 or NT22?

{"custom_id":"request-468","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, and the grammar has various non-terminals that resolve to these strings. \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the grammar starts with S, which produces NT81 NT90. Each of these non-terminals eventually resolves down to a series of t and numbers. So the string starts with t6, which I need to trace back through the grammar to see if it comes from a non-terminal that S can produce.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t6 t6 t15 t5 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t13 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t3 t0 t10 t14. \n\nI'll start by breaking it down. The first token is t6. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that NT69 and NT51 both have a rule that leads to t6. For example, NT69 \u2192 t6, and ND0 \u2192 t6. Wait, but ND0 is not shown here; let me check. Hmm, actually, I see ND0 is in another part, but looking at the provided rules, yes, both NT69 and NT51 have a production that includes t6. So t6 can come from either of these non-terminals.\n\nNext, I notice that each t6 is followed by other t tokens. Let's take the first t6. It comes from either NT69 or NT51, depending on other productions. So I need to see how the grammar produces t6. Looking up, for example, NT67 \u2192 t15, and NT51 \u2192 t32. Hmm, maybe I should look for how the non-terminals resolve step by step.\n\nWait, I think it's better to reverse-engineer the string starting from the top-down approach. The string starts with t6 t6... so the entire string is a sequence of various t's. The grammar's start symbol is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the initial production is NT81 and NT90. Each of these non-terminals will produce a string that eventually leads to the given t-strings.\n\nSo I need to check if the given string can be derived from NT81 and NT90. Let's focus on the first NT81. NT81's production is NT95 NT9. So NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then, NT9 is a terminal t10. But wait, the string starts with t6, so maybe I'm misaligned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each token as part of a production step. Let me think differently: each non-terminal in the grammar eventually produces a string that can be expanded to terms like tX and numbers. So, for each token in the string, it must correspond to a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more efficient to model the grammar as a parser and see if the string can be generated. But this might take a long time, especially with 27 tokens.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the structure of the string. The first two tokens are t6, t6. Let me check if NT81 or NT90 can produce t6. Looking at NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 is t10, so that might not help. Let me see if NT95 can produce t6.\n\nLooking at NT95, it has two productions: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT91 (I think I missed some earlier). Wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT91 when looking elsewhere? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT95 is:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT95\n\nWait, no, looking back:\nFrom the provided grammar, the rule for NT95 is:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT91\n\nWait, no, the given rules show NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT91? Or is it different? Wait, looking again:\n\nThe rules include:\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT95 rules:\nLooking through the provided grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT95? No, wait, let me check each NT95 production.\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, NT95 is produced by NT25 NT60 and NT55 NT95? Or is it another.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT34\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT25 \u2192 NT15\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT95 productions:\n\nWait, no, looking again, the provided rules are numerous, but I don't see NT95 having a production with NT95 itself. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, after NT77, I see NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, then NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26, etc. It seems NT95 has the following production:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and then looking deeper, no. Wait, no, in the given rules, the production for NT95 is:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 (I think that's one of them). I don't see another production for NT95, but maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT95 productions. Let me scan through the rules:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT95 \u2192 NT55 NT95 (Wait, no, looking through the rules, I don't see NT95 being produced by NT55 NT95. Maybe not.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me focus on the initial production: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string must be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81, its production is NT95 NT9. So NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. NT9 is t10, so one part is t10. But the string starts with t6, not t10. So maybe this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's see: NT81's production is NT95 NT9. So the first part is NT95's string, followed by NT9's string, which is t10.\n\nWait, but the first token in the string is t6, so that doesn't match. So perhaps NT81 isn't the right starting point. Maybe I need to check if the string can be produced by NT90 instead.\n\nWait, let's double-check: S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the string is the combination of NT81's production and NT90's. So each part must produce some string that together make the whole.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's map each token in the string to a production. Starting with the first token: t6. So which non-terminals produce t6? Looking through the rules, any NT that has a production where the terminal is t6.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT69 \u2192 t6, NT51 \u2192 t6. So the first t6 can come from either NT69 or NT51.\n\nSimilarly, the second t6 would come from another NT that produces t6, perhaps the same or different.\n\nSo, starting with t6 from NT69, for example. NT69's production is NT67 NT37. NT67 \u2192 t15, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82.\n\nNT9 \u2192 t10, NT82 can be 't6' or another production. Wait, looking back, NT82 has the production NT95 NT13, and also looking down, I see NT82 can be 't23'? Wait, in the given rules, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, NT82 is:\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT82 \u2192 NT74 NT13\n- NT82 \u2192 't7'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\nWait, no, looking again, the rules for NT82 show that it has a production that is t7: NT82 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-497","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t6 t6 t10 t3 t16 t15 t31 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t0 t15 t16 t35 t7 t15 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t6 t14`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but here I don't need to use such algorithms; I just need to check if the string is generated by this grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the production rules start with a non-terminal on the left side, and on the right side, they are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which fits the form A \u2192 BC. Another example is NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, which again is A \u2192 BC. Some rules have terminals on the right, like NT82 \u2192 't3', which is A \u2192 a.\n\nThe string to check is long, but since it's composed of various 't' terms with numbers, I think each 't' might correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. The first step is to see how each 't' in the string corresponds to a production rule. \n\nI should start by building a parsing tree or a derivation sequence. But considering the grammar's rules, maybe a better approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to see if each 't' can be replaced by a production that leads to the top symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the grammar's productions and see if the string can be generated by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain. However, with 32 tokens in the string, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be broken down into parts that match the right-hand sides of the production rules. For example, looking for chunks of two terminals or non-terminals. Wait, but actually, in CNF, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in the string, when we see a 't' followed by some symbols, they could represent a single production rule's application.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the string is composed of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers might be the indices of non-terminals. So, each token in the string like 't6' is actually the terminal 't' and some number. But wait, wait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides consist of terminals (like 't1', 't2', etc.) and non-terminals (like NT7, NT95, etc.). So each element in the string is of the form 'tX' where X is a number between 1 and 90, depending on the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the grammar, the terminals are strings like 't3', 't6', etc., so each token in the string is a terminal symbol of the form 't' followed by a number. Therefore, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, so each 't6', 't10', etc., is a terminal.\n\nWait no, that can't be because in the grammar, the non-terminals are the NTs, like NT7, NT39, etc. The terminals are the 't's with numbers, such as 't1', 't3', etc. So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol. Therefore, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols and non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, the string is all terminal symbols because it's just 't's followed by numbers. So each token is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, the productions are like A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where 'a' is a terminal, so the string is built by replacing non-terminals with terminals or sequences of non-terminals. So in this case, we can model the string as a sequence of terminals that result from expanding the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut given that the string is composed solely of terminal symbols, each token in the string should correspond to a single terminal symbol. However, looking at the grammar, some of the productions also have non-terminals on the right-hand side, so the expansion can produce a sequence like NT1 nt2, and each of those can be further expanded.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to reverse-engineer the string to see if each token in the string can be obtained by applying the grammar's production rules.\n\nWait, that approach might be tough because the string's length is quite long. Alternatively, maybe I can look at the grammar's productions and see which 't's can be derived from each non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see what each non-terminal expands into.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\n- NT43 \u2192 't35'\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT86 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't33'\n- NT88 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't20'\n- NT13 \u2192 't15'\n- NT60 \u2192 't24'\n- NT12 \u2192 't35'\n- NT69 \u2192 't34'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT48 \u2192 't23'\n- NT25 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't6'\n- NT43 \u2192 't1'\n- NT13 \u2192 't0'\n- NT28 \u2192 't34'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5'\n- NT48 \u2192 't29'\n- NT51 \u2192 't22'\n- NT83 \u2192 't23'\n- NT90 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, I notice duplicates like NT55 \u2192 't31' and NT95 \u2192 't13' and another NT95 \u2192 't13' and then later 't0'. Also, some produce multiple terminals, like NT25 \u2192 't15' and 't5'. Wait, no, actually each rule's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT86 \u2192 't32' is a single terminal, so the expansion of NT86 is just 't32'.\n\nSo the approach is to see if each token in the string is matched by a terminal production of some non-terminal. But since the grammar allows two non-terminals to be adjacent, we might need to split the string into parts where each part is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string is a single sequence of terminals. So how can two non-terminals appear in the expansion? For example, if the grammar has a production like A \u2192 BC, then the expansion could be 'tX tY' if B and C produce 'tX' and 'tY' respectively. Or, B could be another non-terminal that could expand further.\n\nSo, to model this, perhaps the string can be split into symbols where each symbol is either a terminal or a pair of terminals (i.e., two non-terminals in the right-hand side of a production).

Then NT81 and NT90 each need to expand into strings.\n\nLooking at NT81: it has the production NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9.\n\nThen, NT95 has NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a specific string to evaluate whether it's generated by this grammar. My goal is to determine if the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires all production rules to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, I notice that all rules are indeed in CNF, except for a few that don't fit because some have more than two non-terminals on the right side, but upon closer inspection, it seems all rules are actually in CNF since each production is either two symbols or a terminal. So I think the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string: `t10 t5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t0 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t0 t16 t35 t7 t15 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t6 t14`. \n\nTo determine if this string can be generated by the grammar, I'll use the CYK parsing algorithm. The CYK algorithm is suitable for CNF grammars. Here's a step-by-step approach I'll take:\n\n1. **Identify the Start Symbol**: The start symbol is S, so the first production to consider is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\n2. **List All Non-terminals and Terminals**: From the grammar, the terminals are various t followed by numbers. The non-terminals are NT followed by numbers, and NT7 is a single NT symbol.\n\n3. **Initialize the CYK Table**: Create a table where rows represent symbols and columns represent positions in the string. The size of the table will be (length of string) x (length of string).\n\n4. **Fill the Table**:\n    - For each position, determine possible non-terminals that can produce the string segment.\n    - Start with segments of length 1, then build up to longer segments.\n    - For each pair of non-terminals A and B, check if there's a production rule where A \u2192 BC and the middle non-terminal is part of the grammar.\n\n5. **Check for the Start Symbol**: After filling the table, if the start symbol S is present in the top-right corner (i.e., covers the entire string), the string is in the language.\n\nLet's start implementing this.\n\n**Step 1: Initialize the Table**\n\nThe string has 34 symbols, so our table will be 34x34. Each cell (i, j) will represent the range from position i to j (inclusive).\n\n**Step 2: Filling the Table**\n\n- **First Pass (Segments of Length 1)**:\n    For each position k from 0 to 33, check if there's a non-terminal NTxxx equal to the terminal at position k.\n\n    For example:\n    - Position 0: 't10' \u2192 Check if NT10 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT10 as a non-terminal; it's a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, NT9 is 't10', not NT10.

{"custom_id":"request-510","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given grammar generates the string `t6 t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t15 t5 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t5 t5 t0 t15 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t0 t0 t10 t14`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is useful because it simplifies the parsing process and allows for certain optimizations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT81 NT90. Both NT81 and NT90 are non-terminals. Each of these will eventually lead to terminal symbols based on the productions given.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar, substituting non-terminals with terminals as we go. If we can successfully reduce the entire string to terminals and match it exactly, then the string is in the language.\n\nStarting with the string: `t6 t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t15 t5 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t5 t5 t0 t15 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t0 t0 t10 t14`.\n\nLet me break it down into parts based on the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT81 NT90. So, the string should start with the production of NT81 followed by NT90.\n\nFirst, let me look up the productions for NT81 and NT90.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT90 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n\nBut wait, looking further, NT90 actually produces NT25 NT37, but in the initial part, it's being split as NT90 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Wait, that can't be, maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the initial part shows S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then, in the grammar, NT81 is defined as NT95 NT9. So, S \u2192 NT95 NT9 NT25 NT37. But no, wait, S is NT81 followed by NT90, which is NT25 NT37. So S \u2192 NT95 NT9 NT25 NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down correctly. Let's first see the production of NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, let's look at the full grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\n- NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n- NT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\n- NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\n- NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n- NT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n- NT82 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't16'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT12 \u2192 't30'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT35 \u2192 't18'\n- NT95 \u2192 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't31'\n- NT95 \u2192 't0'\nWait, there's a problem here\u2014NT95 has two productions: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and then again NT95 \u2192 't13' and also later NT95 \u2192 't0'. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, there's:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nand then another production:\n\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\n\nWait, but in the full list:\n\nWait, the grammar given includes:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nThen, later:\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nAnd again:\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nWait, so NT95 has three productions: two terminals and one non-terminal. That seems conflicting. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production must be either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So NT95 can have NT25 NT60, or a single terminal. But in this case, NT95 has more than two productions, which isn't standard in CNF. Wait, no\u2014in CNF, each rule is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So having multiple rules for the same non-terminal is allowed, so NT95 can have multiple rules.\n\nThis might be causing confusion, but I can manage by considering all possible options.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces NT81 NT90. So the first part of the string starts with NT81, which produces NT95 NT9.\n\nSo, the first two symbols after S would be NT95 and NT9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't6', but according to NT81's production, it's NT95 NT9. So let's see what NT9 produces.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't10'. So, whenever NT9 is used, it produces 't10'.\n\nSo, the first part is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9 \u2192 't15' 't10'.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, NT9's production is 't10', so when NT9 is used, it immediately becomes 't10'. So the first part after S is 't15' because NT95 could be 't15'?\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me make sure. NT95 has two productions: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and NT95 \u2192 't13' and also another 't0'. So, it can produce a terminal or combine with two non-terminals.\n\nSo in this case, when NT95 is part of NT81, which is in S, perhaps we have to choose which production to use. But since we're trying to parse the string, we might need to see which alternative is possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting tangled. Let me try to map out the entire string's symbols and see if each part corresponds correctly.\n\nThe string is: t6 t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t15 t5 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t5 t5 t0 t15 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t0 t0 t10 t14.\n\nI think the best way is to represent the string as a list and try to parse it from left to right, replacing the first symbols as per the grammar until all symbols are consumed.\n\nLet me list out the string:\n\n1: t6\n\n2: t10\n\n3: t3\n\n4: t16\n\n5: t15\n\n6: t15\n\n7: t6\n\n8: t6\n\n9: t15\n\n10: t5\n\n11: t15\n\n12: t16\n\n13: t5\n\n14: t15\n\n15: t6\n\n16: t5\n\n17: t5\n\n18: t0\n\n19: t15\n\n20: t15\n\n21: t16\n\n22: t5\n\n23: t15\n\n24: t6\n\n25: t0\n\n26: t0\n\n27: t10\n\n28: t14\n\nI'll need to see if this can be generated by S, which is NT81 NT90.\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 t10. So the first part is NT95 \u2192 ... ?\n\nWait, but wait: Let's step back. Let me try to model the parsing process.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the entire string must be split into two parts: the left part (NT81 production) and the right part (NT90 production).\n\n2.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and the string is a sequence of t and numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and NT81 \u2192 t95 NT9, which eventually can produce a terminal (like 't1') or another non-terminal.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of t and numbers: \n\nt10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t15 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t15 t24 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t3 t15 t0 t16 t20 t7 t15 t6 t14.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since it's CNF, the derivations are straightforward: each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, until all are terminals.\n\nMaybe I should start from the top symbol S and see if I can build the string step by step. S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, the string should start with NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is 't10'. Let's check which production rules generate 't10'. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT90 \u2192 t10 (in the rules). So, NT90 can produce 't10'. That's good.\n\nNow, NT81: looking at the rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So, NT81 must be split into two non-terminals. The next element after 't10' is 't3', so let's see what generates 't3'. From the rules, NT39 \u2192 t33? No, wait, NT39 is 't33' in one rule, but NT39 also appears in NT25 \u2192 t15. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's list all terminals and their corresponding NTs:\n\nLooking for each t in the string and find the NT that directly produces it:\n\n- 't1' comes from NT7 \u2192 t1 (and also NT77 \u2192 t34, but that can't be it)\n- 't3' comes from NT77? Wait, NT77's production is \u2192 t34. Wait, maybe I need to check each terminal's source.\n\nWait, let me create a list of each terminal and which NTs produce them:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- 't1' \u2192 NT7 \u2192 t1\n- 't2' seems not present\n- 't3' \u2192 Maybe NT39 \u2192 t33? Wait, no. Let me check each rule that ends with t.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t1 (yes)\n- NT16 \u2192 t16 (so NT16's production is 't16')\nWait, wait, no, in the grammar, the terminals are on the right-hand side as 'tX'.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, each production on the RHS has either two NTs or a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's given in a list format with productions of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals or strings of terminals. The start symbol seems to be S, and each production is followed by two non-terminals. My goal is to check if the string `t6 t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t6 t10 t3 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t5 t31 t15 t16 t1 t7 t0 t15 t16 t15 t31 t6 t14` can be derived from this grammar.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol. So for each production, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals. This setup means that any derivation from the start symbol S will result in a parse tree where each node has exactly two children, leading to a total number of symbols in the string that's one more than a power of two, or similar.\n\nWait, wait, let me think. For a string of length n generated from S, the parse tree is a binary tree with height log2(n) approximately. But since each production is binary, the number of steps is fixed based on the tree height. But maybe I'm complicating things. Instead, perhaps I should approach this by constructing the parse tree or checking the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the terminals in the string and trace their possible sources in the grammar. Each terminal must be the result of a production where it's directly rewritten. So, for each 't' followed by numbers, I need to check if that's a terminal in the grammar or if it's a non-terminal that can expand to that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules directly produce terminals. For example, NT7 -> 't1'. So if 't1' appears in the string, that must come from NT7. Similarly, NT82 -> 't6' and NT9 -> 't10', so 't6' and 't10' must come from these non-terminals. I should map each terminal in the string to the non-terminals that produce them.\n\nLet me list the terminals and their sources:\n- t1 from NT7\n- t3 from NT77\n- t6 from NT82 or NT9\n- t10 from NT9\n- t15 from NT28 or NT69\n- t16 from NT20 or NT74 or NT86 or NT67 or others?\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT7 -> 't1', NT18 -> 't20', etc. Maybe the best way is to list all the non-terminals and the terminals they produce.\n\nLet me compile a list:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT77 \u2192 t18\nNT20 \u2192 t16\nNT28 \u2192 t34\nNT12 \u2192 t35\nNT74 \u2192 t31\nNT95 \u2192 t13 or t0\nNT82 \u2192 t6 or t39?\nWait, looking back, I think I might have miscalculated.

Wait, no. NT28 is on line13: NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28. Line13 says NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28.\n\nBut NT28 is on line13: NT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28? So does that mean NT28 is a non-terminal? Looking at line13, it's written as NT31 -> NT86 NT28, and on line19, it's NT26 -> NT25 NT55. No, line13 is NT31, which uses NT28, which isn't in the list of non-terminals that have a terminal as RHS yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

{"custom_id":"request-557","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t5 t1 t33 t15 t6 t6 t10 t6 t13 t15 t16 t35 t7 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t15 t24 t0 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t3 t0 t10 t14`. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT81 NT90. Each non-terminal on the right-hand side of the productions seems to expand into two other non-terminals, except for some that directly expand into terminals. \n\nThe non-terminals are things like NT81, NT90, NT7, NT82, etc. Each of these either breaks down further or is a terminal. For example, NT81 breaks down into NT95 and NT9, and NT9 breaks down into 't10'. Similarly, NT82 directly expands into 't6'.\n\nSo, the overall structure starts with S, which is two non-terminals, NT81 and NT90. Each of these, in turn, breaks down further until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 38 tokens, all of which are these 't' followed by numbers. So, my first observation is that each 't' must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left that produces two non-terminals eventually terminates in terminals. For example, NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and NT9 -> 't10'. NT95 itself breaks down into NT25 and NT60, which eventually become 't15' and 't6', respectively. Wait, but in the string, after t10, we have t6, which doesn't directly follow. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and NT95 -> NT25 NT60. Let's see: NT25 -> NT5 and NT55, and so on. Wait, no\u2014I might need to trace the derivation process more carefully.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the entire string can be divided into the sequence of non-terminals as per the grammar. Each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals except for some terminals.\n\nSo the string should correspond to a series of such steps, starting from S.\n\nLet me note that each step in the derivation adds two non-terminals, but the string is a sequence of terminals. Each step in the grammar expansion takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals, each of which may expand into one or more terminals.\n\nWait, no, each production is two non-terminals, each of which may eventually produce one or more terminals. So the string is a concatenation of the terminal productions from each non-terminal in the right-hand side of the grammar.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string into the grammar. Parsing strategies like the CYK algorithm might be cumbersome here, but maybe I can match the string step by step.\n\nLet's try to break down the string into possible sequences that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5, t1, t33, t15, t6, t6, t10, t6, t13, t15, t16, t35, t7, t15, t16, t5, t15, t6, t15, t24, t0, t0, t16, t15, t15, t10, t3, t0, t10, t14.\n\nWait, that's 38 tokens. Let's list them as positions 0 to 37:\n\n0: t5\n1: t1\n2: t33\n3: t15\n4: t6\n5: t6\n6: t10\n7: t6\n8: t13\n9: t15\n10: t16\n11: t35\n12: t7\n13: t15\n14: t16\n15: t5\n16: t15\n17: t6\n18: t15\n19: t24\n20: t0\n21: t0\n22: t16\n23: t15\n24: t15\n25: t10\n26: t3\n27: t0\n28: t10\n29: t14\n\nI think the best approach is to see if the string can be constructed by expanding S step by step, breaking it down into the necessary non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S -> NT81 NT90. So the string must consist of the concatenation of NT81's terminal outputs and NT90's terminal outputs.\n\nLet's first evaluate NT81.\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9. So NT81 must produce t10 (from NT9) and whatever comes from NT95.\n\nWait, NT95 -> NT25 NT60. Let me see:\n\nNT25 -> NT5 and NT55.\n\nLooking up NT5, I don't see it directly in the grammar, but let me check. The given grammar lists for NT5: I see it's part of NT60: NT60 -> NT98 NT55, and NT25 -> NT5 NT55. Also, NT55 -> NT67 NT37.\n\nLooking up NT5: Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT5 as a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal? Or maybe it's a non-terminal that only appears in other productions. Let me check: in the grammar, NT5 is part of NT60: NT60 -> NT98 NT55. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's:\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT25 -> NT5 NT55\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nWait, wait. So NT55 is a non-terminal, but in the grammar, only NT55 is present. Wait, no, I think NT5 is a non-terminal because it's on the right side of a production: like NT77 -> NT34 NT35, so if NT35 is already a terminal, but looking through the given productions, I don't see NT5 as a non-terminal; it's part of NT25's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at all the non-terminals in the grammar:\n\nNT81, NT90, NT98, NT79, NT37, NT26, NT48, NT69, NT51, NT48, NT25, NT9, NT33, NT15, NT6, NT13, NT16, NT35, NT7, NT82, NT10, NT69, NT78, NT51, NT43, NT25, NT5, NT9, NT13, NT60, NT12, NT69, NT51, NT48, NT23, NT5, NT9, NT13, NT28, NT60, NT43, NT22, NT83, NT90, NT7, NT98, NT76, NT51, NT48, NT29, NT51, NT83, NT95, NT7, NT98, NT7.\n\nWait, I think I missed some in the initial listing.

Wait, the grammar seems extensive.\n\nBut perhaps instead of trying to parse the entire string at once, I should check each position in the string against possible terminals that come from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me start with S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nSo the entire string should be the concatenation of NT81's output and NT90's output.\n\nSo I'll first look at the start of the string: t5 t1 t33...\n\nLet's see what NT81 produces.

My string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols separated by spaces.\n\nThe string is: `t5 t24 t15 t6 t10 t6 t15 t15 t6 t5 t1 t33 t15 t6 t5 t24 t15 t6 t5 t24 t15 t6 t6 t15 t15 t15 t15 t6 t14`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S seems to have two rules:\nS -> NT81 NT90\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n... (and so on for other non-terminals)\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n... and so on until NT26.\n\nEach of these non-terminals eventually breaks down into a combination of terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nBut to parse the entire string, I probably need to use some method like recursive descent parsing, or maybe just try to build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a tree and see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since all the rules in the grammar are of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, except the ones that directly correspond to a terminal, which is A -> 'tN'.\n\nSo each non-terminal eventually must expand down to a series of t's with numbers.\n\nThe string is a series of t's followed by numbers. Each non-terminal in the grammar corresponds to a specific t followed by a number, except some that have more complex rules.\n\nWait, let's see. The grammar has some non-terminals that expand into other non-terminals, like NT74 -> NT31 NT83. So each of these non-terminals must first expand into the next level, and so on, until they hit a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model the string as a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to each production rule.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nThe string is: t5 t24 t15 t6 t10 t6 t15 t15 t6 t5 t1 t33 t15 t6 t5 t24 t15 t6 t5 t24 t15 t6 t6 t15 t15 t15 t15 t6 t14.\n\nThat's 36 tokens. Let's count how many non-terminals are in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals expand into terminals directly, like NT7 -> 't1', NT77 -> 't34', etc. Others expand into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each non-terminal, if it expands into two others, their combined parse tree will form a subtree that matches the production.\n\nSo, the entire string starts with S, which is NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, after parsing S, the string must be split into the parts that each NT81 and NT90 expand into.\n\nBut to do that, each NT81 and NT90 must eventually produce sequences of terminals.\n\nLet's see what NT81 and NT90 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT25 -> NT5\nNT5 -> NT67 NT37\n... Wait, but NT55 -> NT67 NT37, and NT26 -> NT25 NT55.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map out the chain each non-terminal could take to reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT7:\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT51 -> NT48 NT53?\nWait, I see NT51 -> NT26 NT37? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT25 -> NT5, which is directly a terminal. So NT25 can expand to 't5'.\n\nLooking at NT95: NT95 -> NT25 NT60.\n\nSince NT25 -> 't5', and NT60 -> NT98 NT55.\n\nNT98 -> 't31', NT55 -> NT67 NT37.\n\nNT67 -> 't15', NT37 -> NT9 NT82.\n\nNT9 -> 't10', NT82 -> 't6' (since there's a rule NT82 -> 't6' but looking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I think I might have missed some rules. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT25 -> 't5'\n\nWait, yes, that's in the list.\n\nWait, in the initial rules, for example, NT35 -> 't18', etc.\n\nSo, the idea is that each non-terminal eventually leads to a sequence of t's with numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can create a kind of parse tree where each non-terminal in the string eventually leads down to a sequence of t's.\n\nBut parsing a string of 36 tokens with such a grammar could be quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the grammar's ambiguity and see if the string can be generated.\n\nMaybe a bottom-up approach would work, building from the terminals upwards. Since the string consists of terminals, perhaps starting from the end and checking if the string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each production rule is of the form A -> BC, which is a binary tree with two children. So, each non-terminal must produce an even number of tokens in total, if all the non-terminals eventually parse to terminals.\n\nWait, the entire string is 36 tokens, which is even, but each step may have non-terminals that produce further non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to the two symbols after S.\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of what NT81 generates and NT90 generates.\n\nSo, let's check the string as S = part1 + part2, where part1 is what NT81 must generate, and part2 is what NT90 must generate.\n\nBut to find part1 and part2, we need to see if NT81 and NT90 can generate their respective parts.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause NT81 expands as NT95 NT9, and NT90 is in the right-hand side, but looking at the grammar, I see that NT90 is actually not present directly. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, some lines are like 'NT98 -> NT7 NT39', etc.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S -> NT81 NT90.\n\nSo, S can only derive into two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see a production rule for NT90 except being part of S.\n\nSo, S can't derive any other sequences than NT81 and NT90.\n\nTherefore, the string must be:\n\n[NT81 parsed into some substring] + [NT90 parsed into some substring]\n\nNow, let's see.\n\nThe entire string is 36 tokens. Let's split it into two parts.\n\nSuppose part1 is length k, part2 is length 36 -k.\n\nWe need to find if part1 can be generated by NT81 and part2 by NT90.\n\nBut NT81's expansion is NT95 and NT9.\n\nSo, let's look at NT95.\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60.\n\nNT25 -> 't5'\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82.\n\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nNT82 -> 't6' (since in the grammar, some symbols expand directly to 't6', like NT82.\n\nWait, looking back, yes, I see NT82 has a rule NT82 -> 't6'.\n\nSo, tracing NT95:\n\nNT95 -> 't5' (from NT25) and then NT60 which is 't31' followed by NT55 -> 't15' followed by NT37 -> 't10' followed by 't6'?\n\nWait, perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, maybe instead of going through the entire string, which is time-consuming, I can check the string for consistency with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are used to generate strings through a series of production rules. The grammar provided is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a terminal symbol. Wait, actually, Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So looking at the rules, I see all of them are either A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 terminal (like 't3', etc.). So that's correct.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so the grammar needs to derive it starting from the start symbol, which is S. The start symbol S is in the first rule: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string must start with NT81 and NT90.\n\nLet me look at the string. The first three t's are all t6. Wait, no, the first part is t6 t6 t6... Let me parse it correctly. The string is: t6, t6, t6, t6, t16, t15, t31, etc.\n\nWait, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, right? So t6 is one terminal, t16 is another, and so on. So the string is a series of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I can see that each non-terminal (like NT81, NT90, etc.) expands into two non-terminals, except those that expand into a terminal directly. So each step in the derivation will split the string into smaller parts until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven that S starts as NT81 NT90, I need to check if the entire string can be derived from these. Let's see: NT81 produces NT95 NT9, and NT90 also produces NT98 NT10. So from S, the first step would be NT95 NT9 and NT98 NT10.\n\nWait, let me get the rules right. The first rule is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Each non-terminal can be replaced by either a pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo starting from S, the first expansion is two non-terminals: NT81 and NT90. Let's see what NT81 and NT90 produce.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT90 \u2192 NT98 NT10.\n\nSo the first split would give us NT95 NT9 and NT98 NT10. Then each of those needs to be expanded further until they reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT95: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, which again splits. NT25 \u2192 NT5 NT15, so that's another split. NT5 \u2192 NT67 NT37, which splits again. NT67 \u2192 NT69 (wait, no: looking back, NT67 \u2192 't15') no, wait. Let's check the rules again.\n\nWait, NT67 is a non-terminal that produces 't15' directly. So NT67 can be replaced by just t15, which is a terminal, so that's a leaf.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map out the steps.\n\nLet's take the first part of the string: t6, t6, t6, t6, t16, etc. So the first four t6's.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT12 \u2192 't30', NT39 \u2192 't33', NT82 \u2192 't6', so NT82 can produce t6. Similarly, NT79 or... Wait, let me list what produces t6.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (once)\n- NT25 \u2192 't15'\n- NT55 \u2192 't31' (since NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37, and NT67 \u2192 t15, wait, no. Let me see: NT67 \u2192 't15', yes, so NT55 \u2192 t15 t37. But that's splitting, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me find all the non-terminals that produce a 't6'. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t6 (direct production)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, and none of those produce t6 directly? Wait, checking NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT51 NT74. Let me see NT51: NT51 \u2192 NT26 NT37, which would then split into NT26 and NT37, each of which might produce more splits, so maybe NT88 doesn't produce t6.\n\nWait, more methodically:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that directly produce t6:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n- NT86 has multiple rules, but looking at the rules, NT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37, NT25 \u2192 t15, and NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. NT9 is t10, and NT82 is t6. So NT86 would produce t15 and something, so not directly t6.\n\nWait, another direction: NT82 is also in other rules?\n\nWait, let's look at all the rules for t6:\n\n- NT82: 't6'\n\nIs that all? Wait, no: Looking at the rules, let me check all non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT67 \u2192 't15'\n- NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37 \u2192 t15 t37\n- NT48 \u2192 't19'?

So NT86 produces t15 t10 t6.\n\nBut in the string, there are multiple t6's.\n\nHmm, maybe NT82 is the key here since it directly produces t6.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the string step by step, perhaps starting from the beginning.\n\nThe first part of the string is t6, t6, t6, t6. So four t6s.\n\nLooking at NT82 \u2192 't6', so perhaps each t6 comes from NT82. But NT82 also appears in other rules, but the direct production is only one. So each t6 in the string could come from an NT82.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT90 \u2192 NT98 NT10.\n\nLet me see what those produce:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT25 \u2192 NT5 NT15\nNT5 \u2192 NT67 NT37 \u2192 t15 NT37\nWT8: NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82 \u2192 t10 't6'\n\nSo NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 \u2192 (t15 t10 t6) and (t5 maybe?

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all in the form of two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, S starts as S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so each NT... is a non-terminal with a number. Each of these NT... productions breaks down into two other NT... or terminal symbols.\n\nMy plan is to map each 't' in the string to the non-terminals they come from. Since each production is binary (two non-terminals), each t in the string must come from a non-terminal production that results in that t.\n\nI'll start by looking at each t in the string and see which non-terminals can produce it.

Let me check:\n\nWait, the user provided a lot of grammar rules, let me scan them.\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes several NT's with '\u2192 terminals'. For example:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 't6'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT98 \u2192 't31'\n- NT60 \u2192 't5', 't24' (from NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55 and NT60 \u2192 NT58 NT24, but those lead to 't31' and 't58') wait, no. Wait, the user wrote a lot of grammar rules, but perhaps I should list the terminals more clearly.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal symbols are 't1', 't2', ..., 't39' (assuming they are single 't's followed by numbers). The actual 't's in the string are up to 't39', but in the string given, the highest is 't34' and 't14'.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce t6: NT86 \u2192 't6'. So any string generated by the grammar should never have a 't6' as a terminal since NT86 only produces 't6' once. Wait, no, the productions for NT86: looking at the grammar, the user wrote multiple NT86 productions:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT37,\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37,\n\nand NT86 \u2192 't32'.\n\nWait, no, looking back: user provided NT86 multiple times, but for example:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37,\n\nand also another production:\n\nNT86 \u2192 't32'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the user wrote:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT37,\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37,\n\nNT86 \u2192 't32'\n\nAnd also:\n\nLooking through all the grammar:\n\n- NT86 is present as follows:\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT37,\n\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37,\n\nNT86 \u2192 't32'.\n\nSo, NT86 can produce 't32' as a terminal. Also, NT86 can produce two non-terminals.\n\nIn the given string, we have several t6, t16, t5, etc.\n\nBut NT86 is the only non-terminal that can produce t6, because in the grammar, the productions with 't6' are only NT86 \u2192 't6'. So any 't6's in the string have to come from NT86.\n\nBut wait, NT86 can also produce non-terminals: 't32' is a terminal, but 't6' is another option? Or does each NT86 rule produce either two non-terminals or one terminal? Looking at the grammar, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, and some rules allow a non-terminal to derive a terminal. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, some non-terminals derive terminals directly. For example, NT86 \u2192 't32' suggests that that production is A \u2192 terminal, which is allowed in CNF, as long as each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be either terminals or non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be of the form A \u2192 BC, so terminals alone are not allowed. Therefore, the presence of a production like NT86 \u2192 't32' suggests that the grammar is not in CNF, which contradicts the user's initial statement. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar's format.\n\nWait, upon closer inspection, in the user-provided grammar, some lines look like A \u2192 BC, and some look like A \u2192 x, where x is a terminal. This suggests that the grammar is not in Chomsky Normal Form because in CNF, all productions must be A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals. However, in the user's grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal, which is not allowed in CNF, meaning that the grammar is invalid as per CNF rules. That raises a problem because if a grammar is not in CNF, it complicates the analysis since we cannot directly use the standard methods for CNF grammars, like CYK parsing.\n\nBut since the user presented the grammar as being in CNF, perhaps I misread some of the productions. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 \u2192 but also NT7 \u2192 't1', so that's a problem because in CNF, all productions should be non-terminals. Similarly, NT82 \u2192 't6'; that's a terminal, which shouldn't be allowed. Therefore, the grammar as provided is not correctly formulated for CNF, which is a problem because the user stated it's in CNF. Maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps in this context, they allow some productions to have a terminal as the RHS, even though in standard CNF, that's not allowed.\n\nBut for the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that the grammar is correct and that each production is valid, even if a non-terminal can produce a terminal. Or perhaps, in this case, the '\u2192' symbols are just list separators, and each '\u2192' is followed by a single RHS. Let me look again.\n\nActually, looking at the grammar as provided:\n\nEach line is a non-terminal followed by \u2192, then either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, but also NT86 \u2192 't32'. So that suggests that the grammar is not in CNF because in standard CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS.

{"custom_id":"request-593","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It consists of a set of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT98, NT37, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals or sometimes into a terminal symbol (like 't3', 't16', etc.). \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t6 t15 t24 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t3 t15 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10 t14`.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S -> NT81 NT90. So any valid string generated by this grammar must start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, no, actually, S is the start symbol, so the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then each of those can be further expanded. But since S is replaced by two symbols, the string derived from S will be the combination of the two sub-derivations of NT81 and NT90.\n\nSo the start is S, which will produce a string that is a concatenation of two parts: one from NT81 and another from NT90. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of t followed by numbers, like t10, t6, etc. These are terminals. So I need to check if the string can be broken down into two parts, each of which can be the result of expanding NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT90 -> 't14'? Yes, according to the grammar, NT90 -> 't14'. So the last token in the string is t14, which must come from the expansion of NT90. \n\nSo the string is split into two parts: the first part comes from NT81 and the second from NT90. Let me count the tokens:\n\nThe entire string has 33 tokens. So the first 16 tokens (from t10 to t15 t10 t6 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10) would come from NT81, and the last 17 tokens (t14?) Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, actually, NT81 and NT90 each expand into a certain number of terms. Each production is a binary tree, so the number of terminals in the expansion corresponds to the depth of the parse tree.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is two symbols. So the entire string can be represented as a sequence derived from the top-down expansion of S. Each step in the derivation appends two symbols. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string must be equal to the number of expansion steps, but I'm a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, for a CFG in CNF, the length of the string must be equal to the number of productions, but I might be mixing concepts. Alternatively, the number of symbols in the string must be one more than the number of production steps because each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nWait, but considering the start symbol S produces NT81 NT90, which is two symbols. Then each of those can produce two more, leading to four, and so on. So the total number of symbols would be a power of two, but in this case, the string has 33 symbols, which isn't a power of two, so perhaps that's an issue. 33 is an odd number of symbols, but S starts with two, so unless some non-terminals produce two non-terminals, but in this case, all are terminals, so the total number of symbols should be 2^k, but 33 isn't. So maybe that's a red flag. But wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal, so perhaps the number of symbols can vary.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S as two symbols, each step in the derivation could increase or keep the same number of symbols depending on how the non-terminals are expanded. For example, if both NT81 and NT90 expand into one terminal, the total would be 2. If one produces two non-terminals and the other a terminal, then it would be 3. If both produce two non-terminals, it would be 4, etc. So the number of symbols can vary, but I'm not sure if there's a pattern. However, if a non-terminal produces a terminal, it reduces the number of symbols.\n\nWait, no. If a non-terminal X \u2192 AB, where A and B are non-terminals, then the count increases by 1 (since one non-terminal becomes two). If X \u2192 a, then it's two symbols (the non-terminal and the terminal?), no, wait, in a production like X \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, the count remains the same (since X is one symbol and a is one symbol, but X is replaced by a, so the total number of symbols remains 1, actually). Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should approach it by trying to parse the given string backward, seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string: looking at the exact string, it's t10 t6 t15 t24 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t3 t15 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10 t14.\n\nSo there are 33 tokens, each being t followed by a number.\n\nI'll try to break this down from the end, seeing if the terminal t14 can come from NT90, which has one production to 't14', so that's the base. So the last part is 't14' \u2192 NT90.\n\nSo the string can be divided into two parts: the prefix up to 't15 t14' and the suffix 't14'. Wait, perhaps I should look for how the string can be split based on the productions.\n\nBut let's see: the string ends with 't14', which is NT90, so the entire string is the expansion of NT90 plus one more part? No, wait, because NT90 is only one terminal. So the last token is 't14', which comes from NT90.\n\nSo the string is t10 t6 t15 t24 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t3 t15 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t10 followed by t14.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack from the end.\n\nThe entire string must be generated by S \u2192 NT81 NT90, so the string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT81 and NT90.\n\nWe know that NT90 \u2192 t14. So the entire string is the expansion of NT81 followed by t14. But t14 is derived from NT90, so the entire string must be the expansion of NT81 followed by t14. So the length is len(NT81_expansion) + 1.\n\nBut len(NT81_expansion) is variable. Let's try to see what NT81 can expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find the production for NT81. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't immediately see NT81 as a non-terminal. Wait, looking again: the productions involve various NT terms, but does NT81 have a production?\n\nLooking through the list: I see NT82 \u2192 't3', etc., but I don't see NT81 in the non-terminals' productions except perhaps within another non-terminal? Wait, looking at the list, I see NT81 as part of other productions:\n\nWait, for example, NT82 \u2192 't3', NT87 \u2192 something else, etc. But wait, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT81 being defined as a non-terminal with any production, except perhaps in the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-592","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and we need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, first I should understand the structure of the grammar and see how it can derive strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal symbol on the left side of the arrows produces two other non-terminals on the right side. That makes sense because Chomsky Normal Form requires productions to have two non-terminals on the right. Some rules, though, have a terminal on the right side, like NT7 -> 't1'. So those are the base cases where a non-terminal directly turns into a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is a series of terminal symbols separated by spaces: `t15 t1 t33 t15 t10 t6 t10 t5 t34 t5 t6 t3 t34 t23 t30 t34 t33 t15 t10 t0 t0 t15 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t20 t7 t15 t6 t14`. Let me count the parts\u2014there are 38 symbols here. I wonder if that helps at all.\n\nFirst, I should list out the production rules to get a better picture. Each production is of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for some that produce terminals. So, for each non-terminal NT, I can track where it leads.\n\nLet me start by looking at all the production rules and see if I can map out a possible derivation path.\n\nFor example, S starts as S -> NT81 NT90. So the top-level derivation starts with NT81 and NT90. Each of these will eventually produce terminal symbols, and their combination should form our target string.\n\nBut wait, this seems complex because the grammar is quite large, with many non-terminals and terminals. I need a systematic way to approach this. Maybe I should start from the start symbol S and try to see if I can reach the target string.\n\nBut considering the number of non-terminals and the possible combinations, it might be more efficient to work backwards from the given string and see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nAnother approach could be to build a parse tree for the string, ensuring that each part of the string can be generated by the grammar. Let me try that.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production step generates a new token, and the maximum length of a string is 2^k, where k is the number of productions. But with a string of 38 tokens, I can't compute that here, but maybe it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar. Let me pick the first few tokens and see how they fit.\n\nThe string starts with t15, t1, t33, etc. Let's look at the rules that produce t15. Looking through the productions, I see NT67 -> 't15' and NT31 -> 't35', but also NT75? Wait, no. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking for t15:\n\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- Also, NT31 -> 't35', which isn't directly helpful, but NT75? Wait, no, I don't see that.\n\nWait, the productions provided include:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT55 -> 't15'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT88 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't20' [Wait, is this rule? Or is there another one.]\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of rules that produce each terminal symbol. That could help identify possible nodes in the parse tree.\n\nLet me go through each terminal symbol and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking for 't15':\n- NT67 produces 't15'\n\n' t1 ': NT7\n\n' t33 ': NT39\n\n' t10 ': NT9\n\n' t6 ': NT82\n\n' t5 ': NT25\n\nLooking at the string, the beginning is:\n\nt15 t1 t33 t15 t10 t6 t10 t5 t34 t5 t6 t3 t34 t23 t30 t34 t33 t15 t10 t0 t0 t15 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t20 t7 t15 t6 t14\n\nBreaking it down token by token and seeing where they can come from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process the string step by step from left to right, checking if each token can be matched by applying a production rule.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation adds one token. So the number of steps in the derivation corresponds to the length of the string minus 1, because the initial non-terminals expand one by one.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols, so the derivation of a string of length n requires (n-1) steps because each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, effectively doubling the length each time until we reach a terminal. But wait, that's for a single non-terminal. Here, the initial S splits into two symbols, and each of those can split further until terminals are reached.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. But that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAnother thought: I can create a bottom-up parsing approach, trying to reduce the string to S by applying inverse productions.\n\nLet me list all the production rules again and see if any terminal appears in the right-hand sides.\n\nHere's the full list:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37\n\nNT31 -> NT86 NT28\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\n\nNT82 -> NT95 NT13\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37\n\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\n\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nNT20 -> 't16'\n\nNT98 -> 't31'\n\nNT67 -> 't15'\n\nNT12 -> 't35'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT77 -> 't34'\n\nNT35 -> 't18'\n\nNT95 -> 't13'\n\nNT55 -> 't31'\n\nNT95 -> 't0'\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\n\nNT25 -> 't5'\n\nNT86 -> 't32'\n\nNT39 -> 't33'\n\nNT88 -> 't7'\n\nNT9 -> 't10'\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\n\nNT43 -> 't20'\n\nNT13 -> 't15'\n\nNT60 -> 't5'\n\nNT48 -> 't23'\n\nNT25 -> 't5'\n\nNT9 -> 't6'\n\nNT43 -> 't1'\n\nNT13 -> 't0'\n\nNT28 -> 't34'\n\nNT60 -> 't5'\n\nNT48 -> 't29'\n\nNT51 -> 't22'\n\nNT83 -> 't23'\n\nNT90 -> 't14'\n\nNT7 -> 't20'\n\nNT98 -> 't24'\n\nWait, I notice a couple of things: NT82 has two different productions leading to 't3' and 't6', but I see some other options too?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, except for the start symbol S which produces two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Let's look at the production rules:\n\n- S -> NT81 NT90\n- Each rule has a left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal and a right-hand side (RHS) consisting of two non-terminals.\n- Some of these non-terminals, like NT25, NT37, etc., eventually produce terminals (t followed by numbers). For example, NT7 -> 't1', NT3 -> 't3', etc.\n\nOur goal is to parse the given string and see if it can be derived from S. The string is: `t10 t6 t3 t16 t5 t15 t10 t3 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t15 t10 t15 t31 t15 t6 t10 t6 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t0 t10 t14`.\n\nI'll start by working backwards from S. Since S produces NT81 and NT90, the string must start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81, according to the rules:\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nAnd NT9 is a terminal, but wait, no: NT9 appears as -> 't10' because looking at the rules, there's NT9 -> 't10'. So NT9 is 't10'.\n\nSo NT81 expands to NT95 followed by 't10'. Now, NT95 expands as per the grammar:\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nAnd looking further:\nNT25 -> 't5' (from NT25 -> 't5'?) Wait, let me check the rules again. The rules are written with '->' but some seem to have multiple options. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the rules provided, for NT31 -> NT86 NT28; then NT86 in another rule is NT25 NT88. Hmmm, this might get a bit tangled. It's going to take some time.\n\nWait, the rules are a bit jumbled because they have multiple lines for the same non-terminals. For example, NT86 appears in two places:\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nand\nNT86 -> NT25 NT37.\n\nSimilarly, NT37 has two productions:\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\nand\nNT37 -> NT12 NT77.\n\nThis suggests that some non-terminals have multiple production rules, hence they're ambiguous. The parsing might involve considering each possible option.\n\nGiven the string, the first part is 't10 t6 t3 ...'. Let's see:\n\nIf S expands into NT81 NT90, then NT81 is first, followed by NT90.\n\nFrom the rules, NT81 -> NT95 NT9, which is 't10' as NT9 is 't10'.\n\nWait, NT9 should be a terminal, as per the rule. So NT81 expands to NT95 followed by 't10'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't10 t6 ...' which suggests that after 't10', we have 't6'. So the second part must be 't6', which comes from somewhere in the NT95 expansion.\n\nBut wait, 't6' is a terminal. Who expands into 't6'? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, NT10 has 't10' (I think NT10 is the non-terminal, but wait, the rules don't list NT10. Let me check:\n\nIn the rules list, I see NT9 -> 't10', not NT10. Wait, that's confusing. Let me scan the rules:\n\nLooking at the end of the rules:\n\nNT43 -> 't35'\nNT25 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't1' (but this is a different production)\nNT13 -> 't15', etc.\n\nSo, looking for terminals in the string. 't10' comes from NT9, which is in the NT81 production.\n\nAfter that, the next element is 't6', which is a terminal from the rule NT82 -> 't6'. So somewhere downstream, after NT95 comes NT82 to get 't6'.\n\nLooking at NT95's rules:\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nor\nNT95 -> NT15 NT17 (wait, no). Wait, I need to check the rules again:\n\nWait, I see:\nNT95 in the rules has two productions:\n- NT95 -> NT37' something, but I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the rules are presented with each line as a production.

{"custom_id":"request-610","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is a bit complex, with a bunch of production rules, and the string I need to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for certain parsing algorithms and can simplify the analysis of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and from S, we derive NT81 NT90. Each of these NT symbols leads to other productions, which eventually expand into terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. So, the string I'm given is a sequence of these 't' tokens, each representing a terminal in the grammar.\n\nMy goal is to see if the entire string can be derived starting from S by expanding the non-terminals until I get a sequence of terminals exactly matching the given string. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a single terminal or combines two non-terminals. This means that the derivation tree for the string will have a specific structure, perhaps resembling a binary tree, where each step expands two non-terminals into the next level until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe string given is: `t10 t10 t15 t31 t15 t10 t0 t15 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t5 t31 t31 t15 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t10 t0 t0 t0 t6 t14`.\n\nIt's quite a long string, 41 tokens in total. To approach this, I should probably start by tracing back from the start symbol S to see how the string could be built up.\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be part of NT81, and the second part should be part of NT90. Let me check the string:\n\nThe first token is 't10'. Looking at the grammar, NT81 can produce 't10' through the rule NT81 \u2192 't10'. So, that fits. But wait, I should remember that NT81 might have other productions, so this is one possible terminal.\n\nThe next token is 't10' again. So, after NT81, we have another 't10'. Looking at NT81's productions, it has only one production: NT81 \u2192 't10'. So, this is straightforward.\n\nThen, the third token is 't15'. Let's see where 't15' comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 't16', NT60 \u2192 't24', NT25 \u2192 't5', NT25 \u2192 't15' (wait, no: looking at NT25, the production is NT25 \u2192 NT53 NT92? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, according to the grammar provided, NT25 has these productions:\nNT25 \u2192 NT48 NT69\nWait, no, let me list them step by step.

Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should make a list of all NT symbols and their possible terminal productions.\n\nLet me scan each NT rule to see which ones produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (so NT7 can produce 't1')\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT74 \u2192 't7' (Wait, no, NT88 \u2192 't7')\n- Wait, let me go through each NT rule and note when they can reach a terminal.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' \u2192 always gives 't1', so any chain leading to NT7 will produce 't1'.\n- NT86 \u2192 't32' (Wait, no: NT86 has multiple productions. Looking:\n\nNT86 \u2192 't32', but also other rules that produce more non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-623","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF has production rules where each non-terminal (A) generates exactly two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but in some sources, it's specifically two non-terminals. Wait, I think in the strictest sense, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But sometimes, CNF allows for productions of the form A \u2192 B a, which is similar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Each rule starts with S and has two NT followed by numbers. So, each production in this grammar seems to split the left-hand side into two non-terminals on the right. That fits the CNF structure since each production has exactly two non-terminals.\n\nNext, looking at the string to evaluate: `t10 t6 t10 t15 t5 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t6 t5 t24 t15 t10 t0 t15 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t3 t15 t15 t16 t35 t7 t15 t16 t20 t7 t6 t14`.\n\nEach element here is a terminal symbol, which are 't' followed by numbers. So the string consists of a series of 't's with numbers. Now, the grammar's rules map these 't's to specific non-terminals. For example, the production NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35. Then, another production NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74, and so on, until eventually, each rule terminates into a 't' symbol. These terminals are the 't's in the string, each pointing to a specific non-terminal's expansion.\n\nSo, to determine if the string is generated, I think I can parse the string into a tree, following the rules from the top-down approach. Let me consider the structure.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT81 and NT90. So, the string must be decomposed into these two parts. Let's split the string at the first occurrence where NT81 and NT90 would start. Wait, but in the string, all we have are 't's. So perhaps each 't' in the string represents the concatenation of the productions of these non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the sequence of non-terminals that would generate the entire string, starting from S.\n\nEach 't' in the string corresponds to the expansion of a specific non-terminal. For example, each 't10' must come from a production that leads to t10, which then is generated by some NT. Looking at the productions, NT9 \u2192 't10', and NT7 \u2192 't1'. But wait, in the string, I have t10, t6, etc., so perhaps I can build a tree where each 't' corresponds to a specific NT production.\n\nLet me outline the strategy:\n\n1. Check if the string's length is a power of 2. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the length of the generated string must be 2^n where n is the number of productions when expanding the start symbol. Our input string has 40 't's. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 40 isn't a power of 2, which could be a problem. Wait, that might mean the string can't be generated, but I'm not entirely sure because I might be misapplying the rule.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. When a CFG is in CNF, the number of symbols in the sentential form doubles at each step during expansion. So, starting from S, each expansion replaces one symbol with two, so the number of symbols increases but isn't necessarily a power of 2. Hmm, actually, the number of symbols (including non-terminals and terminals) starts at 1 (S), then each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the total number becomes 2, then 3, etc., but I might be getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 't's corresponds to the number of leaves in the parse tree. Each non-terminal production adds one more symbol. So, for a string of length n, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree would be n-1, arranged in levels. So, the number of 't's must correspond to 2^k for some k because each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols? Wait, no, because non-terminals can overlap expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree manually. Let's try.\n\nThe string is: t10 t6 t10 t15 t5 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t6 t5 t24 t15 t10 t0 t15 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t3 t15 t15 t16 t35 t7 t15 t16 t20 t7 t6 t14\n\nSo, 40 t's, all digits after t.\n\nNow, each t is a terminal, which has a specific production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only place a non-terminal directly converts to a terminal is in specific rules. For instance, NT7 \u2192 't1' etc.\n\nSo, each 't' in the string must be matched by replacing from the non-terminals. Therefore, the string is a sequence of these t's, each coming from specific productions.\n\nThe key is to find a sequence of non-terminals that, through their productions, can produce the string when fully expanded.\n\nSince this is a bit complicated, perhaps I can list each t and see which production it comes from.\n\nLet me list some of the productions:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't16'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT43 \u2192 't43' which becomes 't23'?\n\nWait, looking at the productions given:\n\nWait, for NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\n\nAnd NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\n\nWait, but NT43 is in the production, but the rules for NT43 are a bit confusing because in the given grammar, some rules have 't's, like NT77 \u2192 't34', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the rules can be split into two categories: those that split into two non-terminals and those that split into a terminal and a non-terminal. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production should have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Wait, but in the given grammar, some of the productions have a terminal as one element, e.g., NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35; NT77 \u2192 't34' NT83. Wait, that can't be right because in CNF, each production must be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps this grammar is not in strict CNF, but maybe in a form that allows terminals in the right-hand side. Alternatively, maybe it's in Kuroda normal form, which allows for two symbols (might be terminals or non-terminals). But the problem states it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which strictly requires each production to be A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, so that would mean that any rule in the grammar where a terminal isn't the only symbol on the right side is invalid for CNF. So, I need to check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most rules are A \u2192 BB or A \u2192 BB, but some rules have a terminal or a mix, like NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35 is fine (two non-terminals), but then other rules like NT77 \u2192 't34' NT83 is a terminal followed by a non-terminal. That's allowed in weak CNF, but standard CNF doesn't allow terminals on the right side. So, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the grammar may not be in standard CNF but in some extended form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar is in CNF but uses a mix, but more likely, some rules have a mix of terminals and non-terminals on the right side, which wouldn't fit strictly. So perhaps this is not a proper CNF grammar, which complicates matters.\n\nBut regardless, perhaps the approach should proceed regardless of that, attempting to reconstruct the string.\n\nWait, alternatively, the approach might be to model the grammar with a recursive descent parser. Each rule defines the production of a non-terminal, and to parse the string, we can start from the top symbol S and try to match the entire string.\n\nThe string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-625","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to be something like 't3', 't16', etc. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, there are a bunch of non-terminals like S, NT7, NT98, and so on, and many of them directly produce terminal tokens like 't3', 't16', etc. \n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string starts with 't6', ends with 't14', and has several other terms in between. \n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components: t6, t13, t15, t16, t15, t15, t6, t10, t10, t6, t16, t15, t15, t10, t6, t10, t3, t16, t15, t31, t0, t16, t5, t15, t10, t6, t0, t15, t16, t15, t31, t15, t10, t14.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens: 38 tokens. That's a lot. But since it's a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, derivations can be quite long, especially if there are many non-terminals. \n\nI think I'll approach this by first seeing which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35, which then both have productions to terminals or other NTs. Similarly, NT25 \u2192 t15, which is a terminal, so that's an easy one. \n\nI need to see if the string can be generated by starting from S and applying productions step by step. Since the string is long, maybe I can look for patterns or see if each 't' corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by mapping each token to a non-terminal that produces it. For example:\n\n- t6: Looking at the grammar, I see NT43 \u2192 t35, but t6 isn't directly there. Wait, NT69 \u2192 t34, NT51 \u2192 t32, NT82 \u2192 t6. So the non-terminal NT82 produces t6.\n- Similarly, t13: NT95 \u2192 t13, and also NT13 \u2192 t15, but that's another issue.\n- t15: NT98 \u2192 t31, which isn't t15. Wait, NT25 \u2192 t15. So NT25 is t15.\n- t16: NT12 \u2192 t35 (no), but NT7 \u2192 t20. Wait, looking again, NT98 \u2192 t31, but I'm looking for t16. NT86 \u2192 t32, NT31 \u2192 t35, NT98 \u2192 t24. Oh, wait, looking at the grammar, NT79 might not be present. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check each non-terminal.\n\nWait, the list I was provided is a bit long. Let me look for each token:\n\nt6: look for non-terminals that produce t6. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT82 \u2192 t6.\n\nt13: Looking for NT productions that produce t13. \n\nLooking through, I see NT95 \u2192 t13. So NT95 produces t13.\n\nt15: Looking for NT that produce t15. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT25 \u2192 t15. So NT25 is t15.\n\nt16: Looking for NT that produce t16. \n\nLooking through, NT7 \u2192 t20 (no), NT98 \u2192 t31 (no), NT86 \u2192 t32 (no), NT20 \u2192 t16. Oh yes, NT20 \u2192 t16. So NT20 is t16.\n\nt10: Looking for NT that produce t10. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT9 \u2192 t10. So NT9 is t10.\n\nt3: Looking for NT that produce t3. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT90 \u2192 t14, NT39 \u2192 t33, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82, which then leads to terminals. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Alternatively, looking at the grammar, does any NT produce 't3'? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, I see NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82. But neither of those are terminals. So perhaps I need to see if t3 is produced directly by any NT.

Let me scan through:\n\nLooking through, I see NT74 \u2192 t31, NT31 \u2192 t35, NT74 \u2192 t31, which is another NT. Hmm. Wait, also, looking at NT90: No. Looking at NT69 \u2192 t34, NT51 \u2192 t32. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, no. Looking at the grammar, the rule starting with NT82 is given. For example, NT82 can produce t6, t3, etc. Let me see:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6' and also 't3'.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT82 -> 't7'\n\nWait, more accurately, looking at the grammar, under NT82, there's a production: NT82 \u2192 't6' (I think the lines with '->' followed by a single token are direct productions). Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, each line is a production. For NT82, the lines are:\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\n\nand\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nand\n\nNT82 -> 't3'\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread.

Each non-terminal seems to produce two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Then each NT leads to two other NTs or terminals. For example, NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39, and NT39 is a terminal 't33', and similarly others.\n\nThe string I'm given is a sequence of t terms and numbers. Each t is a terminal symbol, like 't1', 't10', etc., and the numbers are also terminals. Since it's a terminal string, the derivation needs to reduce the entire string without any non-terminals left at the end.\n\nI think I need to simulate a top-down or bottom-up parsing approach, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Another way is to check each production rule's corresponding terminals.\n\nLet me list each production rule as a production map with each NT and what it produces:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\nNT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\nNT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88\nNT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74\nNT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\nNT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\nNT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88\nNT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT86 \u2192 NT25 NT37\nNT31 \u2192 NT86 NT28\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\nNT82 \u2192 NT95 NT13\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT35\nNT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\nNT20 \u2192 't16'\nNT98 \u2192 't31'\nNT67 \u2192 't15'\nNT12 \u2192 't30'\nNT31 \u2192 't35'\nNT7 \u2192 't1'\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\nNT35 \u2192 't18'\nNT95 \u2192 't13'\nNT55 \u2192 't31'\nNT95 \u2192 't0' (Wait, there's a duplicate for NT95 here. It appears twice, once as NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 and then later as NT95 \u2192 't13' and 't0'. Maybe I need to correct that. It should probably be one production: either another non-terminal or a terminal. So perhaps it's a typo. Looking again, it's written twice: NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, then NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 again. Wait, but the user wrote it twice. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the user wrote:\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\nNT55 -> NT67 NT35\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT82 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't16'\nNT98 -> 't31'\nNT67 -> 't15'\nNT12 -> 't30'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT77 -> 't34'\nNT35 -> 't18'\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60\nNT55 -> NT67 NT35\nNT26 -> NT25 NT55\nNT7 -> NT48 NT35\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\nNT39 -> 't33'\nNT88 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't10'\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't20'\nNT13 -> 't15'\nNT60 -> 't24'\nNT12 -> 't35'\nNT69 -> 't34'\nNT51 -> 't32'\nNT48 -> 't23'\nNT25 -> 't5'\nNT9 -> 't6'\nNT43 -> 't1'\nNT13 -> 't0'\nNT28 -> 't34'\nNT60 -> 't5'\nNT48 -> 't29'\nNT51 -> 't22'\nNT83 -> 't23'\nNT90 -> 't14'\nNT7 -> 't20'\nNT98 -> 't24'\n\nWait, I see that NT95 appears three times: once as NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, once as NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, and also later again possibly.

It's likely that one of the entries is a mistake. Let me look carefully.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice the NT95 production line is present twice:\n\nNC95 -> NT25 NT60\nNC95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nThen again when checking other lines, I see NC95 -> NT25 NT60 is written a third time. That's strange. Probably, it's a typo, and one of them is incorrect. But ignoring that, perhaps it's either a single production rule that has two different branches or a mistake.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving the problem, I think each NT has exactly one production, except for terminals, which are also included.\n\nNext, I need to parse the given string into tokens, each being a terminal symbol ('t' followed by a number).

{"custom_id":"request-641","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. That makes it easier to parse or to simulate the derivation process.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string I need to evaluate: `t6 t10 t10 t6 t16 t5 t15 t10 t6 t3 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t5 t24 t0 t16 t15 t31 t0 t0 t15 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t3 t10 t14`. I notice that it's a sequence of tokens, each presumably corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the production for S is NT81 NT90. So the string must start with the terminal symbols generated by NT81 and NT90. \n\nNow, I should check what each NT rule produces. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n- NT90 -> NT25 NT37\n\nSo, NT81 produces NT95 and NT9. Let's check what NT95 and NT9 produce.\n\nNT95 has two rules:\n1. NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n2. NT95 -> NT55 NT37\n\nWait, but each production must be applied step by step. So in the case of NT95, it can choose either of these two options. Similarly, NT9 is a terminal? Let's check the grammar. No, in the initial rules, NT9 is a non-terminal because it's on the left side of ->. Looking at the rest of the grammar, I see that NT9 -> 't10', so it's a terminal. So NT9 is 't10'. Similarly, NT81 is 't6' because NT81 -> NT95 NT9, and if NT95 is expanded, but wait, let me look again. Wait, in my initial analysis, I thought NT81 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT81 -> NT95 NT9\n\nSo NT81 is composed of NT95 and NT9, which are non-terminals. Then, looking further, NT95 can produce either NT25 NT60 or NT55 NT37. Similarly, NT9 is 't10'. So let's track the derivation.\n\nStarting with S: NT81 NT90\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9\nNT90 -> NT25 NT37\n\nSo the string starts with the sequence corresponding to NT95, NT9, NT25, NT37.\n\nNow, let's see what each of these produce:\n\n- NT95: 't13' if NT95 -> NT55 NT37 and then NT55 -> NT67 NT37. Wait, no, that's getting too deep. Maybe I should map each non-terminal to its corresponding terminal token.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping from each NT symbol to its terminal value. Let's list them out:\n\nI'll go through each line and note the productions that lead to terminals.\n\n- NT7 -> 't1' (from NT77 and NT74)\n- NT77 -> 't34' (from NT77)\n- NT74 -> 't31' (from NT74)\n- NT7 -> 't1' (also mentioned elsewhere, maybe a duplicate)\nWait, I need to make sure I'm consistent. Maybe I should list all non-terminals and their terminals.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT7: sometimes leads to 't1' (NT7 -> NT48 NT35 and NT43 NT20 NT13 NT7). Hmm, but in the grammar, NT7 is defined as NT48 NT35 in one line and NT43 NT20 NT7 in another? Wait, actually, checking:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> NT78\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the numbers. Let me list each NT symbol and their productions, then note which ones produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each NT and see which rules produce terminals.\n\nLooking one by one:\n\n1. NT79: Not sure, as the numbers don't match. Wait, wait, the grammar seems to have multiple lines, each line being a rule for an NT. So I need to list all NTs and their rules correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the grammar lines are not properly numbered. The initial statement shows a grammar with lines like S->NT81 NT90, NT98->... etc. So each line is a production for a particular non-terminal, with the left-hand side being the NT, and the right-hand side being the symbols it produces.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT77 -> NT34\n- NT74 -> NT31\n- NT7 -> NT1 (I see multiple lines for NT7, but probably, it's a typo. Wait, looking more carefully, in the grammar, there are lines like NT7 -> NT48 NT35 and NT7 -> NT35 NT18. Also, NT7 -> NT43 NT20 NT13 NT7? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, no, it's more like each line is a separate production. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> NT48 NT35\n- NT77 -> NT34\n- NT74 -> NT31\n- NT7 -> NT43 NT20 NT13 NT7?

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except for the start symbol which can have one terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules on the left side seem to have two non-terminals except for the ones that produce terminals like 't1' to 't39' and some 't's. Wait, actually, most non-terminals produce two others, except the ones that produce terminals, like S. S -> NT81 NT90, which are non-terminals, so S isn't directly producing a terminal. Then, the other rules are all like NTx -> NTy NTz. So the top-level derivation starts from S, which branches into NT81 and NT90.\n\nNow, I need to check if the given string matches the language defined by this grammar. The string is: `t10 t3 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t5 t24 t15 t10 t3 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t10 t15 t31 t31 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t15 t24 t15 t6 t3 t15 t15 t15 t10 t14`.\n\nI think the approach should be to parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if we can derive the string by expanding non-terminals. Since this is a CNF grammar, the leftmost derivation would proceed by expanding the leftmost non-terminal at each step.\n\nSo, let's start with S. According to the grammar, S -> NT81 NT90. So the first two symbols should be the expansions of NT81 and NT90. Looking at the string, the first two symbols are t10 and t3. Wait, but NT81 and NT90 should expand into something starting with terminals. Wait, maybe I should check what NT81 and NT90 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT81 -> NT95 NT9. So NT81 expands into NT95 and NT9. Then NT9 -> t10, which is a terminal. So the first symbol in the string should come from NT9, which is t10. Then the next symbol would come from NT95. Let's see what NT95 produces.\n\nNT95 -> NT25 NT60. NT25 -> t15, so the next symbol is t15? Wait, but in the string, after t10 comes t3. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I got the order wrong. NT81 is NT95 and NT9. So the first symbol from NT9 is t10, then NT95 should produce something else. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, NT95 -> NT25 NT60. NT25 -> t15, and NT60 -> NT98 NT55. NT98 is t31, and NT55 -> NT67 NT37, which are t67->t15 and NT37->t1? Or wait, let me see the productions for NT55.\n\nNT55 -> NT67 NT37. NT67 -> t15, and NT37 -> NT12 NT77. NT12 is t35, and NT77 is t34. So NT55 would produce 't15 t35 t34'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you expand NT55, it's two steps: NT67 which is t15, and NT37 which is NT12 NT77. NT12 is t35, and NT77 is t34. So NT37 would produce t35 and t34. So combining, NT55 would produce t15, t35, t34. But since it's a leftmost expansion, we have to consider the order. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce the given string. Alternatively, perhaps I can reverse the approach and see if each part of the string can be matched by expanding the non-terminals correctly.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the fact that in CNF, each rule has exactly two non-terminals except the ones that produce terminals. So to generate a string, each production must correspond to a sequence of terminals that can be generated by expanding each step correctly.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of terminals. Let's list them out:\n\nThe string is: t10, t3, t16, t15, t15, t6, t6, t5, t24, t15, t10, t3, t0, t16, t5, t15, t6, t10, t15, t31, t31, t15, t16, t15, t15, t10, t15, t24, t15, t6, t3, t15, t15, t15, t10, t14.\n\nThat's 41 symbols. Now, let me see how the grammar can produce this.\n\nStarting with S, which splits into NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81: NT81 -> NT95 NT9.\n\nNT9 is t10, so the first symbol is t10.\n\nThen NT95: NT95 -> NT25 NT60.\n\nNT25 -> t15.\n\nThen NT60: NT60 -> NT98 NT55.\n\nNT98 is t31, NT55 -> NT67 NT37.\n\nNT67 -> t15, NT37 -> NT12 NT77.\n\nNT12 -> t35, NT77 -> t34.\n\nSo NT60 would produce t31, t15, t35, t34.\n\nWait, but NT95 is NT25 NT60, which would be t15 and the expansion of NT60.\n\nSo the next after t15 (from NT25) would come the expansion of NT60, which is t31, t15, t35, t34.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, after t10 comes t3, then t16, etc. This doesn't align. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong because NT81's NT9 is t10, but the second symbol in the string is t3, which doesn't match. That suggests that maybe my parse is incorrect. Or perhaps I made a mistake in expanding.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine the rules. Let me check NT81 and NT90.\n\nWait, NT81 is NT95 NT9, so NT81 is split into two parts. The string starts with t10, which would come from NT9, correct. Then the next part comes from NT95, which is NT25 NT60.\n\nFrom NT25 -> t15, and NT60 -> NT98 NT55. NT98 is t31, NT55 is NT67 NT37. So after t15, the next part would be t31, followed by NT67 (t15), NT37 which is t35 and t34.\n\nSo the expansion so far would be t10, t15, t31, t15, t35, t34, ... but the string after t10 is t3, which is different. That suggests a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another path. Wait, maybe NT81 could produce more branches. Let me consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe my parsing order is incorrect. Let's think about the entire string and see if there's a way to match it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the production that directly corresponds to each part of the string.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first part is t10, which comes from NT9. Then after that, the next is t3, which could be NT3.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing NT3 in the grammar. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me check NT3. Is there a production for NT3?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT3 except perhaps in some production, but it seems that NT3 is not present. So perhaps that's an error. Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the given grammar has rules like NT7->t1, etc. But I don't see NT3 in any of the productions. So the production NT13 ->t15, but that's for NT13.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, but I can't assume that. So perhaps the string isn't correct because NT3 isn't present.

{"custom_id":"request-653","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see a bunch of NT entries mapping to combinations of other NTs or terminals like 't' followed by numbers. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of t's and numbers: `t10 t13 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t6 t10 t15 t20 t33 t15 t10 t6 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t0 t15 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t5 t24 t15 t10 t6 t0 t15 t10 t14`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of multiple tokens. Each token is either a 't' followed by a number or just a number. The grammar rules only have non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right. So each tX must correspond to some production rule ending with that terminal.\n\nLet me think about how the grammar might produce such a string. Each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals, and eventually, those non-terminals must expand to terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if each production can lead to the correct sequence.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each tX as a result of a production, so I can map each tX to its corresponding production rule. For example, t10 is produced by NT9, according to the rule NT9 \u2192 NT59 NT10, but wait, looking back at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't10'. So NT9 expands directly to t10. Similarly, t13 comes from NT13 \u2192 't13', and so on.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar rules more carefully, I see that some terminals are mapped directly. For example, NT9 \u2192 't10', NT7 \u2192 't1', NT16 is 't16' from NT20, and so on. So the idea is that each non-terminal can either expand to two non-terminals or produce a single terminal.\n\nGiven this, the string is a series of these terminals. To generate such a string, the parser would start with the start symbol S and apply production rules until only terminals remain, matching the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t10, which comes from NT9. Then t13 comes from NT13. Next is t0, which comes from NT9. Hmm, but NT9 is already used. Wait, maybe each non-terminal can be used multiple times.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string can be viewed as a series of expansions from the NTs down to the terminals. Since it's a context-free grammar, the string must be a leftmost derivation, where each step replaces a non-terminal with its two productions, ultimately leading to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check each production for the terminals in the string. Since the grammar is C\u00b0NF, each production of a non-terminal is a two-symbol production (two non-terminals or a terminal). So the string must have length 2^n, where n is the number of splits. But the given string's length is 39 tokens, which is 2^5 + something, so maybe not directly applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how each part of the string matches the grammar.\n\nLet's list the string as a sequence of t and numbers: t10, t13, t0, t16, t5, t15, t6, t6, t10, t15, t20, t33, t15, t10, t6, t15, t16, t5, t15, t6, t0, t15, t0, t16, t5, t15, t6, t5, t24, t15, t10, t6, t0, t15, t10, t14.\n\nSo the number of tokens is 39. Each production in the grammar creates two symbols. So the derivation tree must have a certain structure. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parse tree. Let's see how to construct the parse tree.\n\nThe start symbol is S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S expands into NT81 and NT90. Each of those must then expand further.\n\nLet's take the first token, t10. From NT9 \u2192 t10. So that's a leaf node.\n\nBut looking back, NT9 appears in several places. Let me note the relevant rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't10'\n\nAlso, NT9 is used in other productions. For example, NT26 \u2192 NT43 NT88, and so on. I might need to track where each non-terminal produces the given terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that correspond to S's expansion into NT81 and NT90, each of which must generate their respective parts of the string.\n\nLet me try to see if the first token t10 comes from NT9, which is part of NT81's production or somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking at the NT81 entry: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So if the first symbol is t10, then that would correspond to NT9 being 't10' and the other part as NT95.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t10, so perhaps NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then NT9 \u2192 t10, and NT95 would need to produce some other sequence. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is generated by one expansion. Let me try to see step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n2. Each of these non-terminals must expand into the respective parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, starting with t10, suppose that comes from NT9. So NT81 would need to expand into something that ends with t10, but perhaps that's more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built in a way where each tX corresponds to a specific NT rule. Let me create a mapping:\n\nEach tX corresponds to a specific NT:\n\n- t10: NT9\n- t13: NT13\n- t0: NT9\n- t16: NT20 (as NT20 \u2192 't16')\n- t5: NT25 (as NT25 \u2192 't5')\n- t15: NT60 or NT31 or others?\n\nWait, looking at the NT rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't16'\nNT25 \u2192 't5'\nNT15 is in NT55 (NT55 \u2192 't15')\nWait, maybe I should list all the NTs and their corresponding tX's.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't10'\n- NT13 \u2192 't13'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT16 is 't16' from NT20\n- NT30 from NT12? Wait no: NT12 is mapped to 't30'\nWait, perhaps each NT directly maps to a tX. Let me check:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT77 \u2192 't34'\n- NT74 \u2192 't33' (because NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, but look for tX in NT74's rule: No, in the given rules, NT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83. Wait, perhaps none of its rules end with a terminal. So how is 't33' produced? Looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't15'\n- NT51 \u2192 't32'\n- NT43 \u2192 't23' Wait, wait, looking again: The rules from the grammar:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see that several Nts produce a 't' and a number.

The grammar is provided along with the string, and I have to decide if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. The response should just be 'Yes' or 'No.'\n\nFirst, I should understand how Chomsky normal form works. From what I remember, in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This helps in structuring the grammar in a way that each production either breaks a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF. All production rules either start with a non-terminal (NT) on the left and have either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So, each non-terminal can branch into two others or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t6 t10 t6 t6 t6 t13 t15 t16 t1 t7 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t3 t16 t35 t7 t0 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t0 t0 t15 t16 t20 t7 t0 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me think about how the parsing works. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string can be viewed as a binary tree where each internal node is a non-terminal and the leaves are terminals. So, the string must split into parts according to the productions.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of tokens for clarity:\n\nt6, t10, t6, t6, t6, t13, t15, t16, t1, t7, t15, t16, t15, t15, t6, 6, t3, t16, t35, t7, t0, t15, t16, t5, t15, t6, t0, t0, t15, t16, t20, t7, t0, t16, t35, t7, t6, t14.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the string is:\n\nt6 t10 t6 t6 t6 t13 t15 t16 t1 t7 t15 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t3 t16 t35 t7 t0 t15 t16 t5 t15 t6 t0 t0 t15 t16 t20 t7 t0 t16 t35 t7 t6 t14.\n\nI need to see if this can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S produces NT81 NT90. So, the first step is that S must produce NT81 and NT90, which in turn can produce the parts of the string.\n\nSo the first two symbols of the string should match the productions from NT81 and NT90, or vice versa since each can split into two.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe first token is t6. Let's check which NTs produce t6.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' (but not t6)\nNT77 \u2192 't34'\nNT74 \u2192 't31', 't83'\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83, which produces 't31' and 't83'\n\nWait, but I'm looking for terminals. So, let me see which non-terminals have rules that produce t6.\n\nLooking through the productions for terminals:\n\nLooking for 't6' as a production:\n\nFrom the productions list:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT25 NT55\n- NT86 \u2192 NT51 NT88 (but 51 is NP25 and 88 is t7)\n- NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT28 (wait, no, that's a recursive production: NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT28, which is actually a left recursion. Oh, but in CNF, it's okay to have left recursion, but to handle it in parsers, it's often converted to right recursion. So perhaps in this case, the grammar allows for NT28 to be reduced, but for our analysis, we can consider NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT28 as an epsilon production, but wait, no, in CNF, epsilon productions are only allowed for the start symbol. So, perhaps NT28 is in a cycle. Hmm, that could complicate things.\n\nWait, but the production NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT28 is a left recursion and would need to be converted to right recursion for parsing, but perhaps the problem doesn't require that since the initial grammar is in CNF. So, in CNF, left recursions are not allowed; the productions must be in a form where left side has a single non-terminal and the right side has two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, no left recursion. Therefore, any production like NT28 \u2192 NT60 NT28 would not be allowed in CNF.

{"custom_id":"request-675","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite large, with all non-terminals splitting into two terminals or non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of t followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production is either a two-symbol production (two non-terminals) or a terminal. This structure is useful because it allows for efficient parsing, like the CYK algorithm, but I might not need that here.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT81 NT90, which is two non-terminals. Then NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT90, which breaks down further, and so on. Some non-terminals are directly tied to terminals like t1, t2, etc., or more complex ones that eventually resolve to multiple t and numbers.\n\nThe string to check is: `t6 t10 t5 t5 t0 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t13 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t15 t34 t35 t23 t18 t33 t15 t10 t3 t15 t16 t5 t31 t15 t15 t6 t14`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but actually, in CNF, every production must expand into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, a production like NT7 \u2192 't1' is two symbols: 't1' is the terminal, but actually, in CNF, each production should produce two symbols. Wait, no, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, when A \u2192 a, it's a single terminal symbol, and when A \u2192 BC, it's two non-terminals. Thus, each production's right-hand side can have one or two symbols, but when it's two, they are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm confusing something. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production must be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where BC are non-terminals. So the right-hand side is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the terminals are in singleton productions. So, for example, NT7 \u2192 't1' is allowed because it's a single terminal. Similarly, NT7 could also be in a production with another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the given grammar, I see some non-terminals like NT7 appearing in productions like NT7 \u2192 't1'. So that's a production that produces a terminal. It's allowed because it's of the form A \u2192 a. So, the grammar is a mix of single terminal productions and two non-terminal productions.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each of these is a terminal symbol. So the string is composed of all terminal symbols. Thus, to generate this string from S, every production in the derivation should eventually expand into these terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every non-terminal on the left-hand side must expand into exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. Each step of the derivation would split the non-terminals into smaller units until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar and the string, it's going to be challenging to trace the entire derivation. However, maybe I can approach this by checking each non-terminal and seeing if it can derive any of the terminal sequences present in the string.\n\nLet me consider the string and break it down. The first term is 't6'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't6'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't10', NT7 \u2192 't1', and so on. Let's scan through all the non-terminals to find those that directly output 't6', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each non-terminal to the terminals they can produce. So I'll list each non-terminal and the terminals they can produce or if they\u2019re terminals themselves.\n\nLet me start by listing each non-terminal and what they produce:\n\n- S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n- NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT99?

But also, NT98 can produce 't31' directly.

{"custom_id":"request-687","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, a single non-terminal, or a pair of non-terminals. That should make things a bit easier because I can try using a top-down parsing approach or maybe build a parse tree.\n\nFirst, let me recall that each production in the grammar is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B, C are non-terminals or terminals. My string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like t15, t24, etc. The grammar seems to define how these terms can be combined through the non-terminals.\n\nI should probably start by looking at the top-level production. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string should start with NT81 and end with NT90. Let me check the given string: the first word is t15, and the last word is t14. Wait, that might be a problem because S should expand to NT81 and NT90, meaning their replacements should start the string and end it correctly.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first part is t15, which I think comes from NT81 or NT95 or another non-terminal that eventually leads to t15. Wait, let me go step by step.\n\nWait, no. S expands to NT81 and NT90, each of which are non-terminals. So each of these should expand into a sequence of t's according to the rules.\n\nSo the string given is a concatenation of several 't' tokens. Each 't' represents a terminal in the grammar. My job is to see if this sequence can be produced by S.\n\nI think the best way is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. But since I'm just thinking, maybe I can try to parse it manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree would help. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the entire string is built from the start symbol S. So the root of the parse tree would be S, which produces NT81 and NT90. Each of these will branch into their components.\n\nLet's start by considering NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at NT81: I see in the production rules, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nSo that would mean NT81 expands to NT95 followed by NT9.\n\nLooking at NT95: It has multiple productions, like NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, etc. But also, NT95 \u2192 t13. So it can directly produce t13.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 has a production NT9 \u2192 t10.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t15 t24 t15 t10 t6 t13 t0 t16 t15 t15 t10 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t10 t6 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t15 t31 t0 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t0 t15 t6 t14.\n\nWait, let's see: the first expansion is S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nSo NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nAs I thought, NT95 can be t13 or expand further. In this case, to get t15, maybe NT95 can expand into NT35 and NT18. Wait, NT95 has a production NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, but that's not a terminal yet. So that would lead to more expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up all the non-terminals and see which paths they can take.\n\nStarting with NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT95 can be:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT13 (Wait, no: looking back, I don't see NT95 \u2192 NT13. Let me check the given rules again.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, yes: looking at NT95, I see NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, NT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, and also NT95 \u2192 NT13. Is that right? Wait, I should verify each rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT95: NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT25 -> something, NT60 -> something like NT98 or NT24.\n\nWait, the rule you provided includes:\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT95 -> NT0?

Let me check:\n\n- Yes, in the given rules, NT95 -> t0 is present. But wait, also, is there another production for NT95?\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nand\n\nNT95 -> t0.\n\nAlso, I remember the problem statement: \"NT95 -> t0\" seems in the rules as well. So NT95 can either expand into t0 or into further non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at NT9: NT9 -> t10.\n\nSo the first production of NT81 is NT95 followed by NT9. So starting with t15, I need to see if NT95 can produce something that starts with t15.\n\nWait, the first token is t15, so let me think about what NT95 can produce. If NT95 can expand into a sequence that starts with t15, but I see that NT95's primary terminal is t0 and the others are in longer productions. Wait, perhaps there's a path where NT95 expands to a non-terminal that leads to t15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-688","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's see. I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5, where A and B and C are non-terminals, a is a terminal, and S is the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, every rule seems to be either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side. So it's properly in CNF, which is good because standard parsing methods like the CYK algorithm can be used.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t6 t6 t6 t3 t16 t15 t31 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t5 t20 t33 t15 t10 t10 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t3 t16 t5 t15 t6 t3 t0 t15 t15 t0 t16 t1 t7 t10 t14.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists entirely of terminal symbols. Each symbol like t6, t16, etc., is a terminal\u2014so that's consistent with the grammar, where non-terminals only produce terminals or other non-terminals, which then get expanded down.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can think about how the string can be broken down into a parse tree of non-terminals. Each production in the grammar represents a split of the string into two parts. The length of the string can give a hint. For a string of length n, the number of steps required is roughly log2(n) if we consider each step splits into two.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string. It looks like there are 41 tokens (each 't' followed by a number is a single token). Wait, no\u2014the string is written with spaces separating each token, so each token is an individual string like 't6', etc. So the total number of tokens is 41, which is 41 symbols.\n\nIn CNF, each non-terminal production either splits into two non-terminals or produces a single terminal. So the maximum length of a string derived from a non-terminal A is 2^n, where n is the number of splits. So to reach 41 symbols, let's see what n would be. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 41 is between 32 and 64, so the derivation would require at least 6 steps.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need to get into that. Instead, I can try to build the parse tree from the leaves up. Alternatively, I can check each production to see if the string is a valid derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in unary languages, if the grammar only has a single non-terminal, but here there are multiple non-terminals. But that might not be the case.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which expands to NT81 and NT90. So the string starts with 't6' which comes from some expansion.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NT81 and NT90.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nSo the string must start with NT81 and end with NT90, but wait, looking at the string, the first token is 't6', which is a terminal. So the first step is to see if 't6' can be derived from NT81 or from NT90.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Then NT95 and NT9.\n\nLooking for possible productions:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nSo let's see what each of these expands to.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nNT98 is 't31' or derived further. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the grammar has some productions where the non-terminals expand into terminals or other non-terminals. For example, NT98 \u2192 't31' in some productions?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the grammar includes several productions. For example, looking at NT98: there's a rule NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39. Then NT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35. NT48 \u2192 NT69 NT74, and so on. This can get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the given string, let's map each 'ti' to see what non-terminal it comes from.\n\nLooking at the first three 't6's. So 't6' is in the string four times, but in the string, the first 't6' is the first token.\n\nLooking for where 't6' comes from. Let's look at the grammar rules where a terminal is on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6' \u2192 NT67 NT37\nBut in the given rules, NT67 is a non-terminal, so that wouldn't produce 't6' unless it's directly connected.\n\nWait, some of the productions have terminals on the right. For example:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6'\n\nYes, the rule NT82 \u2192 't6' exists.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT67 \u2192 't15'\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-700","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the target string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT98, etc.) and terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't1', 't2', and so on. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nThe grammar is given in a flat format, so I'll list out the main productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT81 NT90\n\nThen all other productions are for non-terminals leading to combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT82 directly produces 't3' and some others produce 't1', 't5', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \nt10 t5 t31 t15 t6 t6 t6 t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t0 t16 t20 t7 t0 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t3 t16 t35 t7 t0 t10 t14\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. Let me split it into individual tokens for clarity:\n1. t10\n2. t5\n3. t31\n4. t15\n5. t6\n6. t6\n7. t6\n8. t6\n9. t15\n10. t5\n11. t0\n12. t16\n13. t15\n14. t15\n15. t15\n16. t6\n17. t3\n18. t15\n19. t16\n20. t15\n21. t15\n22. t15\n23. t10\n24. t6\n25. t0\n26. t16\n27. t20\n28. t7\n29. t0\n30. t0\n31. t16\n32. t15\n33. t15\n34. t6\n35. t10\n36. t3\n37. t16\n38. t35\n39. t7\n40. t0\n41. t10\n42. t14\n\nThat's 42 tokens. Now, I'll start by looking at the start symbol S. S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the string must start with a production of NT81 producing something and NT90 producing something else. Wait, the grammar seems to have some non-terminals that produce terminals directly, but I need to check if the initial two tokens can come from NT81 and NT90.\n\nLooking at the terminals, let's see what NT81 and NT90 produce. From the grammar:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\nNT90 \u2192 NT58 \u2192 Wait, looking back: actually, the grammar lists NT90 \u2192 't14'. Hmm, wait, looking through the grammar, NT90 directly produces 't14', so that's a terminal.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nFrom the given grammar, there's an entry: NT90 -> 't14'. So S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So S would produce NT81's production and NT90's production. Since NT90 directly is 't14', the last token of the string is 't14', so the last part must correspond to NT90.\n\nSo the string should end with the NT90 part, which is 't14'. That matches the last token. So that's good.\n\nNow, we need to see if the start symbol S can generate the entire string. Let me try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and breaking it down into non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut this could be complex since it's a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, which typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. All productions are either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo the parsing strategy could be to start from the entire string and see if it can reduce down to S, using the productions in reverse.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a parse tree, starting from S and expanding it into the strings. But with 42 tokens, that's a lot to handle manually.\n\nAnother approach is to look for sequences that correspond to the terminals in the string and see if they can match any productions. Let's see what the first two tokens are: t10 and t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t10 and t5 must come from some non-terminals. For example, t10 comes from NT90 (since S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and NT90 produces 't14'). Wait, no, in this case, the string starts with t10. So perhaps the initial productions are different.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: S \u2192 NT81 NT90. So the first production of S will generate two parts: the first part from NT81 and the second part from NT90. So the entire string must be a concatenation of a string from NT81 and a string from NT90.\n\nSince the last token is 't14', that must come from NT90, as NT90 \u2192 't14'. So the last part is fixed.\n\nThus, the string must be: [tokens from NT81] + 't14'\n\nSo the first part of the string (before 't14') should be derivable from NT81.\n\nLet me look at the string up to the second last token (since the last is 't14'):\n\nt10 t5 t31 t15 t6 t6 t6 t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t0 t16 t20 t7 t0 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t3 t16 t35 t7 t0 t10\n\nWait, that's 41 tokens, but the total string is 42, with the last being 't14'. So the first part is 41 tokens, ending with 't10' (the 41st) before 't14' (42nd). Hmm, perhaps I need to consider the token before the last two: let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt10 t5 t31 t15 t6 t6 t6 t6 t15 t5 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t3 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t0 t16 t20 t7 t0 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t3 t16 t35 t7 t0 t10 t14\n\nWait, that's from 1 to 42. So positions 1-41 are the first part (from NT81), and position 42 is 't14' (from NT90). So the first part is 41 tokens.\n\nBut that's a lot. Let me see what the possible paths are.\n\nNT81's production is NT95 NT9 (S \u2192 NT81 NT90: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9). So NT81 is NT95 and NT9. Let's look at NT9's production.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT9 \u2192 't6'. So if NT9 produces 't6', then in the beginning of the first part, after NT9, we have 't6'. But the first token is 't10', so that doesn't fit. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so if we split S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 't6', then the first part would be 't6' (from NT9) followed by whatever NT95 produces. But the first token in the string is 't10', not 't6'. So that's a conflict. So if NT81 produces NT95 NT9, and NT9 is 't6', then the first token should be 't6', but it's 't10' instead. Therefore, this suggests that the first production path might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check NT81's production again. From the grammar provided, the lines are:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar list, there's a line: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My task is to parse the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Both NT81 and NT90 must expand to sequences that result in the string.\n\nLet me note the terminals in the string: t6, t10, t15, t16, t0, t3, t24, etc. I need to see how these correspond to the productions.\n\nStarting with NT81 and NT90:\n\n1. NT81 --> NT95 NT9 (from the grammar)\n   NT95 has productions:\n   - NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60\n     NT25 \u2192 t15 (from NT25 \u2192 t15)\n     NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55\n       NT98 is a terminal 't31'\n       NT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37\n         NT67 is 't15'\n         NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82\n           NT9 \u2192 't10'\n           NT82 can be 't6', 't13', 't37', 't39', etc.\n\nSo from NT81:\nt95 \u2192 t15 and then NT60 \u2192 t31 (since NT98 is t31)\nWait, no, NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55, and NT98 is 't6' in one of the rules? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT98 has multiple productions, one is NT98 \u2192 't31' and others.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT98 \u2192 't31' is one option, but also other options. Hmm, perhaps I need to trace each step.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for NT98, one of its productions is NT98 \u2192 't31', but others include NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39, etc. So when NT98 appears, it can choose to be a terminal or continue expanding.\n\nSo let's process the initial S \u2192 NT81 NT90.\n\nFirst, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nNT25 \u2192 t15 (from the production NT25 \u2192 t15).\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nNow, NT98 can be either 't31' or further expanded. Let's see the string starts with t6. But NT98 can be 't31', which is another terminal, but in the string, the first token is t6. Hmmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9, and let's see what NT95 and NT9 expand to.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nAs above, NT25 is t15.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nAgain, NT98 could be 't31' or continue.\n\nBut the string's first token is t6, which doesn't match 't31', so does that mean NT98 must expand to 't6' somewhere? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me check NT60. NT60 can also be NT98 NT55 or NT55 is another option? Or wait, looking back, NT95 can go to t25 or other? No, NT95 is split into NT25 and NT60, each of which may have further productions.\n\nWait, maybe NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, and each of those can produce terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo let's consider:\n\nNT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60.\n\nNT25 \u2192 t15.\n\nNT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55.\n\nNT98 \u2192 't31' or further expansions.\n\nBut in the string, the first element is t6, which isn't t31.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path for NT81.\n\nWait, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nWhat about NT9? From the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't10', which is a terminal.\n\nSo NT81 breaks down to t15 (from NT25) and then NT60, which is NT98 and NT55.\n\nSo far, we have t15, and then NT98 and NT55.\n\nIf NT98 \u2192 't31', then NT55 is another non-terminal.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT67 NT37.\n\nBoth NT67 and NT37 are non-terminals. From the grammar:\n\nNT67 \u2192 't15' (from NT67 \u2192 't15').\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82.\n\nNT9 is 't10'.\n\nNT82 can be 't6', 't13', 't37', 't39', or others. Looking at the string, it starts with t6, so maybe NT82 is 't6'.\n\nSo from NT37 \u2192 NT9 ('t10') and NT82 ('t6'), so that part becomes t10 t6.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nFrom NT81:\n\nt15 (from NT25) + t31 (from NT98) + 't15' (from NT67) + 't10 t6' (from NT37).\n\nWait, but looking at the actual string, the beginning is t6 t6 t6 t10... So this approach may not align. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider both NT81 and NT90 producing parts that map correctly to the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6 t6 t6. So let's see: maybe NT81 and NT90 each expand to a 't6' segment.\n\nLooking at NT81's possible expansions:\n\nFrom NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nNT95 can be 't25' or expand further.\n\nBut let's see what's needed to produce a 't6'. Maybe NT81 can be further expanded. Let me check NT95 again.\n\nWait, no, NT95 is NT25 NT60, which gives t15 and then NT98 NT55.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps both NT81 and NT90 involve different paths that together make up the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to build the string from the start step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t6, so let me see if either NT81 or NT90 can produce a t6.\n\nLooking at NT81's production: NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9.\n\nEach of these can produce terminals or further non-terminals. The first part is NT95, which is NT25 NT60.\n\nNT25 is 't15', so that part would start with t15, but the string starts with t6. So perhaps this branch is not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider another production for NT81. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT81: it only has one production, which is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So that's the only way to get NT81.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part of the derivation must start with NT95 NT9.\n\nSince the string starts with t6, maybe the 't6' comes from NT9 in some other way, but NT9 is 't10' or something else?\n\nWait, let me check the production of NT9.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT9 is 't10'. So NT9 cannot produce a 't6', which is at the start of the string.\n\nThis suggests that maybe my initial analysis is wrong, or perhaps the grammar can only produce the string if certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing another production. Let me recheck the grammar. Oh, wait, NT9 \u2192 't10' is one of the productions, but are there others? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT9: only NT9 \u2192 't10'. So it can't produce 't6'.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t6, but in the grammar, there's no way for NT95 or any other sub-grammar to produce t6. So perhaps the entire string isn't in the language, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something in the NT81 expansion.\n\nWait, the expansion of NT81 is only possible as NT95 NT9, which starts with NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60 \u2192 t15 (from NT25"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-711","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar first.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except possibly the start symbol when it produces terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t6 t6 t6 t5 t1 t33 t15 t6 t10 t3 t16 t5 t31 t15 t0 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t15 t15 t6 t10 t10 t0 t15 t16 t20 t7 t15 t16 t15 t31 t15 t6 t14.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT81 and NT90. So, the string should derive from S via S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Let's see if the overall structure fits.\n\nLooking at the grammar symbols, there are a lot of NT followed by numbers. Each of these seems to be non-terminals that eventually produce a single terminal symbol, based on the rules. For example, NT81 is defined as NT95 NT9, and each of those continues until we get to terminal t's.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to parse the given string from the start and try to match it with the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step according to the productions.\n\nLet me try to break down the string sequentially.\n\n1. The string starts with 't6 t6 t6 t5 t1 t33...'. Let's see what could produce this.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT81 and NT90. So the first two parts should be the expansions of NT81 and NT90. Let's check NT81 and NT90 productions.\n\nNT81's production is NT95 NT9. So the first part should be NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. Let's see what NT95 and NT9 produce.\n\nNT95 is defined as NT25 NT60 in one production, and also has another production NT37 NT18. Wait, let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking back, NT95: NT37 NT18 and NT25 NT60.\n\nWait, no, let me check again because sometimes the productions can have multiple options. So NT95 can be NT37 NT18 or NT25 NT60.\n\nSimilarly, NT9's production is NT7 and 't10'. So NT9 \u2192 NT7 t10. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, let me check if NT9 has any production.\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules include NT9 \u2192 't10', right? No, wait, let me look:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT9, it's actually defined as... Wait, let me list the grammar rules provided:\n\nWait, the grammar is quite long. Let me look for NT9. Scanning through the rules:\n\nNT95 has two productions: NT37 NT18 and NT25 NT60.\n\nNT9: Not explicitly listed as a production from NT9, but looking at it, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again. Oh, I see at the bottom of the grammar, there's NT9 \u2192 't10' ? No, looking:\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT81 NT90, and then a list of NT rules. Each NT is defined as producing other NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n- NT9 is not directly a terminal, but in the rules, I see for example NT7 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking through all the rules, I see that some NT symbols produce terminals, like NT82 \u2192 't3', NT20 \u2192 't16', and so on. So, each NT rule either produces two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, for NT9, I don't see it having two NT productions. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT48 NT35\nNT82 \u2192 't3'\n...\nLooking through them, I think NT9's production is not explicitly given as one of the main rules.

{"custom_id":"request-722","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. Since it's CNF, the string should be parsed in a way that each step either breaks down a non-terminal into two symbols (terminals or non-terminals).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t10 t10 t6 t3 t16 t1 t7 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t6 t13 t0 t16 t20 t7 t0 t15 t16 t5 t31 t15 t16 t5 t15 t10 t10 t10 t6 t16 t1 t7 t0 t16 t15 t31 t0 t6 t14`.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals like NT98, NT37, etc., are defined recursively, and some eventually produce terminals like 'tX' or other non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by drawing the parse tree. Since the string starts with 't6', I'll look at the grammar to find which non-terminals can directly produce 't6'. Looking through the productions, the rule NT39 -> 't33', but that's not 6. Oh wait, in the grammar, NT9 -> 't10', and NT10 might be another. Alternatively, looking for NT9: NT9 -> 't10'. So 't10' comes from NT9.\n\nIn the string, the first 't6' might come from a non-terminal that directly produces 't6'. Looking through the grammar, NT25 -> 't15' (from NT26 production), but wait, no. Let me check each terminal production:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal's production to terminals or other rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT82 -> 't2'\n- NT10 isn't directly a terminal; looking in the grammar, I don't see NT10 directly. Wait, I might have misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar is in the form of S -> NT81 NT90, etc. So all non-terminals on the left produce two non-terminals until they reach a terminal or another rule that leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see for example, NT51 -> 't22', NT25 -> 't5', NT43 -> 't35', etc. So 'tX' comes from certain non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with 't6', so I need a production that leads to 't6'. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT77 -> 't34'\n- NT35 -> 't18'\n- NT95 -> 't13'\n- NT55 -> 't31'\n- NT67 -> 't15'\n- NT12 -> 't35'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\nWait, no, I think I'm missing something. Let's go one by one.\n\nLooking for all non-terminals that directly produce a 'tX':\n\nLooking at each line, any non-terminal that's directly converted to a 'tX'.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT82 -> 't6' (Wait, looking at the list, there's NT82 -> 't6' directly. Yes, line says NT82 -> 't6'. So 't6' is directly from NT82.\n\nSo the first token in the string is 't6', which comes from NT82.\n\nSo 't6' is NT82, then we have to break down the production of NT82. Looking at the grammar, NT82's production is given as: Looking through the list, I see NT82 -> 't6' in one rule and NT82 -> 't23' in another. Wait, let me check all NT82 productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT82 has two productions:\n\n1. NT82 -> 't6'\n2. NT82 -> 't18' (Wait, no, in the given grammar, line 10: NT82 -> 't6' and line 15: NT82 -> 't3'? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the lines are:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines (probably each line is a production for a non-terminal):\n\nLooking at all NT82 productions:\n\n- Line 10: NT82 -> 't6'\n- Line 15: NT82 -> 't6' again?

Looking at the grammar provided, I can see that several non-terminals produce terminals directly, like NT7 \u2192 't1', NT98 \u2192 't31', etc. \n\nThe string starts with 't6', so I need to check which non-terminals can directly produce 't6'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT9 \u2192 't6' and NT16 \u2192 't10'? Wait, actually, NT9 \u2192 't6' is not present.

Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at NT9: in the grammar, NT9 is defined as NT12 -> 't3', but I think I'm mixing non-terminals. Let me list the terminals:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1', \nNT43 \u2192 't20', \nNT25 \u2192 't5', \nNT86 \u2192 't32', \nNT39 \u2192 't33', \nNT88 \u2192 't7', \nNT9 \u2192 't10', \nNT82 \u2192 't6', \nNT43 \u2192 't1', \nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, some rules like NT26 \u2192 't25'? Let me look at each production and see which ones directly go to terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't1' (so T7 is a terminal 't1'), \nNT88 \u2192 't7' (so 't7'), \nNT9 \u2192 't10' (so 't10'), \nNT82 \u2192 't6' (I think in the rules, NT88 is 't7', NT9 is 't10', NT82 is 't6' as per the given string starting with 't6').\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, let me check:\n\nNT82 is in the rule NT82 \u2192 't6', right? Because looking at the grammar, NT82 is mentioned as `NT82 -> 't6'`. So NT82 can produce 't6'.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals in the string: 't10', 't16', etc. So for each token in the string, I need to find a non-terminal that can produce that terminal. \n\nThe string is quite long, so I'll have to methodically check each token.\n\nLet me start by checking the first token 't6'. NT82 \u2192 't6', so we can have S \u2192 NT81 NT90. Now, NT81 and NT90 need to produce specific sequences.\n\nLooking at NT81: in the grammar, NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So to get 't10', since NT81 \u2192 't10'? Wait, no, NT9 \u2192 't10' and NT81 is NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9. So NT95 might generate 't9' or a non-terminal that goes to 't9', but from the grammar, I don't see NT95 \u2192 't9' directly. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT37 NT18, and NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82, and NT82 \u2192 't6', which is a terminal. So that would be a route that eventually leads to 't6'. But maybe that's not the right path for the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be broken down by finding the corresponding non-terminals that produce each terminal.\n\nLet me start building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t6 t10 t6 t10 t10 t6 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t5 t31 t0 t16 t5 t15 t6 t6 t10 t0 t15 t16 t35 t7 t0 t16 t5 t15 t10 t13 t0 t15 t0 t16 t20 t7 t10 t14.\n\nThat's 36 tokens. So each token must come from a terminal production. Let's list each token and see which non-terminal can produce them.\n\nt6: NT82\nt10: NT9\nt16: NT20 (since NT20 \u2192 't16'), or wait, looking at NT26 \u2192 't25'? Hmm, no. Let me check the rules for NT20. NT20 \u2192 't16', so yes, t16 comes from NT20.\n\nt10 again: NT9\nt10 again: NT9\nt6 again: NT82\nt16: NT20\nt35: Looking at the rules, NT35 \u2192 't18', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe another NT35. Wait, perhaps NT95 \u2192 't13', but not directly. Maybe via NT95 \u2192 NT25 NT60, then NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55, etc., but that would involve non-terminals and could produce a terminal path. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I think NT55 can produce 't31', which is a terminal, but maybe NT35 is another rule. Let me check:\n\nLooking for terminals under the non-terminals. I see NT31 \u2192 't34' no, wait:\n\nWait the grammar has:\n\nNT74 \u2192 NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT12 NT77\n\nBut NT12 \u2192 't3', and NT77 \u2192 't34', so that would produce 't34' as a terminal from NT77, but maybe I need to check all NT35.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I think NT35 has two rules: NT35 \u2192 NT95 NT18 and NT35 \u2192 NT18.

{"custom_id":"request-774","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break down what I know.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every rule either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into a terminal.\n\nThe target string is: `t10 t6 t6 t6 t16 t15 t15 t6 t6 t3 t16 t5 t15 t6 t13 t15 t15 t15 t16 t15 t15 t10 t15 t34 t22 t7 t34 t23 t30 t34 t33 t15 t10 t5 t1 t33 t15 t10 t6 t0 t0 t0 t16 t1 t7 t6 t14`.\n\nI'll start by looking for any terminal symbols (like t1, t3, etc.) in the string and see if they appear in any production rule. If a production directly produces a terminal, that's straightforward.\n\nLet me list all the rules and see which terminals they produce. The rules seem to directly map non-terminals to terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT82 -> 't6', 't8'\nWait, looking back, I see that NT82 is split into two rules: one to 't6' (from the given list) and another to 't8'?\n\nWait, the given rules are a mix. For example, NT82 has two rules:\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT82 -> 't32'\n\nHmm, so does that mean NT82 can produce either 't6' or 't32'? That might complicate things because some terminals can be produced through different paths.\n\nBut looking through the list, many rules produce a single terminal. Let me check which non-terminals map to 't's:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT82 -> 't6' (and another rule for 't8'? Wait, looking again: Oh, in the provided list, NT82 has two rules, so NT82 can produce either 't6' or 't32'?\n\nWait, no, in the given list, it's written as:\n\nNT82 -> 't6'\nNT82 -> 't32'\n\nSo yes, NT82 has two production rules to two different terminals. That's important because it means in the derivation, NT82 can be replaced either by 't6' or 't32'.\n\nBut wait, in the string, I see `t6 t6 t6 ...`. So if a non-terminal like NT82 can produce 't6' multiple times, that could account for consecutive 't6's in the string.\n\nSimilarly, some other terminals are used once each, so they have to be generated by their respective non-terminals. For example, 't16' must come from a non-terminal that produces 't16'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT98 -> 't16' (from NT98's rule: NT98 -> NT37 NT83, but wait no, wait. Wait, in the given rules: \n\nWait, in the given list, I see:\n\nNT98-> 't31'\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nAfter a lot of rules, I see some that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT9 -> 't10'\n- NT86 -> 't32'\n- NT39 -> 't33'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- Also, looking further:\n\n- NT20 -> 't16'\n- NT98 -> 't31'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT43 -> 't20'\n- NT13 -> 't15'\n- NT60 -> 't24'\n- NT12 -> 't35'\n- NT69 -> 't34'\n- NT51 -> 't32'\n- NT48 -> 't23'\n- NT25 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't6' (Wait, but earlier NT9 was defined as 't10'? No, wait, NT9 is 't10' and another rule for NT9 might be conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parse. Let me redo this step more carefully.\n\nI think I confused some rules earlier. Let's methodically go through each production and note which produce terminals.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT81 -> NT95 NT9 \u2192 producing NT95 and NT9.\n\nNT95's rules: Looking through the list, I see NT95 appears in multiple rules:\n\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60, NT37 NT18, NT25 NT60? Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, the complete list is:\n\nS -> NT81 NT90\n\nNT98 -> NT7 NT39\n\nNT37 -> NT9 NT82\n\nNT26 -> NT43 NT88\n\nNT48 -> NT69 NT74\n\nNT18 -> NT20 NT26\n\nNT74 -> NT31 NT83\n\nNT35 -> NT12 NT77\n\nNT86 -> NT51 NT88\n\nNT95 -> NT37 NT18\n\nWait, the rules listed are a bit lengthy.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each non-terminal and see if they produce any terminals.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals and their productions to see if any directly produce terminals:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT81 NT90\n   NT81 \u2192 NT95 NT9\n   NT90 \u2192 perhaps doesn't directly produce a terminal. Need to check if any of its productions do.\n\n2. NT98 \u2192 NT7 NT39\n3.

NT60 \u2192 NT98 NT55 (another production), but another production is NT60 -> NT86 NT28, and another is NT60-> NT24\nWait, in the provided rules, I see for NT60:\n\nNT60 -> NT98 NT55\nNT60 -> NT86 NT28\nNT60 -> NT24\n\nSo NT60 can produce NT24 as a terminal (t24 is terminal as per some rules... Wait, checking the list:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT24 is a terminal?\n\nWait, in the provided rules, for NT24: I don't see any production that directly maps to a terminal. Did I miss it? Or perhaps I'm looking in the right place.\n\nWait, looking again, in the given rules:\n\nWait, looking for 't*' in the list. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nFrom the given list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (terminal)\n- NT9 \u2192 't10' (terminal)\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (terminal)\n- NT39 \u2192 't33' (terminal)\n- NT74 \u2192 't31' (terminal)\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me iterate through each non-terminal and see if their productions ever reach a terminal.\n\nStarting with the top:\n\nLooking for any 't*' in the productions:\n\n- NT95 -> NT25 NT60\n- NT98 -> NT7 NT39, which ends with NT39, which produces 't33' (terminal).\nSimilarly, NT37 \u2192 NT9 NT82, which is NT9 ('t10') and NT82 ('t6').\n\nSo any non-terminal that eventually leads to NT9 or NT39 would produce 't10' or 't6' respectively.\n\nSimilarly, NT86 has two productions: one to 't32' and one to NT51 NT88. NT88 could lead to other terminals.\n\nBut"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
