Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided to understand how strings are formed. This grammar has non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) that can be rewritten into terminals (t's) or other non-terminals. The goal is to see if \"t6\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, to get a string, we'll expand S into NT56 and NT45. Each of these non-terminals will need to produce a terminal symbol or further break down into other non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nLet me follow the chain of productions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nStarting with NT56:\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nThen NT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNow, NT63 is a terminal (t9) and NT49 is another non-terminal.

Hmm, perhaps I missed something. Let's try another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should track each non-terminal step by step.\n\nLooking again, after NT56 -> NT69 NT44, then NT69 is NT63 NT49. NT63 is t9, so that part is done. NT49 is NT22 NT66. NT22 is NT61 NT7. NT61 is NT18 NT59. NT18 is NT32 (t32). NT59 is NT64 NT17 but NT64 isn't present, so maybe that's a dead end. Alternatively, perhaps NT59 can be reached elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I took an incorrect path. Let me try expanding S again more carefully.\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nFirst, let's expand NT56 and NT45 one by one.\n\nExpanding NT56:\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT63 is t9, so we have t9.

Wait, checking the rules again, perhaps I missed that NT59 is another option.\n\nLooking back, I see NT68 -> NT28 NT26, but not NT59. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if NT59 is present. Looking through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT59: I see NT59 -> NT64 NT17, but I don't see NT64 in the rules. Is that a mistake? Maybe NT59 can be expanded differently. Wait, perhaps I should check if NT64 is present elsewhere or if it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should check lower sections.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all the non-terminals systematically. Let me list all the NTs and their productions:\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards from the string \"t6\" to see if it can be produced.\n\nThe string is just \"t6\". So, we need a production rule that directly produces \"t6\".\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only terminal symbols are t's, and their indices. Let me see if any production directly gives \"t6\".\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT -> t6. I don't see any production NT -> t6. So, unless \"t6\" can be derived through combining two non-terminals that produce t6, but since \"t6\" is a single terminal, it must be produced directly by a single non-terminal. Since I don't see such a production, perhaps it's impossible.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me look through all the production rules to see if any have a terminal t6.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT70 -> t17\nNT30 -> t17\nNT18 -> t32\nNT26 -> t4\nNT26 -> t29\nNT20 -> t6\nSo, yes, NT20 -> t6. So, if we can derive NT20 in one of the branches of S, then the string \"t6\" can be produced.\n\nSo, let's check if either NT56 or NT45 can derive NT20.\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT56 NT45\n\nWe need to see if either NT56 or NT45 can produce NT20, or more accurately, the combination of their expansions can result in t6 somewhere.\n\nWait, actually, since S produces two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45, both need to be expanded into strings, and their concatenation must be \"t6\". So, \"t6\" is a single character, so one of the non-terminals must produce \"t6\" and the other must produce an empty string, which isn't possible because all productions produce at least one terminal or non-terminal. So, that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the non-terminals produces \"t\" followed by another terminal that combines to make the string \"t6\", but that seems unlikely because the grammar only produces single terminals per production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production rule is of the form NT -> NT1 NT2, except for when NT has a terminal. So, \"t6\" can only be produced by a single NT that has a production rule leading directly to \"t6\". But looking at all the rules, none of the NTs directly produce \"t6\". Only NT20 produces \"t6\", as per the rules listed.\n\nTherefore, unless \"t6\" can be generated as part of a larger expansion, it's unlikely. But since \"t6\" is just a single character, we'd need a NT that can produce that, which isn't present. So, it's impossible for the grammar to generate \"t6\".\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the string is \"t6\". So, it's just a single 't' followed by the number 6, but in the grammar, the non-terminals and terminals are only single characters with the number indicating their identity. So, perhaps \"t6\" is supposed to mean the terminal t followed by the terminal 6, but that's two terminals, which wouldn't fit the single rule. But in reality, in a grammar, each production rule produces a string of terminals, so each 't' is a separate terminal. So, \"t6\" as a string must be a concatenation of two terminals: 't' and '6', which would be represented as 't' followed by '6'.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, the terminals are strings of the form 't' followed by a number. For example, NT63 -> 't9' meaning the terminal is 't' concatenated with '9', but that's not the case. Wait, looking at the rules, they use capital letters as NT and lowercase as terminal symbols with numbers. Wait no, looking carefully, the grammar shows:\n\nFor example, NT70 -> 't17', which I think is a terminal symbol 't' followed by '17'? Or is it a terminal 't7' followed by something else? Wait, I'm confused.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, it's written as, for example:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nSo, perhaps 't17' is a single terminal symbol consisting of 't' followed by '17'? Or is it 't' and then '17'? But in typical Chomsky normal form, the grammar is over a single terminal alphabet. So, each terminal is a single character. Therefore, perhaps the way it's written, 't17' is a single terminal symbol. But that doesn't make sense in standard notation. Alternatively, maybe it's 't' as the terminal followed by '17'. But that would be two characters, which complicates things because then S produces a string of two terminals: one 't' and one '17'? But the given string is \"t6\", which is just 't' followed by '6'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The string is \"t6\", which is two characters: 't' and '6'. So, the grammar must have a production that starts with 't' and ends with '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) looks like. CNF requires all productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right side.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit the CNF structure. All the rules start with a capital letter on the left and on the right, except for the terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45 is a non-terminal S producing two non-terminals NT56 and NT45. Similarly, NT70 \u2192 't5' is a terminal, which is one of the rules.\n\nThe string to check is \"t5 t2\". I notice that the string splits into two tokens: 't5' and 't2'. Let's think about how the grammar can produce such a sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to see where 't5' and 't2' come from in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I find NT70 \u2192 't5' and NT2 \u2192 't12', but wait, the string has 't2', not 't12'. Hmm, so maybe 't2' comes from another rule. Let me check the rules again. There's NT26 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 't29', and NT25 \u2192 't10'. Wait, but 't2' isn't directly a terminal here. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps 't2' isn't directly present as a terminal, so it must be generated indirectly through a series of productions. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't2'. Looking at the rules, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like t5, t24, etc. Let me search for all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT34 \u2192 't24'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT59 \u2192 't34'\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT18 \u2192 't27'\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' (Wait, this is a duplicate for NT70)\n- NT26 \u2192 't4', 't29'\n- NT46 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't0' ... Wait, but the string has t2, not t0.\n\nI'm not seeing a rule that directly gives 't2', but maybe through some combination. Let me try to see if 't2' can be produced by a non-terminal. Looking through all the terminal rules, none seem to produce 't2' directly. That might be an issue because the string has 't2', but the grammar might not have a production for it.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me go through all the NTs and check the terminals:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't5', 't7', 't17', 't14', 't30', 't27', etc.\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT59 \u2192 't34'\n- Others: no 't2'.\n\nSo, no non-terminal directly produces 't2'. That suggests that the string 't2' can't be generated by any production in the grammar. Therefore, the string \"t5 t2\" should not be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I can have a longer derivation. Suppose the string is produced through multiple steps. Let me try to see. For example, maybe there's a way to produce something that eventually splits into 't5' and 't2'. Let me see the structure of the grammar.\n\nThe overall start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45, both non-terminals. So S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from the rules), and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (from the rules). So S starts as NT56 (which is NT69 and NT44) and NT45.\n\nLet me try to see if I can derive 't5' and 't2' from this. Wait, S produces NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\nNT46 \u2192 NT4 NT39 (Wait, wait, looking again: Actually, the rule is NT46 \u2192 NT6 NT39, and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a parse tree for the string. The string is two symbols: t5 and t2. So in the parse tree, the root S (non-terminal) must produce two symbols. So S must first derive into two non-terminals that then produce t5 and t2 or two terminals. But wait, S is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so both are non-terminals. But then, the two symbols in the string are each a single terminal, so we need each non-terminal to derive into a terminal. But if any of them cannot derive into the required t5 and t2, then the string is not possible.\n\nBut since for the second part, 't2', there's no production that gives t2 directly, that might be the issue. So let's see: the first symbol in the string is 't5', which is directly produced by NT70, as NT70 \u2192 't5' is a production. So if a NT can derive into 't5', we're okay there.\n\nBut for the second symbol, 't2', we need a non-terminal that can derive into 't2'. If no such non-terminal exists, then 't2' cannot be generated, making the entire string impossible.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Do any non-terminals derive into 't2'? Scanning all the terminal rules:\n\n- No non-terminal seems to derive into 't2'. So this suggests that 't2' cannot be generated. Therefore, the string \"t5 t2\" cannot be generated because 't2' isn't a terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a production where a non-terminal first splits into two, and then one of them produces 't5' and the other produces 't2' through their own steps.

The string is \"t17 t12\". Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It's a CFG where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all productions on the left are single non-terminals on the left side, and the right side is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nNow, I need to see if \"t17 t12\" can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the string has two tokens, t17 and t12, I need to find a way to produce these tokens using non-terminals that can eventually result in these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, terminals are only on the right side of productions, and each production either combines two non-terminals or directly outputs a terminal. So, the process should involve starting from S and breaking it down according to the productions until I get the terminals in the string.\n\nLet's look at the given grammar rules. S is transformed into NT56 and NT45. So, first, I need to see if both NT56 and NT45 can produce \"t17\" and \"t12\" respectively or vice versa, but considering the string is \"t17 t12\", order matters.\n\nWait, no, the string is \"t17 t12\", so maybe I need to check if one non-terminal produces \"t17\" and the other \"t12\". Alternatively, perhaps the non-terminals can be derived to eventually match these.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see if there are any non-terminals that produce \"t17\" or \"t12\".\n\nChecking the rules:\n\nLooking for 't17' in the right-hand side of productions, I see 't17' appearing in NT69 -> NT63 NT46, where NT66 is transformed into 't6'. Wait, perhaps that's not relevant. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, specifically, NT70 \u2192 't17' (rule no. 70), and NT70 also appears in some other productions, like NT69 -> NT63 NT46, perhaps indirectly.\n\nAlso, NT30 \u2192 't17' (rule no. 30). So if any non-terminal can derive to NT70, that would give 't17'. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 't24' (rule no.13), but I'm looking for 't12'. Wait, looking for 't12':\n\nLooking at the rules, NT22 \u2192 't0' (rule 22), NT2 \u2192 't12' (rule 2, which is NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66 \u2192 ... Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the derivation step by step.\n\nThe string has two tokens, so we're looking for a derivation where S becomes two non-terminals that produce \"t17\" and \"t12\" respectively.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45, as per rule 1.\n\nSo, the string would be NT56 \u2192 ... and NT45 \u2192 ...\n\nIf NT56 can produce \"t17\" and NT45 can produce \"t12\", then yes.\n\nSo let's check NT56. Looking at the productions, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (rule 55). Then, NT69 and NT44.\n\nWait, let's trace:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from rule 55)\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46 (from rule 45?)\n\nWait, let me check: NT45, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through, NT45 appears on the left side of some rules. Let me see each rule where NT45 is on the right:\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nRule 45: NT45 \u2192 something? Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me look again.\n\nActually, in the given grammar, NT45 is on the right side in several productions. Let me check each rule starting with NT:\n\nLooking, I find NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 (rule 49), NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39 (rule 48), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all rules where NT45 appears on the left side. Let me go through the given rules:\n\nRule 1: S -> NT56 NT45\n\nSo S produces NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo NT45 is directly in the S's production.

{"custom_id":"request-22","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string \"t33 t14 t37\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side and two on the right, or a single terminal. But looking at the grammar, I notice that some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right, like S -> NT56 NT45. Wait, no, actually in CNF, every production must be of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can sometimes be terminals. But in this case, the start symbol S has two non-terminals, which is fine. However, other rules like NT66 -> NT6 NT36 have two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF, I think. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be a single non-terminal on the left. So, any production that has two or more non-terminals on the right is actually a problem because it's beyond CNF. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, S -> NT56 NT45. So S is a non-terminal, and the right side has two non-terminals. That's okay because in CNF, it's allowed if the rule is A \u2192 BC, which is exactly the case here. Similarly, NT66 -> NT6 NT36 is another B \u2192 BC. So this is correct. I need to make sure that all the rules are in CNF. Let me check a few more. NT25 -> 't10' is a terminal; that's allowed because the base case. Similarly, NT22 -> NT63 NT48 is two non-terminals, which is fine. So, it's a correct CNF grammar.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t33 t14 t37\". So, we have three tokens: t33, t14, t37.\n\nSince the grammar might allow starting with S and producing the entire string, but in this case, the string starts with t33, which is a terminal. So, the derivation must start with a rule that directly produces a terminal, but looking at the grammar, most of the rules are of the form NTX -> NTY NTTZ. So, I need to see if any of these can produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, let me see. The only way to have a terminal in the right-hand side is if a rule directly produces a terminal, like S -> NT56 NT45, but NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals. So, S doesn't directly produce a terminal. Similarly, looking through all the rules, I see some like NT56 -> 't33', which is a terminal. Ah, so NT56 can produce t33. That's good.\n\nSo, let's see. To generate t33 t14 t37, we need each token to be produced by some part of the derivation. Let's consider each token:\n\n1. First token is t33. Look at the rules where a non-terminal produces t33. Checking the grammar, NT56 -> t33.\n\n2. Second token is t14. Looking for a rule that produces t14. Checking the grammar, NT71 -> t14 and NT69 -> t5 (but T5 is not this). Wait, in the list, I see NT71 -> t14.\n\n3. Third token is t37. Looking up, in the grammar, NT48 -> t24, NT47 -> t7, etc. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT48 -> t24, so that's not t37. Looking again, does any rule produce t37? Hmm. Wait, in the list, there's NT28 -> t36, NT25 -> 't10', NT46 -> 't4', NT10 -> 't28', NT70 -> 't17', NT36 -> 't37'? Let me check. Oh, wait, looking through the rules, I see NT36 -> 't37' under NT36. So, yes, NT36 can produce t37.\n\nSo, the string is t33 t14 t37. So, we need to find a derivation where S can expand into these tokens in order.\n\nNow, let's think about how to construct the derivation.\n\nFirst, S is the start symbol. The initial step is S -> NT56 NT45. Because looking at the rules, S only has one expansion: S -> NT56 NT45. So, the first two non-terminals are NT56 and NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 -> t33. That's good because the first token is t33. So, NT56 can directly become t33. Now, the remaining part is NT45. We need to produce t14 and t37. So, let's see what NT45 can produce.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT45, in the grammar, I don't see NT45 in any production except possibly as a right-hand side. Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see NT45 being a left-hand side except in the production NT56 -> 't33' and NT35 -> NT42 NT3, etc. Wait, maybe I got the name wrong. Wait, the start symbol is S, and then S -> NT56 NT45. So, NT45 is a non-terminal that can produce something else. Let me check the rules again. Oh, yes, NT55 -> NT44 NT56, and NT55 also splits into NT44 and NT56. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I can see NT45 appearing in NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, but is that correct? Wait, I think I might have made a mistake because in the given grammar, each production is written as NTxxxx -> NTyyyy NTzzzz. So, let me look for which non-terminals can produce t14 and t37.\n\nWait, NT45 isn't directly producing a terminal in the given rules. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me list all the rules starting with NT:\n\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\nNT2 -> NT48 NT66\nNT1 -> NT63 NT7\nNT54 -> NT6 NT45\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\nNT61 -> NT18 NT59\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31\nNT7 -> NT13 NT36\nNT8 -> NT45 NT5\nNT50 -> NT25 NT8\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT70 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't17'\nNT18 -> 't27'\nNT26 -> 't4' (Wait, in the given grammar, there are multiple rules for NT26. Let me check again.)\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT26 -> 't4' and NT26 -> 't29' as separate productions. Similarly, NT63 -> 't9', etc.\n\nSo, NT26 can produce 't4' and 't29'. Similarly, NT18 -> 't27', etc.\n\nBut in our string, after t33, the next is t14, which is NT71 -> 't14'. But how do we get t14 after t33? Because in the first step, we have S -> NT56 NT45. NT56 becomes t33. So, NT45 needs to produce t14 and t37. So, the question is, can NT45 eventually produce the string t14 t37.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT45 directly produces a terminal. So, let's see if NT45 can expand into other non-terminals that can produce t14 and t37.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the grammar, the rule NT56 -> 't33' is a terminal, and NT45 is only used in the production of S: S -> NT56 NT45. So, NT45 must produce the remaining two tokens: t14 and t37.\n\nBut looking at all the rules where NT45 appears on the left, I don't see any. Wait, checking again: S -> NT56 NT45. So, NT45 can only be derived from other rules. Wait, but the other rules are for NT22, NT61, etc., but not NT45. So, perhaps NT45 is a non-terminal that can't produce any other non-terminals but must be a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string I'm testing.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. CNF is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process and allows for certain algorithms like CYK.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems there are multiple non-terminals, but I notice that the string is a sequence of terminals: 't37', 't13', 't34'. My task is to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the production rule is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part should come from NT56, and the second from NT45. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: the first is 't37', the second is 't13', and the third is 't34'. Wait, but the string is 't37 t13 t34', which is three terminals. However, S \u2192 NT56 NT45 produces two non-terminals, each of which might expand into more non-terminals or terminals. So, the string length should be compatible with the number of steps.\n\nLet me think: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, each NT56 and NT45 need to produce parts of the string. Let's look at the first part: 't37'. Maybe NT56 directly produces 't37'? Let me check the grammar rules. Scanning through, I see NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking for NT56: I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, NT56 \u2192 NT61 NT10, etc. Hmm, none of the NT56 productions directly produce a terminal except maybe through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should build parse trees from the bottom up. Since the string is three terminals, let's see how the grammar could generate three terminals. The initial production S \u2192 NT56 NT45 splits the string into two parts. Let's check if each of these NTs can generate a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, each NT should expand into a sequence of terminals or other non-terminals. Let's see: the first NT56 should generate a string that, when combined with what NT45 generates, forms 't37 t13 t34'. But wait, 't37' is a terminal, so NT56 must produce 't37' followed by something, but the string is 't37 t13 t34'. So maybe NT56 gives 't37' and NT45 gives 't13 t34'? Or the other way around? Or perhaps NT56 and NT45 each produce parts that combine into the string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check the productions. Let's check if there are any NTs that directly produce 't37', 't13', or 't34'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't37' (NT4 \u2192 't37')\n- NT13 \u2192 't24' (but 't13' is another terminal)\n- NT1 \u2192 't24' (again, but 't13' is another terminal)\n\nWait, let me recheck. The terminals are:\n\n- `t37`, `t13`, `t34`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't37' (so NT4 can produce 't37')\n- NT13 \u2192 't24', which isn't helpful\n- NT1 \u2192 't24' as well\n- There's no NT producing 't13' directly, except maybe from another rule.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each terminal:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't37': only NT4 \u2192 't37'.\n\nFor 't13': Is there any NT that produces 't13'? Let me look. Scanning the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't13' except in the production NT1 \u2192 't24', which isn't helpful. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider chain productions.\n\nWait, maybe 't13' is part of a longer chain. Let's see: The string is 't37 t13 t34'. So, first is 't37', then 't13', then 't34'. Let's see if there's a way for NTs to break down into these in order.\n\nWait, the first part of the string is 't37', which could be produced by NT4. So perhaps NT56 \u2192 something that includes NT4. Let's see NT56's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 has the following rules:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT56 \u2192 NT61 NT10\n- (others don't have NT56, so I'll check these)\n\nSo, if NT56 is producing, say, NT61 NT10, then NT61 could produce 't37', but I don't see that. Alternatively, if NT56 produces NT69 NT44, does NT69 or NT44 produce 't37'? Let me check NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, and so on. It's possible but would require more steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT56 produces NT61 NT10, and maybe NT61 can produce 't37' directly? Let me check NT61's productions: looking at the grammar, I don't see NT61 \u2192 't37'. The next one is NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59. So, if NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59, then each of those could produce parts.\n\nFor NT18, production is NT18 \u2192 't27' (wait, no: looking at the rules, NT18 \u2192 't27' isn't there. Let me check NT18: Oh, I see NT18 \u2192 NT27 NT35. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking again, the rules for NT18: I see NT18 \u2192 NT27 NT35. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up rule numbers. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT18: the relevant rule is NT18 \u2192 NT27 NT35.\n\nWait, but then if NT18 is producing two non-terminals, each may need to generate further. But in our string, we have 't37 t13 t34', so maybe the first part is 't37' from NT4, then 't13' from somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't possible. Let me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe the string can be generated by starting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45, then NT56 \u2192 something, and NT45 \u2192 something else. Let's see:\n\nSuppose S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nIf NT56 can produce 't37' and NT45 can produce 't13 t34', then the string would be 't37 t13 t34'. But NT45's productions are:\n\nLooking at NT45's productions. Wait, in the given grammar, do we have any NT45 production? Let me check the first few lines:\n\nThe grammar starts as:\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\nNT2 -> NT48 NT66\nNT1 -> NT63 NT7\nNT54 -> NT6 NT45\n... and more.\n\nWait, I don't see NT45 in the first part, but looking through, I see NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, NT45 is part of NT55's production. So, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nBut then S \u2192 NT56 NT45 can also be represented as S \u2192 NT55, because NT55 can split into NT56 and NT45. Wait, no: the production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, not NT55.\n\nWait, perhaps I can substitute NT56 and NT45 with their own productions. Let me try to build the parse step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a top-down approach, starting with S and trying to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-38","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t3 t13 t13 t27` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammar has rules where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems mostly in CNF, with some exceptions like S \u2192 NT56 NT45 and a few others. But maybe I can work with what I have.\n\nThe target string is `t3 t13 t13 t27`. Each word is a terminal, so I need to trace back the derivations from the top symbol S to see if I can build this string.\n\nLet's look at the grammar rules step by step. Starting with S, the first rule is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. That means S can be split into two parts: NT56 and NT45. Each of these, I assume, are non-terminals that can be further expanded.\n\nSo, the first part is NT56. Looking through the rules, I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Hmm, NT22 is another non-terminal, and it has its own rules. NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, NT70 is a terminal 't17'. Wait, that's a terminal, but our string starts with t3. Maybe I went the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT56 splits differently. Let's see if there are other rules for NT56. Oh, only NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, that's the only way to expand NT56. So, going down that path, we get NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Then, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT66 is a terminal 't6'. So far, we have 't6' from NT49, but we need 't3' at the beginning. So maybe NT63 or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I took a wrong approach. Let me try starting from the beginning and see how t3 could come up. The string starts with t3. Looking through the grammar, do any of the rules generate t3? Let's see. I see NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46 and also NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, and NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36, but none of these directly produce t3. Hmmm.\n\nWait, there's also NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49, NT15 is generated by NT49. Let me check NT49: it's in the rule NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So, NT49 produces 't66'? No, NT66 is a terminal 't6'. Wait, no, wait: NT66 is 't6'? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking back, I see NT66 \u2192 NT6 NT36, and NT6 is 't12' terminal because NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22, and NT1 is a terminal 't24'. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of the terminals:\n\nFrom the rules, terminals are:\nt1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t13, t17, etc.\n\nWait, specifically, looking at the rules, some NT directly produce 't' values. For example:\nNT6 \u2192 't12'\nNT7 \u2192 't13'\nNT8 \u2192 't13'\nNT21 \u2192 't13'\nNT18 \u2192 't32'\nNT13 \u2192 't24'\nNT25 \u2192 't10'\nNT30 \u2192 't17'\nNT46 \u2192 't4'\nNT39 \u2192 't21'\nAnd others produce 't' with numbers as 't27' (that's NT? Well, the string has 't27'. So 't27' must come from some rule that has a terminal with 't27'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\nNT70 is a terminal 't17', but nowhere does a rule generate 't27' directly. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check the provided rules again. Oh, the last line mentions NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT30 \u2192 't17', but nothing produces 't27'. Hmm, but the string has 't27'. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, let's check the rules again. I see NT18 \u2192 't32', which is another 't' but not 27. Then, is there any rule that ends in 't27'? Looking through, I see NT28 \u2192 't36', NT36 \u2192 't25', etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules more carefully. Oh, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT59 \u2192 't34'\n- NT50 \u2192 't3'\nWait, that's t3. So, maybe that's part of the string. Let's see: T3 appears in NT50.\n\nSo, NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8. NT25 \u2192 't10', and NT8 \u2192 't13'. So, NT50 produces 't10' 't13' \u2192 't10t13'. That's 't1013' or 't1013'? Hmm, but the string has 't3' as the first part.\n\nWait, how does NT3 generate t3? Because NT3 appears in several rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\n- NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5\n\nSo, if NT3 is derived, it could potentially lead to a 't' from somewhere. Let's follow one path.\n\nTake NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. NT68 is a terminal 't3', and NT46 is 't4'. So, T3 T4. But in the string, it's T3 T13 T13 T27. That would fit if we take T3 from NT68 and T4 from NT46, but the string continues as T13s and T27. Hmm, perhaps that's a possible first step.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the first part is 't3 t4', but the string starts with 't3 t13 t13 t27'. So that doesn't fit. Maybe another path.\n\nLooking at NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55. If NT3 expands into itself, that could lead to a chain, but we don't want to get stuck in an infinite loop. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5. NT55 is 't4' (from NT55 \u2192 't4').\n\nWait, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. And S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, that gives us the initial S \u2192 NT56 NT45, leading to NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and so on. So, perhaps the string starts with NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, let me try constructing the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT44 is 't3' (from NT44 \u2192 't3'). So that gives us 't3'.\n\nThen, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9' (from NT63 \u2192 't9'), and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 is 't0' (from NT22 \u2192 't0'), and NT66 is 't6' (from NT66 \u2192 't6'). So, after expanding, we have 't9 t0 t6' so far, which doesn't match the string. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm expanding in the wrong order. Let me try a different path.\n\nLet me take S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT44 \u2192 't3'.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 \u2192 't0'.\n\nNT66 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo far, we have 't0 t9 t6', which isn't the string we need.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that makes things a bit more straightforward, I think. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure CFGs where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, I see rules like S -> NT56 NT45, which fits the A \u2192 BC structure, and some rules that end with terminals like NT70 -> 't17'. \n\nThe string to validate is `t6 t0 t2 t20`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nTo approach this, I think I'll work backwards from the string. Each terminal in the string must have been derived from a production that only has terminals on the right side. So, let's start from the rightmost symbol and work our way back up.\n\nBreaking down the string step by step:\n\nThe string is `t6 t0 t2 t20`. So, in terms of symbols, it's t6, t0, t2, t20.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is t20. Checking the grammar, I see that NT20 -> 't6'. So, the last part is t20, which comes from NT20.\n\nNow, moving left, the next symbol is t2. So, the substring we're looking at now is t6 t0 t2. We need to see if this part can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT26 -> 't4', but that doesn't help here. Wait, let me check the relevant rules. For t2, is there a rule that produces 't2'? Let's see, I don't see any NT with a production to 't2'. Hmm, that's confusing. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the t2 could come from a higher non-terminal. Let me check other rules. Looking at NT56 -> 't33' and NT50 -> 't20'. Wait, that might not directly help. Alternatively, maybe t2 is derived from a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t2 comes from a rule that I'm not seeing directly. Let me check the given grammar again for t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT39 -> t21, NT36 -> t25, etc. Wait, perhaps t2 is part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a derivation tree bottom-up. Let's consider the entire string `t6 t0 t2 t20`.\n\nSince each terminal is a leaf in the derivation tree, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLet me try to map this out:\n\nThe string is four terminals: t6, t0, t2, t20.\n\nSo, in terms of structure, it's something like:\n\nX \u2192 ... \u2192 t6 t0 t2 t20\n\nEach of these terminals must have been produced by a series of rules where non-terminals are expanded until we get to terminals.\n\nLet's start from the end.\n\nt20 comes from NT20. So, in the derivation, at some point, there's a NT20 producing t20, and this NT20 must have been part of a larger structure.\n\nThe next symbol to the left is t2. So, we might have something like NT20 -> t4 and another non-terminal that produces t2, but that doesn't line up. Wait, perhaps the t2 is part of the production for another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar for t2. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't2'. So, perhaps t2 comes from another non-terminal through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for sequences of terminals that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be divided into parts that each correspond to a production rule.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. Each rule in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the entire string must correspond to a derivation where each step combines two non-terminals into one, until we get the root symbol S.\n\nBut the string is four terminals, which is even, but each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to get four terminals, the number of non-terminals would be n such that n = (k -1), where k is the number of terminals. Wait, no, for a CFG in CNF, the number of symbols in the string is (2^k), but that might not apply here.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start from the beginning.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45, each of which are non-terminals. So, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nEach of these non-terminals can produce either a terminal or two more non-terminals. So, for the string to be valid, we need to see if the expansion can result in the given string.\n\nBut working forward from S might be complicated because we have layers of non-terminals. An alternative approach is to work backward, from the string, ensuring each terminal is reducible to a non-terminal.\n\nLet's start from the end:\n\nThe last symbol is t20, which comes from NT20.\n\nSo, in the last step, NT20 must have been the replacement, so before that, the string had ... NT20, which became t20. So, prior to that, the string would have been ... NT20, and now it's ... t20.\n\nNow, moving left, the part before that would be t2. So, we have t6, t0, and then the part that leads to t2.\n\nWait, perhaps the t2 comes from NT2. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT2 -> 't2' directly. Instead, looking at the rules, NT2 is defined as:\n\nNT2 -> NT48 NT66\n\nSo, NT2 can't directly produce 't2'. That means that in the derivation, NT2 must expand into other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because if t2 is in the string, and NT2 doesn't produce 't2', then perhaps t2 comes from another non-terminal's expansion. Let me see.\n\nLooking further, I see rules like NT26 -> t4, NT55 -> t20, etc. Wait, perhaps t2 is part of another production that indirectly leads to it. Or perhaps the string isn't possible because the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces 't2'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. Does any non-terminal directly produce 't2'?\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT12 -> something, NT1 -> t24, etc.\n\nWait, here's NT22 in the rules: NT22 -> NT63 NT48. Not helpful. NT19: I don't see any rule NT18 or NT19. Wait, actually, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't2' as a terminal. That might be a problem because the string contains 't2', and if there's no rule for a non-terminal producing 't2', then it's impossible to generate it.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Looking at all the rules, I see NT28 is defined as 't36', NT47 as 't21', etc., but I don't see any rule that produces 't2'. So, if the string contains 't2', and there's no non-terminal that directly produces 't2', then that means the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-46","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string `t36 t37 t3 t24 t14` is generated by the given context-free grammar. It's a bit intimidating, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in context-free grammars, each rule has a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. The process of generating a string would involve starting with the start symbol (which here is S) and applying the production rules until no more non-terminals are left, resulting in a string of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its only production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, the first two symbols in any derived string must be NT56 followed by NT45. Let me write that down: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, the string we're checking starts with `t36`, which is a terminal symbol. So, looking back, how do we get terminals from the grammar? Let's check the production rules for NT56 and NT45 to see if they can derive to `t36` or sequences that might produce the given string.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nSo, NT56 can only produce NT69 and NT44. Neither of these is a terminal, so NT56 must be expanded. Now, NT69's productions are:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nSo, NT69 is non-terminal, so it must be expanded. Now, looking at NT63:\n\nNT63 -> 't9' \n\nWait, hold on, NT63 has a production to 't9', which is a terminal. So, NT63 can produce 't9' directly. But in our target string, we have 't36' as the first symbol. So how does that happen?\n\nLet me check NT63's productions again. Hmm, there might be another path. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me make a tree.\n\nLooking at the string: `t36 t37 t3 t24 t14`.\n\nWait, but according to S's production, the first two symbols should be NT56 and NT45. So the first part is NT56 \u2192 which is 't36' from its production? Wait, no. NT56's production is NT69 NT44. So, NT56 must expand to NT69 and NT44. But in the string, the first symbol is 't36', so NT56 must produce 't36' in some way.\n\nLooking at NT56, its only production is NT69 NT44, which are both non-terminals. So, how would NT56 ever produce a terminal? It seems it wouldn't, unless one of those non-terminals produces a terminal. So, let me check NT69's productions.\n\nNT69 can be NT63 NT49. Are any of these terminals? Hmm, let's see:\n\nLooking for any NT production that eventually ends in a terminal without any non-terminals left.\n\nLooking at NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT3 nt55\n\nWait, that's in NT36's production. Let me try to find a path where NT56 leads to 't36'.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently. Since the string starts with 't36', perhaps there's a non-terminal NT36 that directly produces 't36'. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a rule:\n\nNT36 -> 't36'\n\nYes, here it is: NT36 -> 't36'. So that means NT36 is a production that directly gives 't36'. Great, so how do we get from S to NT36? Let's see.\n\nBut S starts with NT56, which expands to NT69 and NT45. So, to get 't36' as the first symbol in the string, I think NT56 must somehow produce 't36', but looking at NT56's production, it only produces NT69 and NT45. So, wait, unless NT69 or NT45 has a production that starts with 't36' in the derived string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT56's expansion could lead to a NT36. Let me try to see.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nThen, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nThen, NT63 \u2192 't9' (a terminal). Wait, but that's only one symbol. So, if NT63 produces 't9', then NT69 would produce 't9' followed by whatever NT49 becomes. But in our string, after 't36' comes 't37', so maybe I'm looking at the wrong path.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each terminal in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal. Let's try mapping each token in the string to the non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the string: `t36 t37 t3 t24 t14`\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, I need to find if the grammar allows each of these t's to be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at each 't' symbol:\n\n- t36: NT36 -> t36\n- t37: Any non-terminal? Looking through the productions, I see NT28 \u2192 t36, NT10 \u2192 t28, etc. Wait, is there a non-terminal that produces t37?\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't immediately see t37 as a terminal. Let me double-check the rules. Hmm, I don't see any NT directly producing t37 except maybe through a chain. Let me check NT28: NT28 \u2192 t36. So t36 could come from NT28. But our string starts with t36, so maybe NT28 \u2192 t36. But how does NT56 get to NT28?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the string starts with t36, maybe NT56 needs to somehow lead to t36, but looking at the production rules, NT56 only goes to NT69 and NT45. So, unless NT69 or NT45 produce t36, which I don't see, that seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I've missed something in the grammar. Let me check the production rules again for NT69:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 -> t9\n\nNT49 -> t15\n\nSo, NT69 would produce t9 followed by t15, which is 't9 t15'. But the string starts with t36, which is way beyond that. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe the string is built by a certain derivation where non-terminals are expanded multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built in reverse, but that's unlikely. Let me try again.\n\nLet's consider the production sequence starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT69 NT44 NT45\n\nNow, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT44 NT45\n\nThen NT63 \u2192 t9, so now S \u2192 t9 NT49 NT44 NT45\n\nWait, but in the string we have 't36' as the first symbol, not 't9'. So maybe this path isn't correct. Perhaps I need a different route.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting NT56 wrong. Let me see if there's another NT that can produce 't36'. Oh, wait, NT36 directly produces 't36', as I noted. So, maybe I can find a way for NT56 to expand to NT36 somehow.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, if either NT69 or NT44 can produce NT36, then NT56 could eventually produce t36. Let's check:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 \u2192 t9 (from NT63) and NT49 \u2192 t15 (from NT49). So, NT69 produces t9 t15.\n\nBut how do I get 't36' from that? Maybe if NT36 is somewhere deeper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT63 can produce NT53 somehow, but looking through the grammar, I don't see NT36 being produced from any other non-terminal except itself.\n\nWait, perhaps NT22 is involved because I see NT22 -> t0 in one of the rules. Hmm, but that seems irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string doesn't start with t36, but I'm supposed to parse the entire string.\n\nWait, no, the string is `t36 t37 t3 t24 t14`. So the question is, does the grammar generate this string?\n\nLet me try to find each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. But wait, looking at the grammar, most rules look like S -> NT56 NT45, but some have more, like NT68 -> NT28 NT26. Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering\u2014no, wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. But here, some rules have two NTs, others have more letters, which are terminals. Oh, right, in CNF, the right-hand sides must consist of exactly two non-terminals, so any production that has a terminal on the right-hand side isn't in CNF. But looking at the grammar, some rules have terminals like 't5', 't17', etc. So maybe the user presented the grammar in a way that the right-hand sides can have terminals, perhaps because it's not a strict CNF, or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is already simplified, and the rules are just given as is.\n\nAnyway, to check if the string is in the language, I can use the CYK algorithm. Let's see. First, I need to know all the non-terminals that can produce the terminals in the string. The string is `t4 t1 t29 t13 t27 t33`, so the terminals involved are t4, t1, t29, t13, t27, t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list the productions that result in these terminals:\n\nt4: Where do I get t4? Looking at the rules, NT28 -> t36, but wait, t4 is a terminal. Let me find:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT68 -> t3 NT22, which if NT22 is 't27', then NT68 can produce 't3 t27'. But perhaps it's better to find each terminal's possible sources.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to first create a list of which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t1 appears in NT68 -> t3 NT22, and NT22 -> t27.\n- t13: NT21 -> t13 t31, and NT31 -> t4 t50, and NT50 -> t3, etc. Hmm, maybe that's getting too complex. Alternatively, let's try to see which non-terminals can produce each t.\n\nt4: Looking at the rules, I see that NT26 -> t4, so NT26 can produce t4. Also, NT28 -> t36, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, NT26 can produce t4 directly, as per NT26 -> t4.\n\nt1: Looking at the rules, where can t1 come from? Hmm, maybe NT26 can produce t4, but t1 might come from elsewhere. Wait, let me check. Looking through the rules, maybe NT2 -> NT48 NT66, but NT48 can produce t24, so that's not t1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let's look for 't1' in the rules. The rules end with 't5', 't17', etc. So, perhaps I need to find a non-terminal that directly produces 't1'. But looking at all the rules, I don't see any rule that ends with 't1'. Hmm, that's a problem. So if 't1' is in the string, but there's no production in the grammar that directly produces 't1', how can that be?\n\nWait, looking again at the rules. Let me check each rule to see if any of them have 't1' on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't1'. So, that would mean that in the grammar, there's no way to produce 't1' as a terminal. Therefore, any string containing 't1' cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, the string given is `t4 t1 t29 t13 t27 t33`, which includes 't1'. So if 't1' is in the string but the grammar cannot produce it, then the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I'm not missing any production. Let me go through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with 't1':\n\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT36: No t1 here.\n- NT8 -> NT45 NT5: No.\n- NT9: No, I don't see any.\n- NT10: No.\n- NT11: Doesn't have any t's except in other parts.\n- Wait, looking through all the rules: The rules are given in line breaks, I might have missed some.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT50 -> NT25 NT8: No t's.\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45: No.\n- NT44 -> NT3 NT26: No.\n- NT70 -> t17: Yes, here's 't17'.\n- NT26 -> t4: Yes, t4.\n- So no rule seems to produce 't1'.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. That's helpful because it might make parsing easier, and maybe I can use something like the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But I'm not sure how efficient that is without actually implementing it.\n\nLet me look at the given grammar to see if I can spot any patterns or possible left or right moves. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT56 NT45. So, S is the root, and from there, it's a matter of expanding NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, looking at NT22 -> NT63 NT48. Hmm, but in the string, I see t4, t12, t5, t10, t0, t9. So I need to see how these t's are connected.\n\nI notice that each NT rule seems to generate combinations of NT's or terminal t's. For example, NT22 -> NT63 and then NT48, and so on. But the string is a sequence of t's, which suggests that some of these productions must be terminal rules. Let me check the productions that produce t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some NT's produce 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT70 -> 't5' or NT70 -> 't17'. Also, other NT's like NT63 -> 't9', NT45 -> 't4', etc. So each step involves choosing whether to expand further or to produce a terminal t followed by a number, which seems to correspond to the tokens in the string.\n\nLet's map out the tokens: t4, t12, t5, t10, t0, t9. So, each t is followed by a number, except t4 is first. Wait, no, each is a separate token, so it's t4, then t12, etc.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since S -> NT56 NT45, perhaps the string can be split into parts corresponding to NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT56 and NT45.\n\nI think I need to see if each part of the string corresponds to the expansion of NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me list the productions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 -> NT68 NT44\n\nWait, no, the start is NT56 and NT45, which go to NT69 NT44 and NT68 NT44, respectively? Wait, looking back: S -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 -> NT68 NT44\n\nSo, from NT56, we get NT69 and NT44. From NT45, we get NT68 and NT44. Wait, but the string is t4, t12, etc. So let me see how each of these could produce t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look into the individual NT's and see what they produce.\n\nLet me see what NT69 and NT68 produce. According to the rules:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\n\nSo, for NT69, we can further split, etc. Maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of symbols and see if each can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the sequence of t's corresponds to terminals that result from the application of the productions.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nThe string is t4, t12, t5, t10, t0, t9.\n\nWait, that's six tokens. So the parse tree should have six leaves corresponding to these t's.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is two symbols on the left and two on the right, each step introduces two symbols, but the root has two symbols, leading to more nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build the parse tree bottom-up, matching the terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Each of these is a terminal, so each must come from an NT production directly.\n\nSo, let's see which NT's generate these.\n\nt4: NT45\n\nt12: Is any NT producing t12? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT2 -> t12 (because NT2 -> t12). Wait, no, NT2 is a symbol. Wait, no, looking back: I think I missed some NT's.\n\nWait, the grammar provided is a big list. Let me search for any line where NT produces a 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT1 -> t24\n\n- NT3 -> t24\n\n- NT5 -> t1\n\n- NT7 -> t13 t36?\n\nWait, more precisely, checking each NT rule, I find:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48: No t's.\n\n- NT45 \u2192 t4: Yes, this is one of the productions.\n\n- NT70\u2192 t5, t17\n\n- NT18\u2192 t32\n\nWait, but I'm looking for NT's that produce t12.

Hmm, that's odd because the string has t12. So how does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check again.\n\nLooking through the production rules for NT's:\n\n- NT63 -> t9: yes\n\n- NT28 -> t36: not t12.\n\n- NT36 -> t25, t70\n\n- NT42 -> t46, something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> t13 and t36\n\n- NT54 -> t6, t45: does that connect to something?\n\nWait, perhaps t12 is generated through a chain. Let's see.\n\nWait, if t12 is t12, perhaps it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, for example, perhaps NT2 -> t12.

{"custom_id":"request-84","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t6 t34 t2 t37 t32 t7 t7`. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. So, looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t6, t34, t2, t37, t32, t7, t7. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and looking at the production rules, S produces NT56 and NT45. So, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Now, I need to see if NT56 and NT45 can derive the respective parts of the string.\n\nLet's start with NT56. Looking at the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, NT56 expands into NT69 and NT44. Now, I need to see what each of these produces.\n\nLooking at NT69, according to the rules, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT69 expands into NT63 and NT49. Now let's check what NT63 and NT49 produce.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT70 is a terminal, specifically from the production NT70 \u2192 't5'. Wait, the string starts with t6, not t5. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, in the string, the first token is t6, but according to NT70's production, it's 't5', so that's conflicting. Did I go wrong somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I should backtrack. NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT70 is 't5'. But the string starts with t6. So perhaps NT63 is not the right path here. Let me check the production for NT63 again. Oh wait, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which goes to t5. But the first token is t6, so maybe we need to look elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial expansion. Let me retrace. The original string is t6 t34 t2 t37 t32 t7 t7.\n\nLet me consider that maybe I missed another production path for NT63. Looking at NT36, which is part of the grammar, it appears in several rules. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which is another route. Wait, but in my initial thought, I was on NT63, which goes to NT25 and NT70. So if NT70 is 't5', which doesn't match the first t6, perhaps there's another production for NT63 that I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking back, I might have missed a production for NT63. Let me check the grammar rules again. Oh, here's NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. Hmm, but NT36 isn't directly in NT63's rules. Let me see the production for NT63. Hmm, I don't see NT63 having other rules. So perhaps NT63 only goes to NT25 and NT70, which is 't5'.\n\nSo if that's the case, then starting from NT56, expanding to NT69 and NT44, which further expands to NT63 and NT49. Now, NT49 is another production: NT49 \u2192 NT46 NT68. Let me check what NT46 and NT68 produce.\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT4 NT37. NT4 is terminal 't37' according to the productions, so NT4 is 't37'. Also, NT37 is a terminal 't21' according to the rules. Wait, no: looking at NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, and NT3 \u2192 NT355? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me map this out properly.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better. Instead of trying to expand step by step, which could get complicated, I can try to see if the string can be matched by the grammar by building a parse tree.\n\nThe string is t6 t34 t2 t37 t32 t7 t7.\n\nLet me look at the first two tokens. The first part is t6 t34. Looking through the grammar rules, I notice that NT22 expands into t22, which would produce t0. But that's not matching. Alternatively, NT2 is a production: NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66. Let me see what NT48 and NT66 produce.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. NT25 is terminal 't10', and NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20. Now, NT21 is a terminal 't13' and NT20 is another production. Wait, let me check NT20's production. Wait, in the given rules, I don't see NT20 directly; instead, perhaps I need to look deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by breaking down the string into tokens and trying to assign them to non-terminals. Let's list the tokens: [t6, t34, t2, t37, t32, t7, t7]\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can produce t6. From the grammar, NT2 \u2192 't12' is a terminal, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, NT6 is a production: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22. NT1 \u2192 NT18 NT7. Hmm, no. Maybe I should look for NT6 specifically. Wait, wait! There's NT61 \u2192 NT69 NT49. Hmm, no. Alternatively, NT70 is 't5', but we have t6. Hmm, perhaps looking at NT69's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for NT61 again. Wait, NT61 has two productions: NT61 \u2192 NT22 NT10 and NT61 \u2192 NT10 NT22. Wait, but those both seem to go into smaller components. Wait, looking at NT22: NT22 \u2192 t22, which is a non-terminal, and in the productions, NT22 is part of the start rule. Wait, no: NT22 is a terminal? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, non-terminals are all the NT and S. Terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and 't2', etc. So, for example, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, but NT70 is a terminal, meaning it expands into 't5'. Similarly, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So, let me check each step again.\n\nStarting with the initial expansion S \u2192 NT56 NT45. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, as before. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Now, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT25 is a terminal 't10', and NT70 is 't5'. But in our string, the first token is 't6', so this path is not matching.\n\nSo perhaps NT44 needs to be considered. NT44 has two productions: NT44 \u2192 NT56 NT45 and NT44 \u2192 NT56 NT45 again? Wait, looking at the rules: yes, NT44 \u2192 NT56 NT45 in both cases, except that one is from NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT44 comes from NT56, which comes from NT69 and NT44. Hmm, maybe I'm going in circles.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for non-terminals that can produce 't6' as their terminal. Looking through the grammar, is there any non-terminal that directly expands into t6? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT... \u2192 't6' directly. I don't see any non-terminal productions that directly produce 't6', except perhaps NT6 itself, but looking at the rules, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which would produce 't25' and 't5' (since NT70 \u2192 't5'). So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look for a production that includes 't6' on the right-hand side. Scanning through the rules: I don't see any production where a non-terminal converts directly to 't6', except maybe in NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which is 't25' and '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-87","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I'm supposed to check is \"t24 t20 t21 t12 t29 t5 t32\". \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, as all the non-terminals (NT) have production rules that either split into two other non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that it consists of multiple non-terminals generating combinations of 't's. Each production rule either breaks down a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or directly into a single terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be generated by expanding the start symbol S down to this string through these production rules.\n\nLet me start by identifying all the non-terminals in the string. The string is composed of 't24', 't20', 't21', 't12', 't29', 't5', and 't32', so none of these are non-terminals in the grammar\u2014they are all terminals. The grammar's start symbol is S, and from there, we need to apply the production rules step by step to see if we can reach this string.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo S expands into two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Now each of these needs to expand into the corresponding terminals in the string. Let me check their production rules.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nSo now, NT56 becomes NT69 NT44, and NT45 becomes NT63 NT49. That means the string needs to break down into NT69, NT44, NT63, and NT49.\n\nWait, but the actual string has four 't's: t24, t20, t21, t12, t29, t5, t32. Hmm, but S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49. That's four non-terminals, each of which can split further. So each of these would need to be expanded further into their respective terminals.\n\nLet me check each of these:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT56\n\nWait, but NT69's production is NT63 NT49. So NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. That means the 't's from NT69 would split into NT63 and NT49.\n\nBut hold on, let's backtrack. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49. Each of these must expand into the right terminals.\n\nLet's look at each NT in the expansion:\n\nNT69: Its production is NT63 NT49.\n\nNT44: Its production is NT3 NT26.\n\nNT63: Its production is 't9' in the grammar. Wait, no, looking back, NT63 is broken down further.\n\nWait, the terminals for NT63 are 't9', but let's confirm:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I find NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nThen NT70 \u2192 't17' terminals, so NT63 can produce 't9' via NT25 NT70. But wait, the direct terminal is when NT70 is a terminal. Actually, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'.\n\nSo NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70 \u2192 (what do NT25 and NT70 produce? Let's see.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10. NT70 is 't17'.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't28'.\n\nSo NT25 \u2192 't10' via NT10.\n\nTherefore, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70 \u2192 t10 t17. So NT63 produces t10t17.\n\nSimilarly, NT44: Its production is NT3 NT26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5 \u2192 let's see.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complex. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nSo now, we have NT69, NT44, NT63, NT49.\n\nLet's process each of these:\n\n1. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\n2. NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\n3. NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\n4. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nLet's expand each of these:\n\n1. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo NT69 becomes NT63 NT49 \u2192 (NT25 NT70) (NT22 NT66). But each of these needs to expand further:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nSo NT25 NT70 becomes t28 t17.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39 \u2192 't10' (NT25 \u2192 't28') and NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20\n\nWait, no, let me check NT39:\n\nLooking back, NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30\n\nNT30 \u2192 't17'\n\nSo NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20 \u2192 (NT71 NT30) (NT20). NT71 is 't14', NT30 is 't17', and NT20 is 't6'.\n\nThus, NT39 \u2192 t14 t17 t6.\n\nWait, that's a bit involved.

Let me re-examine NT48's production.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39.\n\nNT25 \u2192 't28' as per NT25 \u2192 't28'.\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30 \u2192 't14' and 't17' as per NT71 and NT30.\n\nNT20 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo NT48 \u2192 't28' (from NT25) followed by NT39 which is 't14 t17 t6'.\n\nThus, NT48 \u2192 t28 t14 t17 t6.\n\nSo NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT48 \u2192 (NT4 expansion) (t28 t14 t17 t6). \n\nNT4 \u2192 't37' \u2192 as per NT4 \u2192 't37'.\n\nSo NT22 \u2192 't37' followed by t28 t14 t17 t6.\n\nThus, NT22 \u2192 t37 t28 t14 t17 t6.\n\nNow, going back to NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 we just found is t37 t28 t14 t17 t6.\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT10.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't28'.\n\nSo NT66 \u2192 't28'.\n\nWait, no: NT66 is 'NT66', which I think is defined as NT10. Let me check NT66's production.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT10 \u2192 't28'.\n\nSo NT49 \u2192 NT22 (t37 t28 t14 t17 t6) followed by NT66 (t28).\n\nThus, NT49 \u2192 t37 t28 t14 t17 t6 t28.\n\nWait, that's a lot of terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-107","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is \"t12 t27 t14 t21 t36 t17 t9 t34\". I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal symbol on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each rule seems to break down symbols into other symbols, some non-terminals and some terminals. The terminals are the ones ending with 't' like t12, t24, etc., except for some which are just single letters like 't5' or 't17'\u2014wait, looking closer, actually, many of the terminals end with 't' and a number, except NT15 has 't'?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the rules, I see that several non-terminals expand into terminals and other non-terminals. The string we're checking consists of all terminal symbols except perhaps for 't5' which is in NT56. Wait, the string is t12, t27, t14, t21, t36, t17, t9, t34. None of these seem to correspond directly to the NTs listed because all NTs in the rules either have longer terms or different endings.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NTs as non-terminals and the actual terminals. Let me parse the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production rule is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> a NT, where a is a terminal. For example, S -> NT56 NT45, and NT56 -> NT69 NT44, which in turn breaks down into more NTs until we hit terminals like 't69'? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the rule definitions, things like NT70 -> 't17' or NT69 -> 't5'. So each NT eventually expands to a terminal and another NT, except when it's a single terminal, like NT70 -> 't17'. \n\nSo each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal until we end up with all terminals.\n\nThe string we have is a sequence of terminals. The question is whether there's a derivation starting from S that ends with this string.\n\nGiven that S expands into two non-terminals: S -> NT56 NT45. So S can be derived as NT56 followed by NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 expands as NT69 NT44, and NT45 expands as NT68 NT24. Then, NT69 is a terminal 't5', which is the first symbol in the string. Then, NT44 would expand into NT3 NT26, which I need to track.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by working backwards from the string. Since parsing from left to right can sometimes miss the correct expansion steps.\n\nLet me write down the string: t12 t27 t14 t21 t36 t17 t9 t34.\n\nI think I can try to parse this string step by step, trying to match from the start symbol S down to the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe constructing a parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string appears in the left-hand side of any rule or in the expansion chain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT eventually produces a terminal and possibly another NT. Let's try to see if each 't' in the string is a result of an NT.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT50 -> 't25', 't8' (since NT50 has rules that either expand into a terminal, or into combinations like NT25 NT8, etc. But looking at the provided rules, many NTs seem to have terminals as their direct productions. For example:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT71 -> 't7'\n\nNT26 -> 't4'\n\nNT36 -> 't25'\n\nNT7 -> 't13'\n\nNT69 -> 't5'\n\nWait, looking at the rules given, several NTs directly produce a terminal. For example, NT56->'t69'? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let's check each line.\n\nWait, each line in the grammar is of the form NT XY -> something. So the lines like:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT71 -> 't7'\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nNT22 -> 't0'\n\nWait, hold on, some of these are just a single 't', like NT55 -> 't33'? Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, it's:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT71 -> 't7'\n\nNT68 -> 't3'\n\nNT22 -> 't0'\n\nSo the right-hand side is a terminal. Therefore, NT70 and others can produce a 't' followed by nothing, which is just a single terminal. So for example, NT70 can be rewritten to 't17'.\n\nWait, but looking at the string we have: t12 t27 t14 t21 t36 t17 t9 t34. Each letter is a separate term, so each is a terminal.\n\nSo, each component of the string must be a terminal produced by some NT. Let's list them and see if each appears in the right-hand side of any NT's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- 't5' is from NT56 rule: NT56 -> 't5'...?

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t17 t37 t10 t3 t25 t24 t29 t1` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine Yes or No. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals here are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't1', 't5', etc., and the non-terminals are the NT variations, like NT22, NT35, etc. \n\nThe string ends with `t1`. Looking at the NT productions, I remember that 't1' is a terminal. So I need to find which non-terminal directly produces 't1'. Scanning the productions, I see NT1 -> 't24', and NT4-> 't37'. Hmm, but wait, 't1' is a terminal, so it must come from a non-terminal directly.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT71 -> 't7' and NT4-> 't37'. But I don't see any NT directly producing 't1'. So that's confusing. Or maybe I missed it. Let me check each NT rule to see if any output a terminal including 't1' or 't' sequences. \n\nLooking through the list, NT31 -> 't50' and 't4', and NT13 -> 't24' and 't1'. So 't1' is part of NT13's expansion: NT13 -> 't24' 't1'. But in the string, the last part is `t1`, which can't split into two. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, the string is `t17 t37 t10 t3 t25 t24 t29 t1`. So the last token is 't1'. If NT13 produces 't24' 't1', but the last token is just 't1', how can that fit? Maybe the grammar allows for the last unit to consume 't1' on its own, but the production must end a non-terminal with a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each rule again. \n\nLooking for where a non-terminal expands to 't1', but I don't see any. Hmm, perhaps 't1' is produced by a non-terminal. The productions I see are all either combining two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, I see NT25 -> 't10', and NT10 -> 't28'. So the string includes 't10', but that's from NT25.\n\nSo I'll approach this step by step, perhaps using a parsing method. Since it's CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm or similar methods to check if the string is in the language.\n\nFirst, the string has 8 tokens: 17,37,10,3,25,24,29,1. Let's list them as positions 0 to 7.\n\nWe'll create a table where each cell (i,j) represents the non-terminals that can generate the substring from position i to j.\n\nStarting with i=0 and j=0: The first token is 't17'. Looking for NT rules that produce 't17'. Scanning the productions, I see NT61 -> 't22' 't69' (so that's two symbols), but I'm looking for 't17' itself. Checking each NT rule, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't17'. Wait, the only 't's in the string are 't17', 't37', 't10', etc. Looking through the productions, most are combinations, but I don't see any NT directly producing 't17'. So maybe 't17' is the start of the string, but it doesn't come from any NT. That's a problem because the entire string must be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S -> NT56 NT45. So S can only produce two non-terminals, which in turn produce other symbols. So S starts the expansion, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two others.\n\nBut the string has a 't1' at the end, which must come from a NT production that has a terminal. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't1'. That suggests that either the string is invalid, or I missed a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the rules. Let me check again. For example, looking for NT rules that end with a terminal 't...', checking the rules:\n\n- NT25 -> 't10' (t10, which is then from NT25)\n- NT13 -> 't24' 't1'\n- So 't1' can come from NT13 if NT13 can be expanded to something that includes 't1' as a terminal, but in that case, the production for NT13 is 't24' 't1', which would require that the unit is split into two parts: 't24' and 't1'. But the string ends with 't1', so perhaps that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has a production like NT71 -> 't7' or NT31 -> 't50' 't4', but no, we need 't1'.\n\nWait, maybe the production chain is such that the string's last token 't1' comes from a NT that directly produces it. But looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't1'. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't1' comes from a chain. For example, perhaps NT13 is part of the chain and when it's split into 't24' 't1', but then how does the string end with a single 't1'? Because 't24' would be another symbol, but in the string, the last token is 't1' without any other symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the whole string as being generated bottom-up. Let's consider that the last token is 't1', so we need a non-terminal that can produce 't1' as part of its expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a single terminal, but looking at the productions, none directly produce 't1'. So that makes me think that 't1' cannot appear in the string, but the string does have it. So perhaps the answer is No.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can try to see if the string can be parsed.\n\nLet's try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t17 t37 t10 t3 t25 t24 t29 t1\n\nLet me list their indices as tokens 0-7:\n\n0: t17\n1: t37\n2: t10\n3: t3\n4: t25\n5: t24\n6: t29\n7: t1\n\nWe need to check if each token can be produced by some non-terminal expansion.\n\nt17: So we need a non-terminal that can produce 't17'. Looking through the rules, no NT directly produces 't17'. The rules are all combinations. So unless 't17' can be a part of a longer derivation, that seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps t17 is part of a longer production. Let's look. For example, NT61 -> NT22 NT7, which is 't22' 't7' since NT7 -> 't13' (wait, no, looking back, NT7: The rule for NT7 is NT13 NT36. So NT7 splits into other non-terminals, which could eventually be terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is more about checking if the string can be parsed from the top down. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut this might take too long, especially since I have to think through all possibilities. Alternatively, since 't17' is the first token and none of the NT rules directly produce 't17', maybe the string is invalid.\n\nSo my initial thought is that since the string starts with 't17' and the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal that produces 't17' directly, the string is not part of the language. Thus, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, just to be sure, let me check if 't17' can be part of a longer expansion. For example, from NT61: NT61 -> NT34 NT8. NT34 -> 't24', and NT8 -> 't13'. So NT61 would produce 't24' 't13', which is 't24 t13'. But our string has 't17' as the first token, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSimilarly, looking for any NT that can produce 't17' as a terminal. I don't see any such rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some NTs can produce 't' followed by numbers. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT26 -> 't4' ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF is. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure makes parsing easier, but for my task of checking the string, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol, which in this case seems to be S.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, and the productions are all two non-terminals on the left and a non-terminal or a terminal on the right. So, it fits the CNF criteria.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t4 t25 t0 t14 t24 t33 t21 t6`.\n\nI think the approach is to see if I can build this string by following the productions. Each production either combines two non-terminals or introduces a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each step in the derivation should be replacing a non-terminal with a terminal or a combination that eventually leads to the string.\n\nLet me list the productions and terminals to have a clear picture.\n\nFirst, the terminals in the string are t36, t4, t25, t0, t14, t24, t33, t21, t6.\n\nNow, looking at each production:\n\n1.

Since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, maybe the string can be constructed by substituting non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to reverse-engineer the derivation starting from the string.

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t21 t33 t34 t28 t14 t4 t6 t28 t9` is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, the only terminals are those ending with 't', like t21, t14, etc. The other symbols are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, to derive the string, I'll start with S.\n\nNext, I notice that each non-terminal leads to productions with other non-terminals. My goal is to find a leftmost derivation path (or any order) that can produce the given string. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nEach terminal in the string is t21, t33, t34, t28, t14, t4, t6, t28, t9. I'll need to see how each of these can be generated.\n\nLooking at the productions, I can check if each of these terminals are directly present in the grammar. Each production ends with either NTn \u2192 ... \u2192 a terminal, but sometimes through multiple steps.\n\nFor example, looking through the productions, most are of the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, but some are terminals. Each terminal production is a single 't' followed by a number. So, the terminals are things like 't21', 't33', etc.\n\nI'll list the terminals in the string and see if they are present in the grammar:\n\nt21: Yes, looking through the productions, there's NT18 \u2192 t32, NT26 \u2192 t4, NT66 \u2192 t6, etc. Wait, I need to look for whether any NT production ends directly in t21. Wait, the productions end in t-something. Let me check if any NT production directly ends with t21. Looking through the list, yes, there's NT18 \u2192 t32, not t21. Oh, Wait, no: Looking again, NT18 \u2192 t32 is a production? Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 t32? Or is that another NT?\n\nWait, let me check each production ending with a terminal to see which terminals are present.\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46 (but ends with NT46 which is non-terminal)\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49 (non-terminal on right)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22 (non-terminals)\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT9: Not shown here, but assuming it's non-terminal until specified.\nWait, but in the grammar given, every production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and another non-terminal except for the ones that end with a terminal like 't21', 't33', etc.\n\nSo, I need to figure out for each terminal in the string, how it can be generated.\n\nLet me list each token in the string and see if it's present in any of the productions as a terminal:\n\nt21: Looking through the productions, there's NT18 \u2192 t32, which is 32. Not 21. Let me check NT17, but wait, the productions don't go that high. Wait, looking again, I see NT68 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal. But t21 is another terminal. Wait, no, in the given productions, I see NT18 \u2192 t32, NT26 \u2192 t4, etc., but t21 is a terminal. Wait, looking for any production that directly ends with t21. Wait, I see NT18 \u2192 t32, which is 32, not 21. Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the list is a bit long, but I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, let's find where the terminals are:\n\n- NT2: 't12'\n- NT4: 't37'\n- NT7: 't13'\n- NT8: 't13'\n- NT22: 't0'\n- NT2: 't12'\n- NT13: 't24' (Wait, NT13 \u2192 t24, right?)\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT66 \u2192 t6\n- NT28 \u2192 't36' (Wait, no, NT28 \u2192 t36?

Wait, looking at the list:\n\nThe productions start with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nThen, under NT2: nt22 \u2192 nt48 nt39\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each terminal and see if any production ends with it.\n\nFor example, does any NT production end with t21?\n\nLooking through the list, yes, I think there is:\n\nWait, under NT18 \u2192 t32.\n\nNo, that's 't32'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, here's a part:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't13', so NT21 produces t13.

Let me search the list.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT1: 't24' - No.\n- NT2: 't12'\n- NT3: two non-terminals (NT68 NT46)\n- NT4: 't37'\n- NT5: two non-terminals (NT1 NT49)\n- NT6: two non-terminals\n- NT7: 't13'\n- NT8: 't13'\n- NT9: probably non-terminal unless specified.\n- NT10: NT71 NT30\n- NT11: ?\nWait, perhaps I shouldn't look for t21 in the terminals but see if the entire string can be generated from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will have a tree where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut since the string is a series of terminals, the root (S) must derive to a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to parse the string from the start symbol S. However, considering the string is t21 t33 t34 t28 t14 t4 t6 t28 t9, which is 9 symbols. In Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Since there are no \u03b5 productions, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a tree, but 9 terminals would require 8 productions, but the grammar might not allow that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar, but seeing the string, each of these is a terminal, so the problem is whether the grammar can produce each.\n\nBut no, because the grammar is context-free and each production can produce certain terminals. So, perhaps the string can be built by recursively applying the productions.\n\nI think the key here is to check if each of these terminals is present as the direct production of some non-terminal.\n\nLooking again at the grammar for possible 't21' as an end terminal. Wait, in the productions, I see NT21 \u2192 't13', but that's 't13', not 't21'.\n\nWait, looking again: under the NT productions, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't13', but I don't see any NT that ends with 't21'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll start by writing down the entire grammar to get a clear picture. The start symbol is S, and it directly produces NT56 and NT45. So, the initial string derived from S is `NT56 NT45`. Then, each NT can be replaced according to their production rules until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided string, it's a series of t's followed by numbers, which are likely the terminals. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar step by step.\n\nI'll start by examining each terminal in the string and see if they can be derived from any non-terminals in the grammar. If I can trace a path from the start symbol S to each t-value in the correct order, it means the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's break down each terminal:\n\n1. t27: Looking through the grammar, 't27' is the result of NT18 -> 't27'. So, NT18 must be in the derivation.\n2. t12: This comes from NT2 -> 't12'.\n3. t17: Both NT6 and NT30 produce 't17'.\n4. t10: NT10 -> 't28'.\n5. t20: NT20 -> 't19'? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT20 -> 't34'. Hmm, that's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT20 -> NT54 -> NT56 NT61. Then NT10?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me list out each terminal and their origins.\n\n- t27: NT18\n- t12: NT2\n- t17: NT6 or NT30\n- t10: 't10' is a terminal, but it's only mentioned in NT10 -> 't28', which is different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, the terminals are mapped as per the grammar's production rules. The 't' values are on the right side of productions. For example, NT26 -> 't4', so 't4' is NT26's result.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, there's a line: NT70 -> 't17', and another NT30 -> 't17'. So, any N-terminal that leads to NT70 or NT30 will result in 't17'.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the mappings:\n\nLet's make a list:\n\n- NT26 -> 't4' (so NT26 can lead to 't4')\n- NT49 -> 't15' (and also NT49 -> 't13', wait no: NT49 is transformed into 't15')\nWait, perhaps I should create a mapping from each non-terminal to its production rules and see which terminal they can produce.\n\nBut that might take a lot of time. Instead, perhaps I can work backwards from the string to see if I can reconstruct a derivation.\n\nThe string is: t27, t12, t17, t10, t20, t6, t25, t1, t5, t7.\n\nLet's start from the end. The last symbol is 't7'. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce 't7'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT71 -> 't7' and NT70 -> 't17' is another NT, and others?\n\nWait, let's check all the NTs and their terminals:\n\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT50 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't24'\n- NT34 -> 't24'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT49 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't17' (duplicate)\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT36 -> 't25'\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't13'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT50 -> 't20'\n- NT48 -> 't2'\n- NT18 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't9'\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't26'\n- NT10 -> 't28'\n- NT71 -> 't7'\n- NT20 -> 't34'\n- NT46 -> 't4'\n- NT39 -> 't21'\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't12'\n- NT13 -> 't1'\n\nWait, looking for 't7', the relevant non-terminals are:\n\n- NT71 -> 't7' (twice)\n- NT70 -> 't17' (so no)\n- Others: None. So the only way to get 't7' is via NT71.\n\nSo the last symbol, t7, comes from NT71. Therefore, in the derivation, the last NT must be NT71, which expands into NT69 and NT44, as per NT71 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo the last part is NT71 -> ... which produces 't7'. So in the derivation, the string built before that must be followed by 't7'.\n\nNow, stepping back, before 't7' comes 't1', which is in the string: t7, t1. So 't1' must come from NT1, as looking at the terminal mappings:\n\n- NT1 -> 't24'. But we have 't1' in the string, which is not 't24'. Wait, that's confusing. Did I get that wrong?\n\nWait, looking at NT1's rule: NT1 -> NT22 -> 't12'. Or is NT1 a terminal? No, looking at the grammar, every production has two non-terminals on the right, except when it produces a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, some rules produce a terminal.\n\nFor example, NT22 -> 't0'. Wait, no, looking again, it's:\n\nNT22 -> NT48 NT69.\n\nWait, no, checking the provided rules:\n\nActually, looking through the rules, many of them end with terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT22 -> NT48 NT69\n- NT26 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT36 -> NT25 NT70\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nAnd several have terminals on the RHS. For instance, 't1' is an output of NT1 as per NT1 -> 't24'. But that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I confused NT1's production.\n\nWait, looking back at the given grammar, I see NT1 -> 't24'. So, NT1 can directly produce 't24', which is correct because NT1 is a non-terminal that can derive a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 -> NT48 NT69: which themselves can derive into more symbols.\n\nSo, perhaps my confusion is with the NT1: since the last symbol is 't7', which comes from NT71, the part before is 't25 t1 t5'. Hmm, maybe I'm not approaching this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to split the string into individual tokens and work backwards step by step.\n\nSo the string is:\n\n1. t27\n2. t12\n3. t17\n4. t10\n5. t20\n6. t6\n7. t25\n8. t1\n9. t5\n10. t7\n\nI'll attempt to build the derivation starting from the last symbol and moving backwards.\n\n10. t7: comes from NT71, which is NT71 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, the last part is NT71 -> NT69 NT44, but in the string, only 't7' is present, not 't17' or 'other t's. Wait, no, the derivation would have to include all symbols leading up to t7.

{"custom_id":"request-151","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t37 t33 t4 t13 t15 t2 t36 t37 t26 t15`. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means each rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's mostly rules that expand non-terminals into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, the start symbol S -> NT56 NT45. So S expands into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then expands further. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, which are the 't' followed by some numbers.\n\nThe string has ten tokens, all of which are terminals. So the derivation must result in exactly ten tokens. Starting from S, each application of a production rule should increase the number of symbols. Let's see: each production either replaces a single non-terminal with two, so the length doubles each time. But wait, since this could happen multiple times, maybe the total number of steps is not straightforward. However, the string has a specific count, so I need to trace how many symbols are generated from S.\n\nS starts with two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Each of these will generate further symbols. Let's think about how the count increases. Each step where a non-terminal is replaced by two others doesn't change the count yet because we replace one with two. But when both are non-terminals, the number doubles. Wait, no\u2014 each non-terminal replacement is a binary split, so the total count depends on the number of leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to track the number of symbols as we try to build the string. Alternatively, perhaps I can trace the string from the start symbol.\n\nThe string is t37 t33 t4 t13 t15 t2 t36 t37 t26 t15. Let's count the symbols: 10. So starting from S, which produces two non-terminals, the derivation has to result in exactly 10 terminals. Each application of a production rule, replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, increases the count. So starting from S, the number of symbols would be as follows:\n\n- Starting with S: 1 (S)\n- After first expansion: two non-terminals, so 2\n- Each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals, so each step potentially doubles. But the process can vary as different non-terminals are expanded.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see how the string can be built by starting from the symbols in the string and trying to build them from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, let's list the tokens in order:\n\nt37 t33 t4 t13 t15 t2 t36 t37 t26 t15.\n\nI think I can try to match these tokens from the right side of the grammar rules. Since the right-hand side of the rules is either two non-terminals or a terminal, I can try to split the string into parts that correspond to these productions.\n\nLet me look for the terminals that appear as standalone in the grammar. The terminals are like 't37', 't26', etc. So each terminal in the string must be matched by a production that directly produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are listed in the last few rules:\n\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT50 -> 't3'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT36 -> 't25' and 't26' (from NT61 and others)\n- NT21 -> 't13' and 't26'? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, NT21 is defined as NT49 NT31. Then NT49 is NT22 NT66, NT22 is NT18 NT59. Wait, this might get complicated. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string and try to build it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t37 t33 t4 t13 t15 t2 t36 t37 t26 t15.\n\nLet me try to split it into parts that could be matched by the grammar. The end symbols appear in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 -> t33 (since NT56 -> t33 is one of the rules, from NT56 -> NT69 NT44, which then expand further. Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, the grammar rules are:\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side includes a terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT56 -> t33\n- NT50 -> t3\n- NT48 -> t24\n- NT28 -> t36\n- NT70 -> t7\n- NT69 -> t5\n- NT61 -> t27, I think? Wait, looking through:\n\nLooking at the rules, the terminals are 't5', 't7', 't24', 't3', 't9', etc. The rules have NT36 -> t25, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal rules:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT50 -> 't3'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT61 -> 't27'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at all rules for NT61:\n\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8 and NT61 -> NT18 NT59 and NT61 -> NT2 NT10.\n\nBut none of these rules produce a terminal directly. Instead, looking deeper:\n\nWait, no, I might have misread. Looking again, the grammar rules for NT61 are:\n\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\n\nNT61 -> NT18 NT59\n\nNT61 -> NT2 NT10\n\nBut none of these are direct terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, what about NT21? NT21 -> NT49 NT31, and NT49 -> NT22 NT66 and NT31 -> NT4 NT50.\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can try to trace the string from the start symbol down, replacing the non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t37, which must come from NT37, but wait, the grammar doesn't have NT37. Wait, perhaps NT37 is a production that produces t37. Looking through, the rules:\n\nDo any non-terminals produce t37? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes, NT22 -> t37.\n\nWait, looking back, NT22 is defined as NT18 NT59. So maybe t37 comes from NT22.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this backward, trying to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar.\n\nLet's take the string as S = [t37, t33, t4, t13, t15, t2, t36, t37, t26, t15].\n\nLet me see if I can break it down into parts where each part is either a terminal or follows a production.\n\nLet me try to find splits that match the grammar.\n\nLooking for the end of the string, it ends with t15. Looking for where t15 appears as a terminal in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I don't see t15 as a terminal. So perhaps it's from a non-terminal that eventually produces t15.\n\nLooking at the rules, t15 is in NT15, which isn't a terminal. So perhaps t15 is from a non-terminal that expands to it. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t37, which I think is NT22 -> t37. So the first part could be NT22.\n\nBut NT22 is NT18 NT59. So t37 would be the first terminal, followed by NT18 and NT59.\n\nSo the string would be t37 (NT22), followed by the expansion of NT18 and NT59.\n\nBut wait, NT22 -> t37 (so t37 is the first token), and the rest of the string would be the expansion of NT18 and NT59.\n\nSo the string after t37 would be t33 t4 t13 t15 t2 t36 t37 t26 t15. But NT18 and NT59 each produce two non-terminals.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to line up. Maybe I'm approaching it wrong.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of the parse tree.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst off, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. That's helpful because it tells me the grammar uses leftmost derivations, and each step replaces a single non-terminal with two others, ending when all are terminals.\n\nThe string we have starts with `t0`. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce `t` followed by a number or another symbol. For instance, `NT1` produces `t24`, and there are others like `NT70` which produce `t17` or `t7`. So `t0` must come from a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that `NT1` produces `t24`. But that's a `t`, not `t0`. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up. Let me check the productions again:\n\nWait, the production NT1 -> 't24', but the string starts with `t0`. So, how can `t0` be generated? Looking through all the non-terminals, I see that \"70\" is the only one that produces 't7', but that doesn't help with `t0`. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me scan the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the NT1 production, it's `NT1 -> 't24'`? So that's a single terminal. But the string starts with `t0`. Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking through, I see NT1 is 't24', NT2 is 't12', NT3 is 't3 NT55', etc. Wait, is there any non-terminal that directly produces `t0`? Let me look through all the non-terminals:\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produces `t0`. The initial production is S -> NT56 NT45. Let me check NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT45 -> NT63 NT49\n\nWait, but none of these directly produce terminals. So perhaps `t0` comes from a derivation chain. Let's think about how `t0` can be generated.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT56 NT45. NT56 becomes NT69 NT44, and NT45 becomes NT63 NT49. So S becomes NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, NT69 -> NT17 (since looking at NT69's production: NT69 -> NT63 NT49. Wait, no. Looking at the grammar, NT69 is actually `NT69 -> NT63 NT49`. So NT69 leads to NT63 and NT49.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing NT1 in the initial derivation. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe `t0` comes from some deeper non-terminal. Let me see if any NT produces `t0`.\n\nLooking again: NT1 is 't24', so can't be. NT2 is 't12', still no. NT3 is two non-terminals, so likely not `t0`. NT4 is 't37', again no. NT5 is 't20', etc. I'm starting to think that perhaps none of the non-terminals directly produce `t0`. Wait, but that can't be because the string starts with `t0`.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking. Let me go through each NT and see if any of them have a production that includes `t0`.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT1 -> 't24' (no)\n- NT2 -> 't12' (no)\n- NT3 -> NT6 NT55\n- NT4 -> 't37' (no)\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT49\n- NT6 -> NT1 NT22 (nope)\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT36\n- NT8 -> 't13' (no)\n- NT9 (is there one?) No, it seems NT9 is used in NT36 (as NT36 can produce NT25 NT70)\n- NT10 -> 't28' (no)\n- NT11? No, I don't see NT11 in the list. Hmm.\n- NT12 -> 't28' (no)\n- NT13 -> 't24'\n- NT14 -> 't15'? No, wait, NT14 isn't listed. Wait, in the string, after `t0` comes `t7`, so perhaps NT14 is part of the derivation. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe I should try to find a derivation path starting from S and see if I can reach `t0 t7 t36...`.\n\nThe string is `t0 t7 t36 t14 t4 t4 t24 t21 t36 t10 t15`.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1.

Looking at the list:\n\nWait, I see NT44 in the production for NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So NT44 is a non-terminal. Hmm, but in the grammar, perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, looking back, yes: NT55 -> NT44 NT56, and NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So NT44 is a non-terminal that must be expanded. So, can it ever produce a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I don't see any NT that directly produces a terminal with '44' as part of it, except maybe through combinations. Wait, perhaps NT55 is 't5' somewhere, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me see if any of the NTs producing terminal t's could connect to the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t0`, so how can that be produced?

Alternatively, maybe it's produced by some other NT through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking at the productions again:\n\nI see that NT1 -> 't24', which is a terminal. But nowhere is 't0' a terminal. So perhaps `t0` comes from some other NT, but I don't see any NT that directly produces 't0'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the NTs, NT3 is \"NT68 NT46\" with NT68 being 't3'. Wait, no, looking back, the productions say:\n\nLooking through the NTs, for example, NT70 -> 't17' and 't7'. No NT directly produces 't0' as a terminal. So if the string starts with `t0`, that's a problem because the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produces 't0' as a terminal.\n\nWait, unless the string is somehow incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT that produces `t0` is present in the grammar but I overlooked it. Let me go through each production again to check.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT2 -> 't12'\n- NT3 -> 't36' (since it's NT68 't3' and NT46 't4')\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT5 -> 't20'\n- NT6 -> 't1 NT22' \u2192 so it's two non-terminals, no terminal here.\n- NT7 -> 't13 NT36'\n- NT8 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's important because parsers for CNF are more straightforward, but for this problem, I might not need a parser; instead, I can use the structure of the grammar and the string to figure it out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t7 t29 t4 t15 t0 t17 t1 t9 t21 t0 t13`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Let me look at the grammar rules provided. Each non-terminal can expand into either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual terminals: t7, t29, t4, t15, t0, t17, t1, t9, t21, t0, t13. \n\nI notice that not all of these are in the right-hand side of any production rules, so perhaps the string is longer than necessary, or maybe some of these are in the middle of the derivation.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct how this string could be formed. Since the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S should generate something starting with NT56 followed by NT45. Let's see what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT56 is defined as NT69 NT44. So NT56 expands to NT69 NT44.\n\nNow, let's see NT69. The production for NT69 is NT63 NT49. So NT69 becomes NT63 NT49.\n\nNext, NT63 is 't9' (from NT70's production, but wait, NT63's production is 't6'? Wait, no, I'm looking at the productions: NT63 \u2192 't9'?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT63 -> 't9'.\n\nYes, NT63 is a terminal 't9'. So that's straightforward. \n\nThen, NT49 is 't15'. Let me check:\n\nNT49 -> 't15'.\n\nYes, in the productions, NT49 \u2192 't15'.\n\nSo combining NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 (NT63 NT49) (NT44). NT44 is not a terminal. Looking at the productions, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nNT26 can be either 't4' or 't29' depending on the rule.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT26 has two productions:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nand\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nNo, wait, looking again, actually, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, under NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3 \u2192 Hmm, this seems redundant. Or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT26 is defined as:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nIs that the only production? Or was I looking somewhere else?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nalso, another rule: NT26 -> NT36 NT3. Hmm, that's the same as the previous one. Maybe it's a typo or something, but perhaps it's just one rule with different versions, but I think it's a mistake. Anyway, maybe it's better if I check each rule step by step.\n\nLet me proceed. So after NT56, I have NT63 NT49, which are t9 and t15, respectively. So far, we have t9 t15.\n\nNow, next is NT44. NT44 is defined as:\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26.\n\nSo NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. Let's see what NT3 is.\n\nNT3 can be either NT55 or NT50. Looking at NT3:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT55 NT50.\n\nWait, NT3 is rewritten as NT55 NT50, not NT50 NT55. Wait, no: Checking the production under NT3:\n\nNT3: It says NT3 \u2192 NT50 NT55. Or wait, looking at the grammar, under NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT55 NT50.\n\nYes, so NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT50. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nSo NT55 has several productions. Looking back, under NT55:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45.\n\nWait, that's the same as the starting symbol S.\n\nWait, that's interesting because S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and then NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, which led us into this deeper expansion. So perhaps the parse tree is becoming very deep, which is okay in a context-free grammar.\n\nBut let me continue. So NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nThen, NT56 again: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nWait a minute, this feels recursive. Because earlier, we had S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT69 NT44) (NT45). Then NT45 is... looking at NT45:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT45, do we have a production? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the list: NT45 can be:\n\n- NT1 -> NT63 NT7\n\nWait, no, NT3: I think I mixed up NT3. Wait, checking NT45.\n\nWait, the grammar under NT45 has:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I can see several NT45 productions.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions where NT45 appears.\n\nLooking through the grammar list provided:\n\n- NT45 -> 't4' (I think I missed this earlier)\n\nWait, yes, under NT45: \n\nNT45 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo NT45 is a terminal. So in the case of NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, which is a non-terminal, and then NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nBut in our initial expansion, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 expands to NT69 NT44, and NT45 is 't4'. So S \u2192 t9 (from NT63), t15 (from NT49), then NT44 continues as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I got a bit lost. Let me try to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nLet me re-identify each component:\n\nThe whole string is t7 t29 t4 t15 t0 t17 t1 t9 t21 t0 t13.\n\nBreaking it down in terms of grammar rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo S starts with NT56 and then NT45.\n\nLet\u2019s first focus on NT56. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'.\n\nNT49 \u2192 't15'.\n\nSo so far, from NT56 and NT45, we have t9 t15 followed by the content of NT44.\n\nNow, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nLet\u2019s see what NT3 is. NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT50.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nWait, but that's the same as S. So NT55 and NT56 again. But that seems like a loop.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to parse the string from the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to try to find a parse tree that matches the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since this is getting complex, perhaps I can think in terms of the possible terminals and their origins.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with t7, ends with t13.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the terminals that appear are:\n\nt0: appears in NT1 \u2192 't24' ??? Wait, no, sorry, I need to check.\n\nWait, all the terminals in the grammar are listed at the end, each with their corresponding string.\n\nLooking down the list, for example:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT45 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't13'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT50 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but this includes t0, t1, t2, etc.\n\nLooking through all the terminals:\n\nLooking at each production, when the RHS is a terminal, here's a list of all terminal strings:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-192","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t9 t33 t10 t17 t0 t26 t32 t10 t26 t21 t34 t15`, and I have the respective grammar provided. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form of CFG where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, all productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, and the only productions start with S. Wait, no, actually S is the start symbol, and the first production is S -> NT56 NT45. So all productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 a terminal. That fits CNF because it's two non-terminals on the RHS or a terminal.\n\nNow, my task is to see if the string `t9 t33 t10 t17 t0 t26 t32 t10 t26 t21 t34 t15` can be derived from S.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nI need to parse the string using the grammar. Each step involves replacing a non-terminal with its two production parts until only terminals remain. The string should be exactly the terminals after all productions.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see possible matches. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are the 't' followed by a number, and also 't17', 't24', etc. Wait, no, the productions are defined as NT... \u2192 something, and some of those are replaced by terminals. So, I need to check if the given string can be a result of these productions.\n\nStarting with the string: t9 t33 t10 t17 t0 t26 t32 t10 t26 t21 t34 t15.\n\nFirst, the length is 12. In CNF, the number of symbols in the string (excluding the start non-terminal) should be 2^n -1, where n is the number of productions. But since I don't know n, maybe it's better to proceed by trying to see possible ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reconstruct the derivation starting from S and seeing if we can form the string. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with t9. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production that produces t9. \n\nLooking through the productions, the rule NT68 \u2192 't6' is one, but 't9' is also a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n- NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT53 \u2192 NT42 NT3 (Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar as presented is a list of productions. Let me note which non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT68 can produce 't25' because there's NT68 \u2192 NT25 NT39? Wait, no. Wait, the grammar as listed:\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nWait, maybe I should make a list of all rules where the RHS is a terminal. Wait, actually, in CNF, the RHS can be terminals, but in the given grammar, I think all RHSs are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in the grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. These are non-terminals. NT68 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. So NT68 can produce 't3' as per the production.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the other productions:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't10'\n- NT6 \u2192 't22'\n- NT61 \u2192 't27'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT50 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, the terminals are 't3', 't4', 't10', 't17', etc. The string given includes t9, t33, t10, etc. Wait, t10 is a terminal? Looking at the grammar, yes, NT66 \u2192 't10' so 't10' is terminal.\n\nBut in the string, t9 is the first element. So is t9 a terminal or a non-terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, is t9 a terminal or a non-terminal?\n\nLooking at the productions again, none of the rules have a RHS of 't9' except one of the non-terminals being produced. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through, for example, NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all the rules where the RHS is a terminal. So:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't25'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT34 \u2192 't24'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT66 \u2192 't10'\n- NT6 \u2192 't22'\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n- NT13 \u2192 't24'\n- NT50 \u2192 't3'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT59 \u2192 't34'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT50 \u2192 't20'\n- NT48 \u2192 't2'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32'\n- NT35 \u2192 't9'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT7 \u2192 't24'\n- NT31 \u2192 't50'\n- NT55 \u2192 't56'\n- NT44 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, so from this, the terminals are numbers, like 't3', 't10', etc. So 't9' must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't9'. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nThe production NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. So the RHS is two non-terminals. Wait, does any rule produce 't9' as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- Wait, I don't see any rule where RHS is 't9'. But wait, let me check carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- Wait, no. So if 't9' is part of a derivation, it must come from a non-terminal that can be rewritten into 't9'.\n\nWait, looking at NT63 \u2192 't6'? Or is there a rule that produces 't9' from NT35?\n\nWait, NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which are non-terminals. And we need to see what those produce.\n\nWait, looking at all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking for where the RHS can produce 't9':\n\nWait, looking through, NT35's RHS is NT42 and NT3. So if NT42 can produce something that leads to 't9', or if any rule for NT42 can ultimately produce 't9'.\n\nWait, NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68.\n\nAnd NT46 \u2192 NT7 NT21.\n\nSo NT46 \u2192 NT7 and NT21.\n\nBut NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36.\n\nAnd NT13 \u2192 NT24 NT68.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree bottom-up or top-down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simulate a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe string to derive is: t9 t33 t10 t17 t0 t26 t32 t10 t26 t21 t34 t15.\n\nLet me start with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo S becomes NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, I need to expand NT56 and NT45 to terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, this is getting deep.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Context-free grammars are defined by production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side can consist of other non-terminals and terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. It seems like these are terminal symbols. Each part of the string might correspond to a derivation from the top symbol S.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string should start with these two non-terminals. Wait, the string starts with \"t33 t15 t14 t1...\", which includes t33. Let's check if NT56 can produce t33.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT56: it's only present in NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So NT56 can only be expanded into the combination of NT69 and NT44. Wait, no, the productions listed go from NT56 to NT69 NT44, but looking back, the grammar has S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Hmm, perhaps I need to step through the leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, the initial step is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first symbols are NT56 and NT45. We need to keep expanding until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLet's start:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNow, expand NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo now, the string becomes NT69 NT44 NT45.\n\nNow, we can choose between expanding NT69, NT44, or NT45.\n\nNT69's production: looking through the rules, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, the string is NT63 NT49 NT44 NT45.\n\nNext, expand NT63. Looking at the rules, NT63's productions include NT61 NT22 (from NT63 \u2192 NT61 NT22), NT47 NT20 (from NT63 \u2192 NT47 NT20), NT45 NT39 (from NT63 \u2192 NT45 NT39), etc.\n\nAlternatively, any other NT63 rules? Let me check. Oh, there's also NT63 \u2192 NT45 NT5.\n\nWait no, looking back, the rules for NT63 are:\n\nNT63 -> NT61 NT22\n\nNT63 -> NT47 NT20\n\nNT63 -> NT45 NT39\n\nAnd others like NT63 \u2192 NT45 NT5 (no, actually, it's NT63 \u2192 NT45 NT39 in the given list. Wait, checking the rules again:\n\n- NT63 -> NT61 NT22\n\n- NT63 -> NT47 NT20\n\n- NT63 -> NT45 NT39\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure about the exact list. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the given rules, I see NT63 -> NT45 NT39, and also NT63 -> NT45 NT5? No, wait, in the provided grammar, there's a line \"NT63 -> NT45 NT39\" and \"NT63 -> NT45 NT5\" maybe? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the list includes:\n\n- NT45 -> t4\n\n- NT63 -> NT45 NT39\n\nSo that's one. Also, looking for NT63:\n\nWait, I don't see another NT63 production except these, maybe I missed. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking through all the NT63 lines:\n\n- NT63 -> NT61 NT22\n\n- NT63 -> NT47 NT20\n\n- NT63 -> NT45 NT39\n\n- NT45 -> t4\n\nWait, so when NT63 is being expanded, what are the options? Let me check:\n\nNo, NT63 only has those three production rules. So from NT63, we can choose to expand to NT61 NT22, NT47 NT20, or NT45 NT39.\n\nLet me pick one. Hmm, maybe NT63 \u2192 NT45 NT39 would be useful since one of the options leads to t45 and another to t39, which might be useful later. Let me try that.\n\nSo replacing NT63 with NT45 NT39:\n\nNow, the string is NT45 NT39 NT44 NT45.\n\nWait, but NT45 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT45 produces. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT45 appears in S's production as S \u2192 NT56 NT45, but looking through other rules, NT45 \u2192 ?\n\nYes, looking at the rules, there's \"NT45 -> t4\". So that's a terminal, so NT45 becomes t4.\n\nSo replacing NT45 with t4, the string becomes t4 NT39 NT44 t4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me see.\n\nWait, the current string after expansion is NT45 NT39 NT44 NT45.\n\nSo expanding each NT45:\n\nNT45 becomes t4, so each NT45 \u2192 t4.\n\nSo the string becomes t4 t39 NT44 t4 NT45 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, each NT45 in the string needs to be expanded. So the string is NT45 (t4) NT39 NT44 NT45 (t4). So after expanding both NT45s, we get t4 t39 NT44 t4.\n\nNow, NT44 is another non-terminal. Let's expand NT44. Looking through the rules, NT44 \u2192 NT56 NT4? Let's check:\n\nWait, the rules include NT44 -> NT3 NT26 (from NT44 -> NT3 NT26), and others. Let me check: NT44's productions are:\n\nFrom given rules:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nYes, that's the only production for NT44. So NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo replacing NT44 with NT3 NT26, the string becomes t4 t39 NT3 NT26 t4.\n\nNow, NT3 is a non-terminal. Let's expand NT3.\n\nNT3's productions: the rules include NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, and also NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 (from \"NT33 -> NT3 NT55\" if I'm mistaken, but wait, looking back, \"NT3 -> NT3 NT55\". Yes, that's a rule.\n\nWait, more accurately, the grammar as provided has lines like:\n\n\"NT36 -> NT3 NT55\"\n\nWait, but let me look for NT3's rules:\n\nLooking through the entire list, the only NT3 production is NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55. So NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which allows for multiple expansions.\n\nWait, but I also see that there's another rule: \"NT35 -> NT54 NT5\" and others, but not NT3. So it's possible that NT3 can only derive itself infinitely, but perhaps that's not the case here if another production exists. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again: under the NT3 line, I see \"NT3 -> NT3 NT55\". So that's one rule. Is there another rule for NT3? I think that's the only one. So it seems that NT3 can only be replaced by itself and NT55, allowing for an infinite repetition, which would create an infinitely long string. But in our case, the string is finite, so this path might not be suitable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a wrong turn earlier. Let me backtrack a bit.\n\nWe had:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT45 NT39 (choosing this)\n\nThen, after expanding, we had t4 (NT45 expansion), then NT39, then NT44, and another NT45 which also becomes t4.\n\nNow, NT44 -> NT3 NT26.\n\nThen, NT3 needs to expand, but as above, this could go on infinitely unless there's another rule that allows for termination.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, is there a rule where NT3 produces a terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, I know that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), it's a context-free grammar where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t's with numbers, and each t might correspond to a terminal in the grammar. I think each t is a terminal symbol, and the letters like S, NT*, and numbers are non-terminals. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S produces NT56 and NT45. So, the start is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Wait, that's a production where S splits into two parts: NT56 and NT45. That means the string is a concatenation of these two parts. \n\nSo the string given is t26 t33 t10 ... etc. I need to see if these tokens can be derived from NT56 and NT45. \n\nLet's break the string into two parts based on the split from S. The first part would correspond to NT56, which I believe is produced by another non-terminal, and the second part would correspond to NT45. So I need to check if each part can be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Wait, but in the given productions, NT56 is a non-terminal, so I think it's part of the non-terminals. But I need to see how NT56 can be expanded. Let me check if NT56 has a production. Oh, I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Hmm, not sure if that's the case. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, I don't see NT56 as a non-terminal. Wait, wait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar list starts with S, then NT22, NT61, etc. I don't see NT56 in the list of non-terminals. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the list again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list, the non-terminals include S, NT22, NT61, etc., but I don't see NT56 listed as a non-terminal. Hmm, that might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps NT56 is a terminal? No, because in the string we have t26, which is in the list as a terminal, like t5, t6, etc. So wait, maybe NT56 is a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions are all terminals or non-terminals. So NT56 is a production? Or is it a non-terminal? In the given grammar, after S, the productions have NT*, like NT22, etc. So I think NT56 is a non-terminal. But in the list provided, I don't see NT56 as a non-terminal, so perhaps it's missing. That might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo in the question or the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S splits into NT56 and NT45. Both of these must be non-terminals, but looking through the grammar, I don't see NT56 or NT45 listed as non-terminals. That's confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the grammar? Or perhaps NT56 is a terminal? But in the string we have t26, t33, etc., which are terminals. So NT56 is a non-terminal, but it doesn't have a production, so it can't generate anything, which would make the entire start production impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The production S \u2192 NT56 NT45 implies that both NT56 and NT45 must be non-terminals and have productions. But in the given grammar, I don't see any productions for NT56 or NT45. That would mean that the grammar cannot generate any string starting with the tokens derived from these non-terminals. Therefore, the string \"t26...\" cannot be generated because the initial split from S is impossible without further productions.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list the non-terminals again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, from S \u2192 NT56 NT45, both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals. Then, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44? Wait, I don't see that in the grammar. Wait, let me check each line:\n\nThe lines are:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nWait, okay, I see that NT56 is a non-terminal and has a production NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nThen, NT69 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT69's production, I don't see a line starting with NT69. Wait, the lines go up, like NT61, NT50, etc. Let me see if I have all lines correctly.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, after S, there are several NT entries, but maybe I missed NT69. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT22 \u2192 ...\n\nNT54 \u2192 ...\n\nNT68 \u2192 ...\n\nNT61 \u2192 ...\n\nNT21 \u2192 ...\n\nNT50 \u2192 ...\n\nNT3 \u2192 ...\n\nNT5 \u2192 ...\n\nNT36 \u2192 ...\n\nNT47 \u2192 ...\n\nNT42 \u2192 ...\n\nNT71 \u2192 ...\n\nNT31 \u2192 ...\n\nNT55 \u2192 ...\n\nNT49 \u2192 ...\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nThen, after that, more productions, including NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted earlier. So, NT69 has a production: looking for NT69 \u2192 something. The line NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, I need to check if all these non-terminals have productions.\n\nSo, processing step by step.\n\nThe string to process is t26 t33 t10 t29 t3 t0 t13 t15 t2 t5 t3 t37 t28.\n\nSince S generates NT56 and NT45, the string must be composed of the tokens generated from NT56 and NT45 in sequence. So we split the string into two parts: first part must come from NT56, and the second from NT45. Alternatively, both parts must come from NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nBut how long is the string? 13 tokens. Let's see: if NT56 generates a certain number of tokens, say a, and NT45 generates b, then a + b must equal 13. Let's see the possible breakdowns.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is a binary split (A \u2192 BC). The string is a series of t's, so each t is a terminal. So each step of the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until the leaves are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for a parse tree that generates the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to trace backward from the tokens to see if they can be reduced to S.\n\nLet me see if t26 can be matched to a production. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT26 \u2192 t26. Yes, line: NT26 \u2192 t26.\n\nSimilarly, t33: looking for a production of non-terminals that produce t33. Checking the grammar, I don't immediately see a production for NT33, but perhaps a non-terminal that eventually produces t33.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to factor the string into parts that can be built up from the productions.\n\nStart with the first token: t26. Since NT26 \u2192 t26, that's simple. So, the first step could be NT26 produces t26.\n\nThen, after t26, we have t33. So looking for a production where the next non-terminal can produce t33 and perhaps combine with t26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split from S is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All the productions here seem to be of the form NT followed by two other NTs except the ones ending with a terminal like 't5' or 't30'.\n\nLooking at the top-level production, the start symbol S generates NT56 and NT45.

{"custom_id":"request-229","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I should write down the grammar rules and the string to analyze. The string is: `t2 t32 t32 t14 t26 t20 t9 t6 t17 t36 t1 t14 t27 t3`. That's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure should make it easier to parse the string, perhaps using a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm or checking the length of the string against the grammar's structure.\n\nBut since I'm just trying to figure this out manually, maybe I should look for a derivation path that produces the given string. Let me see the initial production: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So any string derived from S must start with NT56 and then NT45. Wait, no, in the given string, the first token is t2. But looking at the rules, I don't see a production for NT56 or NT45 leading directly to t2. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, S produces NT56 NT45. So the first token after S would be the result of NT56 and NT45. So the first step is that S becomes NT56 NT45. Then, each of these can either expand further or produce a terminal.\n\nLet me check NT56 and NT45. From the rules: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46. So after S, the first two tokens come from NT56 and NT45, which then expand to more non-terminals. But in the given string, the first token is t2, which doesn't match any terminal directly from the start. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the string.\n\nWait, the string consists of tokens, each possibly representing a terminal or non-terminal? Or is each token a terminal symbol? Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, for example, so each production of a non-terminal seems to split into two non-terminals, which would eventually produce the terminals.\n\nSo in the string, each \"tX\" is a terminal. So the string is a sequence of 14 tokens starting with t2. But the first production after S is NT56 and NT45, which would split into more non-terminals. So unless there's a direct production of NT56 to t2, which I don't see, maybe the string starts with a t2, which isn't possible from S, because S is NT56 NT45. So unless there's a way for NT56 to produce t2, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT56 that leads directly to a t. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, which in turn would have to produce t's through their own expansions.\n\nSo if the string starts with t2, maybe it's possible that in the derivation, S expands into something that produces t2. Let me check if t2 can appear anywhere in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, t2 appears in NT62, perhaps? Let me check. Wait, wait, let me go through each non-terminal and see if t2 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, t2 appears as NT62 \u2192 NT4 NT10. Wait, no, the tokens are in the string, so looking for t2 in the grammar. Wait, in the given grammar, t2 appears in several rules, but for non-terminals. Let me check each production for t2.\n\nWait, no\u2014the symbols in the grammar are non-terminals, except for the 'tX's, which I believe are terminals. For example, NT18 \u2192 't27', meaning that NT18 can produce the terminal 't27'. Similarly, NT25 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo, the string starts with t2. I need to see if t2 can be the result of any non-terminal's expansion starting from S.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT56 NT45. Let's see the possible expansions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 expands further. Similarly, NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNow, looking at NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Then NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT70 \u2192 't17'. So perhaps one path could involve NT63 producing t17 and another non-terminal. But our string starts with t2, which doesn't seem to happen here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the string is too long and the grammar isn't allowing such a long string. But without knowing the grammar's specifics, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the string contains a terminal that isn't reachable from S.\n\nWait, another way: since the string starts with t2, and the start symbol S (and any non-terminals derived from it) can't produce t2 directly because all the initial productions of S produce non-terminals. So unless some non-terminal eventually produces t2, but looking through the grammar, is there any non-terminal that can produce 't2' directly?\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see each non-terminal that can produce t2 as a base symbol:\n\nLooking for NT... \u2192 't2' or 't2...' anywhere.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT25 \u2192 't10', NT26 \u2192 't4' and 't29', etc. Let me list the rules where a non-terminal can produce a terminal:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't27'\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4', 't29'\n- NT3 \u2192 't55'\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- NT5 \u2192 't1'\n- NT6 \u2192 't12'\n- NT7 \u2192 't24'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT9 \u2192 't36'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n- NT13 \u2192 't24'\n- NT15 \u2192 't13' (Wait, I don't see NT15 in the given grammar. Let me check. Oh, actually, the grammar provided doesn't include NT15, so I can ignore that.)\n\nLooking for 't2' in any of these: I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't2'. Unless it's through a chain where a non-terminal eventually leads to 't2', but looking at all the rules, none seem to have a production where a non-terminal directly outputs t2.\n\nTherefore, the first token being 't2' suggests that the start symbol S can directly produce it, but in the given grammar, S only produces NT56 and NT45, which don't lead to t2 directly. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar, because the first step would have to produce non-terminals that don't result in t2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to have the entire string start with t2 through a different path. Let me try to think if any non-terminal can produce t2. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is invalid because it cannot start with t2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the NT have expansions that include t2. Let me check if any rules have t2 on the RHS.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT62? No, the string is given, but the grammar provided doesn't have such a rule. Wait, in the given grammar, do any of the non-terminals produce t2? I don't see any. So non-terminals can't produce t2 on their own. Therefore, the initial expansion must start with t2 from somewhere, but since S only expands into non-terminals, and those non-terminals don't produce t2 directly, it's impossible.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-224","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has certain properties, like every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of productions, each with non-terminals on the left and either non-terminals or terminals on the right. I notice that some non-terminals on the left are generating terminals, like NT1 -> 't24'. So the start symbol is S, looking at the first production: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. That means S is a non-terminal that needs to expand into two other non-terminals, NT56 and NT45.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t7 t14 t3 t15 t32 t15 t9 t5 t20 t5 t33 t10 t5 t0`. So it's a sequence of terminals, which I think corresponds to the terminals in the grammar. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of derivation produces exactly two symbols when expanding a non-terminal, or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal. So I might need to build a parse tree where each internal node has exactly two children.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't7', which I think is a terminal. Let's check if any non-terminal in the grammar directly generates 't7'. Looking through the productions, I see NT71 -> 't7' and NT70 -> 't28' but also NT70 \u2192 't7' maybe? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I see NT70 has two productions: NT70 -> 't17' and NT70 -> 't7'. So for example, NT70 can derive either 't17' or 't7'. But in the string, the first symbol is 't7', so it might come from NT70. Or also, other non-terminals might derive 't7', but I need to check.\n\nWait, looking through all productions, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\nNT70 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo yes, NT70 can produce 't7' or 't17'. So if the first symbol is 't7', it might have come from NT70.\n\nBut in CNF, the derivations proceed in a way that each step either combines two non-terminals or replaces one with a terminal. Since the first symbol is a terminal, perhaps the first production is NT70 \u2192 't7', meaning that in the first step, NT70 directly produces 't7'.\n\nBut wait, the starting point is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. So S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then, each of these non-terminals will be expanded further. The entire string is composed of 14 symbols, which suggests that there are 13 steps of production (since each step adds one symbol, starting from one symbol as S, then two, etc.). Alternatively, each terminal in the string must come from a production that directly replaces a non-terminal.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to think about the possible derivation of this string. Let's consider the entire string as a sequence of 14 terminals, so the derivation would require 14-1=13 productions.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF either produces a terminal or two non-terminals, the string must be exactly the sequence of terminals generated by the leftmost derivation. So we can try to see if the string can be split into the leftmost non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at the grammar and see what each non-terminal can produce.\n\nBut this might take a while since the grammar is quite large. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into substrings that each correspond to a production.\n\nLet me look at each symbol and see what non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see if they appear in any production.\n\nThe symbols are: t7, t14, t3, t15, t32, t15, t9, t5, t20, t5, t33, t10, t5, t0.\n\nI need to see if any non-terminals can produce these.\n\nFirst, t7: as before, NT70 can produce 't7' or 't17'.\n\nt14: Looking through the grammar, is there a production that gives 't14'? Let me check. I see NT71 -> 't14', so yes, NT71 can produce t14.\n\nt3: Looking at NT28 -> t36, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I see NT36 -> 't25', but let's look for 't3'. Wait, in the list, there's NT35 -> NT42 NT3. So that's producing '3' as the third symbol.\n\nWait, but looking for 't3' as a terminal. I see NT13 -> 't24', but 't3' is not a terminal in the grammar unless... Wait, let me go through the grammar again to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't3'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT22 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT22 is producing two non-terminals.\n\nI don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't3'. Hmm, unless I'm misunderstanding the notation. Wait, 't3' is a terminal. So perhaps some non-terminal NT3 produces it. Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't3'. Because most productions like NT22 go to NT56 and NT45, but I don't see a NT3 \u2192 't3' or something similar. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, so let me check each production for the terminals. For example, NT36 -> 't25', which is terminal. But where is 't3' defined?\n\nWait, maybe 't3' is produced by a non-terminal. Let me check: for example, NT21 -> NT49 NT31; no. NT25 -> 't10', so 't10' is another terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps 't3' is part of a non-terminal's production that eventually produces a terminal. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT3: It has two productions, both involving NT1. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 or NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT4. So both productions are non-terminals, so NT3 can never produce a terminal. Therefore, in the given string, 't3' must come from another non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nWait, in the given string, the third symbol is 't3'. So that would mean that the third symbol is a terminal. So perhaps there is a non-terminal that can derive 't3'.\n\nLooking again, let's see:\n\nThe productions:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT25 \u2192 't10', so combining them, NT36 can produce 't10' as part of a non-terminal chain.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for 't3', which is a terminal. So maybe I need to check if any non-terminal directly produces 't3'.\n\nLooking through the productions again:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 NT25 NT26\n- NT71 \u2192 't14' and 't7'\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT3\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- Wait, maybe NT21 \u2192 NT13 NT31, and NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any non-terminal that can directly produce 't3'. Oh, I see here: NT36 \u2192 't25', but that's 't25', not 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't3' is part of NT36 \u2192 't25' and then NT25 \u2192 't10' \u2192 but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT46 \u2192 't4', which might be derived from NT46:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT46 is a non-terminal, and if it can produce a terminal, but in the given string, the terminal 't4' might come from NT46.\n\nWait, but in the string, I don't see 't4' except for the 12th symbol (t5), 13th is t0, so perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, maybe 't3' comes from NT26, which can produce 't4' or 't29'.

{"custom_id":"request-243","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t17 t33 t26 t5 t21 t13 t28 t13 t36 t4 t36 t2 t13 t1 t36`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, S expands into NT56 followed by NT45. Both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so each will expand further.\n\nLooking at NT56: The productions for NT56 are only one production, NT69 NT44. So NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNow, NT69 can be expanded. Looking at the productions, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT44 has a production NT3 NT26. So NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nNow, substituting back, NT56 \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nNext, NT63 has productions NT26 NT3. Wait, no, looking back: NT63's productions are not in the given grammar. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, NT63 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, is there a production for NT63? Yes, I see NT63 \u2192 NT26 NT70. So NT63 \u2192 NT26 NT70.\n\nBut wait, NT26 has a production NT36 NT3. NT70 can be NT17 or NT69? Wait, looking at the grammar: NT70 \u2192 't17'. So NT70 is a terminal. So for NT63:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT26 NT70.\n\nBut NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nSo expanding NT63: NT26 NT70 \u2192 (NT36 NT3) NT70.\n\nBut NT36 is a non-terminal with productions, like NT47 NT20. And NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which is a recursive rule, but let me see how that plays out.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to construct the string step by step.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nNow, let's expand each non-terminal:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT26 NT70.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT26 NT70 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nNT70 is a terminal: 't17'. So that part is done.\n\nNow, let's process each part:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nSo replacing NT26, we get NT36 NT3 NT70 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nNT36 can be expanded. Looking at the productions, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nSo NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nSubstituting back, S \u2192 NT25 NT70 NT70 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nNow, NT25 \u2192 NT10.\n\nSo NT25 \u2192 NT10.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT10 NT70 NT70 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nNT10 \u2192 't28' (from NT10 \u2192 't28').\n\nSo S \u2192 't28' NT70 NT70 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, but NT10 is 't28', so that's the first token in the string: 't28'. But the first token in the given string is 't17'. Oh, that's a problem because we started with S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which leads to 't28' first. But the string starts with 't17', so that must mean S \u2192 NT56 NT45 doesn't expand to 't17' but perhaps another production.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking back, wait, the grammar's first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, but maybe there's a way to start with another production. Wait, no, the starting symbol is S, which only goes to NT56 NT45. So how can the string start with 't17'? Because S's expansion starts with NT56 NT45, which, upon expansion, produces something else.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at NT70, it directly expands to 't17'. So any occurrence of NT70 in the derivation will contribute 't17' to the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 expands to 't4' directly, as per the production NT26 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, but in the expansion I did earlier, I had NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, which then branched into further non-terminals. But there's also a production NT26 \u2192 't4'. So I should consider both possibilities.\n\nLet me start over, more carefully.\n\nThe string is: t17 t33 t26 t5 t21 t13 t28 t13 t36 t4 t36 t2 t13 t1 t36.\n\nSo the first token is 't17'. Looking for where 't17' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT31 \u2192 't28' (from NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50; NT50 \u2192 't3'? Wait no, NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8, but looking else:\n\nWait, looking at NT10 \u2192 't28'. And NT70 \u2192 't17'. So both are terminals.\n\nIn the string, the first token is 't17', which is produced by NT70. So perhaps the initial expansion begins with NT70 somewhere.\n\nBut the starting symbol is S, which initially expands to NT56 NT45, which in turn expands to NT69 NT44, then to NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to see if the string can be built starting from S, but perhaps the initial expansion isn't as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be divided into parts that correspond to different non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt17, t33, t26, t5, t21, t13, t28, t13, t36, t4, t36, t2, t13, t1, t36.\n\nSo the first 't17' could come from NT70. So in the derivation, at some point, there's a NT70.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT70 can come from either NT26 NT36 (if I'm remembering correctly, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the user's grammar input:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nSo NT70 is a terminal that produces 't17'. So the entire NT70 is a terminal. So to get 't17', a production must have NT70 as a result.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nYes, so NT70 is a terminal with value 't17'. So in the string, 't17' comes from NT70.\n\nThen, the string starts with 't17', which is from NT70.\n\nSo perhaps the initial expansion somehow includes NT70.\n\nBut since S initially expands to NT56 NT45, which then expand further, maybe the NT70 is generated through another path.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the expansion leads somewhere else. Let me see:\n\nLet me see what else could lead to 't17'.\n\nLooking, only NT70 and possibly others, but I don't see others. So 't17' must come from NT70.\n\nSo how can NT70 appear in the derivation?\n\nNT70 is not a non-terminal that can expand further. It's a terminal. So in the parse tree, how can NT70 be derived?\n\nWait, perhaps in an earlier step, a non-terminal expands into NT70.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal expands to NT70. Instead, NT70 is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-250","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite extensive with multiple non-terminals, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has two main characteristics:\n1. Each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n2. The start symbol does not appear on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT56 NT56 or NT22 -> NT63 NT48, or some have terminals like NT70 -> 't5' or 't17'. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: `t37 t36 t33 t17 t7 t9 t9 t32 t25 t0 t37 t28 t27 t34 t20`.\n\nI think the approach should be to try to construct the string step by step using the grammar's productions. This might involve working backwards from the string, trying to parse it according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a sequence of productions that can generate this string. Let me list out the tokens and see if I can match them to the grammar's terminals.\n\nThe tokens in the string are: t37, t36, t33, t17, t7, t9, t9, t32, t25, t0, t37, t28, t27, t34, t20.\n\nI wonder if each token corresponds to a specific production. So, for example, t37 is a terminal, which means it must be produced by a rule where the right-hand side is a terminal. Looking back at the grammar, I see NT4 -> 't37', so maybe this token comes from NT4.\n\nSimilarly, t36 can be from NT36, but wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT36's productions: one is 't25', another is NT25 and NT70. So perhaps t36 comes from a different rule. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nLet me make a table of all terminals and their corresponding NTs:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT4 -> 't37'\n\nLooking for t36: Is there any NT that produces 't36'? Let me go through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given productions:\n\nNT36 appears in two cases:\n- NT36 -> NT25 NT70\n- NT36 -> NT47 NT20\n\nBut wait, I don't see any production that produces 't36' directly. Hmm. So maybe t36 is part of a longer production. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string must be generated by the grammar, I can try to work backwards step by step, applying the inverse of the productions to see if I can reduce the string to the start symbol S.\n\nEach step would involve finding a part of the string that matches the right-hand side of a production and replacing it with the left-hand side.\n\nLet's write down the string: t37 t36 t33 t17 t7 t9 t9 t32 t25 t0 t37 t28 t27 t34 t20\n\nI need to reduce this string down. Each reduction step will replace a sequence of symbols (possibly consisting of a terminal or two non-terminals) with the left-hand side of a production.\n\nLet's look for the longest possible match. Alternatively, it might be easier to start from the beginning and see if I can apply any production.\n\nLooking at the first token: t37. Which NT produces t37? Looking through the grammar, I see that NT4 -> 't37'.\n\nSo perhaps the starting symbol S can generate NT4 via some chain of productions. Wait, the start symbol is S, so I need to find a chain that starts with S and ends with t37.\n\nLooking at the productions, S -> NT56 NT56. Hmm, so the initial step from S is to split into two NT56s. That means whatever comes next must be products of NT56.\n\nSo, the string starts with t37, which is from NT4, so maybe the first part of the string is parts of NT56 leading to t37.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me try starting from the beginning of the string and see which production rules I can apply.\n\nFirst token: t37\n- This comes from NT4 as per NT4 -> 't37'.\n\nSo, can I find a production that leads to t37 being part of a chain? Maybe NT4 is part of a longer production. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT4's production is only NT4 -> 't37'. So NT4 doesn't appear in any other production as a right-hand side. That means t37 must be a terminal at the lowest level, and it can't be expanded further. So, in the parsing, if t37 is a terminal, perhaps the entire string comes from a sequence where somewhere the root S expands into something that leads to t37.\n\nBut wait, S -> NT56 NT56. So S can't directly produce a terminal. Instead, each NT56 would expand further.\n\nSo maybe I need a way to parse the string by applying the productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it would be better to process the string from the end to the beginning, trying to match each terminal with a production.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of symbols. Since every production either produces two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) or a single terminal, the length of the string must satisfy certain constraints.\n\nBut the given string is 15 tokens long, which could correspond to 15 steps, but since each step can split into two, it's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, let's consider that each non-terminal produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the total number of symbols when expanded must have a structure that follows the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol S. It splits into two NT56s: S -> NT56 NT56.\n\nSo each NT56 will have its own expansion.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo NT56 becomes two non-terminals: NT69 and NT44.\n\nNow, each of these can potentially split again.\n\nLooking at NT69: NT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT44: NT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nContinuing this, NT63-> 't9', so t9 is a terminal. NT49->'t15' (from NT49 -> 't15').\n\nWait, but maybe I need to map each token to the NTs they come from.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step from the first token.\n\nToken 1: t37 comes from NT4's production.\n\nSo perhaps the initial expansion of S leads to a path where one of the NT56s eventually produces t37 via NT4.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me trace it:\n\nStart with S: S -> NT56 NT56\n\nEach NT56 is NT56, so let's pick one and expand it until we find a terminal.\n\nSo NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 -> 't9' (a terminal)\n\nWait, that gives 't9' as the first symbol, but in the string, the first symbol is t37.\n\nSo perhaps that path is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, let's try the other NT56 in S.\n\nS -> NT56 NT56\n\nAssume we expand the other NT56 first: NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 again -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 -> 't9'\n\nAgain, that's 't9', but the first token is t37. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe another path exists.\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT56 is expanded to NT61.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 can be NT65 NT61? Wait, no, looking back, I think I might be misinterpreting.\n\nLet me list all the productions again more carefully.\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT56 are:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nWait, according to the grammar, is there a production for NT56 that leads to something else?\n\nYes, NT56's production: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, no, NT56 doesn't directly produce 't37'. So the 't37' must come from a terminal in one of the non-terminals downstream of S.\n\nWait, but if we can't expand S directly to t37, maybe the entire string can't be generated.\n\nBut that can't be the case because sometimes the grammar might have a path to reach t37 through multiple steps.

Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has certain characteristics, like every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That might help me parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me look at the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. So the first step is to split the string into parts that match NT56 and NT45. The string starts with 't6 t36 t1 t27 t17 t14 t33 t7 t15 t5 t4 t24 t34 t32 t6 t28'.\n\nWait, I need to break this string into two parts after the start symbol S. So the first part should be the expansion for NT56 and the second for NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Let me see what NT69 and NT44 produce. NT69 is from the grammar: NT69 -> NT63 NT49. Then NT63 is a terminal 't6' and NT49 -> NT22 NT66. Wait, NT22 is NT22 -> NT63 NT48, which is 't36' and NT48 -> NT25 NT39. NT25 is 't10' and NT39 -> NT33 NT21. Wait, NT33 is a terminal 't10'? Or am I mixing something up.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step. Let me list the grammar productions and terminals more clearly. I notice there are several NTs with arrows to other NTs and some that expand into terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll represent the grammar as a dictionary for clarity, mapping each non-terminal to its productions:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\nNT2 -> NT48 NT66\nNT1 -> NT63 NT7\nNT54 -> NT6 NT45\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\nNT61 -> NT18 NT59\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31\nNT7 -> NT13 NT36\nNT8 -> NT45 NT5\nNT50 -> NT25 NT8\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT55 -> NT44 NT56\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\nNT6 -> NT1 NT22\nNT61 -> NT2 NT10\nNT21 -> NT71 NT30\nNT50 -> NT54 NT4\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55\nNT5 -> NT1 NT49\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\nNT47 -> NT7 NT21\nNT42 -> NT46 NT68\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\nNT31 -> NT4 NT50\nNT55 -> NT56 NT61\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT70 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't17'\nNT18 -> 't27'\nNT26 -> 't4' and also 't29'\nNT20 -> 't6'\nNT63 -> 't9'\nNT45 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT59 -> 't34'\nNT50 -> 't3'\nNT13 -> 't24'\nNT34 -> 't24'\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT21 -> 't13'\nNT49 -> 't15'\nNT68 -> 't17' (Wait, that's conflicting with NT68's other production. Maybe it's a mistake? Or perhaps it's a typo. Let me check.)\n\nWait, no, looking back, NT68 is actually only one production: NT68 -> NT28 NT26. Hmm, so it's 't28' and 't26' perhaps? Or the numbers are part of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their expansions with terminals instead of non-terminals. Let me try that.\n\nLet me go through each NT and see if I can expand any into terminals:\n\nNT70 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't17'\nNT18 -> 't27'\nNT26 (has two productions: NT26 -> 't4' and 't29') which are terminals, so 't4' or 't29'\nNT20 -> 't6'\nNT63 -> 't9'\nNT45 -> 't4'\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT59 -> 't34'\nNT50 -> 't3'\nNT13 -> 't24' (same as NT1)\nNT34 -> 't24' (same as NT1)\nNT68 -> 't3'\nWait, but earlier production says NT68 -> NT28 NT26, which are non-terminals, so perhaps NT68 can produce 't3' only from somewhere else. Hmm, maybe there's a loop or other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the NTs with terminals. So any NT with a production where one of the components is a terminal represents a possible step.\n\nLooking back, let me see all the NTs and their production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT56 NT45\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-272","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a way to structure grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe given string is `t26 t37 t2 t37 t24 t0 t27 t28 t33 t26 t26 t32 t14 t28 t29 t15`. First, I should note that all the literals in the string are terminals, specifically lowercase 't' followed by numbers. So each token in the string is a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and the right-hand side of the first production is NT56 NT45. So S starts the derivation. Let me write that down: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, each NT symbol like NT56 and NT45 must be expanded until all are terminals. So I'll need to trace how each of these NTs can be broken down.\n\nStarting with NT56: Looking at the grammar, the rule for NT56 is NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 depends on NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (rule). Let's expand both NT63 and NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT28 NT26 (from a different rule). So NT63 is composed of NT28 and NT26.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT26 NT22? Wait, let me check: NT28's rule isn't listed in the provided grammar, but in the first part, NT26 is defined as NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, but in the grammar provided, the NT28 is defined as NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT36. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, the rules are:\n\nLooking back, I see NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, but I also see NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT36, according to the rules provided. Let me confirm: yes, in the grammar, there's NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT36.\n\nSo expanding NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT36.\n\nNow, each of these (NT26 and NT36) can be further expanded. Let's proceed.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nNT36 has two rules: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20. So we need to see which applies.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 is a production: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. Let's hold that thought.\n\nNow, going back to NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 \u2192 [NT28 NT26] and NT49.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 (from NT49's rule). So NT49 = NT22 NT66.\n\nNow, ND22: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT7. So NT22 is NT63 and NT7.\n\nBut wait NT63 is NT28 NT26, which we already have. So this might get complex, but let's keep expanding.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this in a top-down manner, starting from S and trying to build the string step by step.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long, so maybe a better approach is to count the number of steps considering the depth of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given, maybe we can determine the maximum possible depth of the string or the number of symbols expected.\n\nWait, another approach: using the fact that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So when you have a sentence, the number of symbols in the string relates to the height of the parse tree.\n\nFor a CFG in CNF, the minimum length of a string derived from a non-terminal A with a certain number of productions. The length of a string derived from the start symbol S can be up to 2^n, where n is the number of productions in the longest derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, but perhaps more straightforward is to note that each symbol in the string must be matched by a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to try to generate a parse tree that matches the string step by step.\n\nLet's start with the string: t26 t37 t2 t37 t24 t0 t27 t28 t33 t26 t26 t32 t14 t28 t29 t15.\n\nSo, it's 16 symbols long. Let me see how the grammar can produce such a string.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the first two symbols should come from NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 is NT69 followed by NT44.\n\nLooking for the start: the first two tokens in the string are t26 and t37.\n\nSo let me see if NT69 can produce t26 and something, and NT44 can produce t37 and something else.\n\nWait, but NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So the first token comes from NT63 and the second from NT49, but our first token is t26, which is in NT63's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me check the NT63 rule: NT63 \u2192 NT28 NT26. And NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT36. Then NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3. NT36 can expand further.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for the symbols in the string and see which NT they come from.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string: \n\nIndex: 0: t26\n1: t37\n2: t2\n3: t37\n4: t24\n5: t0\n6: t27\n7: t28\n8: t33\n9: t26\n10: t26\n11: t32\n12: t14\n13: t28\n14: t29\n15: t15\n\nSo 16 symbols. Now, each of these terminals must be matched by a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar's NT rules, let's see which NTs can produce t26, t37, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT26 \u2192 t26 is part of the expansion? Wait, no, because NT26's production is NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, not a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let's check each NT symbol in the string to see what non-terminals they can expand from.\n\nt26: can be produced by NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT36, but NT26 is an NT, not a terminal. So t26 is a terminal, which it is. So wait, any NT that can derive a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several NTs have terminal symbols as part of their productions. For example, NT44 has a production to 't3', as seen in line:\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nWait, no, the grammar's lines have:\n\nWait no, I'll check the grammar lines again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLine 3: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT7.\n\nNo, the line is: NT22 -> NT63 NT7.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT22 -> NT63 NT7.\n\nWait, NT22 is a non-terminal, so it's rules lead to other non-terminals. But wait, in NT22 itself, it's defined as NT63 NT7. So to get t2, which is part of the string, we need to see if any NT can derive t2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT36 \u2192 't3' is given as a rule. Because in the list, there's NT36 -> NT25 NT70, and NT36 also has other rules. Also, NT36->'t25' is not; wait, in the provided grammar, looking for txxx:\n\nLooking carefully: I see lines like NT36 \u2192 't25' is not present. Instead, I see NT36 -> NT25 NT70 and NT36 -> NT47 NT20, and another rule is NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20? Wait, let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\nLooking for 't..' terminals:\n\n- NT36 is defined as NT25 NT70 in one rule, but elsewhere, I see NT36 can produce other things. Wait, actually, in the list, looking for lines where the rhs is 't..' is important.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar lines, several NTs:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT20 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's see, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which are all the 't' symbols followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Each non-terminal on the left side produces two non-terminals on the right, and some of them produce terminal symbols. My goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t9 t33 t24 t27 t2 t0 t37 t10 t27 t20 t10 t17 t15 t5 t5 t34 t21`.\n\nHmm, that's 17 elements. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so S must produce two parts. The first part is NT56, which from the rules goes to NT69 and NT44. Let me try to expand S.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (from the production)\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\nWait, let's expand further:\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\nNT63 \u2192 't9', NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\nNT25 \u2192 't10', NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20\nNT21 \u2192 't13', NT20 \u2192... Hmm, this seems getting complicated. Let me try to figure out a possible parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part after S is 't9' which appears in NT63 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So perhaps the string starts with NT63.\n\nWait, the initial productions from S are S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Let me see what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (so that's the first symbol in the string)\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 (since NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55)\nWait, that seems like a loop. Let's see NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 \u2192 NT3 NT55\nBut NT55 can be NT56 NT45 or other rules. Wait, NT55 also has NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 and NT45\u2192 NT22 NT66. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into pairs that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 17 symbols, which is an odd number. Since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, the derivation tree must have an even number of symbols at each step except possibly the leaves. Wait, no\u2014 actually, since each expansion is two symbols, the length can vary, but odd lengths are possible if some symbols produce one terminal. But in this case, the string length is 17, which is odd, but the starting symbol S \u2192 two parts, which would eventually expand into a string where the number of symbols is the sum of the lengths of the two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps let's see: the initial symbol S produces NT56 and NT45. Each of these is a non-terminal that will produce some strings. So the total string would be the concatenation of the two strings derived from NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't9', which might come from NT63. From the grammar, NT63 is produced by NT63 \u2192 't9' or from NT63's rules. Wait, actually, NT63 \u2192 NT63 NT49, so that's a non-terminal that can produce longer strings unless there's a terminal. But there's a 't9' rule for NT63, so perhaps the first part is 't9' followed by something.\n\nWait, let's try to see if the string can be divided into two parts: maybe the first part is from NT56 and the second from NT45.\n\nBut let me look at the string again: `t9 t33 t24 t27 t2 t0 t37 t10 t27 t20 t10 t17 t15 t5 t5 t34 t21`.\n\nLet me see if I can split this string into two parts such that each part is generated by NT56 and NT45, respectively.\n\nFirst, I'll check NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: 't9' would come from NT63, so after 't9' comes 't33 t24...'. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for possible NT69 and NT44 in the string.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, so 't9' would be the first symbol. Then the rest of NT69 would be 't33 t24 t27 t2 t0 t37 t10 t27 t20 t10 t17 t15 t5 t5 t34 t21'?\n\nWait, 't33' comes from NT33. Let me check where NT33 is defined. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT33. The closest is NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. Maybe that's not helpful. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with another non-terminal. Let's consider NT55, which produces NT56 NT45. Wait, but that's the same as S.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is 17 symbols, but since each production either adds two non-terminals or a terminal, it's a bit tricky. Let me consider that the entire string could be derived from S, meaning it's a concatenation of two parts from NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, but NT45 \u2192 NT22 NT66, which in turn NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, and so on. Hmm, this might take a while.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be viewed as a sequence of symbols where each symbol is either a terminal or the result of a production. Let me see if each production can be matched.\n\nLooking at the beginning: 't9' is in NT63's productions, so perhaps the first part is NT63. But wait, S is NT56 NT45, so the first 't9' must come from NT56. Let's check NT56: it produces NT69 NT44, which then produces NT63 NT49.\n\nSo, after NT56: 't9' (from NT63), then what? NT44 produces NT3 NT26. Let's see NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which is a recursive production. So perhaps from NT55, we have a loop. This might mean that the string could have multiple 't5's, which is present towards the end.\n\nBut let's try to find a way to structure this. Wait, perhaps it's easier to see if each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, which they all seem to do, except perhaps for some that are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar's non-terminals are all the symbols with \"NT\" followed by numbers, except those that eventually produce terminals. The terminals are all 't' followed by numbers, like t9, t10, etc.\n\nSo each symbol in the string is a terminal, so the string must be entirely composed of terminals. That's correct because in the given string, all elements are 't' followed by numbers, no non-terminals.\n\nSo the entire string is a sequence of terminals. Since S is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, the entire string would have to be a result of expanding all non-terminals in S's production into terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the entire string is a single derivation from S, which splits into two parts, each part being a terminal string. So the total length would be even? Wait, but the string has 17 symbols, which is odd. Since each production adds non-terminals until they become terminals, perhaps the initial split from S into two parts could result in an odd-length string if one part is of odd length and the other is even.\n\nWait, for example: if one part is length 1 and the other is length 16, the total would be 17. Let me see.\n\nSo perhaps one part is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, with NT56 producing a single terminal 't9' and NT45 producing a string of 16 symbols.

The string is `t24 t15 t15 t32 t13 t13 t33 t33 t10 t2 t10 t5 t20 t17 t17 t2 t27`. Hmm, first, I need to understand how the grammar works and then figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. Also, every production has only two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which simplifies parsing, especially with the CYK algorithm. But I'm a bit rusty on using CYK, so maybe I'll approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the productions to have a clear view. The start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So, the string starts with symbols derived from NT56 and NT45. \n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t24 and t15. Let's see where t24 and t15 come from. I'll go through the productions:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9' (from production NT63->'t9'). NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22-> 't0' (since NT22->nt22 produce 't22' as per production NT22->'t22')? Wait, no, looking at NT22, its production is actually S -> NT56 NT45, but NT22 has its own productions. Let me check.\n\nWait, the productions for NT22 are listed as NT22 -> NT63 NT48. The string's first token is t24, so maybe one of the symbols in the path produces t24. Looking at the productions, for example, NT45 appears in multiple places. Let's check which NT productions result in t24.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT45 has multiple rules. Let's list them:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46 (which is 't3' and 't4')\n- NT45 \u2192 NT71 NT35 (which is 't17' and 't24'?)\nWait, NT35's production is NT42 NT3, so NT42 is 't4' and NT3 is 't24'. So, if NT45 \u2192 NT71 NT35, and NT71 is 't17' (from NT71->'t17'), then NT35 is 't34'. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, for each production, the right-hand side is two non-terminals. For example, NT26 -> NT36 NT3, which is 't25' and 't24'. So, NT26 can produce t25 and t24. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT13. Wait, NT32 is 't32'? Let me look into the mappings.\n\nWait, the production terminals are clearly listed as 'tX' where X is a number. For instance, NT63 \u2192 't9', NT45\u2192't4', etc. So each non-terminal, when expanded, eventually leads to some 'tX' token.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of t tokens: t24, t15, t15, t32, etc. Each of these must be the result of expanding non-terminals.\n\nThe starting point is the initial string being derived from S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first step is to have NT56 and NT45. Each of these will expand into two non-terminals.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t24, t15, t15, t32, t13, t13, t33, t33, t10, t2, t10, t5, t20, t17, t17, t2, t27.\n\nWait, actually, the string is: [t24, t15, t15, t32, t13, t13, t33, t33, t10, t2, t10, t5, t20, t17, t17, t2, t27]. So that's 17 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the derivation tree is a binary tree. The order of the string should correspond to the leftmost derivation, but without knowing the exact parse tree, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string is reachable via the productions starting from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, let's note that the first token is t24. Let me see which non-terminals can produce t24.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, which can be 't25' and 't24' since NT36 \u2192 't25' (from NT6 \u2192 't1') and NT3 \u2192 't24' (from NT3). So t24 can come from NT26.\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT13, and NT32 is 't32', NT13 is 't13', so this might not be relevant for t24.\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59, which would produce 't32' and 't34', not t24.\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT66, which would be 't6' and 't6', not relevant.\n\n- NT70 is 't17'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n\nWait, look at NT1->'t24' directly.

The string is `t20 t26 t1 t37 t29 t37 t12 t15 t25 t14 t27 t14 t21 t14 t5 t25 t12 t32`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since the terminals here are t followed by a number, that makes sense.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S produces two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. Then I need to see how these non-terminals can expand to produce the given string.\n\nLooking at the given string, it starts with t20. So I need to see if t20 can be derived from either NT56 or NT45.\n\nLet me check the rules for NT56 and NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 expands to NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. \n\nSimilarly, looking at NT45's rules: NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT4. NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26, and NT4 \u2192 t37. So if I follow that, NT45 could produce t37 via NT4, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t20. Let me trace t20's origin.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, one of them is NT20. The rule for NT20 is: NT20 \u2192 't6'. But wait, the string starts with t20, which is a different token. So maybe NT20 is not involved here. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT20's production: NT20 \u2192 't6', right? But the string starts with t20, which isn't t6. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, the string has t20, t26, etc. So perhaps the starting non-terminals need to derive to these t's.\n\nLooking again, the first step is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S produces NT56 and NT45, which need to expand into the start of the string.\n\nI'll focus on NT56 and NT45 and see if they can generate the initial t20.\n\nLet's see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\nNT25 \u2192 NT10\nNT10 \u2192 't28' from NT10 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, but the first token is t20, not t28. That suggests that maybe NT26's expansion isn't the way to go. Alternatively, maybe there's another path.\n\nWait, let's look at other NT26 rules. Wait, the user provided multiple rules for NT26. Let me check: OH, wait, in the grammar, NT26 has two rules: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and NT26 \u2192 NT29 NT23? Wait no, looking again, the provided grammar has:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT... Hmm, I'm looking at the user's grammar, and I see:\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT...\" Wait, the user wrote:\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT2...\" Wait, the user's grammar says NT26 has two productions: NT26->NT36 NT3 and NT26->NT29 NT... hmm, perhaps not. Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking, under NT26, the user wrote:\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT2...\"\n\nWait, the user's grammar has:\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT2...\" Wait, the second part is incomplete, maybe it's NT26 -> NT29 NT2? Or perhaps NT26 has another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like NT26 -> NT36 NT3 and NT26 -> NT29 NT... but the user didn't finish writing it. Wait, no, in thegrammar provided, under NT26, the first rule is NT26 -> NT36 NT3, and the second rule is NT26 -> NT29 NT2..., but perhaps it's a typo or miscalculation. Wait, I'm looking at the grammar provided, and under NT26, it's written as:\n\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT2...\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo, and perhaps one of the rules has a missing part. Wait, perhaps it's NT26 -> NT29 and NT2... something. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t20. So the first symbols are t20, t26, t1, etc. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce t20.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that directly produces a 't' with a number is those that have a rule like A \u2192 'tb', where b is a number.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, here are a few:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't37'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n- NT13 \u2192 't1'\n- NT34 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't6'\n- Wait, no. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, the nt's that produce terminals are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't12'\nNT22 \u2192 't0'\nNT1 \u2192 't24'\nNT26 \u2192 't6'\nNT13 \u2192 't24'\nNT6 \u2192 't1'\nNT71 \u2192 't14'\nNT59 \u2192 't34'\nNT25 \u2192 't10'\nNT2 \u2192 't12'\nNT36 \u2192 't25'\nNT10 \u2192 't28'\nWait, maybe I should list all nt's that produce terminals:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't12' (rule: NT2->'t12')\n- NT22 \u2192 't0' (rule: NT22-> 't0')\n- NT1 \u2192 't24' (rule: NT1-> 't24')\n- NT59 \u2192 't34' (rule: NT59->'t34')\n- NT25 \u2192 't10' (rule: NT25->'t10')\n- NT26 \u2192 't6' (because in the grammar, I think under NT26, the first rule is NT26->NT36 NT3, but wait, looking again: the user provided:\n\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT29 NT2...\"\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should go back. Let me find each nt rule that produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nEach rule starts with NT followed by something, then it has either another NT or a terminal.\n\nLet me go through them all:\n\n1.

The string is `t9 t25 t7 t10 t9 t34 t33 t33 t7 t15 t3 t28 t37 t9 t15 t25 t17 t10`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production has two components on the right side. That helps in parsing because each step reduces the number of symbols by one.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it's defined as NT56 NT45. So, the entire derivation must start with NT56 followed by NT45. Each of those NTs will be expanded until we reach the terminals (the 't' followed by numbers) which are our actual tokens.\n\nLet me try to map out the NTs and see how they can produce the given string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if there's a path through the grammar that produces this sequence.\n\nStarting with S:\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo, the first part is NT56 and the second is NT45. Let's see what NT56 and NT45 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT56: It's defined as NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, S becomes NT69 NT44 NT45.\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to be broken down further.\n\nNT69: NT63 NT49\nNT44: NT4 NT26\nNT45: NT68 NT8\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT68 NT8.\n\nNow, each of these needs expansion.\n\nNT63: NT25 NT70\nNT49: NT22 NT66\nNT68: NT28 NT26\nNT8: NT45 NT5\n\nWait, but NT8 is 't13' as per the production NT8 \u2192 't13'. So, NT8 will produce 't13'.\n\nSo, replacing NT68 with NT28NT26 and NT8 with 't13', we get:\n\nS \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT28 NT8 \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT28 't13'\n\nNow, NT63 is NT25NT70, NT49 is NT22NT66, and NT28 is NT36 NT3.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT25 NT70 NT22 NT66 NT36 NT3 NT10.\n\nWait, NT36 is 't25' because NT36 \u2192 't25' (from the production NT36 \u2192 NT25NT70, and NT25 is 't10', and NT70 is 't17', but wait, no. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. From the list, NT25 \u2192 't10' and NT70 \u2192 't17' as per NT70 \u2192 't17'. So NT36 \u2192 't25' 't17' which is 't25t17', but that's not matching the string. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's build the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe given string is: t9 t25 t7 t10 t9 t34 t33 t33 t7 t15 t3 t28 t37 t9 t15 t25 t17 t10.\n\nLet's break it down into the order of tokens: t9, t25, t7, t10, t9, t34, t33, t33, t7, t15, t3, t28, t37, t9, t15, t25, t17, t10.\n\nWait, that's 17 tokens. S starts as NT56 NT45, which should expand into a string of 17 non-terminals, each of which becomes a terminal. So, the entire string should be derived from S, which starts as NT56 NT45.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start from the given string and see if it can be reduced to S, using the grammar. But since the grammar is in CNF, reduction is easier.\n\nIn CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC. So, starting from the string and trying to find unit productions (BC where B or C is a terminal) to reduce.\n\nWait, the first token is t9. Let's look at the productions ending with t9. From the grammar:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8 \u2192 't25' 't13' \u2192 t25t13, so not t9.\n\nWait, any non-terminal that can directly produce t9?

Wait, nt46 \u2192 nt4 is 't37', nt26 is 't4' (from NT26 \u2192 't4'). So NT46 \u2192 t37 t4. So NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46 \u2192 (t28 t26) (t37 t4) \u2192 t28 t26 t37 t4. Not t9.\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully. Wait, looking at NT55's productions: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is similar to the start symbol.\n\nWait, another approach: let's build the string backward. Let's see if each terminal can be matched by the grammar.\n\nFor example, the last token is t10. Let's see where t10 comes from. The only place t10 is generated is from NT10 \u2192 't28' (from NT10's production). Wait, looking at the list: NT10 \u2192 't28'?

Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT22 \u2192 t0 and NT2 \u2192 t12, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the list of terminals, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t27\nNT26 \u2192 t4, etc., but not NT10. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, in the given grammar, let's see NT production for NT10.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT10 in the productions listed. Wait, no, looking at NT50: NT50 \u2192 NT54 NT45. NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45 \u2192 but NT45 is 't4' from NT45.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going down the wrong path here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's try to build the string from the start. Starting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Let's expand each NT step by step.\n\nS: NT56 NT45\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nSo now S: NT69 NT44 NT45\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nSo S: NT63 NT49 NT44 NT45\nNT44 \u2192 NT4 NT26 \u2192 so S: NT63 NT49 NT4 NT26 NT45\nNT45 \u2192 NT68 NT8 \u2192 so S: NT63 NT49 NT4 NT26 NT68 NT8\nNow, let's replace these NTs step by step.\n\nFirst, replace NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70:\nS: NT25 NT70 NT49 NT4 NT26 NT68 NT8\n\nNext, replace NT70 \u2192 't17':\nS becomes: NT25 't17' NT49 NT4 NT26 NT68 NT8\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the second token is t25. So after NT25, comes 't17' which doesn't match t25. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps the initial expansion is wrong.

The string is \"t37 t34 t33 t24 t28 t15 t13 t20 t33 t4 t15 t25 t14 t36 t29 t7 t25 t12 t25\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Each rule has the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, every production either connects two non-terminals or ends with a terminal. The string starts with t37, t34, etc., so there must be a derivation starting with the start symbol S and replacing it through a series of steps to produce this string.\n\nLet me start by identifying the terminal symbols in the string. The string consists of terminals t37, t34, t33, t24, t28, t15, t13, t20, t33, t4, t15, t25, t14, t36, t29, t7, t25, t12, t25. These must be represented by the terminals in the grammar's productions.\n\nI notice that t36 appears multiple times. In the given grammar, I look for production rules that produce t36. Scanning through, I find NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70 and NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20. But wait, looking again, the provided grammar includes:\n\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\nNT61 -> NT22 NT18 (and others)\nNT36 also appears as:\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\nNT61 -> NT21 NT31\nAnd in the string, t36 appears as part of the string, so I need to see if any NT36 can produce a t36?\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT36 is a non-terminal, and in NT36's production, I don't see a rule that ends with a terminal like t36. Instead, NT36 can only produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals until you hit terminals.\n\nLooking back, the string includes t36, which must come from a production of NT36 \u2192 NTxxxx NTyyyy, where one of the non-terminals is a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. I'm looking for any production that has t36 as a terminal. But the grammar seems to have many NTs but I don't see any terminal 't36' as the right-hand side of any rule. Oh, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\nNT61 -> NT22 NT18\nNT18 -> 't27'\nHmm, but the string has t13, t24, t20, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, I see t7 is present. Looking at production rules, NT70 -> 't17', and NT71 -> 't14'. I also see NT70 -> 't17', which is used in the string as t17.\n\nWait, but in the string, there's a 't17' coming from NT70. Similarly, NT71 -> 't14', which is in the string as t14.\n\nLooking further, I see NT69 -> 't5', which appears in the string as t5. Similarly, NT8 -> 't13', so t13 comes from NT8.\n\nNow, looking for t37, which is in the string. Checking production rules for 't37'. In the grammar, NT47 appears as NT47 -> NT7 NT21. But in production rules, NT47's right-hand side is NT7 and NT21. Neither of these produce t37.\n\nWait, but elsewhere in the grammar, I see NT24 -> 't37'. Oh, no, wait, looking again:\n\nWait, the string has t37, which must come from NT24, but looking at the grammar, NT24 isn't a non-terminal; the production rules don't have 't37' as a result of a non-terminal except perhaps NT49 -> NT22 NT66, but that's not useful. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps each terminal in the string is represented by a specific NT. Let me try to map the terminals to non-terminals. For example:\n\nLooking for t37. In the grammar, does any NT produce t37? Looking through the rules, I see NT47 -> NT7 NT21, but that doesn't produce t37. Wait, let's see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't37' (Oh, yes, there's a rule: NT24 -> 't37'. So that would mean that NT24 is a terminal, producing the string 't37'. But in the grammar, NT24 is a non-terminal because it's a left-hand side of production rules. Or is it?\n\nWait, in the grammar, every rule of the form A \u2192 a is a production where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. So let's check if NT24 has such a rule.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 isn't a left-hand side in any rule. So NT24 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Because the only production for NT24 is not a terminal. So maybe I was wrong; there is no NT producing 't37' directly. Then how does 't37' occur in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me re-express the grammar's productions to see if any non-terminal produces t37.\n\nLooking carefully, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 isn't present as a left-hand side. So perhaps 't37' is part of a longer production? Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong.\n\nWait, let me read the grammar again carefully. The user-provided grammar is a list of rules, and I need to check if any rule produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT24's row: Wait, the provided grammar doesn't include \"NT24\", unless I'm missing it. Let me count: I see \"NT49 -> NT22 NT66\", \"NT55 -> NT56 NT45\", etc. Wait, wait, the grammar as provided is in a list, and I think I might have missed some lines.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is listed as:\n\nNT24 isn't present.

{"custom_id":"request-332","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are presented, but I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. Also, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol. The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because all the rules on the left side (like S, NT22, etc.) are single symbols, and their right sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a terminal.\n\nNow, the given grammar has a bunch of production rules. Each rule is like A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C could be non-terminals or terminals (denoted by 'some number'), sometimes just one side is a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers: t28, t10, t32, t29, t27, t36, t3, t32, t14, t24, t34, t37, t5, t2, t21, t25, t25, t12, t4.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the parsing method for CNF grammars, which is typically a top-down approach using recursive descent, or maybe an analysis using the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar might be a bit complex with many non-terminals, maybe I can find an approach by looking for the terminals and trying to see if each step in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual tokens:\n\nt28, t10, t32, t29, t27, t36, t3, t32, t14, t24, t34, t37, t5, t2, t21, t25, t25, t12, t4.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nEach non-terminal can derive two terminals or two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT56 NT45, so S must be followed by NT56 and NT45. But the next thing is that NT56 and NT45 can be terminals or non-terminals themselves.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that many non-terminals have their own productions that eventually lead to terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nI think the key here is to start from the beginning of the string and see if it can be derived by the grammar, step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is t28. Let's see what could produce t28.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t28 is produced by the rule NT28 -> 't28'? Wait, but in the grammar, NT28 is not present. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that directly produce t28. Let's go through each rule:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that produce terminals are:\n\nNT63 -> t9\n\nNT45 -> t4\n\nNT59 -> t34\n\nNT36 -> t25\n\nNT6 -> t1\n\nNT2 -> t12\n\nNT13 -> t24\n\nNT34 -> t24\n\nNT68 -> t3\n\nNT21 -> t13\n\nNT49 -> t15\n\nNT71 -> t7\n\nNT20 -> t34\n\nNT46 -> t4\n\nNT39 -> t21\n\nNT22 -> t0\n\nNT2 -> t12\n\nNT13 -> t1\n\nWait, nothing directly produces t28. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe t28 is a non-terminal? No, because in the grammar, terminals are represented by 'tX', where X is a number, like t28.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a production that can derive t28 through a series of steps.\n\nLooking again, let's see if any of the non-terminals derive t28.\n\nLooking at the rules, let me think. NT28 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar. Instead, we have:\n\nLooking for rules that have t28 as a right-hand side. Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any production that directly or indirectly leads to t28. So, unless t28 is part of some production chain, it can't be in the derived string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the string uses non-terminals, but the productions only include terminals when they end. Wait, but in the string, it's all terminals.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, all the rules on the right-hand side have non-terminals or a terminal followed by a terminal. For example, S -> NT56 NT45, but NT56 and NT45 can be further broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider starting from the string and checking each token from left to right to see if the grammar can generate it.\n\nStarting with 't28'. Let's check if there's any non-terminal that directly produces 't28'. Scanning through the rules, it seems that none of the non-terminals in the grammar directly produce 't28'. Therefore, 't28' cannot be part of any derived string because there's no rule that directly or indirectly leads to 't28'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't28' is part of a longer chain, but honestly, looking through all the rules, I don't see any production that would allow 't28' to appear in a derived string.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the answer would be 'No' because the string contains 't28', which is not an endpoint of any production rule in the grammar. There's no non-terminal that can produce 't28', so 't28' cannot be derived from S.\n\nWait, but is there any way that a non-terminal could derive into 't28' through multiple steps? For example, a non-terminal that can derive into two non-terminals, which in turn derive into other non-terminals, and so on, until you get a terminal. But if none of the productions ever result in 't28', that would mean 't28' is not part of the language.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains 't28', which no rule in the grammar produces, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't28', which is not directly or indirectly produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar.

Chomsky normal form usually looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it mostly consists of non-terminals that break down into other non-terminals and terminals. Each production either expands a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string's length should be a multiple of the number of initial non-terminals because each expansion adds to the string's length.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. That means the entire string must be built from NT56 and NT45, which are two non-terminals. So, the total number of symbols in the string should be even when considering the initial expansion. Let's count the string's tokens: it has 20 tokens, which is even, so that's a good start.\n\nNext, each non-terminal in the grammar eventually breaks down into terminals, but I need to follow a possible derivation to reach the given string.

There are many non-terminals, so I need to see if any of them produce the required terminals in the right order.\n\nFor example, NT54 goes to NT6 NT45. NT68 can go to NT28 NT26, which is t36 and NT26. NT26 can go to t4 or t29. Since the string has t29 at position 12, maybe NT26 is used there. But I'm not sure how this directly ties into the string.\n\nAnother approach is to check if all the terminals in the string can be derived from the grammar. Let's list all the terminals in the string: t3, t3, t13, t29, t36, t5, t7, t28, t33, t15, t21, t10, t3, t27, t27, t33, t37, t9, t27, t15.\n\nI'll try to see if each terminal can be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. For instance, t3 is produced by NT36, which is in the grammar. t5 is from NT55. t7 is from NT13 and NT26. t15 is from NT49 and others. Similarly, t27 is from NT20. t21 is from NT49. t10 is from NT28, and so on.\n\nBut this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for patterns or rules that can generate sequences similar to the string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3 t3. Checking the grammar, NT36 can go to t25 or t21, but t25 isn't in the string. Alternatively, NT3 is one of the non-terminals, and it can produce NT68 NT46. Maybe I should follow that path.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. NT68 can go to t28 NT26. So, t28 followed by NT26. NT26 can be t4 or t29. The string has t28 at position 7 and t29 at position 12. So, after t28, t29 would make sense if NT26 chooses t29.\n\nThen, from NT46, which can go to NT7 NT21. NT7 can be t13 and NT21. NT21 can be t13 or t14. Hmm, the string has t13 a couple of times and then t14 at position 17.\n\nPutting this together: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 t9?\n\nWait, let me correct. NT63 is written as NT63 in the grammar, but when I look at the productions, NT63 \u2192 NT70 NT46. So, NT63 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 can go to 't7' or 't17'. The string starts with t3, so perhaps not NT63. Maybe I should try another route.\n\nAlternative: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT70 NT46.\n\nNT70 \u2192 't7'. So the first terminal is t7, but the string starts with t3. So perhaps this route is wrong. Maybe I should try another initial production.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3, so maybe NT3 is involved. But S doesn't go directly to NT3. Wait, looking back, the grammar's productions for non-terminals:\n\nLooking through all the grammars, I see that NT3 appears in some productions, but not in the initial S. So maybe the string wasn't generated by S? Because NT3 is not part of the initial expansion from S.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The initial string starts with t3, which could be from NT3, but S doesn't produce NT3 directly. Let's check S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the first step must be S expanding into NT56 and NT45. Neither of these directly produce t3. So for the string to generate t3 as the first symbol, there must be a way for NT56 or NT45 to produce t3 via intermediate steps.\n\nLooking at NT56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo, NT56 can go to NT69 NT44, and then NT44 can go to NT3 NT26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 can go to t28 NT26. So, NT68 can produce t28.\n\nBut the string's first symbols are t3 t3, so perhaps this path isn't the way. Alternatively, maybe NT56 \u2192 NT49 NT45?\n\nWait, let me check the list again:\n\nLooking back, NT56's productions are:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then, perhaps NT56 \u2192 NT55 NT45, and then NT55 can be split into NT56 NT45 again. That could lead to recursion, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT45 \u2192 NT55 NT45.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT45 \u2192 NT55 NT45.\n\nSo, NT45 can keep expanding into more NT55s. But NT55 can go to NT56 NT45 again.\n\nThis could lead to an infinite loop if not properly controlled, but in reality, this would mean the derivation could go on indefinitely unless it hits a terminal. But for the string given, which is finite, this suggests that such a recursion would lead to a longer string, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to produce t3 t3 via a different route.\n\nAnother approach: check if any of the non-terminals directly or indirectly can produce t3 multiple times. For instance, NT3 can produce NT68 NT46, which could give t28 and then NT46 \u2192 NT7 NT21, which could be t13 and t14.\n\nBut the string starts with two t3s. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible because NT3 itself doesn't produce t3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a non-terminal that can produce t3 t3 in a derivation step. Let's see if any non-terminals produce two t3s.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT36 can produce t25 or t21. But t25 isn't in the string. NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nWait, but maybe more down the line. If a non-terminal expands into NT3 and another NT3, then that could produce t3 t3.\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nIf NT55 can lead to NT3 NT3 somehow, but looking at the rules, NT56 only expands into other non-terminals, and NT45 also expands into more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT55 can go to NT56 NT45, which can go to NT56 NT45 again, which cycles.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: check if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it means every production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal on the right, except the start symbol, which can also go directly to terminals. \n\nFirst, I realize that Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems mostly in line with CNF, but I spot some entries that might have been written with more than two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, each production only has two non-terminals on the left, except the very first one, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Hmm, actually, that's two non-terminals, but looking again, NT56 and NT45. Since NT56 is non-terminal, yes, that's fine. So it's in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string. But wait, the string is just a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like `t9 t17 t33...`. Wait, but in the grammar, many of the non-terminals on the right side of the productions result in 't' followed by a number, like NT6 \u2192 t1. So each of these 't's with numbers are terminals. \n\nSo, the string is a series of these terminals. My task is to see if there's a derivation in the grammar that starts from S and ends with this exact string.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the string starts with 't9'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which becomes t34 (since NT3 is t34), wait, no, wait: NT25 \u2192 t10 (since NT25 \u2192 NT36 \u2192 ... eventually to 't10'), maybe not.

NT42 is NT86 maybe? Wait, no. Wait, no: looking at the productions, NT4 \u2192 t37, so if NT4 is on the right side, it would produce 't37'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step. The string is a series of terminals, so each element must be generated by a production that ends with that terminal. So I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals, each of which is generated by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NT\u2192, we can see that many of them directly generate a terminal followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t1\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT6 (from row 10): NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\n\nWait, that's two non-terminals. But further down, I see NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. That's two non-terminals. Hmm, but maybe some produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find for each 't' in the string, which NT's produce it. For example:\n\n- I see NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45, and looking at NT6 and NT45:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\nNT1 \u2192 t24\nNT22 \u2192 NT17\nNT17 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no, NT21 \u2192 t13, but earlier rows:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I realize that some NTs produce a terminal. For example, looking down, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT66 \u2192 t6\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT10 \u2192 t28\n- NT46 \u2192 t4\n- NT39 \u2192 t21\n- NT25 \u2192 t36\n- NT10 \u2192 t28\n- Wait, no, each line is a production.

{"custom_id":"request-372","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t9 t26 t24 t14 t24 t14 t33 t14 t10 t3 t33 t12 t33 t10 t21 t26 t28 t29 t3 t5 t36`. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar and the string. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, as all the productions are of the form NT.. -> NT.. NT.. or NT.. -> a (like NT70 -> 't5').\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: `t9, t26, t24, t14, t24, t14, t33, t14, t10, t3, t33, t12, t33, t10, t21, t26, t28, t29, t3, t5, t36`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the initial tree would have branches NT56 and NT45. Each of these non-terminals will likely expand into other non-terminals or terminals based on the productions.\n\nLet me start by trying to build the parse tree level by level.\n\n1. **Start with S \u2192 NT56 NT45**:\n   - So the string starts with NT56 and ends with NT45. Wait, but in the given string, the first element is t9, which is a terminal. Let me check what NT56 resolves to.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT63 \u2192 't9' (a terminal)\n\nSo, NT56 expands to NT69 and NT44. NT69 is 't9', so NT56's first part becomes 't9'.\n\nNow, for NT45 in S:\n- NT45 \u2192 NT48 NT4\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT25 \u2192 NT10\n- NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n- NT20 \u2192 't28'\n- So, NT45 would resolve to 't13' (from NT21) and 't28' (from NT20), giving us 't13 t28'.\n\nPutting the start symbol S, the production S \u2192 NT56 NT45 would generate 't9 t13 t28' at the deepest level, but wait, S is a production of NT56 and NT45, so perhaps the string should be built from the non-terminals expanding step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of the terminals generated by the leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, the string given is `t9 t26 t24 t14 t24 t14 t33 t14 t10 t3 t33 t12 t33 t10 t21 t26 t28 t29 t3 t5 t36`. It's 20 terms, so perhaps the parse tree has 20 levels or nodes. Let me think about how the derivation would work.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first non-terminal is NT56, which expands to NT69 NT44. Then NT69 is 't9', so that's t9. Then NT44 would need to expand further. Let's see NT44's production.\n\nLooking at NT44 in the grammar:\nI don't see a production for NT44 directly, but I see NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56, and NT25 \u2192 NT10, NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20, etc. Hmm, perhaps I should track each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string from the grammar, using a top-down parsing technique like the CYK algorithm, since Chomsky Normal Form is suitable for such methods. Alternatively, building the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by checking if each terminal can be matched with the deepest possible non-terminal.\n\nThe string is: t9 t26 t24 t14 t24 t14 t33 t14 t10 t3 t33 t12 t33 t10 t21 t26 t28 t29 t3 t5 t36\n\nI'll index them from 0 to 19:\n\n0: t9\n1: t26\n2: t24\n3: t14\n4: t24\n5: t14\n6: t33\n7: t14\n8: t10\n9: t3\n10: t33\n11: t12\n12: t33\n13: t10\n14: t21\n15: t26\n16: t28\n17: t29\n18: t3\n19: t36\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nFrom S, the first element should be from NT56. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9', so NT69 on derivation can produce 't9' followed by NT49. So when expanding NT69, t9 is produced. So, looking at the string, the first term is t9, which matches NT69.\n\nThen, after t9, the next part of NT69's expansion is NT49. Let's see what NT49 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48.\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9', so that's another t9. But wait, the next terminal after t9 is t26. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire tree.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which expands to NT69 NT44 NT45.\n\nWait, is that right? No, because in CNF, each production is split into non-terminals, so the order remains. So the start is NT56 and NT45, which each resolve into more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the string should be generated by a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try a step-by-step approach.\n\nStarting with S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n   So the string starts with NT56 and ends with NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, after NT56, we have NT69 which is 't9', and then NT44.\n\nSo the string becomes:\n\nt9 NT44 NT45.\n\nBut wait, NT45 \u2192 NT48 NT4.\n\nSo, the string is t9 (nt44) (nt48 nt4).\n\nWait, no, in the leftmost derivation, the leftmost non-terminal is expanded first. So after S, we expand NT56 to NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, after the first step, the expansion is:\n\nNT69 (which is 't9') followed by NT44, and then NT45.\n\nSo the string starts with t9, followed by the derivation of NT44 and NT45.\n\nSo next, we need to expand NT44. Looking up NT44: does it have any productions? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT44. Wait, do I? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT25 \u2192 NT10, NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20, but that's not NT44. Wait, is there any NT44? No, in the given grammar, NT44 is actually NT44 \u2192 NT39 NT26. Hmm, wait, wait. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT44 isn't listed directly.

{"custom_id":"request-370","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure makes parsing easier, typically using algorithms like CYK, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So any valid derivation must start with NT56 and NT45. Each of these is a non-terminal, so I'll need to see if these can be expanded into sequences of terminals and non-terminals that can produce the given string.\n\nBreaking down the string: the sequence is t13, t4, t14, t12, t32, t13, t1, t3, t14, t4, t34, t29, t0, t3, t37, t9, t5, t2, t0, t17, t34. That's 21 tokens, which is a lot, so the derivation tree has to be quite deep.\n\nI think I should perhaps try to parse the string using the grammar. But parsing manually might be time-consuming, so maybe I can look for patterns or see which non-terminals correspond to the string's tokens.\n\nWait, the grammar consists of several productions, and I can list them out. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- ... (many more productions)\n\nEach production either splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals (CNF) or into a terminal and a non-terminal, but actually in CNF, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, in this grammar, do any productions produce a single terminal? Because if not, then any step would involve splitting into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, most of them split a non-terminal into two non-terminals, but some, like NT63 \u2192 't9', NT48 \u2192 't24', etc., have a terminal on the right-hand side. So yes, there are productions that produce terminals. That means the grammar does include some leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nSo the first step is to start with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so each will need to be expanded. Let's see what NT56 and NT45 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 splits into NT69 and NT44. Similarly, NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT44. So both NT56 and NT45 produce two non-terminals each, which in turn will need to be expanded.\n\nSo the string must be a sequence where each step produces parts of the string by expanding these non-terminals. Since the string has 21 tokens, it's likely that the derivation tree is quite deep. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to backtrack from the string, replacing sequences of terminals that match productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts that match the given terminals. Let me see if I can map some of the tokens to non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the starting point, after S \u2192 NT56 NT45, each of these will generate sequences that eventually produce the given tokens. Let's see if parts of the string correspond to these.\n\nThe string starts with t13. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t13. Looking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't24' (no)\nWait, in the list, I see things like NT2 \u2192 't12'. Wait, let me check each production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking more carefully, I notice NT26 \u2192 't4', NT25 \u2192 't10', NT66 \u2192 't6', etc. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal productions (those ending with a 't') are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t12\n- NT7 \u2192 t13 (Wait, no, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36, which are non-terminals. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have t as their right-hand side. For example:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t24 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, let me go through each production to see which produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9?\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking through each rule, some have t:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT44 \u2192 Not terminal.\n\nWait, actually, I need to look for productions that have 't' as a terminal. Let me scan through the list:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\nNT63 \u2192 t9 \u2192 Wait, no, NT63 is defined as NT69 NT44, not producing a t.\n\nWait, no, I need to see which non-terminals produce terminals. Scanning through:\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. For example:\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36 (both non-terminals)\n\nNo, that's not a terminal. Let me look for any non-terminals that have a production whose RHS is a single terminal.\n\nAh, looking at NT5 \u2192 t1. Yes, wait:\n\nWait, let me check all the productions again carefully. Let me scan each production and see if any right-hand sides are a single terminal:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t1? Wait, no, NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49.\n\nWait, looking through all:\n\nWait, actually, from the given productions, some have terminals as RHS. For example:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t13 (Wait, no: NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31, both non-terminals, so not t)\nWait, perhaps I should carefully list all RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find, for example, which non-terminals can directly produce t13, t4, etc.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to start the derivation. So, starting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n\nSo the string after two steps is [NT69, NT44, NT68, NT44]. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nLet's take NT69 first. NT69 is produced by NT56, which came from NT69 \u2192 NT59 NT49.\n\nWait, actually, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So when we expand NT56, we get NT69 and NT44.\n\nNow, expanding NT69: NT55 \u2192 NT69 NT45.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting lost. Maybe I should map the string to tokens and see if they fit into the grammar's possible outputs.\n\nLooking at the string: t13 t4 t14 t12 t32 t13 t1 t3 t14 t4 t34 t29 t0 t3 t37 t9 t5 t2 t0 t17 t34.\n\nThat's 21 tokens. Since each production in CNF splits into two non-terminals, each step increases the count by one. So starting from S, which is S = NT56 NT45 (two symbols), then each step adds more symbols. To get 21 tokens, we need 20 splits, so 20 productions. But that's a lot to track manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the sequence of terminals in the string and see if they can be derived by some parts of the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string using the given grammar, checking if each terminal can be matched by some production.\n\nWait, maybe using a recursive descent parser. Alternatively, build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for substrings that match the terminals and see if the grammar has corresponding productions.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string:\n\nt13, t4, t14, t12, t32, t13, t1, t3, t14, t4, t34, t29, t0, t3, t37, t9, t5, t2, t0, t17, t34.\n\nSo we have:\n\n- t34 appears multiple times.\n\nLooking for where t34 is produced in the grammar. Looking through the productions, do any non-terminals produce t34?\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t24? No, NT34 \u2192 NT68 NT26.\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t25, t70, etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT34 is defined as NT68 NT26.\n\nLooking for"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-383","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t29 t12 t3 t25 t34 t28 t34 t21 t20 t29 t0 t2 t6 t0 t25 t6 t34 t21 t20 t24 t6 t15`. \n\nFirst, I know that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The CNF grammar uses symbols like NT followed by numbers, and terminals like 't' followed by numbers. Terminals are the ones in lowercase, and non-terminals are the ones starting with NT.\n\nMy initial thought is that this string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if these terminals can be generated by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar. The challenge is to parse the string and see if a derivation exists according to the grammar.\n\nI think I should start by looking at the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the top-level productions. The top-level production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, I need to check if the string starts with NT56 and NT45. But wait, NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so each must derive into a string that ultimately produces the corresponding terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't29'. I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't29'. Scanning through the productions for NT26: There are two productions for NT26: one is NT36 NT3 and the other is a terminal 't4' and another 't29'. Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT26 are actually in the grammar as NT26 -> NT36 NT3 and NT26 -> t4 and t29? Wait, no, in the given grammar, for NT26, the productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT26: two entries:\n\n1. NT26 -> NT36 NT3\n2. NT26 -> t4\n3. NT26 -> t29\n\nWait, no, actually, going through each production, I need to look carefully. Let me list all NT26 productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\n- NT26 -> t4\n\n- NT26 -> t29\n\nSo NT26 can produce either t4 or t29. That means if a part of the string uses 't29', it might correspond to NT26.\n\nWait, but in the string given, 't29' appears once near the beginning. Let me check the string: t29, t12, etc. So perhaps the initial NT56 or NT45 needs to be broken down into substrings that generate these terminals.\n\nWait, but S is NT56 NT45. So S's expansion is NT56 and NT45. So each of these non-terminals must expand into a sequence of terminals that, when combined, produce the entire string.\n\nGiven that, let's see what each NT56 and NT45 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44 again, maybe a typo, but it seems to be a single production. Wait, I think I need to look at each production correctly. Let me find all NT56 productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, for NT56:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nWait, actually, in some cases, the same production is listed multiple times with different line breaks. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\n- NT56 -> NT50 NT8\n\nSo NT56 can produce two possibilities: NT69 NT44 or NT50 NT8.\n\nSo, if S is NT56 NT45, then NT56 can be expanded into either:\n\nCase 1: NT69 NT44 and then NT45.\n\nCase 2: NT50 NT8 and then NT45.\n\nNow, let's consider which case is more likely to generate the string given.\n\nBut before that, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be parsed. However, parsing such a long string in CNF might be tedious, so perhaps I can find a way to see if the terminals in the string can be linked to the productions step by step.\n\nLet's take the entire string:\n\nt29 t12 t3 t25 t34 t28 t34 t21 t20 t29 t0 t2 t6 t0 t25 t6 t34 t21 t20 t24 t6 t15\n\nThat's 21 terminals. Since each production in CNF either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals, the number of symbols in the derivation tree would increase by one each step. So, for the string of 21 terminals, the derivation would have 21 - 1 = 20 productions.\n\nGiven that, the top-level production S is two non-terminals, so perhaps the first expansion involves S -> NT56 NT45. Each of these can potentially be expanded into multiple steps.\n\nLet me try to map the string backward. Starting from the end.\n\nThe last token is 't15'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't15'. Looking at the productions for NT46 and other NTs:\n\nLooking through the NT46: \n\nFrom the grammar, NT46 -> NT7 NT21. But that's a combination, so perhaps a higher-level production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for NT18: production is NT27 NT32, which might not help. Perhaps for NT46, which is also used in some productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should check directly which NTs can produce 't15'.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT23? Wait, none in this case.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the NT36 production:\n\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nNT30 -> NT4 NT50\n\nBut 't15' is a terminal. So which non-terminals can produce 't15'. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\n\nNT31 -> NT4 NT50\n\nBut none of these directly produce 't15'. Wait, perhaps NT44?\n\nLooking for NT44 productions:\n\nIn the grammar, NT44 is produced by some NTs. For example, looking at NT50 -> NT54 NT45, perhaps? No, not directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at all NT productions:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't15'. Scanning all the NTs:\n\n- NT26 has productions leading to t4 and t29.\n\n- NT25 -> t10.\n\n- NT36 -> t25.\n\nBut none seem to produce 't15'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the NT46. Let me look at the productions for NT46. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT46 -> NT68 NT21 and also NT46 might be used in other productions.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn the grammar:\n\nNT46 -> NT68 NT21 (from the list, I see: NT46 -> NT63 NT24, NT42 -> NT46 NT68, etc.)\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, looking for NT46:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\n- NT15 -> NT46?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should see if any NT46 exists. Let me check all productions where NT46 appears:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT63 -> 't9', etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to find if any NT has 't15' as a terminal. Maybe NT15? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see 't15' in any NT production. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through the grammar and list all the NTs and their productions.\n\nList of NTs and their direct terminals:\n\n- NT26 -> t4, t29\n\n- NT36 -> t25, t26\n\n- NT63 -> t9\n\n- NT48 -> t24\n\n- NT4 -> t37\n\n- NT28 -> t36\n\n- NT66 -> t6\n\n- NT7 -> t24\n\n- NT8 -> t13\n\n- NT56 -> t33 (Wait, looking again, no: NT56's productions are NT69 NT44 or NT50 NT8, not terminals.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\n- NT56 -> NT50 NT8\n\nSo NT56 can generate either NT69 and NT44 or NT50 and NT8."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens, each of which I believe represents a terminal symbol, ending with the string 't29 t13 t3 t1 t24 t4 t24 t17 t9 t37 t24 t5 t27 t24 t13 t36 t14 t33 t34 t5 t24 t29 t20'. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific structure where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar provided should follow this structure. Looking at the grammar rules, they all seem to be in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which fits the CNF because NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so two on the right. Then, some rules have a mix, like NT26 -> NT36 NT3, but that's still two non-terminals on the right. So, the grammar is indeed in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nThe string to analyze is long, but I can approach it by thinking about how the grammar can generate such a string. Each token in the string is a terminal, so each one must come from a production rule that directly produces that terminal. \n\nSince the entire string is a concatenation of these terminals, it suggests that each terminal is produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. The question is whether these terminals can be concatenated in that exact order according to the production rules.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to use a parsing method, like checking using the CYK algorithm, but that might be too involved here. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step, starting from the top-level non-terminal and seeing if I can derive the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is NT56 NT45. So, the first two non-terminals generated would be NT56 and NT45. The string starts with 't29', which must be the result of some non-terminal. Let me check the productions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56: its production is NT69 NT44. So, NT56 expands into two non-terminals, NT69 and NT44. Now, NT69 expands into NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9', and NT49 is NT22, which in turn is NT2. Wait, NT22's production is NT22 \u2192 NT34 NT8. Let's see what NT34 does. NT34 is t24. NT8 is NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5. NT45 is 't4'. But wait, according to the grammar, NT8 is NT45 NT5, and NT45 is 't4', which is directly a terminal. So, NT8 would generate 't4' and 't5'. \n\nWait, but when NT45 is 't4', that might be another path. Let me try to see the possible derivation. Starting from S: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, we have [NT56, NT45]. Now, NT56 is NT69 NT44. So, the string so far is 't29 t4 ...'?\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let's list out the terminals in order: t29, t13, t3, t1, t24, t4, t24, t17, t9, t37, t24, t5, t27, t24, t13, t36, t14, t33, t34, t5, t24, t29, t20.\n\nBut each terminal comes from a production. So, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the first symbols would be generated by NT56 followed by NT45, which are the first two symbols of the string. But the string starts with t29, which is the start of Nth56 and NT45? Hmm, no, because NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, and each of them expands into more non-terminals before we get to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should figure out which non-terminals correspond to which terminals. For example, looking at the grammar, NT63 \u2192 't9', so any NT63 will produce 't9'. Similarly, NT6 is 't1' because NT6 \u2192 NT1, and NT1 is 't24'.\n\nWait, this might take a while, but perhaps I can map each terminal back to its possible non-terminals. For example:\n\n- t9 comes from NT63\n- t4 comes from NT45\n- t17 comes from NT21 (since NT21 \u2192 't13' ... Wait, perhaps I'm mixing NT21 with NT21. Let me check NT21's production: NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT31. NT71 is 't14', and NT31 is NT49. Wait, no, looking back, NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT31. NT71 is 't7', and NT31 is NT49, which itself is... Let me check the productions for NT49.\n\nWait, looking back, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 is NT2, and NT2's production is NT48 NT66. NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. NT25 is NT10, which seems to produce 't28'... Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the given string is quite long (21 tokens), so each token would come from a specific non-terminal that eventually resolves to it. Since the grammar is in CNF, each terminal is a single step from a non-terminal. Therefore, the string must be a leftmost derivation path that ends with the string in order.\n\nLet me try to see if the first few tokens can come from the start symbol and its children. The string starts with t29. Which non-terminals produce t29? Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t29. Wait, that's a problem. All terminals are either on the right-hand side of productions. Let me check all the productions to see if any terminal is directly 't29'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice some terminals like 't9', 't4', 't17', etc., but 't29' is not directly produced by any rule as a terminal. So, that's a contradiction because in the given string, 't29' must be produced by a non-terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right, because I must have made a mistake. Let me go through the productions again. For example, NT26 has a production NT36 NT3, which both are non-terminals. But in the grammar, I also see some terminals like NT6 is 't1', NT61 is 't59', but I don't see NT26 as producing t29. Perhaps 't29' is a terminal somewhere else?\n\nWait, perhaps I've miscounted the terminals. Let me list all the terminals again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t1\n- NT22 \u2192 t24\n- NT26 \u2192 t29 (Wait, no\u2014looking carefully: NT26 is defined as NT36 NT3. Oh wait, no. NT26's production is NT36 NT3, so that's two non-terminals. Is there any NT rule that produces t29?\n\nWait, looking at NT26 and NT3: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 \u2192 't37' (for NT3 maybe?) Hmm, let me look at other NTs.\n\nNT10 is t28? No, NT10's production is NT25 NT4 NT22. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, does any of the NT in the rules produce t29 directly?\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals are t1, t4, t5, t9, t13, t17, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t3, t34, t36, t37, t45, t48, t49, t50, t55, t56, t59, t61, t63, t68, etc. Wait, let me count the terminals.\n\nThe terminals are the leaves that don't have further productions.

Context-free grammars in CNF have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The string consists of terminals `t0, t1, ..., t37` and other non-terminals.\n\nI recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires each production to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. Some of the productions in the given grammar have more than two non-terminals on the right, but actually, looking again, all the right-hand sides seem to be two non-terminals or a terminal. For example:\n\n- S -> NT56 NT45\n- NT22 -> NT63 NT48\n- etc.\n\nWait, some examples like NT69 -> NT63 NT49, which are two non-terminals, and others like NT3 -> NT3 NT55, which is two non-terminals followed by another non-terminal. Hmm, but in CNF, each production can only generate two symbols. So, I think the grammar is in proper CNF, where each production's RHS is two symbols.\n\nWait, but looking at NT69: NT69 -> NT63 NT49 (two non-terminals). NT3: NT3 -> NT68 NT46. Okay, so all production rules are in CNF except for maybe cases like NT3 -> NT3 NT55. Wait, that's two non-terminals on the RHS, so it's still two symbols, right? So the grammar is in CNF because each RHS is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals are producing sequences of terminals, but each production's RHS is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, for example, look at NT3 -> NT3 NT55, that's two non-terminals. NT21 -> NT71 NT30, also two non-terminals. Some NT rules have only two non-terminals on the RHS. Others, like NT36 -> NT47 NT20, same. Wait, everything seems to be two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo the grammar is in CNF, as per the rules. Now, the task is to see if the given string is derivable from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 21 tokens, all of which are either terminals or the start symbol S. But wait, the string doesn't have any non-terminals like NT56, NT22, etc. So all the tokens are terminals, except perhaps for the first symbols, but looking at the grammar, the only terminal is 't' followed by a number, like 't4', 't10', etc., but nowhere do I see NT30 or something as a terminal. Wait, let me check the start rule: S -> NT56 NT45. Both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals. So the start symbol S is a non-terminal, but in the string, S isn't present. Instead, we have t tokens. So perhaps S must be the starting point, and all the generated strings will be a sequence of t... tokens.\n\nThe given string is a series of t's and numbers, so let's see: t4, t10, t0, etc.\n\nNow, to determine if the string can be produced by the grammar, I'll have to see if there exists a derivation where S, through a series of productions, expands into the given string.\n\nGiven that the grammar may have a lot of productions, it's going to be time-consuming, but I can try to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a derivation tree manually, starting from S and expanding until I reach the given string.\n\nBut considering the complexity, I think a better approach is to model this as a pushdown automaton or use a top-down parser approach.\n\nWait, another way is to work backwards: parse the given string using the grammar. That is, see if the string can be split into parts where each part is a production from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t4 t10 t0 t4 t36 t10 t14 t17 t0 t10 t37 t9 t17 t7 t27 t36 t20 t14 t12 t15 t20 t32 t21`.\n\nBut the string has 21 tokens. Wait, the first token starts with t4, and the last is t21.\n\nI think I should parse it step by step as a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nSo S can produce NT56 and NT45. So the entire string should be derived by first splitting into NT56 NT45, which would mean the string must start with whatever NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nEach of NT56 and NT45 would then produce sequences of terminals. So let's first analyze what NT56 and NT45 can produce.\n\nLooking at the NT56 and NT45 productions:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\nNT63 -> 't9'\nNT48 -> 't24'\nSo NT56: NT56 can become NT69 NT44\nThen, NT69: NT63 NT49\nThen NT49: NT22 NT66\nNT22: NT63 NT48\nNT63: 't9'\nNT48: 't24'\n\nSo NT56 can be derived as: 't9' 't24'\n\nLet me see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 (NT63 NT49) NT44 \u2192 NT63 (NT49 NT44) \u2192 't9' (NT49 NT44)\n\nNT49 \u2192 (NT22 NT66) \u2192 NT22 NT66 \u2192 (NT63 NT48) NT66 \u2192 NT63 (NT48 NT66) \u2192 't9' (NT48 NT66)\n\nNT48 \u2192 't24' so the string becomes 't9' 't24'\n\nThen NT44: NT44 can be NT3 NT26 or something? Wait, looking at NT44's productions.\n\nLooking up NT44: Oh, I need to check all the NT rules.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT44 is produced by NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nBut NT44's productions: Looking through the given rules, I see NT44 is produced by NT26.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\nNT70 \u2192 't7'\n\nSo NT26 can be NT36 NT3 \u2192 NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which is 't25' 't7'.\n\nBut NT3 is NT24: NT24 is in the NT rules? Wait, checking NT24: no, looking through the list, for example:\n\nWait, looking at the list, NT13 is another production: NT13 \u2192 't24'. So maybe that's where NT24 comes from.\n\nWait, actually, in the given list, under NT rules, 'NT5' and others, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list all the NT rules and their possible derivations.\n\nWait, stepping back, perhaps it's better to look for the derivation of the string as a whole.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check for each token in the string if it can be derived via the grammar.\n\nWait, but given the string starts with 't4', and the NT56 and NT45 both start with 't9' and 't24', that's a problem.\n\nWait a minute, the first token is 't4', but according to the grammar, the first part would produce 't9' 't24', meaning the initial part of the string would have to start with t9 t24, but the given string starts with t4.\n\nSo that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string can't be derived because S produces NT56 and NT45, which would produce t9 and t24 as their first tokens, but the given string starts with t4. \n\nSo I think the conclusion is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t24 t26 t15 t2 t9 t6 t20 t26 t3 t26 t9 t6 t6 t12 t12 t3 t27 t7 t1 t5 t21 t4 t9 t5\".\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I see NT symbols and terminals like 't5', 't17', etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. So the initial expansion will be S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so I'll need to expand them further.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT56 and NT45:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT4\n\nSo, starting with S, we get:\n\nS \u2192 (NT56) (NT45) \u2192 (NT69 NT44) (NT68 NT4)\n\nNow, I need to expand each of these non-terminals. I'll list down the productions for each:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\nNT4 \u2192 't37'\n\nWait, NT48 expands to 't24', but I don't think we'll reach that here.\n\nLooking back, after S \u2192 NT56 NT45, expanding NT56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 (NT63 NT49) (NT3 NT26)\n\nNow, the string so far is S \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26. Let's expand each:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9' so that's 't9'\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 \u2192 (NT22) (NT66)\nNT22 \u2192 NT21 NT31 \u2192 (NT21) (NT31)\nNT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31 \u2192 (NT49) (NT31)\nWait, this seems recursive. Let me check if I'm on the right track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to map the entire expansion path and see if the given string can be generated.\n\nThe string provided starts with 't24 t26 t15... Let me look for the earliest symbols.\n\nThe first symbol is 't24', which corresponds to NT48 \u2192 't24'. So in the initial expansion, looking for a path that can produce 't24' early on.\n\nLooking back, after S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is NT69 NT44 (from NT56) and NT68 NT4 (from NT45), so the initial after expansions would be:\n\nAfter expanding S, the left side is NT69 NT44, and the right is NT68 NT4.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is 't24', which is 't24', so we need to find where 't24' appears in the left side or right side.\n\nLooking at NT4: 't37' isn't useful. NT25 \u2192 't10'..., NT48 \u2192 't24'. So in the production NT45, we have NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT4.\n\nSo after expanding, on the right side, we have NT68 and NT4. NT68 is 't28' and 't26'. Wait, NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. Wait, the production for NT68 is actually NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. So NT68 would expand to 't28' and 't26'. But in the string, the second symbol is 't26', which is good because NT68 would produce 't28' followed by 't26'? Wait, no. NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26, but wait, let's check the actual productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29' (I see NT26 has two productions)\n\nWait, NT26's productions are:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 (if terminal), but no, checking again, actually:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT26: \"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\", \"NT26 -> t4\", \"NT26 -> t29\"\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, NT26 \u2192 t4, NT26 \u2192 t29.\n\nSo when we have NT26, it can be 't4', 't29', or more non-terminals.\n\nThis adds complexity because we might have to consider these alternative expansions.\n\nBut let's take it step by step. The string starts with 't24 t26...'.\n\nSo, let me see the possible places where 't24' can come.\n\nLooking at the productions, 't24' comes from NT48. So if in either the left or right side of the initial S expansion, we can produce 't24'.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (left) and NT68 NT4 (right).\n\nSo on the left, NT69 is 't9' followed by NT44, which is 't37' and 't4'? Wait, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26, so NT44 would expand to two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, on the right, NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. NT28 is 't36' and NT26 can be 't4', 't29', or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, it's getting complicated. Let's try a different approach. Maybe we can reverse engineer the derivation.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt24, t26, t15, t2, t9, t6, t20, t26, t3, t26, t9, t6, t6, t12, t12, t3, t27, t7, t1, t5, t21, t4, t9, t5.\n\nLet's note that some of these are terminals. The non-terminals can be identified by the two-letter codes like 't5', which are all terminals.\n\nWait a minute, in the grammar provided, all non-terminals are prefixed with 'NT', like NT56, NT45, etc. The terminals are all lowercase letters followed by numbers, like 't5', 't17', etc.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals. To check if it's generated by the grammar, we need to see if we can derive it by expanding the non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, so the derivation will have a binary tree structure, and the string is a concatenation of the leaves of that tree.\n\nBut generating the entire derivation for this string would be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nBut I'm not sure I remember the CYK algorithm correctly.

{"custom_id":"request-429","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because that means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string to check is: `t6 t10 t2 t37 t7 t10 t4 t29 t27 t10 t4 t27 t12 t27 t28 t3 t9 t34 t36 t12 t13 t3 t29 t28`.\n\nSince the string consists of a series of t's with numbers, I think each tN represents a terminal symbol, and the numbers might be part of the non-terminal productions.\n\nI remember that for CNF grammars, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break down the string step by step.\n\nLet me list the string's tokens for clarity:\n1. t6\n2. t10\n3. t2\n4. t37\n5. t7\n6. t10\n7. t4\n8. t29\n9. t27\n10. t10\n11. t4\n12. t27\n13. t12\n14. t27\n15. t28\n16. t3\n17. t9\n18. t34\n19. t36\n20. t12\n21. t13\n22. t3\n23. t29\n24. t28\n\nHmm, the string has 24 tokens, which is a bit long, but let's see. First, I notice some repeats, like several t7, t10, t27, etc. Maybe we can find a way to represent these as non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of them produce two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT56 NT45. So, S generates two parts, each of which is also a non-terminal that eventually produces a string of terminals.\n\nI think the approach is to see if the string can be built starting from S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nSince the string is quite long, another approach is to see if all tokens are covered by the productions in the grammar. That is, each token in the string must correspond to a terminal in some production.\n\nLooking at some of the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nFor example, NT22 -> NT63 NT48. If NT63 leads to t6 and NT48 leads to t24, then NT22 would contribute t6 t24. But wait, in the string, I have a t6 and later a t10, so maybe that's not directly applicable.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar more carefully. Let's see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT70 -> 't5' (I think this was a typo in the context provided; it's likely NT70 -> 't5', similar for NT30 -> 't17'). Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, NT70 -> 't17', NT69 -> 't5', NT56 -> 't33', NT54 -> 'NT6', but the string mentions t5, which would correspond to NT6 or others.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar is written with '->' as the production. Let me parse them:\n\nFor example, NT70 -> 't17', so whenever we have NT70, it produces t17.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 -> 't6'? Wait, I need to check each production.\n\nWait, no, most of the productions are to non-terminals. Let me see:\n\nLooking for any non-terminals that produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT26 -> 't4'? Wait, no, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT70 -> t17\n\nNT30 -> t17\n\nNT18 -> t27\n\nNT26 -> t4? No, wait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT26: it's written as NT26 -> NT36 NT3. So, it's two non-terminals. So no terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any direct terminal production:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nWait, NT68 -> t3, so NT68 produces t3.\n\nSimilarly, NT48 -> t24\n\nOther non-terminals:\n\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31\n\nNT49 -> t15\n\nLooking through, perhaps the only direct terminals are for NT36, NT3, etc. Wait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nThe string has t6, t10, t2, etc. Let me see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nWait, for example, NT22 -> NT63 NT48. Let me see NT63 and NT48. If NT63 can produce t6, and NT48 can produce t24, but in the string, we have t6 followed later, but perhaps that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the grammar is a collection of pairs of non-terminals. Starting from S, which is NT56 NT45. So S generates two parts: NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56 and NT45:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 -> NT4 NT3\n\nWait, so S produces NT56 and NT45, which are then decomposed further.\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nLooking at NT69: NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nSo, NT56: NT69 (which is NT63 NT49) and NT44 (which is NT3 NT26). Then NT45: NT4 (which can produce NT1 or other terms) and NT3.\n\nThis is getting quite complex, and the string I have is very long. Maybe instead of trying to parse it step by step, I should look for any non-terminals that can produce the given string or parts of it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by a certain derivation. Let's try to map the string to the possible productions.\n\nWait, the string is made of t tokens, each corresponding to a certain production. So, for each t in the string, I might need to see if it's part of a production.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me think differently. How many non-terminals do I have? The grammar seems extensive, with many non-terminals. I'm not sure if this is productive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is simply too long to be generated by this grammar, but I'm not sure. Another idea is to count the number of terminals. The grammar is in CNF, so each production has 2 non-terminals or a terminal. Starting from S, each application of a rule splits into two parts, so the number of steps needed to reach the string length would be log2(n). Here, the string length is 24 terminals, so the derivation would need at least log2(24) \u2248 4.58 steps, so around 5 levels deep.\n\nBut without seeing a specific path, it's difficult to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps some of the non-terminals can produce multiple t tokens. For example, if a non-terminal can produce several t's, but in this grammar, non-terminals mostly produce pairs or terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, some non-terminals might produce multiple t's in a single step. Let me check:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce two terminals:\n\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nIf NT25 produces t10 (from NT25 -> 't10'), and NT70 produces t17, then NT36 produces t10 t17.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> NT3 NT55, which doesn't produce terminal, unless NT55 is a terminal. Wait, no, NT55 -> NT56 NT45, so it's two non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to see if the given string can be broken down into sections that match some non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the t's in the string correspond to the non- terminals that produce them. Let me list all the t's:\n\nt6, t10, t2, t37, t7, t10, t4, t29, t27, t10, t4, t27, t12, t27, t28, t3, t9, t34, t36, t12, t13, t3, t29, t28.\n\nWait, I see several t34. Let me look for which non-terminals can produce t34.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar doesn't seem to have any rules with more than two non-terminals on the left side, and it looks like some non-terminals directly map to terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are many rules like NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, but some are directly converting to 't' terms such as NT70 \u2192 't5', NT30 \u2192 't17', and so on. I think each 't' with a number corresponds to a terminal in the string. \n\nMy approach is to parse the string using the grammar, treating it as a context-free grammar where each step reduces the string to smaller parts by matching grammar rules. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if I can derive it starting from S.\n\nThe string has 26 't's, so I'll list them all to see if they match possible derivations. But with the given grammar, it's better to model this as a top-down parsing problem, starting from S and trying to produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree bottom-up, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be derived into the non-terminals as per the grammar rules.\n\nLet me write down the string again for clarity:\n\n`t21, t7, t3, t7, t9, t27, t3, t15, t6, t37, t5, t32, t34, t36, t28, t1, t37, t7, t12, t7, t17, t20, t24, t21, t28`\n\nI notice that each 't' is a terminal, so each must come from a terminal production rule in the grammar.

For example, the start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the first part of the string should start with NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the first two 't's: t21 and t7. Let's see what non-terminals can produce these:\n\nLooking up the grammar rules:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31, but 't's from NT49 and NT31: Let me see if NT49 \u2192 t15 and NT31 \u2192 t15? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules, for example:\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 (so it's two non-terminals)\n- NT22 \u2192 't0', but that's a problem. Wait, 't0' isn't in the string. Similarly, NT68 \u2192 't3' and 't6' perhaps. Wait, in the string, I don't see any 't0's, so maybe that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps each production leads to a chain of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the start of the string and see if the grammar can produce it step by step.\n\nLet me start with the first two 't's: t21 and t7.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31. So, the first step would be NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31, then each of those can be expanded.\n\nBut if NT21 is the first part, then the string would start with NT21, so t21 comes from NT21's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT21's rule: NT21\u2192 NT49 NT31.\n\nBut the first two 't's in the string are t21 and t7.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because the string starts with t21, then t7, so maybe it's not about the order of NT21 followed by another NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work backwards, using a table-driven approach, like the CYK algorithm. But that might be complicated because I have to code it, but let's try to do it manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a series of productions. Let's try to see if the entire string can be built by the grammar.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens:\n\nt21, t7, t3, t7, t9, t27, t3, t15, t6, t37, t5, t32, t34, t36, t28, t1, t37, t7, t12, t7, t17, t20, t24, t21, t28.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals can produce single terminals, which are the 't' terms.\n\nFor example, NT70 \u2192 't5', so 't5' must come from NT70.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 \u2192 't10', and so on.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find a chain of productions that, when expanded, result in this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parser table, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, I can see if each 't' in the string can be generated by any rule, considering the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is a linear sequence of terminals, so each step must be using productions that substitute a non-terminal into that particular position.\n\nFor example, starting from S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the string starts with NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut in the string, the first 't' is t21, so maybe NT56 produces something that starts with t21.\n\nLooking at NT56's rules: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, etc.\n\nLet me see if I can find a path that leads to t21.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nInstead, perhaps I can see which 't's in the string correspond to certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' and 't6'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't21' ?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines, for example, NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31.\n\nBut wait, let me check one of the grammar lines: \"NT21 -> NT49 NT31\" \u2014 that line doesn't produce a terminal, it produces NT49 and NT31. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the lines.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a production that can be applied.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar lines again more carefully.\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\n\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\n\nAnd so on, each line is a production of the form A -> B C, except those that produce a terminal, e.g., NT70 -> 't5'\n\nSo, to parse the string, each terminal or non-terminal can be handled by the grammar, either as a production rule or via another rule.\n\nGiven that the string is linear, the parser should work by recursively reducing it.\n\nBut since I'm a bit stuck, maybe I can try to map the 't's to possible non-terminals.\n\nLet me go through the string token by token and try to see if I can find a sequence that leads to all of them.\n\nFirst token: t21.\n\nLooking for a production that yields t21.

{"custom_id":"request-448","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t27 t3 t36 t0 t24 t32 t24 t37 t37 t36 t37 t5 t12 t5 t32 t13 t1 t7 t17 t4 t28 t33 t29 t10 t26.\n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. The initial symbol is S, and the grammar consists of multiple non-terminals (like NT22, NT56, etc.) which eventually derive into terminal symbols (like t27, t3, etc.).\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will involve splitting non-terminals into two parts until all symbols are terminals. Each production is two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S and its production:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo, S can only be replaced by NT56 and NT45. Now, I need both NT56 and NT45 to derive into terminals.\n\nLet's look at NT56 first. Checking the productions, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 is split into NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 has two productions:\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (same as first)\nWait, actually, looking again, I see NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 and NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Wait, did I miss a production? Wait no, the given grammar has NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nThen, NT69 has two rules:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nnt63? Yes, and looking at NT63's productions: nt63 \u2192 't9' or other? Wait, no. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see each NT is defined by other NTs or terminals.\n\nLet me list out some key productions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT68 NT44\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NT56: Yes, S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45: I realize that NT45 hasn't been directly mentioned, but looking through the grammar, I see NT45 is involved in other productions. Actually, I notice that earlier, I might have misread NT45's role. Let me check all the NT45 entries.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the list of productions, the strings are in the form of NTxyz \u2192 something. So for NT45, it doesn't have a direct production. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through each production line, I don't see any NT45 on the left side except in S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is the starting point. So I must have made a mistake in initial parsing.\n\nWait, no, the production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So NT45 is on the right side of this production, but the actual NT45 as a non-terminal has its own productions. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse each NT one by one, starting from S.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So I need both NT56 and NT45 to derive into terminals.\n\nNow, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So now, NT69 and NT44 must derive into terminals.\n\nLooking at NT69:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nAnd NT63 and NT49 must produce terminals.\n\nNT63: Let's see, do I have any direct terminal productions? Looking through the grammar, each production is of the form NT \u2192 NT or terminal. So, each non-terminal has multiple productions where it can be split into two other non-terminals or a terminal. So, no NT63 directly produces a terminal. Wait, let me check the given productions:\n\nLooking for NT63:\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\n\"NT63 \u2192 't9'\" \n\nYes, there's a production NT63 \u2192 't9'. So NT63 is a terminal, producing t9.\n\nWhat about NT49?\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nSo NT49 splits into NT22 and NT66. But both of these are non-terminals, I believe.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nSo, NT69 \u2192 't9' (since NT63 \u2192 t9) and NT49 \u2192 ... ?\n\nWait, no, no, productions are chained. So NT69's first production is to split into NT63 and NT49, but NT63 \u2192 t9, and NT49 is a non-terminal that needs to split further.\n\nSo NT69's first production rule is: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nWhich then, when we consider the first rule, we can substitute:\n\nNT63 \u2192 t9\n\nBut NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nSo that would require NT49 to split into NT22 and NT66.\n\nWhat's NT22? Looking for NT22's productions: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48 in one production, but from other productions:\n\nWait, checking again, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n\nNT22 could split into NT63 and NT48.\n\nBut NT63 \u2192 t9.\n\nWhat about NT48? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT48:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n\nAnd both NT25 and NT39 might be NTs or terminals.\n\nLooking for NT25: Does NT25 have a terminal production? No, from the list, NT25's productions are:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\n\"NT25 \u2192 't10'\" \u2014 yes, so NT25 \u2192 t10.\n\nWhat about NT39? NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT70\n\nSo NT39 splits into NT21 and NT70, both of which are NTs.\n\nLet me outline the breakdown step by step.\n\nBut wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this with CYK parsing or to check if the string can be built using the grammar, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if each non-terminal can derive a specific sequence.\n\nBut given that the string is long, with 25 tokens, perhaps the leftmost derivation approach would take too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in CNF, the string must have a structure that corresponds to the leftmost derivations, and the number of symbols must allow for the correct splitting.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation of a string will have a leftmost derivation that results in a sequence where each non-terminal is expanded into two parts until all are terminals. The length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of non-terminals on the leftmost side. But since the start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, starting with two symbols, for each step, we replace a non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols at each step would be:\n\nStart: 1 (S)\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 2 symbols (non-terminals)\n\nThen each of those can be replaced, but if we're doing leftmost derivation, each replacement would double the count.\n\nBut our string has 25 tokens, which is an odd number and not a power of two after starting from S. Hmm.\n\nWait, that might be a clue. Let's think: starting with S, which is one symbol. Apply S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 2 symbols.\n\nEach application replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so after one step: 2 symbols.\n\nAfter two steps (replacing NT56 and NT45), it could be up to 4 symbols, but in this case, perhaps the leftmost derivation goes in a specific way.\n\nBut 25 is not a power of 2. 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 25 is 16+9, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should check if 25 is a possible number of symbols for the leftmost derivation. Let's see: Starting with 1 symbol (S), which is a non-terminal.\n\nFirst replacement: 2 symbols.\n\nSecond replacement: replacing the leftmost non-terminal, leading to 3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-472","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me see how I can approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit that structure, so I'm good there.\n\nThe string to check is: `t9 t15 t36 t21 t3 t1 t27 t28 t1 t36 t9 t34 t10 t25 t32 t5 t27 t27 t21 t13 t6 t0 t7 t37 t28 t5`\n\nI think the strategy is to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing involves starting from the start symbol S and applying production rules until the entire string is consumed. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars.\n\nBut before jumping into CYK, maybe I can see if the string can be broken down step by step. Another approach is to generate the parse tree manually, although with longer strings, that might be tedious. Let me attempt to break down the string into chunks that match the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, each 't' followed by digits is a terminal symbol. The non-terminals seem to be strings of 't's with numbers, like t9, t15, etc.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t9. Looking at the grammar, t9 is either from NT63 or possibly another production. Wait, in the grammar, NT63 can produce t9, right? Because looking at the rules:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT45. But later, NT45 might produce t4. Wait, in the given grammar, NT45 \u2192 t4. So if NT63 can produce t4, but in our string, we have t9. Hmm, maybe I got confused.\n\nWait, actually the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see how these terminals can be formed from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string:\n\nt9, t15, t36, t21, t3, t1, t27, t28, t1, t36, t9, t34, t10, t25, t32, t5, t27, t27, t21, t13, t6, t0, t7, t37, t28, t5.\n\nWait, but each terminal is a single token, right? Like each element separated by space is a single terminal. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nSo the approach is to see if each token (like t9, t15, etc.) can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a single terminal or combines two non-terminals. So I can think of the string as a series of production rules applied in a certain order.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to list the productions again for clarity. The grammar has all right-hand sides as two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Each non-terminal might produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to build a parsing table using the CYK algorithm, which can check if the string is in the language defined by the given CFG.\n\nBut since I'm not very familiar with the CYK algorithm in detail, maybe I can try a step-by-step breakdown.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string: t9, t15, t36, t21, t3, t1, t27, t28, t1, t36, t9, t34, t10, t25, t32, t5, t27, t27, t21, t13, t6, t0, t7, t37, t28, t5.\n\nThat's 25 terminals. Since each production can expand to either two non-terminals or a single terminal, the number of non-terminals might be manageable.\n\nI remember that in CYK, for each position in the string, we determine which non-terminals can derive the substring starting at that position. Then, we build a table where each cell [i][j] represents the possible non-terminals that can generate the substring from i to j.\n\nBut doing CYK manually would be time-consuming. Maybe instead, I can try to find possible parse trees.\n\nAnother thought: since the string is long, perhaps we can see if it can be divided into segments that correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t9. Let's see which non-terminals produce t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9 (NT45), but NT45 \u2192 t4, so that might not help directly. Wait, no, checking each production for t9:\n\nWait the grammar is given, but I don't see a production that directly produces t9. So perhaps t9 is derived from NT63 \u2192 NT45, but is that a terminal?\n\nNo, because NT45 \u2192 t4 (as per later rules), which is a terminal. So perhaps NT63 can produce t9 if it's derived from NT45. Wait, no, NT63's production is only NT45. So if NT45 can produce t4, then NT63 produces t4, but our string starts with t9, which is different.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to construct a mapping of which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLet me list each NT and see which terminals they can produce directly or indirectly.\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36, which then might lead to t24 and t25 (if I parse further, but maybe that's too deep). Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into segments that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nFor example, if I look for a pair of NTs that can produce a segment of the string.\n\nThe first two symbols are t9 and t15. So can any NT produce t9 followed by t15? Let's see.\n\nLooking for a production NT -> X Y, such that X produces t9 and Y produces t15. Or, if the NT directly produces t9 t15, but in this grammar, all productions are two non-terminals or a single terminal, so there are no productions that produce two terminals in one step.\n\nWait, so the only way is for a non-terminal to produce two non-terminals, each of which can eventually produce the required terminals.\n\nSo, for the string starting with t9 t15, we need to find a non-terminal NT that has a production NT -> NT1 NT2, where NT1 can produce t9 and NT2 can produce t15.\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps NT54 has a production to NT6 NT45. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45.\n\nSo if NT6 can produce t9 and NT45 can produce t15, then NT54 would produce t9 followed by t15. But I need to check if NT6 can produce t9.\n\nLooking at NT6's production: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22.\n\nSo NT6 can produce two non-terminals. Let's see their productions.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT24 NT27, perhaps? Wait, I need to check the specific productions.\n\nWait, the grammar is extensive. Let me see if any NTs produce t9 or t15 directly.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n- NT63 \u2192 NT45. \n- NT45 \u2192 t4.\n\nWait, no direct production for t9, but wait:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT45 (t4). But that doesn't help with t9.\n\nWait, where else can I find t9? Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59. Wait, NT59 might produce t9? Let's check NT59's production.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT59 \u2192 NT54 NT61. So if NT54 produces something that eventually gives t9, and NT61 gives t59 (which itself might produce t9?), then maybe.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can look at the string length and see if it's consistent with the grammar. Since each rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, the maximum possible derivation tree for a string of length n is n-1, but that's just a thought.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see how the string can be split into pairs of non-terminals at each step.\n\nBut this is time-consuming without a structure.

{"custom_id":"request-466","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let's see. The grammar looks a bit complex with all these production rules, and the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems all the productions only go to non-terminals except for some that produce 't' plus a number. So that's consistent with CNF.\n\nThe string to check is: t14 t3 t17 t21 t15 t1 t2 t20 t10 t21 t25 t6 t26 t5 t1 t34 t0 t5 t13 t9 t9 t10 t13 t6 t0 t4.\n\nI think each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, meaning they have to appear exactly as they are. Non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production produces either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So 't14' would have to be directly produced by a rule. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that some produce terminal strings. For example, NT70 \u2192 't5' and others.\n\nSo each segment like 't14' must be a terminal derived from a production that directly produces it. Let's see if the grammar has any rules that produce 't' followed by numbers directly. Looking through the rules, I notice some: NT70 \u2192 't5', NT30 \u2192 't17', NT18 \u2192 't27', NT26 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 't29', NT20 \u2192 't6', NT63 \u2192 't9', NT45 \u2192 't4', NT1 \u2192 't24', NT59 \u2192 't34', NT50 \u2192 't3', etc. \n\nSo each 't' followed by a number is a direct production from a specific NT. For instance, 't14' could be NT71, which I see in the rules: NT71 \u2192 't14'. Similarly, 't3' is from NT13, which produces 't13' when there's a specific rule. Wait, let me go through the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't14', so we need a production that produces 't14', which is NT71 \u2192 t14. Then the next is 't3', which is from NT13 \u2192 t13. But wait, NT13's production is 't13', which would lead to that. Then 't17', which is from NT30. Then 't21' from NT21 \u2192 t21 is itself a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar: NT21 is defined as NT49 \u2192 t15 and NT31 \u2192 t1. Wait, no: NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the production for NT21: looking back, I see NT21 -> NT49 NT31. No, that's not a terminal. Wait, no, looking through the rules again, for NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Hmm, that's still non-terminal. Oh wait, looking for rules where r.h.s. is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that some have two terminals, like NT70 \u2192 't5', and others have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, like NT71 \u2192 't14'. Others have all non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which breaks down further.\n\nSo each 't' with a number must come from a production where the NT directly produces that t-number.\n\nNow, looking at the string:\n\nt14 t3 t17 t21 t15 t1 t2 t20 t10 t21 t25 t6 t26 t5 t1 t34 t0 t5 t13 t9 t9 t10 t13 t6 t0 t4\n\nEach of these is a separate token, so the string is a concatenation of these. So the grammar must derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nBut the thing is, in CFG, each production can only generate two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get a long string, you start with S and expand it into non-terminals, which then expand further, and so on until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string's length is 31 tokens, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Let's see how that breaks down.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56: according to the rules, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nThen, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT61 NT48.\n\nNT61 has two rules: one is NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59, another is NT69, but that's irrelevant here.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to walk through the string.\n\nAlternatively, since each 't' is a terminal, we need to find a way the productions lead to that exact sequence. But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string is constructed by a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check if the given string can be generated by the grammar by identifying which NTs produce which parts.\n\nWait, looking at the first part: t14 is from NT71 \u2192 t14.\n\nThen t3 is from NT13 \u2192 t13.\n\nt17 is from NT30 \u2192 t17.\n\nt21 is from NT21 \u2192 t21.\n\nt15 is from NT49 \u2192 t15.\n\nt1 is from NT1 \u2192 t24. Wait, that's a problem because t1 would have to come from NT1, but NT1 \u2192 t24. So how can we get t1? Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me see all the 't' rules. Let's list them:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t5\n- NT30 \u2192 t17\n- NT18 \u2192 t27\n- NT26 \u2192 t4, and another NT26 \u2192 t29\n- NT20 \u2192 t6\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT59 \u2192 t34\n- NT50 \u2192 t3, t20\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n- NT71 \u2192 t14\n- NT21 \u2192 t21 (is this a terminal? Wait, no. Looking back: NT21 is defined as \u2192 NT49 NT31. Are these terminals? Let's check NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT66 is t6, so if NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, and NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, which are not terminals. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps NT21 is a terminal? Or is it that NT21 can't be a terminal, meaning that t21 can't appear as a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 t14\n- NT21 \u2192 t21 (Wait, no, NT21 is defined as NT49 NT31, not a terminal. Oh, wait, let me check that again.\n\nAh, I see now. The production for NT71 is given as NT71 \u2192 t14, which is a terminal. Similarly, for NT21, looking through the rules, it's defined as \u2192 NT49 NT31. So NT21 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. That can't produce 't21' directly; it can only expand into non-terminals. So in the given string, there is a 't21' token, which means that the grammar must have a rule where an NT produces t21. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that produces t21 directly. Because in the rules, NT21 is \u2192 NT49 NT31, and none of the other NTs go directly to t21.\n\nWait, so that would mean the string has 't21', but the grammar doesn't have any production for an NT that directly produces t21. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because 't21' isn't present as a terminal production.\n\nWait, is that the case? Let me double-check all the rules to see if any NT produces t21.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t24 t14 t12 t17 t27 t6 t36 t32 t32 t5 t15 t33 t32 t29 t21 t4 t1 t5 t24 t24 t5 t20 t25 t12 t17 t6 t13`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure helps because it simplifies the parsing process and makes it easier to analyze the derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the starting symbol is S, and the production rules all either have two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. The string provided consists entirely of terminal symbols (all the t followed by numbers), so I need to see if the entire string can be derived from S using these rules.\n\nThe key approach is to build a parse tree from the string top-down starting from S, ensuring that each step of the production conforms to the grammar rules. Since CNF allows only two non-terminals to produce any non-terminal, the parse tree should be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children (except for leaves, which are terminals).\n\nI'll start by examining the string and seeing which parts can be matched to the start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45. The string starts with 't24', so I need to see which productions lead to 't24'. Looking through the production rules, I notice that NT24 doesn't exist because the non-terminals in the rules are like NT22, NT61, etc. So maybe it's NT28 since NT28 \u2192 t36, but that's a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules again. Looking for a production that directly leads to 't24'. Scanning through, I find NT39 \u2192 t21, but that's a different token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a production rule that ends with 't24'. Looking at the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 t24, NT28 \u2192 t36, NT35 \u2192 t9, etc. Wait, perhaps NT42 \u2192 t68, but 't68' isn't in the string.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT48 \u2192 t24. So if somewhere in the string 't24' appears, it must come from NT48. But in the string, 't24' appears multiple times. So maybe the parse tree has nodes that produce multiple 't24's via NT48.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built recursively. Let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t24 t14 t12 t17 t27 t6 t36 t32 t32 t5 t15 t33 t32 t29 t21 t4 t1 t5 t24 t24 t5 t20 t25 t12 t17 t6 t13.\n\nI'll consider each part and see how they might fit into the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't24', which could come from NT48 \u2192 t24. The next part might be the other part of S \u2192 NT56 NT45, but in the string, it's followed by 't14', 't12', etc. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that NT22 \u2192 t0. But t0 isn't in the string. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong approach. Maybe a better way is to try to parse the string using the top-down approach with the given grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the start symbol S in the string. S is defined as NT56 NT45. Each of these is a non-terminal, so in the parse tree, S has two children: NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo the first step is the root S, which splits into NT56 and NT45. Each of these needs to be a non-terminal that can produce a sequence of terminals that match the string.\n\nLooking at NT56, according to the rules: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 must first produce NT69 and NT44. Let's see if those can produce substrings of the input.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Then each of these needs to produce more parts. NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT70 is 't17', which matches the last token. So NT70 can produce 't17'. So NT63's left part is 't17'.\n\nWait, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. So the left part is 't63', but in the string, I have 't25' later. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps this isn't the right path. Maybe I should start by trying to match the entire string against the possible tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe entire string must be generated by S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the first two parts of the tree are NT56 and NT45. Each of these must produce a substring that, when combined, form the entire string.\n\nLet me first process NT56. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNow, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nND63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT70 \u2192 t17 (since NT70 \u2192 t17).\n\nWait, that would mean NT63 produces 't25' and 't17'. But in the string, after the first 't24', we have 't14', 't12', etc., so maybe NT63 produces a longer sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me list all the productions involving NT63, NT25, and NT70.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. So each step, NT63 produces two parts: NT25 and NT70. NT70 is a terminal 't17'. NT25 \u2192 t10 (wait, looking at the rules: NT25 \u2192 t10. So NT25 is a terminal 't10'. Ah, but in the string, the tokens after the initial 't24' include 't10', etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me see. If NT63 produces NT25 and NT70, then NT25 is 't10', and NT70 is 't17', so the substring from NT63 would be 't10 t17'. But in the string, after the first 't24', the next token is 't14', which doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the entire string can be decomposed into parts that match the grammar. Maybe the string is a concatenation of several 't24's and other tokens.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't24 t14 t12 t17 t27 t6 t36 t32 t32 t5 t15 t33 t32 t29 t21 t4 t1 t5 t24 t24 t5 t20 t25 t12 t17 t6 t13'.\n\nHmm, I see that 't24' appears multiple times. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nEach occurrence of 't24' must come from NT48 \u2192 t24. So in the parse tree, each 't24' is a leaf from NT48.\n\nBut how does that connect to the rest of the string? Let's try to see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: NT56 and NT45. So the first part of the string should be the production of NT56.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo NT49 splits into NT22 and NT66. NT66 \u2192 t6. So 't6'.\n\nSo the path from NT56 to 't17' and 't6' would be: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 NT63 NT49 \u2192 NT25 NT70 | NT22 NT66 \u2192 t17 | (something else).\n\nBut wait, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. So NT44 is NT3 and NT26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3 and ... Wait, N68 \u2192 t3. But in the string, after 't17', next token is 't6' which is 't25'?\n\nI'm getting a bit confused.

The string is: `t29 t25 t1 t2 t13 t21 t21 t12 t34 t17 t9 t37 t32 t33 t6 t4 t20 t36 t34 t12 t0 t17 t2 t17 t36 t1 t4`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal or a terminal. This simplifies parsing because each step in the derivation can only produce two symbols at a time.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions except a few are in CNF. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- And so on.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals have productions with only two non-terminals, which is acceptable, but I also need to check if any non-terminal might have a production that isn't in CNF, just to be cautious. Scanning through, I see that some have more than two on the right side. For example, NT70 -> 't5' which is just a terminal\u2014wait, no, in CNF, productions can be terminals, but I think in CNF, typically all productions are between two non-terminals except for terminals. So if a non-terminal has a production that results in a terminal, like NT70 -> 't5', is that allowed?\n\nWait, in CNF, non-terminals can have productions that terminate with a terminal. So yes, that's allowed. So I don't see any non-terminals with more than two symbols on the right side of a production, except maybe some like NT92? Wait, in the grammar provided, I don't see any that have three or more symbols on the right. Let me double-check. For instance, NT20 has NT70 and 't17', which is a terminal. So NT70 is a non-terminal in the right-hand side. Wait, NT70 could have been a terminal if it had only a terminal, but if NT70 has a production that's 't17', which is a terminal, then it's allowed. But in the grammar, looking at NT70's productions, I see:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nThat is, NT70 produces a single terminal, so it's a terminal production. So in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, others produce other non-terminals.\n\nThis is okay because in CNF, a non-terminal can produce two non-terminals, two terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal. But I need to make sure that each production is either two non-terminals, or a terminal, or one non-terminal and one terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be two symbols, but both can be non-terminals, both can be terminals (like a terminal and a terminal), or a non-terminal and a terminal, or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nIn the given grammar, for NT70, it's NT70 -> 't17', which is a terminal, so that's acceptable.\n\nNow, moving on. The given string is a sequence of terminals connected by spaces. Each token like 't29' is a terminal. The grammar needs to be used to see if this string can be derived, starting from S, applying productions in a way that matches the string.\n\nSince all the productions are in CNF or have a single terminal, we can model the derivation as a series of steps where each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which themselves can be non-terminals to be replaced further, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the first element of the string: 't29'. So the first step must involve NT29 -> 't29' (assuming such a production exists). Let me check if NT29 has any production, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT29. Wait, I'm probably missing something because the grammar provided doesn't include NT29. That's odd.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the grammar, I see many NTs like NT56, NT45, etc., but I don't see any for NT29. So 't29' is part of the input string, but if the grammar has no non-terminal that directly produces 't29', that would mean it's impossible. But the grammar is provided in a form where each production may have two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, let me check for any non-terminals that directly correspond to a terminal:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT70 -> 't17' and NT20 -> 't28' and others. So if the string has 't29', there must be a non-terminal NT29 that produces 't29'.\n\nWait, looking at all the productions, I don't see any NT29. For example, let me list all the productions given:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66\n- NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7\n- NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\n- NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\n- NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\n- NT61 \u2192 NT2 NT10\n- NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30\n- NT50 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49\n- NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n- NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21\n- NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35\n- NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT61\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n- NT70 \u2192 't5' wait no, looking back:\n\nActually, let me recheck: looking through the grammar, I see some productions end with a terminal. For example, NT70 -> 't5', NT20 -> 't28', etc. But perhaps 't29' is not present as such. Wait, looking through all the productions:\n\nDo any have a single terminal? Let me check:\n\n- NT50->'t25' \u2014 no.\n\nWait, looking at the productions again:\n\nNT70: NT70 -> 't5'\n\nNT20 -> 't28'\n\nWait, maybe 't29' is part of another NT's production? Or perhaps there's a mistake, or I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, the right-hand side is written as, for example, NT6, followed by NT1, etc. Let me check if there's any NT that produces 't29'. Looking for 't29', but in the productions, I'm seeing 't9', 't5', 't4', 't24', etc., but no 't29' directly. So perhaps the answer is 'No' because 't29' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a longer chain that I can't see. But if all productions are in CNF and the given string has 't29', but the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal that produces 't29', then it's impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nBut wait, looking back, I see that NT29 is not among the non-terminals listed as being part of the grammar. So the start symbol is S, and the non-terminals are all those starting with NT, like NT1 to NT70, etc.\n\nIn the given string, the first token is 't29', which would have to be produced by a non-terminal NT29. If NT29 doesn't exist in the grammar, or if it's not defined, then the string can't be generated.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any production that starts with NT29.

{"custom_id":"request-509","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t12 t36 t4 t3 t13 t20 t13 t0 t28 t32 t27 t34 t21 t0 t7 t2 t29 t5 t28 t26 t4 t5 t20 t25 t7 t0 t9 t4` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals (like 't5', 't17', etc.). Each rule is of the form NT -> NT NT, except for some that directly map to terminals. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are at most two symbols long.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards from the string, trying to parse it using the grammar. I'll start by looking at the rightmost symbols and see if they match any terminals in the grammar. Then, I'll move left, seeing if each pair can be matched by a production rule.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't12'. I check the grammar rules to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't12'. Scanning through, I see 'NT22 -> t27' and others, but I don't immediately find an NT that produces 't12'. Wait, the first symbol is 't12', but in the grammar, there's a rule: NT22 -> t27, but no NT that directly produces 't12'. Hmm, maybe I missed that. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps I'm wrong because in the initial part of the grammar, I see 'NT22 -> NT63 NT48' and ultimately NT22 produces t27, which is mapped through the rules. But for the parsing, I'm looking for productions that produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the beginning. Let's list the symbols in the string in order: t12, t36, t4, t3, t13, t20, t13, t0, t28, t32, t27, t34, t21, t0, t7, t2, t29, t5, t28, t26, t4, t5, t20, t25, t7, t0, t9, t4.\n\nI'll go one by one, but parsing context-free grammars can be tricky without a systematic approach. Maybe using the CYK algorithm would help, but that might take a while. Alternatively, since the string is 30 symbols long, and each production has two non-terminals, the length of the derivation would be 29 splits, leading to 2^29 steps, which is impossible to do manually. So, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, each production rule splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, and if those two can themselves split into more non-terminals until we reach terminals. But for the given string length, it must be that each non-terminal split eventually leads to a sequence of terminal symbols matching part of the string.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t12. Are there any NTs that produce 't12'? Let me scan all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> t27 (so t27 is mapped from NT22)\n- NT13 -> t24 (mapped symbol t24)\n- NT1 -> t24\n- NT2 -> t12 (Wait, do any NTs directly produce t12?)\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT2's rule: NT2 -> NT48 NT66. Let me check what NT48 and NT66 produce:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT48 -> NT25 NT39\n- NT66 -> NT6 NT6\n\nWait, NT66 is defined as NT6, which is NT61 -> t19? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT6 is defined as:\n\nNT6 -> NT1 NT22\nAnd NT1 is t24\nNT22 is t27\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this by identifying each non-terminal and its possible expansion into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the entire string to see if it can be divided into production rules. Let me consider the string and see if any possible splits can match the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is 30 symbols, so if we're splitting into two non-terminals each step, and each non-terminal can split further, the minimal number of non-terminals would be... Hmm, perhaps this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the earliest point where a symbol doesn't match any terminal, which would mean it's invalid. Let's go step by step:\n\nThe first symbol is t12. Is there any NT that can produce t12? Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT2 is t12 because NT2 -> t12 (Wait, looking again, the given grammar rules: there is a rule NT2 -> t12? Let me check the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT63 NT48\n- NT2 -> NT48 NT66\n- Other rules: Maybe not directly.\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar again. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't12'. So perhaps t12 is a result of a non-terminal that eventually produces it through splits.\n\nWait, the rules for NT2: It's NT2 -> NT48 NT66. Then, what does NT48 produce? Looking through the rules, NT48 -> NT25 NT39. Similarly, NT66 -> NT6 NT6.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that can produce 't12'. Maybe t12 is a result of a chain. Let me see if any NT produces 't12' in their expansions.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT22 -> t27 (no)\n- NT06 -> t25 NT70\n- Hmm, perhaps I need to look for where 't12' appears in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is 't12 t36 t4 t3 ...' which could be part of a production rule.\n\nWait, the string starts with t12, so perhaps the top-level production is S -> NT56 NT54, as per the given grammar.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which is NT56 -> NT54 NT69.\n\nWait, let me see the grammar in detail:\n\nThe grammar is a set of rules, and the start symbol is S, which is either NT1 or NT56, etc.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT56 NT54\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nFirst line: S -> NT56 NT54. So S splits into NT56 and NT54. Then, each of those can split further.\n\nSo the entire string must be generated by expanding S into NT56 and NT54, which then expand further, and so on until all symbols are reached.\n\nSo the string \"t12 t36 t4 t3 t13...\" would be the result of expanding S.\n\nIf I can split this string into two parts that correspond to the NT56 and NT54 strings, which are then processed separately, then perhaps it's possible.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the entire string is a concatenation of two parts that each can be generated by NT56 and NT54.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string itself can be split at some point into two parts, each generated by NT56 and NT54, respectively.\n\nBut since I have to be precise, let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to realize that the problem requires the string to be generated by the grammar, meaning starting from S, applying production rules until we get a string of terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar is given, maybe I can find a way to split the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nBut this might take a long time, so perhaps I can look for the sequence of non-terminals that generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with 't12', so perhaps it's generated by some NT that eventually produces 't12'. Wait, but according to the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't12', so perhaps it's part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, perhaps 't12' comes from a chain of expansions. Maybe the NT splits into two, each of which splits further, until they reach 't12'. For instance, perhaps the string starts with NT2, which produces 't12', which would require NT2's expansion.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT2's rule is NT2 -> NT48 NT66, and neither NT48 nor NT66 produce 't12'. So that's a problem.

{"custom_id":"request-510","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has productions that are only of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that structure because all the productions are either splitting into two non-terminals or ending with a terminal. So that's a good starting point.\n\nNext, I need to look at the string to be evaluated: `t9 t25 t34 t7 t25 t29 t9 t26 t2 t9 t0 t13 t14 t1 t20 t34 t2 t27 t17 t15 t13 t34 t10 t20 t34 t20 t7 t20`. It seems like a sequence of terminals, each representing a 't' followed by a number. In the grammar, these numbers correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, 't9' must correspond to NT75 if there's an NT75 \u2192 't9', but wait, from the grammar, I see that some of these are direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice productions like NT70 \u2192 't17', NT69 \u2192 't5', NT68 \u2192 't3', NT61 \u2192 't27', etc. So each 'tn' corresponds to a specific non-terminal. That makes sense.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I probably need to perform a parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, using the CYK algorithm might be a standard approach. But given the length of the string and the complexity of the grammar, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down by the grammar's production rules step by step.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string from left to right. The first symbol is 't9', which I see in the grammar as NT73? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT73. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. And in the terminals, NT63 \u2192 't9'. So 't9' comes from NT63. So that would mean 't9' would be the result of NT63 \u2192 't9'. Therefore, the first token 't9' would come from NT63.\n\nBut looking back at the grammar, NT63 is a non-terminal, so to produce 't9', there must be a production for NT63 \u2192 't9'. But in the grammar provided, I don't see NT63 \u2192 't9'. Wait, wait, no. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nWait, I see NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, but I don't see NT63 or NT49 as terminal. Instead, looking for NT63, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT68 is 't3', NT66 is 't6', NT70 is 't17', etc. Oh, maybe I need to see if any NT has a production that directly yields a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example, NT68 \u2192 't3', NT69 \u2192 't5', NT70 \u2192 't17', etc. But I don't see NT63 directly mapping to a terminal. Wait, so where is 't9' coming from? In the string, the first symbol is 't9'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't9'. Wait, let me recheck:\n\nLooking for all NT production rules that end with a terminal:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n- NT66 \u2192 't6'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' (duplicate)\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't26'\n- NT71 \u2192 't7' (duplicate)\n- NT20 \u2192 't34'\n- NT46 \u2192 't4'\n- NT39 \u2192 't21'\n- NT2\u2192 't12'\n- NT13 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't9'. That might be a problem because the first symbol in the string is 't9'. How is that possible? Did I miss a production? Alternatively, maybe 't9' is the result of a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar rules carefully. I think I might have overlooked something.\n\nLooking at NT63: In the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT63. Wait, actually, I see:\n\nWait, no. Let's list all the productions starting with NT:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66\n- NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7\n- NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\n- NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\n- NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n- NT68 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\n- NT61 \u2192 NT2 NT10\n- NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30\n- NT50 \u2192 NT54 NT4\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49\n- NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n- NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21\n- NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35\n- NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT61\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n- NT70 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT18 \u2192 't27'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n- NT26 \u2192 't29' (Wait, this seems like a duplicate, maybe a typo. So NT26 has two productions: 't4' and 't29'. That can't be right; a grammar shouldn't have multiple productions for the same non-terminal with different left-hand sides. So perhaps it's a typo, but let's proceed.)\n\nWait, also, looking for NTs that result in 't9': I don't see any in the productions. So maybe the string starts with 't9', which isn't directly produced by any NT. That would immediately mean the string is invalid, right? Because the parser can't derive any symbol unless the grammar has a production for the first symbol to a terminal.\n\nBut let me double-check the string. The first token is indeed 't9'. So if the grammar doesn't have a production for any NT that directly produces 't9', then the string can't be generated by this grammar. So does that mean the answer is 'No'?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through the grammar again to see if I missed any NT that produces 't9'. Looking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT with 't9' in their right-hand sides. The closest is NT63 in some productions, but it's never a terminal. For example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45: Both NTs on the RHS\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48: Both NTs\n- NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66\n- NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7\n- etc.\n\nSo, all the productions on the right-hand side are non-terminals except for the terminals in rules like NT70 \u2192 't17', etc."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-523","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like t12, t10, and so on. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the start symbol S, it's S -> NT56 NT45, so the start symbol expands into two non-terminals.\n\nEach of these non-terminals has their own productions. For example, NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and so on. Some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT70 -> 't5' or NT69 -> 't5'. My task is to see if the string can be rewritten by the grammar using these productions.\n\nThe string given is: t12 t10 t2 t2 t29 t27 t9 t26 t12 t9 t21 t2 t27 t25 t13 t13 t12 t29 t13 t14 t15 t36 t20 t34 t15 t6 t14 t12 t9.\n\nI should break down the string into segments that match the grammar's productions. Since each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, I can look for pairs of terminal tokens that align with the productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning, t12. Looking at the grammar, NT18 -> t32, but t12 isn't there. Wait, let me check NT18 and NT2, maybe. Oh, NT2 -> NT48 NT66, and then looking at NT48, it's NT25 NT39. Hmm, this might get complicated. Another approach is to look for tokens that directly map to terminals.\n\nLooking through each NT production, NT70->'t5', NT69->'t5', NT21->'t13', NT1->'t24', NT59->'t34', etc. So, these are direct terminals. The string contains several such tokens, but I need to see if they can come from a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into the expansions of the non-terminals in the start rule S -> NT56 NT45. So, NT56 and NT45 should each produce sequences that, when combined, form the given string.\n\nLet me try to see if I can split the string into two parts that correspond to NT56 and NT45. For example, the first part might be from NT56, and the second part from NT45.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps a better approach is to look at the token counts. Each non-terminal production either splits into two non-terminals or produces a terminal. The string is 31 tokens long. Each production in the grammar either adds a terminal (so the length increases by 1) or continues as non-terminals. The start rule S -> NT56 NT45 gives us two non-terminals, so the string should have a structure that arises from these two.\n\nEach non-terminal in the string must be able to expand into the correct sequence of terminals. It might help to parse the string from the start and see if we can find a way to match each part with the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is context-free, maybe I can look for sequences that match each production. For example, if 't12' appears in any production, I can check if it's directly produced or part of a larger chain.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT2 -> t12, which is the second token in the string. So, that could be matched by NT2.\n\nAfter that, the next token is t10. Looking at NT10, what does it produce? According to the grammar, NT10 produces 't28' (from NT10 -> 't28'), but t10 is not there. Wait, does any non-terminal produce 't10'? Looking:\n\nYes, NT10 -> 't28'. But that's not helpful. Wait, did I miss any NT that directly produces 't10'? Looking again, I don't see any. So maybe 't10' is part of a longer expansion.\n\nWait, in the production NT2 -> NT48 NT66. So, if the first part is NT2 and it produces a and b, which are then used to expand further.\n\nWait, let's think step by step:\n\nThe first token is t12, which comes from NT2. So, S starts as NT56 followed by NT45. If the first part is NT56, which then splits into two non-terminals, and so on. Let me try to see the possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be decomposed into parts that correspond to each production in the grammar. This might take a while, but given the time constraints, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the tokens fit the possible sequences.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but since the grammar is quite large, that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check for inconsistencies: if the string has a token that doesn't appear in any terminal production, or if the count of tokens doesn't make sense given the start rule.\n\nLooking at each token in the string, all of them are terminals (t12, t10, etc.), so each must come from a terminal production. Each non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each split produces two tokens, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nThe string has 31 tokens. The start symbol S produces NT56 NT45, which is two parts. Each of these could split into more non-terminals, each time the number of symbols increases by one for each split. But since each split is two non-terminals, the number of tokens can vary depending on how many splits into non-terminals vs. into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken into a series of terminals and non-terminals that fit the production rules.\n\nLet me see: The string starts with t12, which is from NT2. So, the first part is NT2. Since NT2 -> NT48 NT66, the next tokens should correspond to NT48 and NT66.\n\nLooking at the string, the next token after t12 is t10. But wait, t10 is not directly from NT48 or NT66. Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT2's expansion is not the starting point. Maybe the entire string is produced by the start symbol S, so it's NT56 followed by NT45, each expanding into their own parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can reconstruct the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each token appears in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I see that some like NT70->'t5', NT69->'t5', NT21->'t13', NT1->'t24', etc. So the tokens are all covered except perhaps a few.\n\nNow, the key is whether the sequence of tokens can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into possible chunks:\n\nThe string: t12 t10 t2 t2 t29 t27 t9 t26 t12 t9 t21 t2 t27 t25 t13 t13 t12 t29 t13 t14 t15 t36 t20 t34 t15 t6 t14 t12 t9.\n\nThat's 31 tokens. Since each split of a non-terminal into two non-terminals increases the number by one each time, perhaps we can work backwards.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the start symbol S, which is NT56 NT45.\n\nSo, the first expansion is NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56->NT69 NT44, and NT45->NT70 NT44. So NT56 is replaced by NT69 and NT44, NT45 replaced by NT70 and NT44.\n\nEach of these is a non-terminal. So now we have:\n\nNT69, NT44, NT70, NT44.\n\nThen, each of these can split again.\n\nNT69->'t5' (terminal), so that's done.\n\nNT44->NT3 NT26 (non-terminals), which will then split into their components.\n\nNT70->'t7' (terminal).\n\nNT44 (there are two of them) -> each splits into NT3 and NT26.\n\nSo the string is now:\n\nt5, (from NT69), then NT3, NT26, t7 (from NT70), then again NT3, NT26.\n\nBut in the string, after t12, we have t10, which is t10, which isn't matching.

The string is `t33 t15 t9 t25 t32 t29 t0 t25 t33 t36 t1 t25 t1 t26 t15 t28 t37 t0 t37 t0 t10 t27 t3 t12 t37 t26 t5 t15 t0`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) can be analyzed using methods like the parsing algorithm or the CYK algorithm. But since I'm a bit stuck, let me see if I can break this down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should make parsing a bit easier, though I'm not sure how to apply that yet.\n\nEach non-terminal (NT) seems to produce two terminals or non-terminals. The string consists of a series of these terminal symbols (like 't33', 't15' etc.) and non-terminals (like NT33, NT15, etc.), but wait, on closer inspection, actually all the tokens in the string are t-terminated with numbers, like 't33', 't25', etc. So the string is a sequence of such terms.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, some NTs produce other NTs, and some produce terminals directly. But the string doesn't have any NTs in it\u2014all are 't' followed by numbers. So each token in the string must be derived from a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let me check the grammar to see if all these t-terminated tokens are present as terminals or derived from them.\n\nStarting with the beginning symbol S. The production is S -> NT56 NT45. So S produces two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. Let's see what each of these NTs produce.\n\nLooking at NT56: according to the grammar, NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So NT56 splits into NT69 and NT44. Now, NT69 -> NT63 NT49. Then NT63 is 't9' (from the terminal definitions), so NT63 produces 't9'. NT49 -> NT22 NT66. NT22 is 't22'. NT66 is 't6'. Wait, but according to the production rules, I need to see if NT22 and NT66 are terminals or non-terminals. Looking back, NT22 -> NT18 NT59, which are non-terminals. Hmm, but in the string, we have 't22'.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the production rules more carefully. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't's: 't9' is produced by NT63, 't25' is NT25 -> 't25'\u2014so that's a terminal. 't4' is in NT26 -> 't4'. 't7' is in NT70 -> ... but I see NT70 -> 't17', NT69 -> 't5', and so on.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see 't33' which I don't see in any production listed. Let me check the production rules again to see if I missed it.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT56 is followed by 't33'. Let me check where 't33' is produced. Hmm, I see NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Then, looking at NT55: NT55 -> NT56 NT45 and NT55 -> NT44 NT56. No, not seeing 't33' there. Wait, is 't33' a terminal or is it part of a non-terminal production?\n\nWait, in the list of production rules: I see NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and looking at NT44 in a later part: NT44 -> NT39 NT26. No, that makes NT44 split into other non-terminals. Hmm, I'm not seeing 't33' being derived directly. Wait, but looking again, I notice that in the production NT46 -> 't4' and NT35 -> 't9'. Also, NT39 is -> 't31', and others.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me list all the terminals present in the grammar. Looking through each rule:\n\nNT26: 't4'\nNT26: 't29' (Oh, wait, I see at the bottom 'NT26' has two productions: one to 't4' and another to 't29'. That can't be right because in CFGs, a non-terminal can only have one production. Wait, no\u2014somehow, maybe the user inputted the grammar with multiple productions, but that's not possible. Wait, looking back: oh wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nOh no! Wait, in the list, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT26 NT3? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. The user inputted the grammar with lines like:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nBut perhaps some lines have more than one production. Or maybe not. Wait, actually, looking at the initial lines, each grammar line seems to represent a single production. So, for example, looking at the top part:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\n... and so on.\n\nWait, so each line is a production for the left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal, with one production. Then further down, lines like:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because each line starts with the LHS non-terminal. So for example, looking at:\n\nNT26 is defined as NT36 NT3. Then, NT36 is defined as NT25 NT70. So each non-terminal on the LHS has a single production.\n\nWait, but then, looking through the entire grammar, at the very end, I see lines like:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT26 NT3?\n\nWait, no, I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nIt's a list where each line represents a production for a specific non-terminal. For example, starting from the top:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT56 NT45\nLine 2: NT22 -> NT63 NT48\nLine 3: NT61 -> NT34 NT8\nAnd so on.\n\nThen, looking lower, I see:\n\nLine 203: NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nLine 204: NT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nWait, actually, that can't be. If each non-terminal is on a separate line with one production, then perhaps the user made a formatting error. But perhaps it's correct, meaning some non-terminals have multiple productions, but in reality, in Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal has one production.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For example, looking for NT26: I see in the list:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nand then another line for NT26?\n\nNo, looking again, the user didn't list any other NT26. So perhaps each line is a separate production, and NT26 has only one production: NT36 NT3. So perhaps in the string, when we have 't26', that's because NT26 is a production that leads to 't26'? But in the grammar, NT26 is 't4' or 't29'. Wait, no\u2014looking again:\n\nWait no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each part methodically.\n\nLooking for 't33' in the string. Does any production produce 't33'? Go through each rule:\n\n- NT63: 't9'\n- NT45: 't4'\n- NT48: 't24'\n- NT49: 't15'\n- NT25: 't25'\n- NT26: 't4' and 't29'\n- NT1: 't24'\n- NT71: 't14'\n- NT34: 't24'\n- NT68: 't3'\n- NT8: 't13'\n- NT56: 't33'?\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nLine 15: NT56 -> NT69 NT44\nIs there a production for NT69? Let's see:\n\nNT69 produces NT63 NT49 (line 11), which are 't9' and 't15', but that's not 't3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-544","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I'm supposed to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string is a sequence of t's and numbers. My task is to figure out whether each step in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar better. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the rules:\n\n- The start symbol is S, which goes to NT56 NT45.\n- Each NT production seems to break down into two other NTs or a terminal. For example, NT56 produces NT69 NT44, and NT44 produces NT3 NT26, and so on.\n\nThe string given is: t15 t17 t7 t13 t1 t29 t34 t15 t2 t29 t7 t12 t7 t33 t4 t2 t27 t6 t27 t9 t34 t5 t33 t20 t12 t9 t13 t34 t5 t2.\n\nI notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, while the rest like NT22, NT56 are non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production of a non-terminal produces exactly two other symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, to generate the string, I need to see if it can be broken down into a sequence of these productions. Let's start by splitting the string into tokens separated by spaces. There are 34 tokens here. \n\nI need to check if these tokens can be derived starting from S. \n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first two symbols should derive to NT56 and NT45. Looking at the starting tokens, the first is t15, but t15 is a terminal. Wait, but S produces NT56 NT45, which are non-terminals. So t15 can't come from NT56 or NT45 because in CNF, each production is two symbols. So t15 is a terminal, which would mean NT56 or NT45 must directly produce t15.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, for example, NT55 produces NT56 NT45, but I don't see any NT directly producing t15 or t17. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nIs there an NT that produces 't15'? Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68 \u2192 but NT46 is 't4'\n- NT15: Looking for NT rules where the RHS includes 't15'. Looking through each NT production, I don't see any NT producing 't15' directly. Similarly, 't17' is in NT60's production? Wait, no, in the given grammar, the NT entries don't include 't15' or 't17' as direct productions. \n\nWait, looking again, the string starts with t15. Since S produces NT56 NT45, which are both non-terminals, the first step is to get t15 from either NT56 or NT45. So either NT56 or NT45 must produce t15. But looking at the NT rules:\n\nLooking for 't15' in the terminals, do any NTs directly produce 't15'? None of the NTs have a 't15' in their production. So that's a problem. Because in the string, the first token is t15, but S produces NT56 NT45, and neither of these NTs can directly produce t15. Therefore, the string might not be possible to derive from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me scan through all NT productions to see if any NT directly produces 't15' or 't17'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT70\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT70 \u2192 't27'\n- So NT63 can produce 't27', but that's not helpful for 't15'.\n\nLooking for 't15' as a terminal, perhaps in the expansion of some NT:\n\nWait, NT54's production: NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45. Hmm, any connection to t15?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for where 't15' appears in the productions. If 't15' is a terminal, does any NT directly produce it?\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I don't see any NT that has a terminal symbol as 't15' in its RHS. For example, no NT has 't15' as one of its terminals. All the terminals are like 't9', 't5', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, but NT45's production is NT56 NT45 again? Let me check:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, but that's not 't15'. \n\nWait, let me list all the NT productions and see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- NT70 \u2192 't27'\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT70\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT39 \u2192 't21'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'? Or NT45 \u2192 NT22 NT17? Wait, no:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I need to find any NT that produces 't15'.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70 \u2192 doesn't produce t15\n- NT70 \u2192 't27'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT34 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT70\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39 \u2192 NT39 produces 't21'\n- NT39 \u2192 't21'\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 again\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT49 \u2192 't15' \u2192 Ah, wait, looking for NT49's production: yes! NT49 \u2192 't15' and 't15' is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, does NT49 produce 't15' directly? Let me check:\n\nYes, in the given NT rules, NT49 \u2192 't15'. So that's important.\n\nSo, NT49 can produce t15. Now, in the string, the first token is t15. Since our start symbol S produces NT56 and NT45, perhaps one of them (NT56 or NT45) can produce t15 via a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Now, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, which can produce t15 if we follow that path.\n\nWait, let me visualize:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44) and (NT45 \u2192 ...). If NT56 produces NT69 and NT44, and if NT44 eventually can produce t15, then maybe the sequence is possible.\n\nBut NT44's production is NT43 NT26 or something? Wait, looking through the NT rules, let's see.\n\nLooking for NT44: Looking through the list, I see NT44 is listed in several places. For example:\n\nIn the given rules, I see NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 and also NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 (but that's not relevant here). Let me check:\n\nWait, the provided rules are complex. I'll list the relevant ones:\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (maybe)\n- NT45 \u2192 't4' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n\nAh, so NT45 directly produces 't4', which is a terminal. But in the string, we have 't15 t17 t7...' etc. So the initial NT45 can only produce 't4', but the string starts with 't15', so how is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The start symbol S is NT56 NT45. So, during the first step, S splits into NT56 and NT45. For the string to start with t15, either NT56 or NT45 must produce t15.

{"custom_id":"request-546","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether a specific string is generated by this grammar. Let me start by breaking down what I have and what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a series of production rules where non-terminals on the left side are rewritten into combinations of other non-terminals and terminals. Each production seems to be in the form of A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are either non-terminals or terminals. This is typical for Chomsky normal form, which is a way to structure context-free grammars so that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t15 t5 t2 t21 t15 t7 t26 t2 t7 t6 t33 t14 t26 t20 t25 t29 t14 t9 t4 t13 t32 t36 t29 t27 t34 t33 t14 t2 t12 t5`. Looking at it, all the elements are 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminals in the grammar. My task is to see if this entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S, which is \"S -> NT56 NT45\" as per the grammar.\n\nLet me first outline the approach I should take. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I can use a parsing strategy like the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. Alternatively, I can try to see if the production rules allow the derivation of the string by stepping through the grammar's non-terminals and terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is all terminals, I can try to trace back from the string to see if the start symbol S can generate it through a series of expansions. Another approach is to see if each terminal in the string appears in at least one production's right-hand side. That might not be sufficient because of the structure, but it's a starting point.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are t15, t5, t2, etc. Let me check which non-terminals derive into these.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string and see where they appear in the grammar.\n\nThe terminals are: t15, t5, t2, t21, t15, t7, t26, t2, t7, t6, t33, t14, t26, t20, t25, t29, t14, t9, t4, t13, t32, t36, t29, t27, t34, t33, t14, t2, t12, t5.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce these terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either ends with a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, wait, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each production for a non-terminal A can only produce a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I can make a list of which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Look for any production where the right-hand side (RHS) has 't15'. Scanning through the RHS:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35: doesn't have 't15'\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66: 22 and 66\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45: 56 and 45\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39: 25 and 39\n- NT70 \u2192 't5': only terminal, so NT70 produces 't5'\n- Similarly, looking for 't15' in the RHS:\n\nWait, looking through all RHS:\n\nWait, some of the productions have terminals as the RHS. Let's look for productions where the RHS ends with a terminal symbol.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\nNT50 \u2192 't3'\nNT56 \u2192 't33' and 't4' \u2014 but wait, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44? Wait, no, the productions have RHS which are combinations. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the RHSs consist of non-terminals except when there's a terminal. For example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17' (\u7ec8\u7aef)\nSimilarly, NT30 \u2192 't17', NT35 \u2192 't24', NT18 \u2192 't32', NT26 \u2192 't4' and 't26', and others.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals are in specific productions. So, for each terminal in the string, I need to see if it's a terminal in the grammar and which non-terminals produce it.\n\nLooking at the string, for example, the first component is 't15', so I need to know if any non-terminal can derive 't15'. Let's scan the productions for any production where a non-terminal expands to 't15'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some non-terminals derive terminals:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't5' (right? Because \"NT71 -> NT69 NT35\", wait, that's non-Terminals. Wait, no. Oh, in the list above, NT70 is a terminal, but let's check carefully.\n\nWait, the productions are given as S -> NT56 NT45, and many NTs produce other NT pairs. However, some of these have a terminal in the RHS, like NT70 -> 't17', so NT70 can produce 't17', 't6', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70: includes terminal 't17' (from NT70)\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8 (8 is terminal) and also NT50 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, let's look through the productions for any that have a terminal as part of RHS or as the entire RHS:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and also NT26 \u2192 't4' (Wait, looking at the grammar, I see each production is in the form NTxy \u2192 NTzw or NTxy \u2192 terminal.\n\nLooking through each production, for example:\n\nLooking for 't21' in the string, so I need to see if any non-terminal yields 't21'.\n\nLooking through the productions for terminals, for instance, NT25 \u2192 't10', NT10 \u2192 't28', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a key: for each terminal, which non-terminals can derive it.\n\nFor example, 't5' is derived by NT70, because NT70 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to methodically check each terminal in the string to see if they can appear in a derivation.\n\nLet me list each terminal in the string and see if I can find a production chain where that terminal is produced.\n\n1. t15: I need to see if any non-terminal can directly produce 't15'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any production that directly emits 't15' as a terminal. Wait, maybe in a chain. For example, NT15 as a non-terminal could somehow produce t15 via a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that in the production tree, t15 is emitted somewhere. Let me think.\n\nLooking through the productions, perhaps NT33 or another non-terminal can produce t15.\n\nWait, I'm not finding it. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I can see in the string whether t15 is produced by some NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of t15 is possible if it's derived from a chain that includes t15. But since the only direct terminals come from certain non-terminals, like NT70 \u2192 t17, I'm not sure t15 is directly derivable.\n\nOk, let's move on to the second terminal: t5, which is the second element in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t15, second t5, and so on.\n\nLooking for 't5': NT50 \u2192 't3' and 't25' is produced by NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps NT50 \u2192 't3', but that's not t5. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps NT30 \u2192 't17', no.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for non-terminals that derive to 't5':\n\nLooking again, NT70 \u2192 't5', so if some NT can derive to NT70, then 't5' is produced.\n\nSo, is there a production that leads to NT70? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT44 \u2192 NT43 NT56, but 56\u2192t33 and 43 is something else.\n\nWait, perhaps NT71 \u2192 nt69 and nt35.

{"custom_id":"request-565","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, and the grammar is quite extensive. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, every production seems to be either a single terminal or two non-terminals, so it fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t4 t3 t13 t6 t17 t36 t28 t12 t28 t3 t12 t24 t21 t26 t12 t3 t20 t5 t6 t34 t7 t34 t24 t3 t28 t3 t15 t17 t36 t25 t0.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens. There are 34 tokens, which suggests that the string is quite long, so the parse tree must be quite deep, perhaps 34 levels deep, since each step processes one symbol. Alternatively, it could be deeper, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNow, to see if the string can be generated by the grammar, I think of the standard approach: reconstructing a parse tree for the string or checking if it's possible. Since the grammar is in CNF, the total number of symbols in the derivation for a string of length n is 2n-1. Here, n=34, so the total number of symbols should be 67. But wait, the string itself is just 34 tokens, each representing a symbol in the string. So the parse tree would have n=34 leaves, which would take 2*34-1=67 nodes. That seems feasible, but I'm not sure if the grammar can generate that structure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to simulate or write a parser, but that's time-consuming. Since I can't write code here, perhaps I can use a recursive descent approach or look for patterns.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S produces two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Then, each of these NT's can further produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step, but it's going to be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can model each part of the string as a step in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can figure out the structure by looking at the productions. For example, NT56 can be derived as NT69 NT44, and NT54 as NT6 NT45. NT69 is NT63 NT49, NT63 is NT61 NT34, and NT61 is NT34 NT8, and NT8 is NT45 NT5. Wait, so NT56 can potentially be NT69 (which is NT63 NT49) and NT44 (which is NT3 NT26). NT63 is NT61 NT34, and so on, but this seems too deep.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by trying to match the string from the start, breaking it down into parts. The string starts with t4 t3 t13 t6 t17 t36 t28 t12 t28 t3 t12 t24 t21 t26 t12 t3 t20 t5 t6 t34 t7 t34 t24 t3 t28 t3 t15 t17 t36 t25 t0.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is NT56 NT45. So the first two symbols should be parts of NT56 and NT45. Wait, NT56 is derived from NT69 NT44. So the string must start with some symbols that ultimately derive to NT56, which is NT69 and NT44.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t4. Let's see where t4 comes from. Looking at the productions, NT26 \u2192 t4 (among other options), and some others. So maybe the first part of NT56's derivation is NT26.\n\nWait, let's see, NT56's production is NT69 NT44. So the first part is NT56, which is NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 is NT63 NT49. NT63 is NT61 NT34, NT61 is NT34 NT8, NT34 is NT24 (from NT34 \u2192 t24), and NT8 is NT45 NT5. Wait, so combining, NT61 is NT34 (t24) NT8 (which is NT45 NT5). So NT61 would be t24 followed by NT45 and so on. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by seeing if each terminal in the string can be matched by some NT's. But since the string is quite long, this might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the structure. The starting symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first part of the string should derive from NT56, and the second part from NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, let's separate it into two parts. The first part is \"NT56\" and the second \"NT45\".\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so looking for a way to split it into two parts that correspond to NT56 and NT45. Let's see.\n\nNT56's production is NT69 NT44. So the first part of the string should start with NT69 leading to NT56, which is then followed by NT44. Similarly, the second part is NT45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem where each step processes a part of the string according to the grammar.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be built up step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string is derivable and matches the productions. For example, t4 is NT26 \u2192 t4. So the string starts with t4, so somewhere the NT26 must derive to t4.\n\nSimilarly, t3 is NT3 \u2192 t3, but let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to write the first few steps of the derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo after S is expanded, we have NT56 followed by NT45. Now, the string must derive the entire sequence of terminals. So the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT56, and then the second part the expansion of NT45.\n\nLet's take the first part. The string starts with t4 t3 t13 t6 t17 t36 t28 t12 t28 t3 t12 t24 t21 t26 t12 t3 t20 t5 t6 t34 t7 t34 t24 t3 t28 t3 t15 t17 t36 t25 t0.\n\nIf NT56 is derived to, say, NT69 NT44, then the first part would need to be the expansion of NT69 followed by the expansion of NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT63 could be, for example, NT61 NT34. NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8, which is NT24 NT45 (from NT34 \u2192 t24 and NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5). So that would involve more steps.\n\nThis seems too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that each NT could lead to some terminals, so each production ultimately must reach a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to map the terminals in the string back to possible NT productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t4, which is NT26 \u2192 t4. So somewhere, NT26 must be part of NT56's derivation. So perhaps S is NT56 (which is NT69 NT44) \u2192 and then NT69 is NT63 NT49. Let's see if that leads to NT26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: check for each terminal in the string if it's present in the grammar's terminals. The terminals are as follows: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t12, t13, t15, t17, t18, t20, t24, t25, t26, t28, t34, t36, t39, t45, t48, t50, t54, t55, t56, t59, t61, t63, t68, t69, t70, t71, t8?

{"custom_id":"request-567","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t36 t4 t32 t24 t9 t29 t7 t6 t20 t15 t2 t32 t32 t4 t36 t12 t20 t5 t14 t9 t27 t25 t24 t29 t5 t2 t9 t29 t17 t10 t17\".\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands into NT56 NT45. Each of these could be non-terminals that further break down into other non-terminals and terminals, eventually leading to the 't' terminals which are the leaves of the tree.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of 't's with numbers. My task is to see if these 't's can be derived from the start symbol S through some series of expansions.\n\nSince the grammar is quite extensive with many non-terminals, I should see if the string can be broken down into components that match the right-hand sides of the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t36 t4 t32 t24 t9 t29 t7 t6 t20 t15 t2 t32 t32 t4 t36 t12 t20 t5 t14 t9 t27 t25 t24 t29 t5 t2 t9 t29 t17 t10 t17\".\n\nHmm, that's a long string. Each 't' must correspond to a terminal derived from a production rule. So, I need to check each 't' and see if it's directly in a production rule or if it can be broken down step by step through the grammar.\n\nWait, the first production rule from S is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, S expands into two non-terminals, which in turn expand further until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, the first token is t36. Looking at the production rules, I see NT36 \u2192 t25, but also NT36 can go to NT25 NT70. Let me check: NT36 has two production rules: one is NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and another is NT36 \u2192 t25. So t36 could be derived from NT36 via the rule NT36 \u2192 t25. That's one possibility.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, it seems NT36 can be expanded into another non-terminal or a terminal. Let me check all NT36 productions:\n\nYes, NT36 has two rules: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70 and NT36 \u2192 t25. So, the string starts with t36, so perhaps it's derived from NT36 \u2192 t25. Then, the next token is t4. Let's see how t4 is derived.\n\nLooking for NT4, but wait, in the grammar, I don't see a non-terminal called NT4. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, NT4 \u2192 NT28, which seems incorrect because in the string, the next is t4. Wait, no, looking again: NT4 is one of the non-terminals. Wait, wait, no, actually, looking through the rules, the only production that has 't4' is in the NT4 rule: Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, some non-terminals produce a 't' directly. For example:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't27'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' (in two rules, actually: NT26 \u2192 t4 and NT26 \u2192 t29)\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't24'\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't24'\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n\n- Also, some non-terminals expand into two non-terminals. But wait, looking at the string, the first t36 is derived from NT36 \u2192 t25, so that's one possible expansion. Then, the next token is t4, so that would come from NT4 \u2192 t4? Let's check: Yes, look for NT4.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT4 in the production list. Wait, actually, I must have made a mistake. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t36, but not NT28 \u2192 t4. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT4 is mentioned here: \"NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\" and \"NT4 \u2192 NT28 NT6\". Wait, no, in the first block, it's \"NT68 -> NT28 NT26\". Wait, perhaps I missed NT4.\n\nWait, looking back: The rules are probably presented with each non-terminal's production. Let me go through each line to list all non-terminals.\n\nFor example, the first line says S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSecond line: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48.\n\nThird: NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8.\n\nFourth: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nFifth: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3.\n\nSixth: NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39.\n\nSeventh: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nEighth: NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49.\n\nNinth: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nTenth: NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21.\n\nEleventh: NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68.\n\nTwelfth: NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35.\n\nThirteenth: NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50.\n\nFourteenth: NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed NT4. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, do any of them have 't4'? Let's see:\n\nYes, NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39.\n\nAlso, in NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21, but that's 't7' and 't21'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check if the string tokens are covered by the rules.\n\nThe string starts with t36 t4 t32 t24 t9 t29 t7 t6 t20 t15 t2 t32... etc.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n1. t36: from NT36 \u2192 t25. So NT36 becomes t25, which is t36. So that's possible.\n\n2. Next is t4. Now, looking for NT4 being expanded to t4. But in the rules, I don't see any NT4. So perhaps this approach is wrong. Wait, maybe t4 is part of another production. Let me check the NT47 rule: NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21, which resolves into t7 and t21, but not t4. Alternatively, maybe t4 is from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire sequence as a series of non-terminals that expand into terminals.\n\nFor instance, the string starts with t36, which is NT36 \u2192 t25 (t36). Then, the next is t4, so maybe the next non-terminal is NT4, but since I don't see NT4 producing t4, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is t36, t4, so maybe it's a two-step expansion: S \u2192 NT56 NT45, then NT56 and NT45 expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work from the start symbol and see if it can derive the string. Let's think step by step.\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So S becomes NT69 NT44 at this step.\n\nNow, NT69 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at NT69's production: NT69 \u2192 NT63"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-586","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, efficient. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal string consisting of a single 't' followed by a number. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and many others. So each rule is indeed of the form A \u2192 BC, and some produce a single terminal.\n\nThe input string is a series of tokens: `t28 t29 t28 t21 t36 t28 t32 t4 t28 t26 t37 t10 t2 t14 t36 t3 t20 t9 t29 t26 t0 t21 t28 t5 t33 t6 t9 t7 t10 t4 t0 t4`. These look like terminal symbols, each starting with 't' followed by a number. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. This suggests that in the parse tree, each node would either be a leaf (a terminal) or have exactly two children (non-terminals). \n\nBut manually constructing a parse tree for this string might be tedious, especially since the string is quite long. Maybe I can approach this by looking for production rules that generate the terminals in the string, working from the bottom up.\n\nLet's consider the approach of reverse engineering the string. Each terminal is followed by another, so starting from the beginning, I can see if the first few symbols can be derived from the leftmost production.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t28. In the grammar, I see that NT68\u2192t3 and NT1\u2192t24. Wait, but t28 is earlier in the list. Let me check the list:\n\nFrom the list provided, NT28 is not listed. Wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t36 \u2192 which is another rule: NT28 \u2192 t36.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't28' in the string. Oh, I see that in the grammar rules, some have 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT25 \u2192 't10'\nNT36 \u2192 't25'\nNT47 \u2192 't7'\nNT50 \u2192 't3'\nNT59\u2192't34'\nNT21\u2192't13'\nNT13\u2192't24'\nNT34\u2192't24'\nNT68\u2192't3'\nNT21\u2192't13'\nNT49\u2192't15'\nNT68\u2192't17'\nNT48\u2192't24'\nNT4\u2192't37'\nNT28\u2192t36\nNT66\u2192t6\nNT36\u2192t25\nNT70\u2192t17\nNT69\u2192t5\nNT8\u2192t13\nNT56\u2192t33\nNT50\u2192t20\nNT48\u2192t2\nNT18\u2192t32\nNT35\u2192t9\nNT70\u2192t7\nNT71\u2192t14\nNT25\u2192t10\nNT36\u2192t26\nNT22\u2192t0\nNT2\u2192t12\nNT13\u2192t1\n\nWait, so looking at 't28', none of the rules have that directly as a terminal. But some have 't28' in their bodies. For instance, NT39 \u2192 t21 and t28? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25' and 't26'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' twice, once as 't14'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT50 \u2192 't20'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32'\n- NT35 \u2192 't9'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n- NT13 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't28' as any of the terminals. Let me go through each rule's right-hand side to check for 't28'.\n\nLooking through all the rules provided:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n\nIs that one of the terminals? Yes, NT28 is the non-terminal, and the right-hand side is 't36', which is a terminal. But in the string, I have 't28', not 't36'. So maybe I need to see if there's a production that can derive 't28' from the start.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. Looking through all the rules:\n\n- Looking for any rule where the RHS has 't28' as a terminal. Scanning through all the provided rules, I don't see any rule directly producing 't28'. So the string contains 't28' but there's no production that results in that. Unless perhaps one of the rules has 't28' in the body.\n\nWait no, in the provided rules, the right-hand sides are all either two non-terminals or single terms like 't9', 't5', etc. For example, NT28 \u2192 t36, but that's a terminal, so that's fine. But 't28' is not a terminal itself. So how can 't28' appear in the string?\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the string: it starts with 't28 t29 t28 t21...'. So 't28' is part of the string. But in the grammar, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal produces 't28' as a terminal. So perhaps that's an issue.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the entire list of terminal productions:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25' and 't26'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\nWait, hold on. There's a rule: NT10 \u2192 t28. Yes! \n\nLooking at the grammar, line:\n\nNT10 \u2192 t28\n\nYes, so NT10 can produce 't28'. So that's good. So in the string, when we see 't28', that must come from NT10.\n\nSo let's start checking the string. The first symbol is 't28', which comes from NT10. So in the parse tree, the root would have a production leading to NT10 and something else.\n\nLooking back, the root is S. S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S can only produce two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nBut then, the first symbol is t28, which comes from NT10. So how can that happen? Because S produces NT56 and NT45. The leftmost symbol in the string is t28, which would have to be derived from NT56 or NT45.\n\nSo maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the string isn't directly a top-down parse but a linear sequence of productions. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for whether the string can be generated by the grammar, considering that each step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to trace the derivation. Let's consider that the entire string must be generated by S.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that each terminal in the string must be directly derivable from a non-terminal rule. So for example, each 't28' must come from some NT that produces 't28'. Looking at the grammar, NT10 \u2192 t28 is the only rule that produces 't28'. So any 't28' in the string must be from NT10.\n\nBut then, how is 't28' the first symbol?

{"custom_id":"request-583","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure a bit. The string to evaluate is `t27 t26 t25 t26 t24 t27 t17 t4 t10 t36 t0 t28 t15 t37 t27 t5 t17 t37 t37 t34 t6 t7 t5 t25 t20 t33 t24 t28 t9 t2 t10 t36`.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. Each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. So, the terminals seem to be sequences like 't27', 't26', etc. The non-terminals are everything else, like S, NT, and their variations with numbers.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So, the first step is to see if I can derive the string from S. Let's break down the string into parts that might correspond to the productions.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't27', which might correspond to NT7's production. Looking at the grammar, NT7 produces 't13' and 't36', but that's only if NT7 is a non-terminal. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I see NT7 has a production: NT7 -> NT13 NT36. Wait, no, looking back, actually, I don't see NT7 in the initial productions. Wait, wait, looking through the grammar rules, I notice lines like NT71 -> NT69 NT35, NT70 -> 't17', and so on. So, the non-terminals include a lot of NT followed by numbers, and some have productions ending with terminals like 't'.\n\nWait, correcting myself, the non-terminals are all the NTxy parts. Each production for a non-terminal will lead to either two other non-terminals or to a terminal. My task is to see if the given string can be fully broken down into a series of such productions.\n\nLet me list out the string as a sequence of terminals: [t27, t26, t25, t26, t24, t27, t17, t4, t10, t36, t0, t28, t15, t37, t27, t5, t17, t37, t37, t34, t6, t7, t5, t25, t20, t33, t24, t28, t9, t2, t10, t36].\n\nI need to work from the start symbol S and see if I can break down the string into the non-terminals that produce the terminals. Since the string is quite long, I'll try to find segments that match the productions.\n\nStarting with S -> NT56 NT45. So, the first two symbols must come from NT56 and NT45. Let me check what NT56 produces.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So, NT56 can produce NT69 and NT44. Then NT45: looking up, NT45 -> 't4' and 't5'? Wait, no, wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT45 has two productions:\n\n- NT45 -> 't4' NT1\n- NT45 -> 't5' NT56\n\nWait, no, looking again, I think I might have misread.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT48 -> 't24'\n\nNT9 -> 't9'\n\nNT10 -> 't28'\n\nAnd many others. Looking for NT45, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down all the NT and their productions to keep track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the end of the string and work backwards using reverse derivations. That might be easier since some of the productions are terminal.\n\nLet me try that approach. The last symbol in the string is t36. Looking through the grammar, which NT produces 't36'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT66 produces 't26' and 't6' if I recall correctly. Wait, no: let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at NT63: it's used in NT61 -> NT34 NT8, and other rules. Wait, perhaps I should check which NT productions end with 't36'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT36 has a production leading to t37. Looking at the rules, NT36 has a production that ends with 't37'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, there's NT36 -> NT25 NT70 and NT36 -> NT47 NT20. Wait, does it have a production ending with 't37'? No. Wait, looking again at the rules, perhaps it's in another NT.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me think: NT71 -> NT69 NT35, NT70 -> 't17'. NT21 -> NT49 NT31. NT31 -> NT4 NT50. NT50 has productions like -> NT25 NT8 and -> NT54 NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT36 with other NTs. Let's see: the only 't36' is in NT66's production. Or maybe elsewhere. Wait, looking through, I see NT7 and NT71 have 't13' and 't14', but not 't36'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar rules to find which NT produces 't36'.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT71 -> NT69 NT35 (both are NTs)\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n- NT49 -> NT22 NT66\n- NT66 -> 't26' (from NT66 production: NT66 -> NT36 NT6 and NT66 -> 't26'), but wait, no, wait, actually NT66: looking again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I think NT66's productions are:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT66 -> t26 NT3 (Wait, no, looking at the rule line: \"NT66 -> t26\" somewhere? Let me check the lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar, one of the lines is:\n\nNT36 -> t47 NT20\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, maybe it's better to check each step from the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the last 't36' is in NT36's production. Wait, let me look at the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't36' as a terminal:\n\nLooking at NT36's productions: I see NT36 -> 't25' NT70 and NT36 -> 't47' NT20. Wait, so does that mean 't36' isn't in there. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t27. What NT could produce 't27'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't27' as a terminal. Wait, but wait: looking at the rules, NT70 -> 't17', NT63 -> 't9', NT48 -> 't24', etc. Wait, I don't see any NT producing 't27'. So maybe the string starts with a terminal that's not in the grammar. Wait, but the grammar's terminals are all 't' followed by numbers. So perhaps I need to look for an NT that can produce 't27' as part of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is a series of terminals, and I need to see if they can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each non-terminal can split into two parts, and each part can be a terminal or another non-terminal. So the string is a series of terminals, and I need to see if that sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string using the grammar by trying to split it into the possible branches.\n\nLet's consider the string: t27 t26 t25 t26 t24 t27 t17 t4 t10 t36 t0 t28 t15 t37 t27 t5 t17 t37 t37 t34 t6 t7 t5 t25 t20 t33 t24 t28 t9 t2 t10 t36.\n\nThat's 39 symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-612","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have two terminals as well. But wait, the start symbol here is S, which goes to NT56 and NT45. So S -> NT56 NT45. Each NT is a non-terminal, and these can further break down into other NTs or eventually into terminals which are 't' followed by numbers like t1, t2, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long, but I notice that some of the non-terminals only produce terminal symbols, like NT22, NT7, etc. Wait, no, looking back, most of the NTs have other NTs on their right-hand sides except for some like NT26 -> t4, NT70 -> t17, etc. So many non-terminals directly connect to terminals.\n\nLet me see the string: t21 t28 t10 t37 t33 t28 t13 t0 t20 t13 t3 t34 t12 t26 t28 t37 t5 t21 t25 t12 t6 t32 t36 t6 t14 t13 t29 t24 t2 t37 t17 t33 t33.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar. Let me think about how the string starts: it's t21. Looking at the non-terminals, NT21 is a non-terminal with production rules. Let me check NT21's rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT21 is defined as:\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31.\n\nSo to get t21, we need to generate NH21 via NT21. But NT21 is two non-terminals, so we need each of those to be expanded into something that gives us the respective t's.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I need to break it down step by step. But the string is long, so maybe a better approach is to see which parts can be derived or if any part doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to look for possible sequences that can be formed by the grammar. Let's check the given string for possible sub-strings that could be generated by the grammar. Also, let's note that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, so we can perhaps work backwards.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t21. Since NT21 -> NT49 NT31, let's check if both NT49 and NT31 can be derived to produce t21. Or wait, no, because each non-terminal would be expanded into something else, so perhaps the t21 comes from a terminal production, but NT21 is a non-terminal, so maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, only some non-terminals have terminals in their right-hand sides. For example, NT50 -> NT25 NT8, and NT8 -> 't13', so NT8 can produce t13. Similarly, some other non-terminals have a mix.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built by combining a sequence of terminals produced by these non-terminals. To validate the string, I can attempt to parse it using the grammar, trying to see at each step whether the current terminal matches what is expected from the current production.\n\nBut parsing a string with a context-free grammar without any specific algorithm like CYK might be tedious, especially for a long string. Maybe another approach is to check for each terminal in the string whether it's present in the terminals produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't1', 't2', up to 't70' or something like that. So each 't' is a terminal, and the question is whether the grammar can produce that sequence by combining the appropriate non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a smarter approach is to look for the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated starting from S. The string is 37 tokens long, so it's quite long. Maybe I can find a way to parse it step by step.\n\nBut that's a lot, so maybe I should look for any obvious issues. For example, the first part is t21, so maybe the first non-terminal needs to produce t21. So NT21 is involved. Let's check why.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21 -> NT49 NT31.\n\nSo NT21 must generate two symbols, NT49 and NT31. Each of these would then need to produce something.\n\nLooking at NT49: NT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nWait, NT22 is another non-terminal. NT22 -> NT63 NT48.\n\nHmm, so starting from S, we go to NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet's see NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT56 -> NT69 NT44, but in the grammar provided, under NT56, it's written as NT56 -> NT69 NT44, but then under NT44, it's NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, let's correct that. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nSo NT56 generates NT69 and NT44, which then go on to generate other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to see if the string is a concatenation of known sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains t29, which is present as a terminal in NT26 (from the grammar, NT26 -> t29). So somewhere in the string, there's t29. Looking at the string: ... t21 t28 t10 t37 t33 t28 t13 t0 t20 t13 t3 t34 t12 t26 t28 t37 t5 t21 t25 t12 t6 t32 t36 t6 t14 t13 t29 t24 t2 t37 t17 t33 t33.\n\nSo t29 is present. Since NT26 can produce t29, we can look for instances where t26 is used, but in this case, it's t29 directly.\n\nSo somewhere, the string has t29, which must come from NT26 -> t29.\n\nLooking at the entire string, I can note the positions of t29. It's in the middle of the string, towards the end: t29 is the penultimate token, before t24.\n\nSo the part before t29 is ... t36 t6 t14 t13 t29 ...\n\nHmm, so before t29, the previous t's are t36, t6, t14, t13. Let's see.\n\nIf t29 comes from NT26, then the production for the part before would be something like ... NT26 ... but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to see if this can be broken down in the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too detailed without a clear path. Maybe an alternative approach is to look for each token in the string and see if it can be matched by any non-terminal that directly produces that 't' value.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT3 -> 't13'? Wait, no. Let's check each production rule for NTs that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT22 -> 't27'\n\nNT54 -> 't9'\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT8 -> 't13'\n\nNT56 -> 't33'\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT36 -> 't25'\n\nNT26 -> 't4'\n\nNT26 -> 't29'\n\nNT20 -> 't6'\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT69 -> 't5'\n\nNT50 -> 't3'\n\nNT13 -> 't14'\n\nNT31 -> 't12'\n\nNT21 -> 't13'\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking for each 't' in the string and seeing if it's produced by any of the non-terminal's right-hand sides.\n\nThe string has terms like t21, t28, t10, t37, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NTs that produce t21:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT21 -> NT49 NT31. None of these directly produce t21, but in the string, we have t21 as the first token. So how can t21 be produced? Since NT21 produces two non-terminals, each of those non-terminals would need to produce something that ends up being the symbols in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t21 is produced by NT21 going to NT49 and NT31.

{"custom_id":"request-611","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems that the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. Each of these is a non-terminal, and eventually, these will get expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t34 t2 t33 t0 t13 t32 t1 t20 t1 t20 t26 t2 t1 t28 t29 t1 t12 t5 t27 t29 t34 t14 t6 t2 t27 t28 t25 t9 t33 t5 t2 t6 t37`.\n\nI notice a lot of 't' terms, some numbers. My first thought is that each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol generated by the grammar. I need to see if the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite extensive, with many non-terminals and productions, it's helpful to approach this step by step. Maybe I can trace the possible breakdown of the string into the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the entire string should start with the expansion of NT56 followed by NT45.\n\nLet me check if the string starts with NT56 and NT45. The first part of the string is t34 t2 t33 t0... which could correspond to NT56 and then NT45.\n\nWait, wait. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 and NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT68. So NT56 expands into NT69 and NT44, and NT45 into NT46 and NT68.\n\nSo the entire string should start with NT69 NT44 followed by NT46 NT68.\n\nLooking at the string: t34 t2 t33 t0... So perhaps NT69 and NT44 correspond to the first part. But let me break down each non-terminal's productions:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT45 \u2192 NT46 NT68\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT46 \u2192 NT7 NT21\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nSo for S \u2192 NT56 NT45, we have (NT69 NT44) (NT46 NT68). Let's see if the string starts with the expansion of NT69 NT44 and then NT46 NT68.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse the string starting from the beginning and see if each part corresponds to the productions.\n\nLet me list the string with their indices:\n\n1. t34\n2. t2\n3. t33\n4. t0\n5. t13\n6. t32\n7. t1\n8. t20\n9. t1\n10. t20\n11. t26\n12. t2\n13. t1\n14. t28\n15. t29\n16. t1\n17. t12\n18. t5\n19. t27\n20. t29\n21. t34\n22. t14\n23. t6\n24. t2\n25. t27\n26. t28\n27. t25\n28. t9\n29. t33\n30. t5\n31. t2\n32. t6\n33. t37\n\nThat's 33 tokens. S \u2192 NT56 NT45 (each NT56 and NT45 produce two non-terminals, so 2 non-terminals each, totaling 4, which should each be expanded into their respective sequences. So total tokens should be 4 expansions leading to 4 * 2 (if each is split into two) but actually, each step could be a split.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the string can be divided into two parts, corresponding to NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the entire string should be NT56 expanded to X and NT45 expanded to Y, concatenated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be partitioned into X Y, where X is from NT56 and Y is from NT45.\n\nBut given that NT56 and NT45 each produce two non-terminals, the entire string should be a combination of their expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into the two parts: the first part corresponds to NT56 and the second to NT45.\n\nSo let's consider splitting the string into two parts at some point. Let me try splitting after the first 16 tokens or so and see if the first part matches NT56 and the second matches NT45.\n\nWait, but NT56 expands into NT69 and NT44, which in turn will expand into more non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nThis might take a while, but let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string from the left, matching the possible expansions.\n\nStarting with t34. Looking at the grammar, what non-terminals produce a terminal as their first symbol? Maybe starting from S, which produces NT56 and NT45. But NT56 starts with producing NT69 or others.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the string by expanding S.\n\nLet me attempt a parse:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n2. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n3. NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT68\n\nNow, substitute:\n\nS \u2192 NT69 NT44 NT46 NT68\n\nNow, each of these can be expanded further:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT46 \u2192 NT7 NT21\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nSo now:\n\nS \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26 NT7 NT21 NT28 NT26\n\nNow, substitute each of these:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT61 NT49\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 (wait, no, NT26 in the grammar is actually another rule. Looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n\nYes, so NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 (Wait, is that correct? Or perhaps it's another rule. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I see: NT55 -> NT56 NT45, but for NT3, I see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\nNT38 \u2192 NT47 NT20 (Wait, no, line 36: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70)\n\nBut looking for NT3's rules: NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 (Wait, it's written as \"NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\")? Wait, let me check:\n\nYes, in the grammar:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nBut for NT3: \n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55. Yes, that's line: \"NT36 -> NT25 NT70\", no. Wait, looking up:\n\nLine 3: \"NT3 -> NT68 NT46\"\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nLine 3: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nSo NT3 is directly expanding into two terminals: t68 and t46. So that's helpful.\n\nWait, this contradicts my earlier thought, but let me check again.\n\nYes, line 3 says: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. So if that's the case, NT3 produces t68 and t46 as terminals.\n\nTherefore, when expanding NT3, we get t68 followed by t46.\n\nSo let me correct that.\n\nRewriting the expansion:\n\nS \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26 NT7 NT21 NT28 NT26\n\nNow, substitute each non-terminal:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT61 NT49\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\nNT3 \u2192 t68 t46\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\nNT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\nNT28 \u2192 NT28 NT26\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n\nSo substituting:\n\nS \u2192 (NT61 NT49) (NT22 NT66) (t68 t46) (NT36 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-623","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific form of a context-free grammar where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The given grammar follows CNF because all the rules have two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string to check is: `t14 t29 t15 t37 t12 t12 t9 t2 t3 t25 t29 t32 t33 t27 t13 t15 t24 t26 t3 t13 t33 t33 t37 t28 t12 t6 t26 t28 t4 t33 t29 t29 t2 t26`.\n\nFirst, I recall that the CYK algorithm is typically used to parse strings for context-free grammars, especially in CNF. But I'm not entirely confident about all the steps, so maybe I can approach this differently. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, and terminals are at the end of the process.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each symbol in the string is either a terminal or part of a production. Since the CNF requires every production (except the start symbol) to have two non-terminals, each step in the parsing process splits the string into parts, reducing until reaching the start symbol.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to try to construct the parse tree directly. Starting from the string, I need to see if it can be formed using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I see various 't' terms followed by numbers. For example, 't14'. I should check if 't14' is a terminal produced by some rule. Looking at the grammar, I see rules where NT (non-terminal) terms end with 't...'. For instance, NT71 -> NT69 NT35. Wait, but terminals are things like NT25 -> 't10' or NT48 -> 't24'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for which non-terminals produce 't...' and then see if those can be built from other non-terminals, and so on, until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the first symbol 't14'. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces 't14'? Let me go through the rules ending with 't'.\n\nNT71 -> 't14' (according to the given rules: NT71 -> 't14'), so NT71 can produce 't14'.\n\nSo the string starts with 't14', so the first part is the NT71 symbol. So we have NT71, followed by the rest of the string: `t29 t15 t37 t12 t12 t9 ...`.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, NT71 -> NT69 NT35. So NT71 can be split into NT69 and NT35.\n\nSo the first part is NT71, which splits into NT69 and NT35.\n\nNow, NT69 produces 't5' according to the rules (NT69 -> NT63 NT49; wait, no, looking again: NT69 is NT69 -> NT63 NT49? Wait, no, the string is 't69' but looking at the grammar, maybe I'm confusing NT69 with a production that ends with 't'.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the grammar. Let's list all the NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT71 -> NT69 NT35\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n- NT63 -> NT25 NT70\n- NT25 -> NT10 (from NT25 -> NT10)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

The string is `t17 t3 t34 t20 t29 t9 t14 t2 t32 t20 t2 t1 t1 t13 t12 t5 t27 t5 t12 t32 t15 t7 t4 t32 t6 t32 t12 t32 t4 t33 t12 t3 t29 t37`.\n\nFirst, I remember that grammars in Chomsky normal form have production rules where each rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal and a non-terminal. The given grammar does follow CNF because all rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but I'm a bit rusty. Alternatively, maybe I can try to find a derivation path step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't17'. So I need to find which production rule in the grammar can generate 't17'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that 'NT70' \u2192 't17' and 'NT61' \u2192 't17'. Also, 'NT26' \u2192 't29', but that's already covered.\n\nWait, let me list all productions that produce 't':\n\nLooking through the productions, several non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number, like 't1', 't5', 't7', etc. For example, 'NT70' \u2192 't17', 'NT36' \u2192 't25', 'NT45' \u2192 't4', etc. Let me check each production that ends with 't' followed by a number.\n\nFor example:\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT61 \u2192 t17\n- NT26 \u2192 t29\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT2 \u2192 t12\n- NT13 \u2192 t1\n- NT22 \u2192 t0\n- NT56 \u2192 t33\n- NT49 \u2192 t15\n- NT71 \u2192 t7\n- NT50 \u2192 t3\n- NT30 \u2192 t17\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT59 \u2192 t34\n- NT18 \u2192 t32\n- NT35 \u2192 t9\n- NT70 \u2192 t7 (duplicate)\n- NT71 \u2192 t14\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT36 \u2192 t26\n- NT10 \u2192 t28\n- NT46 \u2192 t4\n- NT39 \u2192 t21\n- NT22 \u2192 t0\n- NT2 \u2192 t12\n- NT13 \u2192 t1\n\nWait, I see that 't17' can be produced by NT70 and NT61. So maybe the first symbol 't17' is from either NT70 or NT61.\n\nNow, since the string is t17 followed by t3, etc., I need to see if either of these can be expanded into the string. I think a bottom-up approach might help, but perhaps I can try to find a possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by some combination of rules. Let me try to map the string sequence.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt17 t3 t34 t20 t29 t9 t14 t2 t32 t20 t2 t1 t1 t13 t12 t5 t27 t5 t12 t32 t15 t7 t4 t32 t6 t32 t12 t32 t4 t33 t12 t3 t29 t37\n\nHmm, that's quite long. Maybe I can start by identifying each symbol and their possible sources.\n\nLet me start by listing each token and trying to find how it can be generated.\n\n1. t17: Can be generated by NT70 or NT61.\n\nAssuming it's generated by NT70, then NT70 \u2192 t17.\n\nNow, the structure would be S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo S generates two parts: NT56 and NT45. Each of these must generate a part of the string.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t17, which is the first symbol. If S is NT56 NT45, then NT56 would generate t17, and NT45 would generate the rest of the string? Or maybe it's the other way around, depending on the order.\n\nWait, in Chomsky normal form, the production is A \u2192 BC, so each step reduces the number of non-terminals. But with two symbols, maybe S is split into NT56 NT45, each of which is a non-terminal that can generate part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production either starts with a terminal or a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must start with the left-hand side being the start symbol S, and each production step must produce a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that eventually all resolve to terminals.\n\nLet me see the start production: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo S generates two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. The string has length 38, so perhaps the string is the concatenation of two parts generated by NT56 and NT45.\n\nTherefore, the first part would be the first chunk, and the second part the remaining symbols.\n\nBut I need to see if NT56 can generate the first few symbols, and NT45 can generate the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT56 generates part of the string, and NT45 generates the other. Let me check what options I have.\n\nFirst, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo NT56 splits into NT69 and NT44. Now, each of these may split further.\n\nLet me track this for NT56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNow, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nAnd NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo NT56 becomes NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26.\n\nEach of these can split further.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT62 NT70. Wait, wait, looking back at the given productions, NT63 is 't9', but that's a terminal. Wait, no, wait. Wait, looking at the productions again:\n\nLooking for NT63: NT63 \u2192 't9'.\n\nWait, in the productions, it says NT63 \u2192 't9'?

The string is a bunch of tokens like t29, t5, etc. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CNF grammar has each non-terminal producing exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, each production does seem to fit that structure.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t29 t5 t9 t0 t21 t10 t27 t15 t34 t7 t28 t20 t37 t32 t12 t34 t34 t29 t29 t25 t10 t36 t20 t25 t20 t20 t33 t37 t33 t2 t21 t17 t27 t14 t37.\n\nOk, so each token is a terminal, either a 't' followed by a number or a digit-only 't's? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some NT produce terminals. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17', so 't17' is a terminal.\n\nSo the string is made up of these terminals. Each production of a non-terminal has two terminals or non-terminals. To parse this string, I think of it as building a parse tree from the top-down or bottom-up. Since it's CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can trace backward from the start symbol S and see if I can connect to the entire string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45 according to S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So to derive the string, the string must be a concatenation of the two parts generated by NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo let's first look at NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from the grammar)\n\nSo to get 't29 t5 t9 t0 ...', I need to see if NT56 can produce a string that starts with t29.\n\nBut wait, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (looking at the productions, NT44 is defined as NT3 NT26). Wait, this might get complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by some production ending, starting from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the possible NT productions and see if they can match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several NT have terminals. For example, NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29'. So NT26 can produce either 't4' or 't29'.\n\nWait, in the string, we have 't29' appearing multiple times. So perhaps NT26 is involved in producing t29. But looking at the grammar, NT26 is defined as NT36 NT3. So to produce 't29', NT26 must have a production that leads to 't29'. But in the grammar, NT26 can't directly produce 't29'; instead, NT26 produces NT36 and NT3.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, nt13 is 't24', nt70 is 't17', and nt69 is 't5' (Wait, no, looking at the productions, for example, NT70 \u2192 't17', but in the string, we have t17 as a terminal. Hmm, but in the grammar, does NT29 have any terminal? Looking back, the provided grammar, I see nt26 is defined as NT36 NT3, but there's no NT26 that directly produces a terminal. Wait, let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see an NT rule that directly produces t29. Instead, NT26 has production NT36 NT3. So NT26 can only produce two non-terminals. So 't29' must come from another NT.\n\nWait, looking at NT22 \u2192 NT48 NT21. NT22 is derived from NT48 and NT21. If NT48 can produce 't22' (maybe not). Alternatively, maybe NT22 produces something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal in the string must be derived by some NT production that eventually ends in a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to figure out which NTs can produce 't29'. Let's look for NTs whose productions can lead to 't29'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, for example, looking for any NT production that includes 't29'. Let's scan the list.\n\nI see NT46 \u2192 NT6 NT45 (but nothing there). Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nLooking into NT63: it's defined as NT62 NT70. NT70 is 't17', so maybe NT63 can produce something with t17?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's approach this differently. Since the string starts with t29, I need to find a production that leads to t29.\n\nLooking for a production where 't29' is a terminal. From the grammar, does any NT directly produce t29? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the NTS, I don't see any NT with a production that directly ends in t29. All NTS either produce two non-terminals or some NTs produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, NT26 \u2192 t4 or t29? Wait, no: looking at NT26, its production is NT36\u2192?

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me see. The grammar is a bit complex with multiple non-terminals and terminals labeled with 't' followed by a number.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t28 t25 t34, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which means each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or with a terminal.\n\nMy plan is to either parse the string using the grammar or to see if I can derive the string from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is on the left side, so I need to produce the string starting from S.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t28 and ends with t12, I need to see if the non-terminals can expand properly to yield this sequence. I'll also note that 't' terms might be leaves, so I need to check if the grammar has rules that produce these 't' terms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT70 has a production to 't17', which is present in the string. Similarly, NT25 has a rule to 't10', which is another term in the string. So, the grammar is producing these terminals through specific non-terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to break down the string and see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals. Let me start from the beginning.\n\n1. The string starts with t28. From the grammar, I look at which non-terminals produce t28. Looking at the rules, NT28 has a production: NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT36. Wait, but NT28 isn't directly a terminal. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check:\n\nWait, I'm looking at the grammar given, and the rules include, for example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT66 \u2192 t6, etc. But looking for t28, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t28. Wait, let me check the grammar again. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT26 \u2192 t4 and t29? Wait, no, let me check the exact grammar:\n\nLooking for NT in the rules:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t4, t29\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\nWait, I'm looking for which non-terminals produce 't28'.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar as provided:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT68 NT26\nWait, no, I'm looking for direct productions to 't' terms. Let me list the rules where the right-hand side is 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT59 \u2192 t34\n- NT50 \u2192 t3 (but NT50 has multiple rules)\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t4, I don't see t26 directly. Wait, but according to one rule, NT26 \u2192 t4, or maybe another?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me go through each rule to find where a non-terminal directly produces a 't' terminal.\n\nLooking through all rules, here are the direct 't' productions:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT59 \u2192 t34\n- NT50 \u2192 t3\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t4 (Wait, looking at the rules: Yes, NT26's production includes 't4' as one of the options. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 t36\n- Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all rules where a non-terminal A \u2192 a (terminal).\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT69 \u2192 t5\n- NT56 \u2192 t33\n- NT55 \u2192 t45 (from NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45)\n- Wait no, actually, the rule is NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, so it's a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nWait, I need to list all the direct terminal productions:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT59 \u2192 t34\n- NT50 \u2192 t3\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t4 (only the rule NT26 \u2192 t4)\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT69 \u2192 t5\n- NT56 \u2192 t33\n- NT55 \u2192 t45 (as part of a larger production)\n- Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nNT55 has rules like NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which are non-terminals. So, only certain rules produce terminals.\n\nSo, the direct 't' productions are:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT59 \u2192 t34\n- NT50 \u2192 t3\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT69 \u2192 t5\n- NT56 \u2192 t33\n\nAre there any more? Let me check all rules:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 not terminal.\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 \u2192 both non-terminals.\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39 \u2192 non-terminals.\n- NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT6 \u2192 non-terminals.\n- NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31 \u2192 non-terminals.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26 \u2192 non-terminals.\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 \u2192 non-terminals.\n\nOkay, so these 12 non-terminals produce terminals. Now, the string starts with t28, which must come from NT28. But from the rules, NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT36, so NT28 is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals. So t28 must be the first symbol, which is from NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28's rule: NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT36. So the sequence starts with NT25 (which produces t10) and NT36 (which produces t25). Wait, but the string starts with t28 t25. Hmm. So that doesn't match because NT28 produces NT25 followed by NT36, which would expand to t10 and t25, respectively. But our string starts with t28 t25. So that would be t28 t25 t10 t25... Wait, no, the string is t28 t25 t34... Which is inconsistent with NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the string is `t28 t25 t34 t34 t29 t17 t13 t10 t7 t7 t17 t36 t2 t25 t3 t2 t14 t26 t5 t20 t5 t12 t0 t7 t2 t6 t37 t7 t25 t29 t7 t6 t34 t13 t10`.\n\nSo the first symbol is t28, which must come from a non-terminal that starts with t28. Looking at the non-terminals that produce terminals, none directly produce t28. So perhaps I was wrong earlier because NT28 doesn't directly contribute a terminal but rather produces two non-terminals. So that means the 't28' in the string must come from some non-terminal that eventually expands into it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to trace this through the productions to see if 't28' can be part of the string. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAnother approach is to build a leftmost derivation. Starting from S, trying to expand to the string.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT56 (from the first rule S \u2192 NT56 NT56)\nWait, no, S is defined as S \u2192 NT56 NT45, right? Because the first rule is S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nSo S starts by splitting into NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet's see what NT4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the task is to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nBut wait, manual parsing might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I could look for any obvious patterns or see if the string can be split into components that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. The 't's correspond to terminals in the grammar. Each production seems to consist of two non-terminals (except some where a terminal is used). So I need to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of non-terminals that the grammar allows.\n\nLet me start by considering the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S generates two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Each of these non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nI'll try to map each part of the string to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first part, the string starts with t29. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT26 is defined as NT36 NT3 and also NT26 \u2192 t4. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and also NT26 can produce \"t4\". But in the string, I have t4, which would correspond to NT26's production. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and NT26 has a production to t4?

Looking at all the rules, I don't see NT26 \u2192 t4. Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't4'; yes, some productions do have 't4':\n\nFor example, NT25 \u2192 t10, NT28 \u2192 t36, NT36 \u2192 t25, etc. So 't4' is a terminal, and where is it?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 t36, and I don't see NT24 having t4. Wait, perhaps I need to check elsewhere.\n\nWait, I see NT46 \u2192 t4. So NT46 can produce t4. So in the string, when I see t4, it can be either a terminal from NT24 if it exists, but I don't see NT24 having a production to t4. Let's double-check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT36 \u2192 t25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to build a parse tree or use memoization. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language, but I might not have time to do that manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the start symbol's expansion.\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be divided into two parts: the first part would be NT56, and the second NT45.\n\nAlternatively, each could be broken down further.\n\nLet me try to split the string into segments that match the productions.\n\nThe string is: t29 t34 t25 t4 t33 t25 t33 t4 t24 t7 t5 t27 t10 t14 t36 t14 t13 t24 t37 t2 t5 t20 t27 t4 t37 t7 t25 t7 t10 t36 t9 t25 t37 t0 t10 t36.\n\nLet me see. Starting with t29, what non-terminal can produce t29?\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t29? Let me scan the rules.\n\nLooking through all NT productions, the only t's are things like t9, t5, t4, etc. Looking specifically, for t29, from the grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 has two productions: NT70 \u2192 t17 and NT70 \u2192 NT69 NT35. But that's for NT70. I don't see any NT producing t29 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look through all the rules again for any NT's terminal production that's t29.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t29. So maybe t29 is a terminal, which it is, and it's part of the string. So in the grammar, that would mean that there's a non-terminal that can produce t29. But unless the grammar has a production like NTx \u2192 t29, which I don't see. So perhaps the grammar doesn't generate t29, which would mean that the string is not in the language. But wait, looking back, the string includes t29, so unless the grammar includes that, it's not possible.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that can produce t29, then the string is impossible. So I must check whether any non-terminal can produce t29.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT26: produces t4, so that's not it.\n- NT22, NT21, etc., but I don't see any that produce t29.\n- Checking each production:\n\nLooking at NT70:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17 OR NT69 NT35. Again, t17, no t29.\n\nLooking for 'nt' rules that have t29:\n\nWait, I don't see any NT in the grammar's productions that produce t29. Therefore, if the grammar doesn't have any such rule, then the string, which contains t29, cannot be generated by it. So the answer would be No.\n\nWait, but I must have made a mistake because the string is given and I'm supposed to evaluate it. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t32.\n\nNT26: \u2192 t4.\n\nNT10 \u2192 ??? Let me check NT10:\n\nWait, looking back through the rules, for example, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 \u2192 t33, so t33 comes from NT56.\n\nBut I need to check if any NT produces t29. So I'll go through each rule:\n\nLooking at NT70: t17 and NT69 NT35.\n\nWait, is there a production for NT69 that leads to t29? Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT69: NT63 NT49. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps a chain. Let me try to see if any non-terminal can eventually produce t29 via a chain of productions.\n\nBut if there's no production in the entire grammar that allows any NT to produce t29, then the string is invalid.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe NT rules are all the capital letters except for the terminals, which are the numbers and 't's.\n\nWait, let me check if any NT rule ends with t29 as the terminal. For example, is there a production like NTx \u2192 t29?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any.

{"custom_id":"request-667","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit easier because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should help in parsing, but since the string is pretty long, I shouldn't try to parse it manually. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grammar rules for easier reference. The grammar seems to consist of a bunch of NT symbols and a few terminals (t's and some numbers). The S starts everything, and the first rule is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So whatever string we have must start with NT56 NT45, with each producing something else.\n\nThe string given is: t26 t29 t24 t1 t20 t21 t14 t6 t6 t33 t34 t7 t9 t12 t34 t2 t13 t13 t20 t26 t26 t26 t36 t21 t27 t29 t24 t26 t36 t34 t4 t4 \n\nThat's 33 tokens, ending with t4. Hmm, let's think about how the grammar might produce this.\n\nI should trace back from the string to see if the start symbol S can derive it. Since all productions are from NT to NT or terminal, maybe I can look for the top-level symbols and see if they match.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t26 and t29. Let me check which non-terminals can produce these.\n\nFrom the grammar rules:\n\n- NT26 can produce t25 (though no, wait: looking back, I see NT26's productions. Wait, in the rules, some NTs have multiple productions, like NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, and NT26 \u2192 NT28 NT26. Wait, but in the given grammar, the rules for NT26 are: NT26 -> NT36 NT3 and NT26 -> NT28 NT26. Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote:\n\n\"NT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT26 -> NT28 NT26\"\n\nWait, no, looking back, the user provided a list of grammar rules. Let me list them properly.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nand\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT26.\n\nSo, NT26 can produce two different things. One is NT36 followed by NT3, and the other is NT28 followed by NT26. So, if our string starts with t26, which is a terminal, we need a production that starts with that.\n\nBut t26 isn't directly a terminal; the terminals are the 't's followed by numbers or letters. Wait, looking back at the grammar, the terminals are things like 't5', 't17', etc. So, in the string, each token is either a 't' followed by a number or something else.\n\nWait, the string is: t26 t29 t24 t1 t20 t21 t14 t6 t6 t33 t34 t7 t9 t12 t34 t2 t13 t13 t20 t26 t26 t26 t36 t21 t27 t29 t24 t26 t36 t34 t4 t4 \n\nI think each token is a terminal, like t26, which corresponds to a terminal symbol. So, each 't' followed by digits is a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the first step is to see which non-terminals can derive t26 as the first symbol. Let's look at which NTs can produce t26. \n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which NTs have a production that ends with a terminal starting with t26. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to have a terminal like t26, there must be a production for some NT that directly produces t26. Wait, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where an NT directly produces t26. Instead, all NT rules produce two NTs, except some may produce a mix of NT and terminal. Wait, in the rules, each production starts with NT and then combines two symbols. So, perhaps a terminal can only come from a production that has a terminal in it. Wait, but in the grammar, let me check.\n\nWait, for example, looking at some rules:\n\nNT25 -> NT10 NT10: no, both are NTs.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps some NTs have a terminal in their production. For instance, looking for a production where a terminal is part of the NT's production.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT72 -> Not sure, let's check the entire list.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the grammar. Each production is either NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a (terminal). So, for example, if an NT has a production that is a terminal, like NTsome \u2192 t5, then that's allowed. But in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing a terminal. Instead, all the NT rules are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, none of the NT rules directly produce a terminal. That's strange because the string starts with t26, which is a terminal. So, unless I've misread the grammar, that might be an issue. Hmm, maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait, perhaps some NT rules have a terminal as part of the production, but in the given grammar, perhaps one of the rules is NT26 \u2192 t26. Let me check the given rules.\n\nLooking through the rules provided:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nand\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT26\n\nNo, those are the rules. So, NT26 can only produce two sequences of NT symbols. So, that means in the string, the first terminal t26 would have to be produced by an NT that somehow can produce t26 via another NT's production. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Maybe I missed a rule where an NT directly produces t26.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again more carefully. Let's see, the list starts with:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nThen:\n\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\n\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\n\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nNT2 -> NT48 NT66\n\nNT1 -> NT63 NT7\n\nNT54 -> NT6 NT45\n\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\n\nNT61 -> NT18 NT59\n\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT36\n\nNT8 -> NT45 NT5\n\nNT50 -> NT25 NT8\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT55 -> NT44 NT56\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nNT26 -> NT28 NT26\n\nAnd so on. So, it seems that NT26 only produces two other NTs. So, wait, how does the string start with t26? That suggests that in the derivation, somehow one of those NT rules would derive t26. But if none of the NT symbols directly produce t26, that can't happen. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules that end with a number, like NT48 -> NT25 NT39, where 39 is part of the production? Or is 39 an identifier for another NT? Hmm, looking at NT48, it's NT25 followed by NT39. Wait, but NT39 isn't in the list provided? Wait, wait, perhaps the rules are listed in a way where some NTs are combined, but maybe I'm missing some. Let me check if any NTs result in a terminal.\n\nWait, let's go through all NTs and see if any directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nS: NT56 NT45 \u2192 two NTs.\n\nNT22: NT63 NT48 \u2192 two NTs.\n\nNT61: NT34 NT8 \u2192 NT34 and NT8. Wait, NT8 is a terminal? Because in the grammar, NT8: NT45 NT5. So, wait, that would mean NT8 is a non-terminal, but in the rule NT8 -> NT45 NT5, which are both NTs. But in the string, we have t5, which is a terminal. So, perhaps NT5 is a terminal because elsewhere in the rules, like NT70 -> 't17',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-691","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding what I need to do here.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about CNF. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single terminal. Wait, or is it that each production has a single non-terminal on the left and exactly two on the right? Or was I mixing up other forms? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar provided, it seems like all productions are of the form NT -> NT NT, which makes sense because every right-hand side (RHS) is exactly two non-terminals. So that's consistent with CNF.\n\nThe given string is: `t0 t12 t21 t4 t29 t26 t34 t13 t0 t26 t1 t14 t32 t25 t24 t33 t10 t4 t34 t36 t29 t28 t26 t20 t3 t10 t33 t2 t28 t7 t1 t14 t26 t37 t20 t12 t33`.\n\nI think I need to parse this string according to the rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a right-grammar, and we should be able to parse it using a recursive descent parser.\n\nStarting with the string S, which is the start symbol. So the parse begins with S. From the start symbol, the first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first part should be the result of NT56, and the second part should be the result of NT45.\n\nSo, let me split the string into two parts, where the first part is matched by NT56 and the second by NT45. But how exactly do I split it? Because it's a sequence of t's connected with spaces; the parser will look for the production rules in order, using the first occurrence of the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think recursively. For each step, the current node (or symbol) is matched against a production, and the string is split into the parts required by the production.\n\nLet me start by checking the overall structure. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string should start with NT56 generating some intermediate symbols, and ending with NT45 generating another, with the rest in between being matched accordingly.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of t's, like t0, t12, etc. So each of these t's must correspond to individual terminals generated by the productions. Each production either ends in a terminal or continues with non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either consumes one terminal or leads to a split into two sub-problems.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write out the production tree and see if it can reconstruct the string.\n\nLet me think about each terminal in the string and see if they can be matched by the grammar. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t0, then t12, t21, etc. So the first non-terminal is NT56, which must generate t0 when possible, perhaps. But looking at the NT rules, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So this doesn't directly produce t0. So that indicates that the initial approach might be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Since the grammar is in CNF, the first symbol must be derived from the start symbol. So the string starts with t0. Looking at the grammar, is there a production chain that generates t0 without passing through other non-terminals?\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, I see NT1 \u2192 't24', but that's terminal. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't12', but the string starts with t0. So perhaps t0 is generated by NT19, but looking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT19. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 't24' (terminal), but that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. The grammar's NT nodes are: NT1, NT2, etc., but in CNF, each production is a combination of two non-terminals. So each node produces exactly two others, which might produce more until we reach a terminal.\n\nSo to parse the string, the first step is to match the start symbol S, which must be split into NT56 and NT45. Then each of these NTs must be parsed in sequence.\n\nLet me break the string into sections:\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of t's, let's represent it as a list of terminals: [t0, t12, t21, t4, t29, t26, t34, t13, t0, t26, t1, t14, t32, t25, t24, t33, t10, t4, t34, t36, t29, t28, t26, t20, t3, t10, t33, t2, t28, t7, t1, t14, t26, t37, t20, t12, t33].\n\nSo, the first step is to split this string into the first part generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, NT69 is the next non-terminal, and then NT44.\n\nI'll need to determine what each of these generate.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is getting too detailed. Maybe I should think about the possible way the string could be built up by the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if each t can be matched by a production. Since the grammar's productions can lead to terminals, perhaps every t in the string corresponds to a terminal rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided productions, I notice that some NTs produce a single terminal. Let me list all the nt's that directly produce a terminal and see if they match the string.\n\nLet's go through the nt rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't24'\nNT2 \u2192 't12'\nNT5: I don't see a rule for NT5 in the given list. Hmm, maybe I need to check whether each t in the string corresponds to one of these.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt0: Not listed anywhere, because in the rules, I don't see NT0. So maybe t0 isn't directly matched by any production. Wait, that's a problem because in the string, the first terminal is t0, but if no production rules in the grammar directly produce t0, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check the provided rules. Let me go through each line:\n\nThe first line: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\nSo S is derived from two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nNext, NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules carefully, I'm trying to find which NTs directly produce a terminal (i.e., have a production rule ending with 'a single terminal symbol'). Each line, after the initial symbol, either has two NTs or a single terminal as the RHS.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo when a production rule for NT2 is followed, it directly produces 't12'. Similarly, any NT whose production ends with a terminal can contribute to the string.\n\nSimilarly, looking through the nt rules:\n\nNT50\u2192't3'\n\nSo when NT50 is produced, it becomes 't3'.\n\nBut looking for a production that starts with NT0, I don't see any. So if the string has 't0', then it's impossible because no production rule leads to t0. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first terminal is 't0'. But looking at all the NT rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't0' directly. So the string contains a term 't0', which cannot be generated by any production rule in the grammar.\n\nSo unless I'm missing something, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because of that 't0' in the beginning.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT56 NT45. So, the string must start with the left-hand sides of these productions.

Let's look at what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT45 -> NT6 NT45\n\nSo, S expands to NT56 NT45, which then expands to NT69 NT44 NT6 NT45.\n\nNow, looking at each terminal in the string, let's try to see if they can be produced by the non-terminals.\n\nThe first terminal is t29. Looking through the grammar, I see NT26 -> 't6' and some other rules, but t29 isn't directly visible. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't28' but nothing for t29.

If no production in the grammar leads to t29, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe there's a way to derive t29 through the productions. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking for t29, I see that in the grammar, no production directly gives t29. For example, NT26 -> 't6', NT26 -> NT36 NT3, NT36 -> NT25 NT70, which leads to 't17', etc. So, there's no path to t29 from any non-terminal in the grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the initial production S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so S must derive into a sequence starting with NT56 and NT45. Each of these can then branch out into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll note the terminals in the string: t13, t25, t3, t4, t29, t20, t0, t9, t7, t5, t7, t6, t37, t25, t3, t20, t3, t29, t17, t36, t26, t2, t10, t29, t33, t5, t5, t6, t2, t34, t34, t26, t20, t12, t3, t28, t28.\n\nThis is a long string, so I might want to see if there's a pattern that corresponds to any of the production rules.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the start symbol S into NT56 and NT45. So, the string should start with the expansion of NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from the grammar). Wait, but in the string, the first t13 is part of the first NT56's expansion. That might not directly correspond because NT56's productions are two steps. Alternatively, maybe I should look for each part in the string to see if they can be linked through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals, and each production step adds certain terminals. Maybe it's better to look for the breakdown of each non-terminal in the grammar into terminals.\n\nFor example, take NT56: it's used in the initial step as S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, NT56 must derive into a terminal sequence that starts with t13 (since the string starts with t13). Looking at NT56's rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44  \nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49  \nNT63 \u2192 't9'  \nNT49 \u2192 NT45  \nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, each production in the grammar has only the non-terminals except for the terminal options. Let me list the productions for NT56:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nIs there any way to reduce NT56? It only expands into NT69 and NT44. Then, each of those non-terminals have their own productions. For example, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead, I can parse the string by looking for matches in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if each segment of the string corresponds to a rule. For instance, starting with t13, which is produced by NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36, etc. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to approach this from the top-down.\n\nWait, the string starts with t13. So perhaps t13 is the result of some non-terminal directly. Let me look for any non-terminals that produce t13 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT1 \u2192 't24', NT2 \u2192 't12', NT3 \u2192 't24', NT5 \u2192 't37', NT25 \u2192 't10', NT29 \u2192 t29 (no, it's 't29' as a terminal?), wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the production rules are:\n\nLooking for rules that end with a terminal. For example, NT68 \u2192 't3', etc. So each non-terminal can end up producing some terminals.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals that have a terminal as a product:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the ones that have terminals are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36  \nWait, no, actually, NT7's production is NT13 NT36, but 't13' is a terminal. Because looking at the list:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't27'  \nNT26 \u2192 't4' and another production to 't29'  \nNT21 \u2192 NT71 NT31  \nNT26 also has 't29'  \nNT36 \u2192 NT25 't70'  \nWait, maybe I should make a list of all non-terminals that have terminal productions:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'  \n- NT45 \u2192 't4' (from S's production)  \n- NT4 \u2192 't37'  \n- NT28 \u2192 't36'  \nWait, no, the production is NT28 \u2192 t36? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, I'll note which non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'  \nNT45 \u2192 't4'  \nNT6 \u2192 't1' (maybe) Wait, NT6's production: NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22. Oh, that doesn't produce a terminal. Let me go through each rule.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48 (t9 and t4)  \nWait, actually, in each production, the right-hand side is either non-terminals or terminals. So for example, NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26, but if any of those non-terminals produce terminals, then eventually, you can get a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't the best.

Maybe I should look for specific sequences in the string that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the non-terminals' expansions.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: t13 t25 t3 t7 t4 t29 t20 t0 t9 t7 t5 t7 t6 t37 t25 t3 t20 t3 t29 t17 t36 t26 t2 t10 t29 t33 t5 t5 t6 t2 t34 t34 t26 t20 t12 t3 t28 t28.\n\nI notice that t25 appears several times.

{"custom_id":"request-703","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, some of which are terminal symbols ('t' followed by numbers) and others that might be non-terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. However, looking at the grammar, I see some productions where the right-hand side is two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. But wait, NT might be a non-terminal or a terminal? Hmm, in CNF, all right-hand sides must be two symbols if it's non-terminal on the left, but I'm seeing that some are terminals. So maybe NT is a non-terminal, but in some cases, they're combined with terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps NT is part of the non-terminals, but in some cases, it's being used with terminals directly, which might complicate things. Or perhaps the grammar uses a mix where some non-terminals could derive into terminals. But looking at the grammar, it's all in CNF, so perhaps each production's RHS has either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, for instance, the production S \u2192 NT56 NT45 is a bit confusing because NT56 and NT45 might themselves be non-terminals that eventually derive into terminals, or perhaps they are terminal symbols. But the string includes tokens like t21, t32, etc., so those might be terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm, but maybe I can try to break down the string and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t21 t32 t0 t13 t21 t20 t2 t32 t4 t26 t15 t6 t33 t7 t20 t36 t3 t14 t33 t9 t29 t21 t1 t5 t32 t3 t6 t9 t0 t3 t27 t6 t28 t6 t10 t20 t5 t33`.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't21', which is a terminal. So I need to see if any rule directly produces 't21'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT21 \u2192 NT22 NT35, but both are non-terminals. Wait, NT21 is a non-terminal that splits into NT22 and NT35. NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, again non-terminals. NT48 breaks down into NT25 and NT39, more non-terminals. This seems like a chain of non-terminals that eventually must derive into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a rule that can produce a terminal. Let's check other productions. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17', so that's a non-terminal that directly produces 't17', a terminal. Similarly, NT71 \u2192 't14'. Others like NT68 \u2192 't3', NT69 \u2192 't5', etc. So many non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLet me map out which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17  \nNT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8 \u2192 wait, NT34 \u2192 t24, NT8 \u2192 t13, so NT34 leads to t24, but NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8, so t24 t13? No, that would be a sequence. Wait, but in the string, we have t24 somewhere?\n\nWait, actually, looking for terminals in the string, I see t21, t32, etc. Let's see if any of the non-terminals produce these. For example, does any non-terminal produce t21? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT22 NT35\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT25 \u2192 NT10\n- NT10 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT10 is defined as NT28 \u2192 NT10, wait maybe it's a loop? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to start from the beginning and try to see how the string could be broken down.\n\nThe string starts with t21. So t21 must come from a non-terminal that produces t21. Looking at the productions, are there any non-terminals that produce t21 directly? Scanning through:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21 \u2192 so NT47 can produce NT7 (which is t13) and t21. Wait, but in the grammar, NT47 is non-terminal ->t7 \u2192 Wait no, NT7 is t13, but NT47 is NT7 NT21, which would produce t13 t21 if both are terminals. But in the grammar, NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21, which would be t13 t21, but I don't see such a production.\n\nWait, looking more carefully: NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21. NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36. NT13 \u2192 t24. NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT25 \u2192 NT10. NT70 \u2192 t17. So, NT47 \u2192 NT7 (which is t13, then t24?), but maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, starting with the first symbol t21.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there any non-terminal that produces t21 directly? Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see any. So t21 must be derived from a non-terminal. Let's see if any production ends with t21.\n\nLooking for A \u2192 ... t21.\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS includes t21.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t15 (but that's a terminal, perhaps), wait looking for nt that derive into t21.\n\nWait, actually, let's check each production line:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that has t21 in its production.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Both are non-terminals.\n\nThen lines 2-25: various non-terminals, some have terminals as single symbols.\n\nLike:\n\nLine 44: NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8  \nLine 45: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45  \nLine 46: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66  \nLine 47: NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56  \nLine 57: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3  \nLine 60: NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26  \nLine 62: NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36  \nLine 64: NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5  \nLine 65: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46  \nLine 67: NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66  \nLine 68: NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7  \nLine 70: NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31  \nLine 72: NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26  \nLine 73: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70  \nLine 75: NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT5  \nLine 76: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3  \nLine 78: NT68 \u2192 NT36 NT3  \nLine 80: NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50  \nLine 84: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3  \nLine 87: NT46 \u2192 NT4 NT37  \nWait, maybe I need to check other lines.\n\nWait, line 70: NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31. NT49 is defined as NT22 NT66, and NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50.\n\nSo t21 comes from NT21, which is NT49 NT31, but neither NT49 nor NT31 produce terminal t21. Hmm, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t21 is part of a longer sequence of t21 and t32. Let me look for the first few symbols: t21, t32, t0, etc.\n\nLooking at the first token t21, so the entire string starts with t21. That suggests that the starting symbol S must produce something that includes t21.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is the start symbol, which is two non-terminals. So the entire string would be a derivation from S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which would then derive into two sequences.\n\nSo the string is: t21 t32 t0 t13 t21 t20 t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-727","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is in the language defined by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' number corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. My goal is to see if there's a way to derive this string step by step using the production rules of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since all the productions are in this form, the derivation process is deterministic, and each step produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is: `t17 t2 t9 t36 t37 t17 t24 t32 t29 t9 t5 t14 t1 t32 t12 t25 t10 t12 t17 t15 t33 t29 t0 t36 t28 t14 t4 t37 t12 t25 t4 t10 t21 t10 t26 t13 t20 t36 t2`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't17', which must come from a production rule that generates 't17'. Looking through the grammar, I see that `NT6-> 't9', 't4'` isn't there. Wait, actually, I should scan the grammar for any non-terminals that produce 't17'. Scanning the right-hand sides, I find `NT70->'t17'` and `NT69->'t5'`. So, 't17' comes from NT70.\n\nSince the string starts with 't17', that must be the first production. So, the initial symbol must derive to 't17', meaning S must first produce something that includes NT70. Looking back at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions: `S->NT56 NT45` and maybe others, but the initial productions for S are fixed. The first production for S is S->NT56 NT45.\n\nWait, the start symbol S has only one production in the provided grammar: S -> NT56 NT45. So S must derive to NT56 NT45. Now, NT56 has a production NT56->NT69 NT44. So after S, we get NT56 NT45, which can split into NT69 NT44 and NT45.\n\nBut the string starts with t17, which comes from NT70. So perhaps the S production leads to something that eventually produces t17. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong point. Since S directly produces NT56 NT45, and each of these can split further, I need to see how that leads to the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the productions of the grammar. Let's list the tokens in order and try to parse them.\n\n1. t17\n2. t2\n3. t9\n4. t36\n5. t37\n6. t17\n7. t24\n8. t32\n9. t29\n10. t9\n11. t5\n12. t14\n13. t1\n14. t32\n15. t12\n16. t25\n17. t10\n18. t12\n19. t17\n20. t15\n21. t33\n22. t29\n23. t0\n24. t36\n25. t28\n26. t14\n27. t4\n28. t37\n29. t12\n30. t25\n31. t4\n32. t10\n33. t21\n34. t10\n35. t26\n36. t13\n37. t20\n38. t36\n39. t2\n\nThis is a lot of tokens. Let's see if we can find a way to parse them.\n\nStarting with 't17', which comes from NT70. So, we need to see if NT70 can produce this sequence. Looking back, NT70 has a production NT70-> 't17', which is just 't17'. So, if NT70 \u2192 't17', then the rest of the string after 't17' must be generated by another part.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with 't17', which is the first symbol. So S must first produce something that starts with NT70, right? Because NT70 is the only non-terminal that directly produces 't17' in the grammar. So the initial step would be S-> NT56 NT45, which can split into NT56 and NT45. But 't17' is from NT70, which isn't directly a child of NT56 or NT45. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with NT70, but looking back, S can only produce NT56 NT45. So perhaps the initial step is correct, but we need to see how NT56 and NT45 can be expanded further to produce the starting 't17'.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to see the entire string as derived from S. Let's see, the entire string is 39 tokens long. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, looking for production rules.\n\nBut given the complexity, another approach is to check if each 'ti' can be produced by the grammar. For example, does each token in the string exist in the grammar as a terminal production? Let's check each 'ti' in the string:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are: t0, t1, t2, t3 (as in NT36->t25 t70, but wait, I should look at all the right-hand sides where terminals are on the right.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT50->'t3'. NT70->'t17'. NT69->'t5'. NT66->'t6'. NT45->'t4'. So each of these tokens exists in the grammar.\n\nSo the string is composed of terminals that are all in the grammar, so that's a good start.\n\nBut to see if the string is derived, we need to see if the grammar can produce this exact sequence.\n\nGiven that the grammar is context-free and in CNF, it's a tree, so each production step adds exactly two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) except when a terminal is derived.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A\u2192a. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or one terminal. When two non-terminals produce two terminals, we can see that the depth of the parse tree is log2(n), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use recursive descent parsing or the CYK algorithm, but since I can't implement it right now, I'll try to break it down.\n\nLet me consider the string and see if it can be partitioned into sub-strings that match the productions.\n\nStarting with 't17', which is from NT70, so I need a production for NT70. Looking at the grammar, NT70->'t17'. So that's one possibility. But in the string, after 't17', we have 't2 t9 t36...'. Wait, but S is the start symbol, and S-> NT56 NT45. So how does that start with NT70? It seems like the first step is S->NT56 NT45, and then NT56 and NT45 must derive the rest.\n\nWait, that can't be because NT56 and NT45 are separate and can't combine to produce a single NT70. So maybe I'm looking at the wrong structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT56 producing 't2', which is a terminal. Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the possible terminals that appear in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the right-hand sides have the following terminals:\n\nt0 (appears in NT28, for example, NT68->t3)\n\nt1 (appears in NT13, NT26, etc.)\n\nt2 (appears in NT3, etc.)\n\nt3 (appears in NT34, NT25, etc.)\n\nt4 (appears in NT6, etc.)\n\nt5 (appears in NT70, NT69)\n\nt6 (appears in NT66, etc.)\n\nt9 (appears in NT36, etc.)\n\nt17 (appears in NT70)\n\nt24 (appears multiple times)\n\nt25 (appears in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-728","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. First, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar and the string we're testing. \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems a bit complex with many productions. Each non-terminal (like S, NT22, NT61, etc.) has right-hand sides that are combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't33 t36 t28...' and so on. My goal is to see if this entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can break it down into the string by following the productions. Since the grammar is in ChNF, every production either generates two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, in the given grammar, most right-hand sides are two non-terminals, except some are a single terminal like 't36' or 't5'. Wait, actually, looking closer, the grammar does have some rules like S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is two non-terminals, and others like NT6 -> 't1'. So some rules produce terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nBut wait, the grammar I was given is entirely in ChNF, which allows two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. So that's correct. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if each 't' corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar.\n\nI should map each 't' in the string to see if it's covered by the grammar. For example, 't36' appears twice in the string. Let me check the grammar for 't36'. Looking through the rules, I see NT70 \u2192 't17', NT69 \u2192 't5', NT8 \u2192 't13', NT56 \u2192 't33', NT45 \u2192 't4', NT68 \u2192 't3', NT71 \u2192 't14', NT25 \u2192 't10', NT36 appears as a non-terminal in rules like NT66 -> 't6' and NT70 -> 't17', etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't33', which occurs at the start of the string. The rule NT56 \u2192 't33' is present. So the first part of the string could be generated by NT56. Similarly, the next part is 't36'. Let's see NT36's productions. Looking at the grammar, I see NT36 \u2192 't25' and NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and also NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20, and NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT68, and others. So 't36' could be directly produced by NT36 \u2192 't25' via NT25 possibly.\n\nWait, but 't36' is a terminal. So in the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't36'? Looking at the rules, I see NT42 \u2192 't6', NT28 \u2192 't36'\u2014yes! So NT28 \u2192 't36'. So 't36' is directly produced by NT28. So that works.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and working my way down.\n\nThe string is: t33 t36 t28 t37 t9 t34 t20 t9 t29 t27 t29 t33 t29 t3 t3 t24 t13 t13 t13 t33 t4 t25 t10 t20 t6 t20 t5 t4 t27 t3 t3 t14 t24 t15 t24 t34 t36 t2 t21.\n\nThat's 43 tokens. Let me see how the grammar can produce this.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S must expand to NT56 and NT45. So S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, looking at NT56 \u2192 't33' as per the production NT56 \u2192 't33'. So the first part is 't33', which matches the string.\n\nNext is NT45. Looking at the productions for NT45, I see NT45 \u2192 't4'. So NT45 becomes 't4'. So now, the string so far is 't33 t4'.\n\nWait, but the next token is 't36', not 't4'. So that can't be right because after S, it's NT56 (gives 't33') and NT45 (gives 't4'), which would produce 't33 t4'. But the string is 't33 t36 t28...', so that's a mismatch. So maybe I'm wrong in choosing NT45 to be 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT45 doesn't produce 't4' in this case. Alternatively, maybe NT45 has another production that can lead to a longer sequence. Wait, let me check all the NT45 productions.\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT45 includes: NT45 \u2192 't4'. Are there others? Wait, in the initial grammar provided, the list for NT45 is: NT45 \u2192 't4' and another rule NT55 \u2192 't45' or something?

Wait, no, actually, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, let me read through each production:\n\nWait, actually, the grammar has:\n\nNT48-> 't24' is one line, which is NT48 producing 't24'.\n\nWait, let me perhaps list all the NT45 production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-752","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. The grammar provided fits this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nThe task is to check if the string `t25 t33 t17 t21 t24 t29 t29 t33 t37 t15 t14 t2 t9 t6 t26 t21 t3 t33 t6 t10 t15 t0 t32 t9 t28 t17 t27 t3 t2 t0 t7 t21 t6 t33 t25 t26 t14 t36 t20 t1` is generated by this grammar. \n\nI know that since the grammar is in CNF, each production contributes exactly one terminal symbol on the right-hand side of a non-terminal. This also implies that the derivation of any string will consist of a sequence of these productions, leading to the terminal string. Each step appends a single terminal, so the length of the string corresponds to the number of productions applied minus one. Let me count the tokens here. \n\nCounting the tokens in the string: let's see, each space-separated term is one token. I'll count them one by one. Hmm, it's a bit tedious, but I think the string has around 64 tokens? Wait, I'll recount: starting from the first `t25`, I'll continue until the end. 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 63 tokens. So, the string has 63 symbols. \n\nIn a CNF grammar, each production introduces exactly one terminal, except for the start symbol which might have multiple non-terminals. The length of the string should then be equal to the number of productions applied, considering the start symbol. Since the start symbol S is expanded into two non-terminals, and each step adds one terminal, the total number of symbols should be n+1, where n is the number of productions. But perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production adds one terminal. So if the start symbol S is expanded into two non-terminals, and each non-terminal can be expanded further, leading to terminals. The length of the string is the number of terminals, which is equal to the number of steps taken from the start symbol to the terminals. So, the number of terminals is equal to the number of productions applied minus the initial two non-terminals. Wait, perhaps it's better to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, the height of the parse tree would be the number of symbols in the string plus one, but I might be overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI think the key is to build a parse tree for the given string, ensuring that each step follows the productions. Since the grammar is given, and it's in CNF, any string generated must consist of a sequence of terminals where each non-terminal's production exactly covers the symbols generated from its children.\n\nTo approach this, I'll look for the terminals in the string and see if they can be matched to any production rules. Wait, but in this grammar, the production rules are all non-terminals on the left, and on the right, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait no, looking back, all productions are in the form A \u2192 NT... a, where NT is non-terminal and a is terminal, except in the given grammar, I see that all productions are A \u2192 NT NT, with some exception? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n- NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8\n- ... \n- Wait, no. All productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NYT NYZ, except maybe some. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, etc. So all productions have non-terminals on the right side except when a terminal appears. Wait, looking again, no. Wait, the way the productions are written is a bit confusing. Let me check a few.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals. The next production is NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. NT63 and NT48 are non-terminals. \n\nWait, looking further, I see that some productions have a terminal on the right-hand side. For example, NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, which are both non-terminals. Wait, no terminals yet. Let me check others:\n\nWait, in the production NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36. Still non-terminals. Hmm. Wait, I'm looking through all the productions, and I think all of them are NT -> NT NT. Because looking at all the production rules given, each rule is of the form NT XYZ, where XYZ are non-terminals. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nFor example, looking at NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT21, which is non-terminals. Similarly, NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, wait, wait! Here's a production with a terminal on the right: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. Oh, so that's where the terminals start.\n\nSo, some productions have terminals like NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. So that's one terminal, '3'. Similarly, when looking through, I might find other terminals. \n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some productions have a terminal as part of the right-hand side. So, for example:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT45 \u2192 NT6 NT45\nWait, no, NT45 \u2192 NT6 NT45? No, that's recursive. Wait, perhaps some other productions have terminals. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, so that's a terminal. Similarly, there's NT63 \u2192 't9'? Wait, let's check that.\n\nLooking back at the production NT63 \u2192 't9'. So that's a terminal. Similarly, NT70 \u2192 't17', NT30 \u2192 't17', NT18 \u2192 't32', etc. So, the grammar has some productions where the right-hand side includes a terminal.\n\nSo, the string provided consists of a sequence of terminals. The string is a sequence of these terminals, so to parse it, we need to construct a derivation where each step leads to the next terminal in the string.\n\nEach time a production is used, it can contribute one or two terminals. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each production contributes at most one terminal. So each step in the derivation appends exactly one terminal symbol.\n\nSo the length of the string is equal to the number of terminals generated, which is equal to the number of times a production that includes a terminal is used. For example, if you have 63 terminals, then you must have 63 steps where a terminal was generated, plus the initial two non-terminals. Wait, maybe that's not the right way.\n\nLet me think about the process. Starting from S, which is a non-terminal, and then applying productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. The number of steps would correspond to the depth of the parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to attempt to parse the given string step by step. The idea is to construct a parse tree that consumes the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small and in CNF, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence of symbols where each symbol corresponds to a production.\n\nGiven the string, each token must correspond to a production's right-hand side, either with two non-terminals (i.e., the production NTXYZ where XYZ are non-terminals) or one terminal. Since in CNF all productions have two non-terminals except for those that introduce a terminal.\n\nWait, but some productions have terminals as part of their right-hand side. For example, NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which corresponds to the terminals '3'. But in the string, each token is just one symbol, like 't25', 't33', etc. So each symbol in the string must be matched to a terminal in some production's right-hand side.\n\nSo, perhaps I can map each terminal in the string to a possible production that ends with that terminal.\n\nFor example, looking at the string: 't25' is the first token. So I need to find a production of the form X \u2192 a, where a is 't25'. So I look through all productions to see which ones have 't25' as their terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\n- NT3 \u2192 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-749","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, so first, I should understand how these tokens relate to each other through the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal on the right. In CNF, every right-hand side (RHS) has exactly two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe string given is: `t36 t13 t4 t28 t6 t28 t20 t33 t3 t24 t15 t13 t13 t26 t36 t5 t24 t13 t9 t33 t13 t12 t25 t34 t34 t33 t6 t21 t33 t27 t14 t1 t29 t14 t3 t37 t37 t14 t10 t13`.\n\nFirst, I notice that many of these tokens are terminals, but some look like non-terminals. Wait, in the grammar, the left-hand sides (LHS) are the non-terminals, and the RHS have a mix. But the string has all terminals except perhaps some non-terminals that don't appear as LHS. Let me check which tokens are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every non-terminal (NTx) appears on the LHS. For example, NT36 has a production. But wait, some tokens in the string, like 't36', are terminals, others are prefixed with 'NT', like NT35, are non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, all non-terminals are prefixed with NT and have numbers, e.g., NT36, NT56, etc. So, any token in the string that starts with 'NT' is a non-terminal, otherwise, it's a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n- t36 is a terminal.\n- NT36 is a non-terminal if present, but I don't see it in the string as a token; wait, no. The string consists only of 't' followed by numbers. So all tokens are terminals because the non-terminals are all prefixed with NT in the grammar.\n\nWait, no, I think I may have made a mistake. The grammar's rules are all about non-terminals (NT), so in the string, each token is either a terminal (like t36) or possibly a non-terminal if it's one of the NT's in the grammar, but wait, NT36 is a non-terminal, but in the string, the tokens are all 't' followed by numbers, so the tokens are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. The string is given consisting of terminal symbols because all are t followed by numbers. The grammar's non-terminals are all labeled as NT followed by a number, such as NT36, NT56, etc. So the string itself doesn't contain any non-terminals; it only has terminals. That suggests that the grammar cannot generate it unless the entire string can be derived through substitutions starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, that can't be because the grammar's start symbol is S. So for the string to be generated, it must be that S eventually expands into the entire string. But given that the string is all terminals and the grammar's non-terminals are all only on the left sides as NTxy, perhaps the only way for the string to be generated is through a series of reductions of those NT symbols down to terminals.\n\nBut looking more carefully, perhaps the string is formed by a sequence where each symbol is the result of a production that leads to a terminal in the end. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to model the string as a sequence of productions and see if we can parse it using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a linear sequence of steps where each step is a substitution of the grammar rules.\n\nBut since all tokens in the string are terminals, the derivation must end when all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. But how?\n\nWait, considering that the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. Since the initial string is entirely terminals, that suggests that the parsing must have started from the start symbol S and replaced it step by step, each time expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut since the string is provided as a list of terminals, perhaps it's a sequence of productions applied step by step to expand S into the string. So, maybe I should see if the string can be broken down into the required production sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of parsing the string using the given productions to see if it's possible to derive the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt36 t13 t4 t28 t6 t28 t20 t33 t3 t24 t15 t13 t13 t26 t36 t5 t24 t13 t9 t33 t13 t12 t25 t34 t34 t33 t6 t21 t33 t27 t14 t1 t29 t14 t3 t37 t37 t14 t10 t13.\n\nThat's a lot of terms. Let me count: 43 tokens.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands into NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nEach of NT56 and NT45 must then be expanded further, each according to their respective productions.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT46\n\nSo, starting with S, the first expansion is NT56 and NT45, each of which then expand into two non-terminals.\n\nSo, from S, we get NT56 NT45.\n\nThen, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT46.\n\nEach of these is another expansion. So, after two steps, S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT69 NT44) (NT63 NT46), making four non-terminals.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT69, NT44, NT63, NT46) then need to be expanded further.\n\nLooking at their productions:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT3\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT33 NT20\n\nLet me note that:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT22 NT3.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT13 NT36.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, maybe instead of trying to follow the entire tree, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be split into segments that match the possible terminal sequences from each non-terminal.\n\nBut considering the string is quite long, maybe it's easier to use a parsing approach, treating the string as a sequence of tokens and trying to match them against the possible derivations of each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a sequence of terminals, and we can check if it's possible to decompose it into a path from S to the entire string via substitutions.\n\nBut with the string being 43 tokens, it's quite lengthy. Alternatively, perhaps the string can only be generated if each production step can be matched in order.\n\nWait, another approach: since it's a context-free grammar, the problem is to see whether the string is in the language, which can be determined using the CYK algorithm or another parsing method. However, implementing CYK would be time-consuming, but perhaps I can try a portion of it.\n\nBut as I'm an assistant, perhaps I can instead look for any inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at each symbol in the string, I can note that all symbols are terminals because they are all 't' followed by numbers.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember has certain characteristics, like each production rule being of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or a terminal followed by non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and each rule has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. I notice there are many non-terminals (like NT1, NT2, etc.), but the terminal symbols are 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are specific terminal tokens.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens with numbers. It looks like the string is: \n\nt25 t0 t25 t7 t33 t28 t7 t7 t2 t25 t4 t36 t10 t32 t33 t9 t2 t34 t24 t17 t24 t36 t33 t25 t34 t10 t34 t15 t1 t1 t37 t10 t2 t17 t29 t9 t12 t29 t37 t10 t9.\n\nThis is quite a long string, so I need a systematic way to parse it. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production has two symbols, so the string can be broken down into a sequence of rule applications. Each production would correspond to two consecutive symbols in the string. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each production can derive two symbols, so the entire string is a sequence of such derivations from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by parsing the string as a leftmost derivation. Starting from S, I'll try to match the leftmost non-terminal in the grammar, replace it with the right-hand side of the applicable production, and see if this can eventually reduce to the entire string.\n\nLet's start by looking at the start symbol S. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, S can be rewritten to NT56 NT45. This means that in the string, starting with 't25 t0 ...', I need to have NT56 and NT45 expanded into the corresponding 't's and other symbols.\n\nWait, actually, the first two tokens should come from NT56 and NT45. So, the first token in the string is 't25', which must correspond to the first symbol from NT56. Let me check if NT56 produces 't25'. Looking at the productions, yes:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, NT56 expands to NT69 NT44. Now, the next token is 't0', which should correspond to NT44. Let me check NT44's productions. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo, NT44 can become NT3 NT26. Now, the string starts as 't25 t0 ...'. From NT56, we have NT69 and NT44. So, after replacing, the first symbols become NT69 NT44, which correspond to 't25' NT69 and T0 NT44.\n\nWait, the first two tokens are 't25 t0', so NT69 should produce 't25' and NT44 should produce 't0'. Let me check NT69 and NT44.\n\nLooking at NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nAnd NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo, NT69 is 't63' followed by NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 \u2192 NT11 NT21, and so on. Hmm, this might get complicated. Maybe it would be better to approach this as a recursive descent parser.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to perform a top-down parsing approach using the provided grammar, tracking how each production could contribute to the string.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. The input string starts with 't25 t0 t25 t7 ...'\n2. The first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, S will replace with NT56 NT45. Now, the input is 't25 t0 ...'. \n\n   So, the first two symbols must correspond to NT56 and NT45 expansions.\n\n   NT56 expands to NT69 NT44. So, after expanding, the input starts with the symbols produced by NT56 and NT45.\n\n   Wait, no. Actually, NT56 and NT45 are both non-terminals, so each will be replaced by their respective productions. So, the first symbol in the input will be from NT56, and the second from NT45.\n\n   So, let's see:\n\n   NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, the first token should be 't25' which comes from NT69. Looking at NT69, we see that NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\n   So, NT69 expands to NT63 and NT49. So, the first token 't25' must come from NT63. Wait, looking at NT63: NT63 \u2192 't9' followed by something else. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT63 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal.\n\n   Wait, no. Let me check the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT46 \u2192 't4'\nBut wait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-768","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals are represented with NT followed by numbers, like NT22, NT61, etc., and some of them directly produce terminals like 't5' or 't17'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t32, t24, t34, t0, t24, t34, t3, t5, t4, t24, t6, t17, t7, t29, t14, t37, t34, t6, t33, t5, t9, t15, t4, t20, t17, t9, t2, t26, t9, t6, t24, t34, t1, t1, t33, t4, t36, t34, t26, t7, t29.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation (or expansion) will result in the string by breaking down each non-terminal into two non-terminals until we reach the terminals. Then, we can concatenate them to see if they match.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the string. Each step should correspond to a production rule that replaces a terminal with a non-terminal. Let me break the string into parts and see if each part can be derived from a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some non-terminals that directly produce terminals. For example, NT68 \u2192 t3, NT66 \u2192 t6, NT36 \u2192 t25, and so on. These are terminals that can help trace back through the grammar.\n\nStarting from the last part of the string to the beginning might be error-prone because sometimes the order matters. Instead, let's see if each pair can be matched to a production.\n\nLet's split the string into pairs of terminals to see if each pair can be produced by some production rule. Remember, in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals, so each step consumes two terminals.\n\nHowever, looking at the grammar, the productions are structured as NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. Each production replaces one non-terminal with two others, and eventually, those become terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the entire process as a leftmost derivation. So each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with its two components. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the reverse approach: start from the given string and see if each terminal pair can be matched to a production. Let's try that.\n\nLet me note that each production in the grammar is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz. So each rule produces two non-terminals. But the terminal strings in the grammar must consist of the concatenation of all the terminal symbols that appear in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to find whether the string can be derived by tracing back through the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a smarter approach is to see if the string matches the structure of the grammar. Since the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S produces two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo the initial expansion would be S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then each of those can be expanded further.\n\nLet me try to get a roadmap:\n\n1. Start with S: NT56 NT45.\n2. Expand each NT into their productions until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me first write down the string and try to match the terminals from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are: t32, t24, t34, t0, t24, t34, t3, t5, t4, t24, t6, t17, t7, t29, t14, t37, t34, t6, t33, t5, t9, t15, t4, t20, t17, t9, t2, t26, t9, t6, t24, t34, t1, t1, t33, t4, t36, t34, t26, t7, t29.\n\nThat's 41 terminals. Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, the total number of symbols ( terminals and non-terminals ) increases by one each step until we reach the top-level rule S.\n\nBut it's complicated to track without a specific method. Maybe I can look for sequences of terminals that can form a production in the grammar.\n\nFor example, let's check if the first two terminals, t32 and t24, can be part of a production that starts with NT that produces t32 and t24. Looking through the grammar, most of the productions are not in the form t32 t24, but maybe some are.\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 t32, so if NT18 can be reached by some production.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT25 \u2192 t10, NT35 \u2192 t9, but perhaps I'm not seeing the connection. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string starts with t32, so perhaps NT18 \u2192 t32. So how can we get to NT18?\n\nLooking through the rules, NT18 \u2192 t32. But to get to NT18, we'd have to have a production that leads to it. Let's see, NT18 is defined as:\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT77 NT94? Wait, no, looking back at the provided grammar, I realize the first part of the problem only lists some rules. Wait, no, the grammar provided includes all the non-terminals, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nLet me re-examine the grammar. It starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so let me find where each NT is defined.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT45 \u2192 NT46 NT6 (Wait, no: in the provided grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22; maybe I'm confused.

{"custom_id":"request-785","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens (like t37, t33, etc.), and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal (A) expands into two non-terminals (BC). The terminals are single symbols and don't appear on the left side of any production. \n\nLooking at the grammar, most non-terminals appear on the left side, like S, NT22, etc. Each of these produces two non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by a number, like t37, t5, etc. At the bottom of the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce these terminals, such as NT70 -> 't17'. So the terminals are the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of these terminal symbols. To check if the string is in the language, I'll need to see if there's a way to derive it using the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string to see its structure:\n\nt37 t5 t33 t7 t9 t1 t20 t5 t14 t14 t29 t9 t20 t34 t20 t6 t5 t1 t6 t21 t24 t6 t7 t25 t17 t17 t20 t7 t5 t34 t7 t12 t20 t33 t6 t6 t29 t12 t6 t21 t6 t10.\n\nThis is a long string, but perhaps I can look for patterns or groupings that match the grammar's rules.\n\nI notice that the grammar starts with S -> NT56 NT45. So the string must start with t33 (from NT56 -> t33) and followed by something from NT45. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t37, which is from NT22 -> t34, but wait, no\u2014NT22 -> t9 is mentioned in the grammar. Wait, no, wait: Let me list some productions:\n\nNT70 -> 't17', NT25 -> 't10', NT47 -> 'NT7 NT21', NT55 -> 'NT56 NT45', NT56 -> 't33' (among others).\n\nSo, the starting symbol S produces NT56 and NT45. So the string must start with the symbols from NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 -> t33, as in the rule NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT69 -> t5, NT44 -> t33. So the first part would be t5 t33.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t37, which is from NT22. That seems inconsistent because S starts with NT56. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is in the correct order of the grammar's starting point. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nSo the string should start with the symbols derived from NT56 and NT45. Let's see:\n\nNT56 has a rule NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT69 -> t5, and NT44 -> t33. So the first part would start with t5 followed by t33.\n\nBut the string starts with t37, which is from NT22 -> t34. So that's conflicting because S's first production is NT56 NT45, so the first token should be from NT56's expansion, which is t33 if NT56 is directly using NT69 and NT44.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the NT56 production more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nAnd NT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nWait, no: Wait, let me find NT56's rules.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nAnd checking further down, NT63 is 't9', NT49 is 't15', etc.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, for NT44, I don't see a production that directly gives t33. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 is 't9'.\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nWait, but NT22 -> NT10, and NT10 might expand further, but perhaps this is too deep. However, I also see that NT56 -> t33 in the rules, right?\n\nWait, actually, wait: Looking through the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule where NT56 directly becomes 't33'. Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nActually, in the grammar provided, NT56's productions are:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nBut looking further, I don't see NT56 producing any terminals. Does that mean that NT56 only expands into other non-terminals? That would mean that NT56 doesn't directly produce 't33'; instead, 't33' comes from another rule, perhaps NT22 -> t34, but wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct my earlier understanding. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals and their productions are as follows:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT70 -> t17\nNT30 -> t17\n...\nWait, no\u2014the grammar has non-terminals on the left side. The terminal 't17' is a production of NT70 and also of NT21 and NT20, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\nNT25 -> 't10'\nNT47 -> NT7 NT21\nNT55 -> NT69 NT45\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n...\nSo each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals, except for NT70, which directly produces t17.\n\nSo, for S to produce a string, it would have to start with NT56 and NT45, each of which must expand into sequences of non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nWait, but the first token in the string is t37, which is from NT22 -> t34. That doesn't make sense because S's first production is NT56 NT45. So unless NT56 and NT45 can directly produce certain terminals, the first token should come from these.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that some non-terminals can produce terminals directly. For example, NT22 -> t34. So if NT56 can reach t37 via some expansion, but I thought NT56 only goes through NT69 and NT44, which don't produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me verify:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 is 't9', and NT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 -> t34.\n\nWait, but do these non-terminals lead to terminals? Let's try to expand step by step.\n\nStart with NT56: \n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 => t9\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\n\nNT22 => t34\n\nNT66 is a non-terminal, let's see what it produces.\n\nNT66 -> NT25 NT6\n\nNT25 => t10\n\nNT6 is NT1 NT22.\n\nWait, NT1 -> 't24'\n\nSo, NT6 (which is NT1):\n\nNT6 -> NT1 NT22 -> 't24' t34\n\nSo going back, NT56:\n\nNT69 produces t9 and NT49 produces what?\n\nNT49 -> NT22 and NT66\n\nNT22 produces t34.\n\nNT66 -> NT25 and NT6.\n\nNT25 produces t10.\n\nNT6 -> 't24' and NT22 (t34)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 \u2192 t9 and NT44 \u2192 then NT49 \u2192 t34 and NT66 \u2192 t10 and 't24' t34\n\nSo the expansion would be t9 t34 t10 t10 t24 t34\n\nWait, that would give the string starting with t9, t34, t10, t10, t24, t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t29 t20 t4 t14 t6 t12 t37 t5 t24 t32 t33 t0 t32 t2 t32 t10 t26 t36 t26 t20 t34 t37 t37 t12 t2 t1 t1 t26 t24 t27 t20 t33 t5 t0 t15 t4 t32 t2 t2 t1 t9 t25`. That's quite a long string with 41 tokens. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right. The start symbol is S, and the productions can be followed down until we reach terminals (the 't' followed by numbers), which are the tokens we're seeing.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation trees are binary. Each step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, each token in the string must be derived by a series of such steps, ending in terminals.\n\nI'll probably need to reconstruct the derivation steps or check if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, every non-terminal seems to have exactly one production rule, so each non-terminal is defined in a specific way. For example, S->NT56 NT45. So, to get the string, it must start with NT56 and NT45. Let's see if the first two tokens correspond to these.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t29 t20 t4 t14..., which are terminals. So, the first two non-terminal symbols derived from S must be NT56 and NT45, but their next steps must produce the strings leading to t29 and t20.\n\nLet me start by seeing what NT56 and NT45 produce. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT45 -> NT25 NT39\n\nSo, NT56 becomes NT69 NT44. Each of these can be further broken down.\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nThen NT69 becomes NT63 NT49, and NT44 becomes NT3 NT26.\n\nContinuing, NT63 becomes 't9' (from NT36 -> 't25 NT70'... wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the NT63: \n\nLooking at the rules, there's a rule NT63->'t9'? Wait, no, NT36 -> 't25 NT70' and NT63 is produced by something else.

Let me check: \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, under NT63, it's written as 't9' (e.g., NT36 -> 't25 NT70', but does any NT63 production lead to 't9'? I see a rule: NT63 -> 't9'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules: Yes, there's a line: NT63 -> 't9' which probably refers to NT68. Wait, no, let's clarify.\n\nWait, the rules for NT36 are:\n\nNT68 -> 't36'\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nWait, the rules given are for NT symbols, like S, NT56, NT22, etc. Each NT has a production rule, which may be another NT or a terminal. \n\nSo, for NT63: looking through the rules, I see NT63 is produced by NT36? Or is it a direct terminal? Let me scan:\n\nYes, under NT36, it's written as NT68. Wait, no. Let me check each line carefully.\n\nLooking down the list:\n\nNT68 -> 't26'\nWait, no. Wait, the list is long. Let me list all NT productions:\n\nThe rules are numerous, so I'll try to find each NT and where it points to.\n\nFor example, NT68 -> 't36'? No, looking through, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT68 -> 't36' (wait, no. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26 (line 40? Not sure, but let me list all lines with NT... )\n\nLooking through:\n\nLine 30: NT6 -> NT1 NT22\nLine 31: NT61 -> NT18 NT59\nLine 32: NT21 -> NT49 NT31\nLine 33: NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\nLine 34: NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\nLine 35: NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\nLine 36: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\nLine 37: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\nLine 38: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nLine 39: NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56\n... and so on.\n\nWait, for NT6, it's NT6\u2192NT1 NT22.\n\nFor NT61: NT61\u2192NT18 NT59.\n\nWait, I think it's getting too complicated to track each NT. Maybe a better approach is to model the possible expansions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains tokens that are not present as terminals in the grammar, which would immediately mean the string is invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-812","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is a set of production rules.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form looks like. From what I remember, Chomsky normal form has production rules where each rule's left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Additionally, the start symbol doesn't produce the empty string.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit Chomsky normal form. Each rule on the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side varies between two non-terminals or terminals, except where I might have missed something. For example, S -> NT56 NT45. NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, and 't's are terminal symbols. I notice that several rules have two non-terminals on the right, which is fine, and some have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, which might be a bit unusual. Wait, in CNF, right-hand sides can be terminals or non-terminals as long as the structure is correct. I think it's okay.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t33 t26 t24 t32 t7 t25 t1 t24 t6 t32 t26 t17 t21 t15 t26 t4 t36 t24 t7 t13 t15 t25 t21 t9 t7 t28 t29 t29 t7 t28 t36 t27 t2 t33 t17 t25 t25 t3 t4`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Essentially, I have to see if, starting from the start symbol (probably S), the string can be derived through a series of applications of the production rules.\n\nBut manually traversing all possible derivations for a string of this length (which seems quite long, 63 tokens) is impractical. There must be a smarter way.\n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of derivation trees or to simulate the parsing process, perhaps through a CYK algorithm. However, since the CYK algorithm is more complex, and without specifically implementing it, I should think about the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nI should look at the terminals in the string and see if they can be matched by the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t33, t26, t24, t32, t7, t25, t1, t24, t6, t32, t26, t17, t21, t15, t26, t4, t36, t24, t7, t13, t15, t25, t21, t9, t7, t28, t29, t29, t7, t28, t36, t27, t2, t33, t17, t25, t25, t3, t4.\n\nNow, I should check if each of these terminals is present as a terminal in any production rule.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of the production rules, I see terminals like 't9', 't4', 't36', etc. But some terminals might not be present, which would immediately mean the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the terminals are listed as 't5', 't17', 't27', 't4', 't29', 't6', 't5', 't69', 't45', 't68', 't34', 't24', 't71', 't13', 't24', 't68', 't17', 't48', 't28', 't26', 't36', 't25', 't70', 't30', 't18', 't50', 't49', 't34', 't68', 't69', 't44', 't15', 't25', 't79', 't31', 't4', etc. Wait, each production rule has different terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, I see a 't2' which isn't in any of the terminal symbols listed. Let me check the provided grammar to see if 't2' is present.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any that produce 't2'. For example, S->NT56 NT45 produces t5 from NT45, but I don't see a rule that directly expands to t2. So if 't2' is part of the string, and it's not present in any production rule, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me double-check. The production rules include things like NT36 -> NT25 NT70, NT6 -> NT1 NT22, etc. But I need to see if any of the RHSs produce 't2'.\n\nLooking through each production, it seems that the terminals are as follows: NT56 may go to t33 or 't4', for example. But 't2' isn't appearing on any right-hand side. Therefore, if the string contains 't2', it's impossible because the grammar doesn't have any rule that generates 't2'.\n\nSo, looking back at the string: ... 't2', 't33', etc.\n\nSo yes, the string contains 't2', which is not present in any terminal symbol of the given grammar. Therefore, it's not possible for the grammar to generate this string. Hence, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-804","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The terminal symbols are all the 't' followed by numbers because I can see each symbol in the string is like 't10', 't20', etc., down to 't5'. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production rules are all non-terminals. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from S using these rules. \n\nThe string provided is quite long: t10 t20 t33 t0 t1 t4 t3 t13 t28 t32 t27 t5 t14 t9 t27 t15 t28 t21 t15 t10 t27 t17 t25 t27 t3 t37 t28 t3 t27 t7 t5 t3 t28 t26 t5 t32 t32 t26 t10 t33 t32 t9 t33. \n\nI need to parse this string, which is composed entirely of terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal. The derivation will involve expanding non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n...\nThe NT rules are a bit complex, but I can see that each NT refers to other NTs, which eventually derive to terminals. \n\nI should try to see which NTs correspond to the given terminal string parts. Let me pick up where the string starts and see if there's a path.\n\nThe string starts with t10. Looking at the grammar, I find NT30 \u2192 t17, NT61 \u2192 t27, but t10 itself isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, the rule NT30 \u2192 t17 is defined, but t10 is another terminal, so I need to check if any NT production leads to t10.\n\nLooking through, I see NT10 \u2192 t28. So, to get t10, I can't directly because t10 is a terminal, but it might be a leaf in the derivation. Wait, no, because NT10 isn't a terminal because it's written as an NT. So to have t10 as a terminal, we need a production rule that includes NT10 \u2192 something that can split into t28. Wait, but actually, in the string, we have t10 appearing twice. Let me check the grammar for NT10, which I see it's defined as NT10 \u2192 t28. So, t10 is generated by NT10. Hmm, wait, this might be a mistake because NT10 is a non-terminal, and the string has a 't10' token, which would have to come directly from a production of NT10, but the grammar for NT10 is only NT10 \u2192 t28. Wait, no, that can't be, because NT10 is a non-terminal that can only produce t28. So perhaps I misread; let's check again.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, I find:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t17\nNT10 \u2192 t28\nNT70 \u2192 t17\nNT61 \u2192 t27\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT69 \u2192 t5\nNT18 \u2192 t32\nNT2 \u2192 t12\nNT13 \u2192 t24\nNT34 \u2192 t24\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n...\nHmm, none of these produce 't10'. Wait, that's confusing because the string has a 't10'. Oh, perhaps I made an error in looking through the rules. Let me check through all NT rules to see if any produce 't10'. \n\nLooking through all NT rules:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8, NT54 NT45\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, etc.\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT18 \u2192 NT32 NT5\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35\n- NT25 \u2192 NT10\n- NT22 \u2192 NT0 (assuming NT22 \u2192 t0, because I see NT22: wait, no, in the grammar, it's NT22 \u2192 NT0, which is a terminal since t0 is in the string, so NT22 produces t20? Wait, no, let me check the NT22 production: NT22 \u2192 NT0; the NT0 production is?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT0 except in NT22. For example, looking for NT0: Do any NT rules lead to NT0? Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\n- Looking down, I see NT22 \u2192 NT0\n- Is there any rule that leads to NT22, which is t20?\n\nSo the production chain might involve NT22 leading to t20 because NT22 \u2192 NT0, and if NT0 has a production, perhaps it can split into terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, in the rules, NT22 \u2192 NT0 is defined. Then, is there a production for NT0? Because t20 is in the string but in the grammar, I can't find a production for NT0, except in the case that NT22 leads to t20. But wait, no: NT22 \u2192 NT0, and if NT0 is not further expanded, then NT22 can only derive to NT0, but in the string, 't20' is a terminal, which must come from a terminal production. If NT22 \u2192 NT0, and NT0 only produces NT0, then that would be a problem. Unless NT0 actually does produce some terminal, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me look again for production rules:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45 (so two non-terminals)\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\nNT45 \u2192 NT6 NT45 (wait, is that a rule?

{"custom_id":"request-827","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nSo, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which has two non-terminals as well. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' represents a terminal symbol, which in this case seems to be a specific string made up of letters and numbers. \n\nThe given string is: `t6 t32 t15 t24 t36 t26 t17 t14 t10 t20 t1 t28 t28 t2 t28 t26 t3 t17 t15 t0 t33 t0 t37 t14 t17 t36 t26 t24 t21 t25 t26 t15 t13 t3 t33 t33 t0 t24 t14 t15 t10 t24 t9 t0`.\n\nFirst, I notice that this string is quite long, with many 't' sequences. I think each 't' is part of a production rule that generates a certain string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal on the right-hand side of a production will eventually derive into a string of terminals. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. So, each of these needs to be expanded down to terminal strings. Let's look at the productions for NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT63 -> 't9'\nNT49 -> 't13'\n\nSo, NT56 directly goes to NT69 (which is 't9') and NT44. Now, let's find what NT44 does.\n\nNT44 is in two places:\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nWait, both options are the same. So, NT44 expands to NT3 and NT26. Let's expand those further.\n\nNT3 has two productions:\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55\nNT3 -> NT5\n\nBut wait, the first option is NT3 producing itself and NT55. The second option is NT3 -> NT5. \n\nSo, NT3 can be either a string of NT3s or end with NT5. But NT5 is a terminal? Let me check the productions for NT5. Looking at the rules, NT5 is not listed, which is a bit confusing. Wait, NT5 is a terminal? Or maybe I missed it. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the NT symbols, I don't see NT5 as a non-terminal; it seems that all non Terminals are two letters. Oh, maybe NT5 is actually a terminal. Wait, no, the initial list shows NTs like NT54, NT55, etc., so NT5 isn't in the list, so it's a terminal symbol. Or perhaps it's a typo, but I think in the given grammar, all NTs are defined except the terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the first rule is S -> NT56 NT45. So both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals. The rest of the rules are for NT36 (first occurrence is NT36 -> 't25'), NT45 (-> 't4'), etc. So the terminals are t followed by a number.\n\nIn the given string, we have 't1', 't2', etc., which are terminals. So each 't' is a terminal, and the number following is the index. \n\nSo, going back to NT3. NT3 can expand as:\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55 (which is non-terminal NT3 and NT55)\nor\nNT3 -> NT5 (terminal t5?)\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT5 isn't defined as a nonterminal, so it must be a terminal. Looking back through the rules, the only NT that is a terminal is NT whose rules start with -> and then a 't'... Wait, no. Actually, for example, NT36 -> 't25', so NT36 is a nonterminal that expands to the terminal t25.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. All NTs that appear on the left of -> are nonterminals, and on the right, their expansion can be other NTs or terminals. So, for example, NT54 -> NT6 NT45, so that's two nonterminals. NT68 -> 't3' is a terminal. \n\nWait, looking at NT68's rule: NT68 -> 't3'. So t3 is a terminal. Similarly, some other NTs expand to terminals like t9, t13, etc. So in the grammar, sometimes a nonterminal expands to a terminal terminal string. So terminals are 't' followed by a number, like 't25' or 't4'.\n\nSo, in the grammar, the NTs are the nonterminals, and each production either replaces a nonterminal with two nonterminals or with a terminal symbol (which is a single 't' followed by some digits).\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, some NTs expand into two nonterminals, while others expand into a terminal string. So, for example, NT68->'t3' is a production where NT68 becomes the terminal 't3'. Similarly, NT45 is another case.\n\nSo, in the string we have to produce, each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol. So the string is like t6 t32 t15 t24... etc. So each 't' plus a number is a single terminal. \n\nSo when we're expanding the nonterminals, each step should produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the production steps starting from S.\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nSo S is replaced by NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet's look at NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69: NT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 is 't9', and NT49 is 't13' \u2192 so NT69 becomes 't9 t13'.\n\nNT44: NT44 -> NT3 NT26.\n\nNow, we have to expand NT3 and NT26.\n\nNT3: NT3 -> NT3 NT55.\n\nWait, this seems recursive. So NT3 can produce a string of NT3s, which can further expand. Or it can produce NT5. \n\nWait, NT3's rules are:\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55\nNT3 -> NT5\n\nBut NT55 is another nonterminal. Let's check NT55's expansions.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nWait, but NT56 is 't9 t13', or not. Wait, wait, let me recheck. So NT55's first expansion is NT56 NT45, which is 't9 t13' and 't4'?\n\nWait, let me get this right. Let me parse each production step.\n\nSo, starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (terminal).\n\nNT49 \u2192 't13' (terminal).\n\nSo, NT69 becomes 't9 t13', which is a terminal string.\n\nNow, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nLet's expand NT3 and NT26.\n\nNT3 can be NT3 NT55 or NT5.\n\nIf NT3 \u2192 NT5, then NT5 is a terminal?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT3 is a nonterminal that can expand into other NTs or into a terminal in one step. So NT3's rules are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\nNT3 \u2192 NT5\n\nBut what is NT5? Looking through the production rules, there's no NT5 defined. That's confusing. Did I miss it? The rules listed start with NT22, NT26, etc., but I don't see NT5. So maybe NT5 is a terminal symbol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo. Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed that NT36 has NT36 -> 't5' or something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, for example, NT36 expands to 't25' (among others). So perhaps NT5 is a terminal, but it's not present as an explicit production in the given rules. Maybe the user made a typo, but for now, I'll assume NT5 is a terminal symbol and thus, in the string, it would appear as 't5'.\n\nBut in the string provided, we don't see 't5's except perhaps in 't5' when it's part of something else.

{"custom_id":"request-825","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I have to figure out whether these tokens can be derived from the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammar has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. All non-terminals are on the left-hand side (LHS), and the RHS consists of only terminals or non-terminals. The grammar provided is a bit complicated, with many non-terminals and rules connecting them. I notice that many of the non-terminals eventually produce terminal tokens like 't5', 't17', etc. So, each non-terminal seems to be a parent that can be expanded into two other non-terminals, and this process continues until a terminal is reached.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t0 t7 t12 t36 t9 t5 t2 t36 t21 t4 t7 t10 t15 t25 t13 t7 t27 t2 t5 t4 t26 t34 t9 t36 t15 t15 t0 t32 t24 t36 t26 t12 t37 t21 t3 t32 t25 t24 t36 t5 t15 t7 t34 t9`.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse this string using the given grammar, ensuring that each step follows the production rules. Since the string is quite long, I should perhaps think about whether it's possible at all given the structure of the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I can look for patterns or specific production chains.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals produce two other non-terminals, and each of those can further split. For example, the start symbol S produces NT56 and NT45. NT56 then produces NT69 and NT44, and so on. So, the overall string should be a concatenation of terminal symbols derived from expanding these non-terminals.\n\nEach non-terminal seems to correspond to a specific sequence of terminals, perhaps a step in a derivation. For example, if I look at the initial non-terminals like NT61, NT69, etc., each of them eventually leads to multiple 't' tokens.\n\nBut given the string's structure, it's a linear sequence of 't' tokens. I think I need to construct a parse tree where each internal node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal symbol. The challenge is to see if this exact sequence of terminals can be built by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nI should also note that the string starts with 't0', which requires finding a production that eventually leads to 't0'. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce 't' tokens, like NT1 -> 't24', but I also notice that others might not. Wait, let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I spot several rules where non-terminals produce single terminals, such as:\nNT3 -> 't24'\nNT59 -> 't34'\nBut I don't see an 't0' token being directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, maybe I'm missing it.\n\nLet me scan again. Oh, here's NT68 -> 't3', and NT7 -> 't13', but I don't see 't0' being produced. Wait, actually, looking back, the initial rule is S -> NT56 NT45. Let me see what NT56 and NT45 expand to.\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT3 -> NT35 NT55\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\nNT70 -> 't5' (from NT70 -> 't5')\nWait, but I'm not sure if any of these produce 't0'. Alternatively, perhaps the starting non-terminals may produce 't0' somewhere down the line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string's length suggests that it's too long for any possible production since each step may only add a few terminals, but I can't be certain. Another approach is to check if all the 't's in the string are valid terminal symbols, but the grammar seems to handle various terminals, so that's probably fine.\n\nBut I might be getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about parsing the string step by step, trying to find expansions that match. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive descent parsing approach, starting from the start symbol and breaking down the string into components.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps the grammar's structure makes it impossible because of the way the non-terminals expand, but without seeing a clear pattern, I'm not sure.\n\nWait a second, looking at the start rule S -> NT56 NT45, which are both two non-terminals. So, the string must be a concatenation of expansions of these two non-terminals. So, let's split the string into two parts, assuming that the overall string is the concatenation of two sub-strings generated by NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t0 and has 39 tokens. If the split is after, say, 19 tokens each, maybe it's possible. Let me check if the first part could be generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nBut without knowing the exact expansions, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps each non-terminal corresponds to a fixed sequence of terminals. For example, NT56 in the rule S -> NT56 NT45, and if the string has a 't0' followed by other tokens, perhaps NT56 is the one that generates 't0' and the following tokens.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT44 -> NT3 NT26, NT3 -> NT35 NT55, NT55 -> NT56 NT45, which is the start symbol again. That seems cyclical. So, this suggests that NT56 and NT45 can produce very complex derivations, possibly with loops.\n\nBut the string provided has a lot of 't's, so it's a matter of whether these can be generated through such expansions. It's possible, but I'm not 100% sure because without a clear parse tree, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. If I think about the grammar structure, each non-terminal except the terminals splits into two other non-terminals, and each such split could lead to complex sequences of terminals. So, a string of 39 't's is plausible, especially given that some non-terminals directly produce multiple 't's.\n\nBut wait, another thought: In the string, I notice a 't5' and other 't's, but I also spot that some non-terminals produce the same terminal. For example, NT61 -> NT34 NT8, and NT69 -> NT63 NT49, etc. Without more specific information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the CYK algorithm, which is a dynamic programming method for parsing strings in CNF. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that in a CNF grammar, each rule is a binary tree, so the height of the parse tree must cover the length of the string.\n\nBut without knowing the maximum depth, I can't apply that directly. Wait, the grammar seems to allow for multiple expansions without reaching a terminal too quickly. So, perhaps a string of up to 39 terminals is possible.\n\nAnother point: the string starts with t0. Do any of the non-terminals expand to t0? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly produces t0. Wait, but maybe via chaining rules. Let me see:\n\nFor example, NT3 -> 't24'.\nBut none of the non-terminals go to t0 directly. Hmm, this might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again to ensure I didn't miss any that produce 't0'.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT3 -> 't24'\n- NT68 -> 't3' and 't17'\n- NT2 -> 't48' and 't66' and others\n- NT13 -> 't24'\n- ... and so on. \n\nSo, it seems none of the rules produce 't0' directly.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it's straightforward for parsing, but Chomsky Normal Form has specific rules, so I need to remember those.\n\nFirst, let me recall Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can have a production that goes directly to a terminal. Also, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all productions have two non-terminals except for the ones where the right side might have a terminal. Wait, no, the grammar provided seems to only have the forms like S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which are two non-terminals, but some have terminals like 't5', 't17', etc. So, the non-terminals can produce terminals as well. \n\nIn CNF, a non-terminal can produce a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So that's okay. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nSo, the task is to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions.\n\nThe given string is: \n\nt2 t13 t3 t20 t3 t15 t29 t13 t4 t6 t20 t0 t12 t20 t4 t26 t3 t12 t29 t7 t7 t3 t29 t28 t9 t13 t37 t24 t28 t13 t6 t36 t1 t36 t17 t12 t33 t15 t29 t4 t25 t36 t25 t12 t33.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which translates to two non-terminals. So, the entire string must be a combination of these productions, expanding non-terminals step by step, eventually yielding only terminals.\n\nI'll need to see if the entire string can be reduced using the grammar. Alternatively, I could simulate the expansion process, but the string is quite long, so maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, I can construct a parse tree starting from S and see if I can derive the entire string. But that might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the count of each non-terminal production to see if the string can be matched.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a series of terminals produced by the non-terminals. Let's see.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT56 NT45, the start is NT56 and NT45. Each of these can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI think the way to proceed is to recursively apply the productions, perhaps using memoization or dynamic programming to track which parts of the string can be generated.\n\nBut since the string is long, maybe we can represent the string as a list and apply the productions step by step, replacing non-terminals with their possible terminals or with other non-terminals that can expand further.\n\nBut this would be computationally intensive, especially without writing code. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts and see if it can fit the structure.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t2 t13 t3 t20 t3 t15 t29 t13 t4 t6 t20 t0 t12 t20 t4 t26 t3 t12 t29 t7 t7 t3 t29 t28 t9 t13 t37 t24 t28 t13 t6 t36 t1 t36 t17 t12 t33 t15 t29 t4 t25 t36 t25 t12 t33.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT56 NT45. So, the string must be generated as two parts: one from NT56 and one from NT45. So the initial split is the string being two separate sequences, each generated by NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, no. S produces NT56 and NT45 as two separate symbols, which then each can produce either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, the overall string is a concatenation of the productions of NT56 and NT45. So, if the string is s = s1 s2, where s1 is from NT56 and s2 is from NT45.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string can be split into two parts: s1 and s2, where s1 is the output of NT56 and s2 is the output of NT45.\n\nTherefore, I need to check if the entire string can be divided at some point into two parts where s1 is derived from NT56 and s2 is derived from NT45.\n\nNow, the question becomes: can the given string be split into two parts, s1 and s2, such that s1 is generated by NT56 and s2 by NT45?\n\nSo, I'll need to figure out what s1 and s2 would be, and whether they match the productions of NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 and NT45 have certain productions. Let me write down NT56 and NT45's productions.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\nNT45 \u2192 NT52 NT6?

{"custom_id":"request-846","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols, some of which are terminals (like 't32') and others which are non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol is also a non-terminal. Additionally, all productions are left- or right-heavy, meaning there are no epsilon productions (productions that produce the empty string) unless the start symbol is the only symbol in the grammar. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any epsilon productions; instead, some terminals are at the base, like 't5', 't17', etc.\n\nThe string given is `t32 t36 t9 t9 t32 t9 t17 t26 t25 t12 t3 t17 t10 t17 t26 t0 t20 t0 t36 t12 t10 t7 t2 t37 t0 t33 t37 t14 t14 t32 t10 t6 t33 t26 t28 t27 t3 t27 t9 t9 t3 t15 t6 t12 t29`. \n\nI need to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, the way to approach this is by using either a top-down parsing method (like recursive descent) or a bottom-up parsing method (like the CYK algorithm). Given the size of the string, which is quite long, I might prefer an efficient method like CYK, but since I'm doing this manually, a top-down approach with backtracking might be tedious but feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break down the string into parts that correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. Each terminal in the string must be derived from a production rule that eventually terminates in that terminal. \n\nLet me list the non-terminals and the possible productions that could lead to a terminal.\n\nFor example, looking at NT70, it has productions NT70 -> 't17' and NT70 -> 't7'. Similarly, NT69 -> 't5', and NT68 -> 't3' in some cases, though there might be other ways through.\n\nWait, but the grammar seems to have some conflicting productions. For instance, NT68 has multiple productions: NT68 -> NT28 NT26 and NT68 -> NT28 NT26 again? Or maybe there's a mistake here. Looking closer, I see:\n\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\nNT66 -> NT6 NT45\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\nNT18 -> NT32 NT26\nWait, perhaps I should map out the possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the length of the string. In CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. However, since the given grammar is in CNF, each step either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The number of symbols in the derived string will be (number of productions applied) + 1, since each non-terminal production increases the count by one.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, starting from the start symbol S, each production either introduces two new non-terminals or a terminal. The number of symbols at each step would depend on how the productions are applied. But to derive a string of length n, we need n-1 productions, each introducing a terminal or splitting into two non-terminals. But in this case, I'm given the string, and I need to check if each symbol can be traced back according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a tree and see if each terminal in the string can be generated from some non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string starts with t32. So, the first step is to find a production that leads to t32.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to see if any rule produces 't32'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT18 -> 't32'. So, NT18 can produce 't32'. So, the first part of the string is 't32', which could come from NT18.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't32', so the derivation would be S \u2192 ... eventually leading to NT18 which becomes 't32'.\n\nBut what comes before 't32'? Let's see the structure. The entire string is a sequence of terminals, so each must be the result of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parse the entire string by looking at the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, which then expand into terminals or more non-terminals, and so on until terminals are produced.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to start from the beginning of the string and see if the first symbol can be produced by some non-terminal, then look for a production that connects that non-terminal to the next symbols.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a recursive approach. The entire string must be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me see. The first symbol is 't32', which comes from NT18. So, NT18 \u2192 't32' is a production, so that works.\n\nSo, after 't32', the next part must be the other part of NT18's expansion. Wait, but NT18's production is NT18 \u2192 't32' (a terminal), so that's the end. So, the first part is just 't32', but the next symbol in the string is another 't36', which would need to be part of another production that can branch off.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how production rules apply in a string.\n\nWait, in a context-free grammar, a production is applied to a single non-terminal at a time. So the string is built by replacing a single non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). So, the string is formed by a series of such replacements.\n\nBut the given string is a linear sequence of terminals. So, each step of the grammar application would replace a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the string as a parse tree, where each internal node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nBut since the string is a linear sequence, the parse tree would have a structure that expands each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can process the string from left to right, matching the productions.\n\nLet me try to think of it as a top-down parsing with leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce NT56 NT45 (from S -> NT56 NT45).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, S -> NT56 NT45. So S can be replaced by NT56 followed by NT45.\n\nBut then, each of these non-terminals will be replaced, and so on until we get all terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the string starts with a sequence that can be derived from NT56 or NT45, since S is split into those two.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT56 NT45, each of those can be split further, and so on.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't32', which is produced by NT18. So maybe 't32' is part of the expansion of NT56 or NT45.\n\nLooking at the production options for NT56: the grammar has NT56 -> NT69 NT44 and NT56 -> NT6 NT45. So, NT56 can produce either NT69 followed by NT44, or NT6 followed by NT45.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 has several productions: NT45 can produce NT64 NT22, or NT22 NT25, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the 't32' in the string and see where it can come from. Since 't32' is from NT18, which can't split further (since NT18 \u2192 't32'), so NT18 can't produce anything else except 't32'. So, the 't32' must be the end of the derivation of NT18, which in turn was part of a larger derivation.\n\nBut then, looking back, perhaps the 't32' is the leftmost symbol, which would come from NT18, which itself must be part of a larger non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should map out the structure of the grammar to see how the symbols relate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for chains of terminals that form valid sequences according to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each rule in the grammar has two non-terminals as their left-hand side, except for the epsilon rule, which we don't have here.\n\nSo, each production introduces two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given is a long list of terminals in order.

Let's see where t25 comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 t36 and NT66 \u2192 t6, but where does t25 come from? The terminals in the grammar are 't9', 't4', 't13', 't24', 't27', 't33', 't37', 't34', 't12', 't2', 't0', 't25', 't5', 't7', 't17', etc. Wait, does any production produce t25?\n\nLooking at NT25: NT25 \u2192 't10' and also NT36 \u2192 't26'. But no production where NT has t25 as a terminal. Hmm, but NT28 is 't36', so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT25 \u2192 t10, and in the string, the 19th element is t25. Let me check that. The string is:\n\nt25, t0, t0, t33, t37, t34, t12, t27, t37, t10, t17, t7, t2, t0, t25, t33, t3, t1, t24, t29, t7, t33, t14, t5, t15, t10, t33, t37, t13, t33, t14, t29, t4, t9, t14, t36, t6, t37, t37, t26, t13, t7, t24, t36, t33, t29.\n\nWait, the 14th element is t25. Let's index starting at 0:\n\n0: t25\n\nSo the question is, how can t25 appear in the string?\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only place where t25 appears is in NT36 \u2192 t26. Wait, no, NT36 \u2192 t25? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT66 \u2192 NT25 NT70  \nWait, that's NT25 is a non-terminal. Also, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nSo, the only way to get t25 is if a production for a non-terminal directly produces t25, but looking through the grammar, it seems none of the non-terminals produce t25 directly except perhaps NT36, but NT36 produces t25 as... Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT36 \u2192 t25 NT70. So NT36 can produce t25. So, to get t25, the grammar must have a non-terminal (like NT36) that can derive into t25.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t25, which must come from NT36 \u2192 t25 NT70. So, the parse tree starts with NT36.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which would mean that the start symbol's expansion starts with NT56 and NT45. So, the string must begin with the expansion of NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut wait, looking at the given grammar, the production S \u2192 NT56 NT45 is correct in CNF, as each is a single non-terminal.\n\nSo, the string starts with t25. Let me see how that can happen.\n\nThe first symbol is t25, which can come from NT36's production NT36 \u2192 t25 NT70. So, the NT36 must be expanded into t25 followed by NT70. But in the string, after t25 is t0. So, we have t25 followed by t0. That would require that NT36's NT70 part is t0. But look at the grammar for NT70: NT70 \u2192 't17'. So, NT70 produces 't17', which is a terminal. Therefore, after t25 (from NT36), the next symbol should be t17, but the given string has t0 after t25. That suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption. Let me retrace:\n\nThe first symbol is t25. If that comes from NT36 \u2192 t25 NT70, then in the string, after t25 comes the expansion of NT70, which is 't17'. But the string has t0 next, which is different. So this suggests that the initial symbol t25 cannot be derived, because after it must come t17, but here it's t0, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order.

{"custom_id":"request-870","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is quite long, so this might get a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar to get a clear view. The start symbol is S, and from there, the entire string should be derived. Let me list out the productions:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nLooking further, I see a bunch of productions for NT with varying numbers. Some look like they might break down into terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers or other non-terminals. I'm starting to think that this is a parse tree where each NT symbol is a non-terminal that eventually leads to a Terminal string consisting of 't' followed by numbers.\n\nNow, the string to check is:\n`t5 t3 t7 t32 t37 t32 t13 t24 t6 t13 t21 t12 t5 t37 t5 t10 t21 t9 t0 t36 t36 t28 t21 t3 t29 t3 t24 t1 t26 t20 t20 t4 t37 t0 t0 t6 t29 t3 t7 t15 t27 t2 t12 t34 t3 t15`\n\nI notice that the string starts with t5, t3, etc. Now, the first production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts based on this rule: the part derived from NT56 and the part from NT45.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts:\n\nPart A: From NT56\nPart B: From NT45 (starts after part A ends)\n\nLooking at the string, \"t5\" seems like it could correspond to a rule that produces 't5'. Looking through the productions, I see NT50 -> 't5' for NT50. But wait, NT59 also has 't5' and NT71 -> 't7'. Hmm, but perhaps more importantly, NT56 -> 't33', which would start with t33, but the string starts with t5. That suggests that perhaps the initial production isn't the right way to go.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I should look for NT56 and NT45 as separate non-terminals and see what their productions are. So, perhaps I need to find if the string can be split into two parts where each part is derived from NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nLooking back, S -> NT56 NT45, so after S, we have NT56 and NT45 producing the first and second parts, respectively. Wait, but in the string, the order of the tokens is as listed. So perhaps the first part is a sequence of words from S's NT56, and the second part is a sequence from S's NT45.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, let's check NT56 and NT45. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nWait, so NT56 breaks down into NT69 and NT44. Then NT44 breaks into NT3 and NT26.\n\nAnd NT3 is NT36 NT35? Wait, no, looking back: NT3 -> NT3 NT55 and NT35 -> NT42 NT3. Hmm, this could get complicated. Alternatively, maybe looking for terminals, but perhaps it's easier to consider each NT as a stack of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to work forward from the grammar to see what possible terminals can be formed.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to start from S and see what possible strings can be generated.\n\nGiven that S -> NT56 NT45, the entire string must be the result of replacing both NT56 and NT45 with their respective production rules until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nSo, first, let's see what NT56 and NT45 can produce.\n\nStarting with NT56:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nThen NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 -> NT25 NT70\n\nNT70 -> 't7'\n\nSimilarly, NT49 -> NT18 NT66\n\nNT18 -> 't32'\n\nNT66 -> NT28 NT26\n\nNT28 -> 't28'\n\nNT26 -> 't4' (as per the productions, NT26 -> 't4')? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT26 is actually NT26 -> 't4' and also NT26 -> 't29'. Hmm, so it can produce either. So, in this case, since we have NT26 inside NT49, which is part of NT56's chain, we have to choose one or the other.\n\nWait, but this is getting complex. Let me try to track each production.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree, starting from the root S.\n\nS produces NT56 and NT45. So, the entire string is a combination of the results of NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut given the length, this could take a while. Let me try to follow each half.\n\nFirst, let's process the left part starting from NT56:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 -> NT25 NT70\n\nNT25 -> 't10' (Looking at the grammar, NT25 -> 't10')\n\nNT70 -> 't7'\n\nSo, from NT63, we get 't10' and 't7', so combined, that's 't10 t7'.\n\nNow, NT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55 (So, this is a recursive production, meaning it will eventually produce multiple symbols until a base case is hit.)\n\nNT55 can be either 't20' (from NT55 -> 't20') or from other productions like NT55 -> NT56 NT45, but wait, that's the same as S, which we've used already. So, perhaps NT55 is processed as a terminal 't20' here.\n\nSo, NT55 -> 't20'\n\nThen NT26 -> 't4' or 't29'\n\nSo, we have 't4' or 't29' from NT26.\n\nPutting it all together for NT56's part:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nWhich becomes (from NT69 and NT44) 't10 t7' and 't3 NT26' which will be 't3 t4' or 't3 t29'\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nWait, NT44 is split into NT3 and NT26.\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55, which is like recursive, so let's see:\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55, which will eventually resolve as NT3 -> NT3 NT55, which again resolves NT55 as 't20', so perhaps it's a loop. Alternatively, maybe there's another production for NT3 that leads to terminals. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nWait, that's a different production. So, I think I made a mistake before. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT3 was producing NT3 and NT55, but in the grammar provided, it's:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46.\n\nWait, wait a minute, let me look back at the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through, yes:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nAh, so I was incorrect earlier. NT3 doesn't produce NT3 and NT55. Instead, it has a production for NT3. So, perhaps I need to correct that.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, the relevant part is:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nWait, that is correct. So, in the earlier analysis, I had mistakenly thought that NT3 had a production for NT3 and NT55, but actually, that's not the case. Instead, NT3 is NT68 NT46. That changes things.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the correct chain for NT3:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nThen NT68 is 't2' from the grammar, as NT68 -> 't2'\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nLooking for NT68, I see:\n\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\n\nSo, that's a production for NT68.

{"custom_id":"request-888","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form is a way to structure grammar rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this structure, as each rule either consists of two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, where S is a non-terminal, and NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals or terminals depending on the rule.\n\nBut wait, looking closer, actually, some of the rules have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT26 \u2192 t6. So, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's correct for CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t0 t13 t25 t2 t21 t28 t2 t29 t3 t36 t15 t10 t17 t2 t2 t32 t15 t10 t15 t13 t20 t26 t25 t3 t10 t13 t0 t4 t33 t4 t14 t15 t27 t2 t34 t4 t3 t4 t33 t4 t29 t10 t6 t27 t28 t28`.\n\nThis string is a sequence of terminals, and my task is to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions of the grammar.\n\nI remember that for such problems, one approach is to parse the string from the start, trying to find a derivation that matches the string. Since it's in CNF, the parser can be efficient, but for this case, I might need to do it manually or at least figure out a way to check if each step aligns with the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the structure. In CNF, the parse trees are binary, meaning each production has exactly two symbols on the right. So, starting from the top symbol S, which immediately expands into NT56 NT45 as per the rule. So, the string should start with t0, but NT56 is a non-terminal, so NT56 must expand into t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, NT56 is two non-terminals. To get t0, I need to check if NT69 or NT44 can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT1 \u2192 t24, NT18 \u2192 t32, and NT46 \u2192 t4. None of these directly produce t0. Wait, t0 is a terminal, so I check the rules where the RHS is a terminal. NT22 \u2192 t0, according to the grammar.\n\nWait, so NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, to get t0, I need NT56 to be split into NT69 and NT44, but if neither can expand into t0, then this string can't be generated because t0 is not present on the RHS of any rule for NT56.\n\nWait, but no, because maybe it's part of deeper expansions. Maybe NT69 can further split into something that eventually results in t0. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT69, its production is NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So, NT63 and NT49 are non-terminals. Let me look at their productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\nNT25 \u2192 NT10.\nNT70 \u2192 t17.\n\nSo, NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70 \u2192 NT10 \u2192 t17 (since NT10 \u2192 t28, wait no, NT10 has the production NT10 \u2192 t28?

{"custom_id":"request-886","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows us to consider algorithms like the CYK algorithm for parsing. However, I don't need to use an algorithm specifically, but understanding the structure might help.\n\nThe string to test is: \n`t14 t7 t13 t20 t29 t10 t36 t4 t13 t36 t5 t3 t2 t34 t12 t0 t10 t33 t12 t24 t1 t28 t7 t33 t33 t0 t1 t3 t10 t6 t6 t9 t10 t34 t28 t34 t28 t29 t6 t0 t36 t9 t32 t20 t25 t24 t9`.\n\nIt's a sequence of terminals, all lowercase letters followed by numbers. Each token is a terminal, so the problem is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven the grammar and the string, the approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. If the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S, then the answer is Yes; otherwise, No.\n\nParsing in CNF can be done using the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. Let's outline the steps of the CYK algorithm in my mind:\n\n1. **Initialize a table**: Create a table where each cell [i,j] represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\n2. **Fill the table**:\n   - For each cell [i,i] (single character), check if there's a production that directly produces that terminal. If so, add the corresponding non-terminal to the cell.\n   - For cells with length >1, check all possible splits (i < k < j) and see if the left part (i to k) and the right part (k+1 to j) can be generated by productions of two non-terminals A and B, such that A\u2192 left and B\u2192 right. Then, check if there's a production X \u2192 AB that adds X to cell [i,j].\n\n3. **Check if the start symbol is in the top-right cell**: If S is in cell [0, n-1], where n is the length of the string, then the string is accepted.\n\nNow, let's consider the string length. The string has t as a separator, but looking at the string provided, it's just a sequence of t followed by two-digit numbers. The string has 65 tokens, so n=65. That's a lot, but manageable with CYK.\n\nHowever, manually setting up a 65x65 table is impractical. Instead, let's look for patterns or possible derivations that can match the string.\n\nBut before diving deep, perhaps I should look for any patterns in the grammar or the string that can hint at possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT56 and NT45. So each production starts with either NT56 or NT45. Let's see what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from grammar)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (from line NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT35 NT55 (line NT35 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49, but I think I might be mixing things here. Wait, line NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20, and NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21, etc. Maybe I should consider the entire path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for terminals in the string and seeing if they can be replaced by non-terminals using the grammar.\n\nLet's look at the beginning of the string: t14 t7 t13 t20 t29 t10 t36 t4...\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see if any production ends with t14. Looking through the productions, I see NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35 and NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35. Wait, I see NT70 \u2192 't5' and NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35. So, perhaps t7 is from NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30, which is t7 from NT21?\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. The string starts with t14. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t14? Looking through the productions, perhaps NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35. But NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, etc. Alternatively, looking for terminals in the productions, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce t-something.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't5' (so when we have NT70, it can produce t5)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35 (line NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35)\n- NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30 (line NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30)\n- NT30 \u2192 't17' (so NT30 produces t17)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35, and NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, which might go deeper.\n\nBut where does t14 come from? Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that directly produces t14. Wait, let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any non-terminal that ends with t14. For example, NT50 \u2192 't3', NT55 \u2192 't33' (line NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which produces t33), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 (line NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45)\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (line NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (line NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT35 NT55 (line NT3 \u2192 NT35 NT55)\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 (again)\n- Wait, so NT55 can be written as NT56 NT45, and NT56 is NT69 NT44, and so on. This seems like a recursive chain.\n\nSo, if we have t14, perhaps it's derived from some non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal. But I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t14.\n\nWait, let me check all non-terminals that may produce t's.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't5' (t5)\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35, but then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, etc. Hmm.\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' (t3)\n- NT61 \u2192 NT22 NT66 (t34)\n- NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30 (and Nt71 is nt69(nt63, nt49), and nt63 is t9, nt49 is nt22(nt66), etc.\n- NT60?

Alternatively, perhaps t14 is part of a longer derivation, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t14, which might be a part of a larger non-terminal expansion.

The string is: t3 t33 t2 t27 t6 t1 t37 t6 t1 t2 t13 t12 t12 t26 t5 t0 t10 t14 t15 t20 t7 t28 t9 t9 t26 t0 t6 t7 t2 t28 t28 t37 t17 t14 t1 t14 t20 t10 t20 t28 t1 t4 t21 t6 t2 t25 t37 t4.\n\nFirst, I should recall the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) structure. CNF requires each production to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems it's mostly in CNF except for some productions with two terminals on the right side, like NT70 \u2192 't5' and others.\n\nWait, no, looking closely, for example, NT61 has a production NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59 and another NT61 \u2192 NT2 NT10. So actually, in the grammar provided, the right-hand side can consist of two non-terminals, but there are also production rules where the right-hand side is a mix of non-terminals and terminals? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, most productions have two non-terminals, but I see some like NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 and others. So it's in CNF except for the right-hand side being all non-terminals. But wait, there are some terminals on the right side, like NT4 \u2192 't37' which is a terminal. So the grammar actually includes productions that directly produce terminals, which would mean terminals can appear in the string.\n\nBut the string given is entirely composed of 't' followed by numbers. So each token is a terminal, and the grammar must have productions that generate these terminals.\n\nTo parse the string, I can use the CYK algorithm or something similar, but since the string is quite long, maybe I can find a pattern or look for whether each token can be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be matched step by step by starting from the start symbol S and expanding it.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So the first two symbols in any derivation would have to be the two parts generated by NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t3 and t33. So I need to check if NT56 can generate t3 and NT45 can generate t33.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from production NT56 -> NT69 NT44)\nAnd NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nAnd NT44 \u2192 NT43 NT56 (Wait, does NT44 exist in the rules? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, NT55 and NT56 are defined. Let me see each production.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a mapping of all non-terminals and their possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a bit time-consuming, maybe I can check if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nBut another approach is to note that each non-terminal leads to a terminal when all are expanded. Since the grammar allows for multiple steps of expansion.\n\nWait, the string is t3 t33 t2 t27 t6 t1 ... etc. So each 't' is followed by a number. Let's see if each 't' corresponds to a production that can generate that t.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see some terminals:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't37'\nNT5 \u2192 't1' (because NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49, but wait, is NT5 a non-terminal or a terminal? Wait, in the given grammar, NT5 is a non-terminal, as it's on the left side of productions. So the only terminals are 't' followed by a number, except maybe some like 't3' being NT36 or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each 't' is a separate token, and each is generated by some non-terminal.\n\nFor example, 't3' could be generated by NT3 \u2192 NT13 NT36, but wait, NT3 produces NT13 and NT36, both non-terminals. So to get a terminal t3, we need to see if NT3 can eventually produce t3 somewhere. But in the given grammar, I don't see NT3 producing a terminal directly. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the production NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55. That's a recursive production, leading to potentially more non-terminals. It seems like it might not produce a terminal. So maybe 't3' is not possible.\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean the string has 't3' which the grammar can't produce. So that would mean the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: NT3 is defined as \u2192 NT3 NT55, which seems to be an infinite loop. So NT3 can't produce any terminal, hence 't3' cannot be generated. So having 't3' in the string would make the answer No.\n\nSimilarly, let's check another 't3' in the string. Second token is t33. Let's see if NT33 can produce 't33', but from the grammar, I don't see NT33 as a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at all NT rules. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT named as NT33. The terminals are all 't' followed by numbers, but in the grammar, most non-terminals produce other non-terminals. So unless a non-terminal can expand into a terminal directly, like NT4 \u2192 't37', but where does 't33' come from?\n\nWait, maybe there's a non-terminal that I'm missing which can generate 't33'. Let me scan through the grammar.\n\nLooking for any production that starts with a non-terminal and ends with a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. Hmm, but that's non-terminals. NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, again non-terminals. NT25 is defined as NT10, and so on.\n\nWait, if NT5 \u2192 't1', then 't1' is possible. Let me check: NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49. So NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7, which leads to more non-terminals. NT49 is defined as NT15, which I don't see producing a terminal. So 't1' can't be generated.\n\nWait, then where do the terminals come from? Let's see, the only explicit terminals are on the right-hand sides of productions, like NT4 \u2192 't37', NT7 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' is generated by a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal. For example, 't37' is generated by NT4, because NT4 \u2192 't37'.\n\nSimilarly, maybe other 't's are generated by other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me try to map which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- NT5 \u2192 ?\nWait, NT5 is defined as \u2192 NT1 NT49. Let me check NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT7. So both NT63 and NT7 are other non-terminals. NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT25 \u2192 NT10, which is \u2192 NT26 NT36 (NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3, NT36 \u2192 ...). This seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to look for all non-terminals that can directly produce a terminal. For example, only NT4 produces t37, NT48 \u2192 't24'? Wait, no, NT48 is defined as NT25 NT39. Wait, I see that NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which would produce something else. Let me check each production.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for non-terminals that directly produce a terminal. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25' in NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70? No. Wait, NT36 is sometimes \u2192 NT25 or nt70. Wait, looking at NT36's productions: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70 and NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT66? Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, looking again: For example, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, but also NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20. So perhaps NT25 can produce a terminal?\n\nLet's check NT25.

{"custom_id":"request-912","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. The goal is to determine whether the string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's given. The grammar consists of a series of production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols ending with 't's, which are terminals. My job is to walk through this string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nChomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side, so this is indeed CNF. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except the terminals.\n\nThe string provided is:\n\nt37 t29 t25 t9 t1 t37 t28 t32 t7 t27 t25 t28 t25 t10 t4 t7 t29 t6 t21 t14 t4 t0 t28 t21 t27 t25 t37 t36 t29 t0 t33 t33 t28 t34 t36 t13 t2 t4 t2 t33 t34 t33 t29 t36 t36 t17 t3 t21.\n\nIt's a long string of 63 terminals. I need to parse this string step by step, using the given grammar to see if it can be broken down into non-terminals using the productions.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a parsing problem, using either a top-down (like recursive descent) or bottom-up (like with a stack) method. Since CNF is efficient for certain algorithms, I might consider a yacc or parsing expression grammar (PEG) approach, but since I'm doing it manually, perhaps a recursive descent with lookaheads would be better.\n\nBut manually handling a string of 63 symbols is going to take a long time. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down by checking the rule structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent the grammar as a set of possible steps and see if the string can be generated by a sequence of these steps.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S and see what it expands to. The first rule is S -> NT56 NT45. So, S = NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals (NT56 and NT45) must themselves expand into sequences according to their production rules.\n\nLooking at NT56: The production is NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So, NT56 = NT69 NT44. \n\nNext, NT69: production is NT69 -> NT63 NT49. So, NT69 = NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63: rule is NT63 -> NT25 NT70. So, NT63 = NT25 NT70.\n\nNT25: production is NT25 -> NT10. Oh, wait, so NT25 is a single terminal? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, I think there might be a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, the rule for NT25 is it appears in several places. For example, NT25 -> NT10. But another rule is NT69 -> NT63 NT49, etc.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules for NT25. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT26\n- NT61 -> NT18 NT59\n- NT26 -> NT36 NT3\n- NT36 -> NT25 NT70\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT25 -> NT10\n\nWait, does NT25 have a production? Looking again. Yes, here:\n\nNT25 -> NT10. So, that's a rule. So, NT25 can produce NT10, which seems to be a non-terminal, but looking further, NT10's rules?\n\nLooking for NT10:\n\nNT10 -> NT28. Oh, so NT10 is NT28.\n\nWait, what's NT28's production? It says NT28 -> 't36'. So, NT28 is a terminal.\n\nWait, let's trace this.\n\nStarting with NT56: we have NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69: NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63: NT25 NT70.\n\nSo, NT63 is NT25 NT70. So, S expands to NT56 NT45, which is (NT69 NT44) NT45 \u2192 NT69 is (NT63 NT49) \u2192 which is (NT25 NT70) NT49. So S becomes NT25 NT70 NT49 NT45.\n\nNT25 is NT10, which is NT28.\n\nSo, S becomes NT28 NT70 NT49 NT45.\n\nNT70 is 't17' (from NT70 -> 't17').\n\nSo, S is now 't17' NT49 NT45.\n\nNT49's production: NT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nSo, S becomes 't17' NT22 NT66 NT45.\n\nNT22's production: NT22 -> NT63 NT48.\n\nSo, 't17' (NT63 NT48) NT66 NT45.\n\nNT63: NT25 NT70 \u2192 again, that's our previous path, leading to 't17'.\n\nWait, no. Because NT63 is a non-terminal again, right? So, in NT63's case, it expands to NT25 NT70, which is NT25 (NT10, which is NT28) and 't17'. So, NT63 becomes 't17' NT28.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of starting from S and trying to expand, I can model this as a parsing problem, trying to match the string with the grammar.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe it's better to look for sequences in the string that correspond to the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking for terminals that correspond to the right-hand sides of the rules.\n\nLet me look for the string fragments:\n\nThe string starts with t37 t29 t25 t9 t1.\n\nLooking for possible sequences. Let's see.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must have the production of NT56 followed by NT45.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must be the expansion of NT56, and then the expansion of NT45, followed by nothing else.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t37 t29 t25 t9 t1.\n\nI need to check if this corresponds to NT56 (which is NT69 NT44) followed by NT45.\n\nSo, let's examine NT56, which is NT69 NT44. NT69 is NT63 NT49, and NT44... Wait, NT44 doesn't seem to have a production in the given list. Wait, looking back.\n\nLooking through the list to find NT44's production. Looking at NT68: it's NT28 NT26. Not NT44.\n\nWait, let me check each rule for NT44.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT54: NT6 NT45\n- NT68: NT28 NT26\n- NT18: NT13 NT36\n- NT45: NT64 NT56\nWait, actually, looking back, NT54 is NT6 NT45, but that's NT54.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NT numbers.\n\nWait, no, the productions given are under the non-terminal NT54: \"NT54 -> NT6 NT45\".\n\nWait, no, in the list above, I see NT54: \"NT54 -> NT6 NT45\". So, NT54 is not NT44.\n\nLooking for NT44, I don't see it in the list. Hmm, perhaps NT44's production is not listed? Or did I miscalculate.\n\nWait, wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\n- NT54: NT6 NT45\n- NT55: NT56 NT45, etc.\n\nHmm, seems like none of the NT rules have NT44. Unless it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that NT44 is a terminal, but from earlier, NT4\u2192 't37'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps.\n\nLet me try to map the string to the productions step by step.\n\nStarting with S: The first step is S \u2192 NT56 NT45.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is:\n\nt0 t17 t21 t21 t9 t32 t15 t2 t24 t0 t21 t24 t10 t15 t14 t36 t28 t3 t29 t36 t32 t6 t13 t21 t5 t6 t6 t3 t2 t26 t1 t17 t2 t32 t0 t33 t3 t14 t36 t14 t36 t27 t10 t28 t34 t4 t34 t27 t10.\n\nFirst, I'll note the end symbols since it starts with t0 and ends with t10. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45, each string should start with an S, which is expanded into two non-terminals NT56 and NT45. Then, each of these non-terminals will eventually expand into terminals or more non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the start productions: NT56 and NT45. \n\nNT56 produces NT69 NT44, and NT45 produces NT63 NT48. \n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 and NT44 have their own productions. \n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. \n\nWait, let's check NT69: It's NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. \n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, which seems to loop. \n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should trace the string through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem, using the grammar to see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut given the string's length, it's going to be very long, so maybe using a bottom-up approach or recursive descent would be time-consuming. However, given the time constraints, perhaps I can take a sample part of the string and see if it can be generated.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: t0 t17 t21 t21 t9 t32 t15 t2 t24 t0...\n\nLooking up the start productions, the first symbol is t0, which is from NT1. So perhaps the expansion starts with NT1.\n\nLooking for NT1 in the productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT63 NT55, and NT55 \u2192 NT55 NT45 and NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56.\n\nWait, actually, let's confirm the productions. Wait, in the given grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT55. Then, NT55 has two options: either NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 or NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56. \n\nSo NT1 can expand into NT63 NT55 or via NT55 which can either produce NT56 NT45 or NT44 NT56.\n\nWait, but in the production for NT55, there's an alternative: from the list, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 or NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56.\n\nSo starting with NT1: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Wait, no, the first symbol is t0, which is part of NT1. So probably the initial expansion is NT1 \u2192 something that starts with t0.\n\nWait, let me find where t0 comes from. In the grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT55, and looking up NT63, but in the productions, NT63 is in NT63 \u2192 't9' and also other productions. Wait, actually, let me list the productions for each non-terminal and see their possible terminal and non-terminal outputs.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a map for each non-terminal's immediate right-hand sides.\n\nSo, first, let me list each non-terminal and what each can expand into.\n\nStarting with NT1:\nNT1 \u2192 NT63 NT55\n\nWhat's NT63?\nLooking at the production list, NT63 has several options:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT63 NT70 (A)\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (B)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nFrom the given productions:\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70\nNT63 \u2192 NT47 NT20\nNT63 also has other productions? Wait, let me scan all rules for NT63:\n\nWait, the productions with NT63 as LHS:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- NT63 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n... others: wait, are there more? Or perhaps NT63 is also part of other rules.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list, so let's check for NT63. Looking through the list:\n\nYes, NT63 appears here: NT63 \u2192 NT47 NT20 and NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nSo, NT63 can produce either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56.\n\nAnd, looking at other rules: NT45 \u2192 NT63 NT48, and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, so if NT1 \u2192 NT63 NT55, and then NT63 can expand, let's say, via NT25 NT70 or a terminal.\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is t0, which is not directly an output from NT63, because NT63's terminals are 't25' and 't70', which are not t0.\n\nSo perhaps NT63 is part of an alternative path.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should look for where T0 comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions, which NTs produce a t0?\n\nLooking at all the productions that are terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT35 \u2192 't9'\n- NT34 \u2192 't24'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't21'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25'\n- NT40 \u2192 't26' (wait, no, I don't see NT40, perhaps NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions for terminals:\n\nLooking for 't0': Wait, none in the list?

{"custom_id":"request-926","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. My goal is to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules and see if I can break the string down into symbols that match the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string: `t27 t7 t26 t6 t7 t3 t20 t3 t26 t6 t17 t20 t14 t14 t25 t7 t37 t9 t21 t34 t33 t24 t15 t24 t15 t15 t12 t6 t4 t25 t32 t7 t2 t4 t33 t13 t4 t25 t33 t34 s34 t34 t33 t10 t14 t13 t32 t13 t25 t28`. Wait, actually, the string doesn't end with S, but in the grammar, S is the start symbol, so the string should derive from S. Let me check the string again. Oh, the last symbol is t28, which is part of NT28: NT28\u2192't36', but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t27: Looking at NT7, which is NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36, both of which are symbols in the grammar. So t27 is NT7. So 't27' is the first token, which comes from NT7.\n\n2. The next token is t7. NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36, so I need to generate NT13 and NT36 next. \n\nLet's look at NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT24 NT24. So t7 is derived from NT13, which produces NT24 and NT24. So after 't27 t7', we have NT13 \u2192 NT24 NT24.\n\nSo now we have to parse the next two tokens after 't7', which would be 't26' and 't6'. Let's see what 't26' and 't6' correspond to.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 appears in NT26 productions: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 or NT26 \u2192 't4' or NT26 \u2192 't29'. 't26' is a terminal, so it's NT26\u2192't26'. So the next token 't26' is NT26. Hmm, but wait, NT26 has multiple productions, including terminals. Let me check the NT26 productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nNT26 \u2192 t4\nNT26 \u2192 t29\n\nSo 't26' is either t4 or t29. But in our string, after 't7' comes 't26' (from index 3), then 't6' (index 4). So 't26 t6'. So 't26' is one token, which should correspond to a production of NT26.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't7', it's 't26', 't6'. So let's see: 't27' is NT7, then 't7' is NT7\u2192NT13 NT36, so we consume 't7' and now have to parse NT13 and NT36. NT13 is NT24 NT24. So next, we expect two NT24 symbols.\n\nBut in the string, after 't7', the next tokens are 't26' followed by 't6'. Let me check NT24 productions.\n\nLooking at NT24: NT24 \u2192 't12' (from NT24\u2192't12'). So 't24' is t12. So if we have 't26' being 't24', then 't26' would correspond to NT24. But looking back, 't26' is 't4' (from NT26\u2192t4) or 't29' (from NT26\u2192t29). So 't26' is either 't4' or 't29', which are different from 't24'. So that's a problem. There's a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the NT24 wrong. Let me check the NT24 definitions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't37'\n\nSo NT24 produces 't37'. So if we have 't26' as 't24', that's incorrect because NT24 doesn't produce 't26'. That suggests that the initial path might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't7' is not NT7. Let me see: in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36. 't7' is generated by NT7. So that's okay. Then after 't7', we have to parse 't26' and 't6', which would correspond to NT26 and NT6.\n\nWait, no: the string is 't27 t7 t26 t6 t7 ...', so after 't7' comes 't26' and 't6'. So that would mean that 't7' is the result of NT7\u2192NT13 NT36, then we need to parse NT13 and NT36.\n\nNT13 is NT24 NT24. So 't13' is 't24' (from NT24\u2192't37'). Wait, no. Wait, 't13' is a terminal, but looking at the grammar, no NT produces 't13' except NT13. Wait, no, NT13 itself is a non-terminal, which splits into NT24 and NT24. So 't13' is actually the result of NT13\u2192NT24 NT24.\n\nBut in the string, we have 't26 t6 t7 ...', so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parsing steps. Maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree for the string.\n\nStarting with S\u2192NT56 NT45. So the entire string must start with NT56 and NT45 symbols.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t27, which is a terminal. Let me see what the start symbol S can produce. S is NT56 NT45, which consists of two symbols: NT56 and NT45. So in the string, the first symbol must be generated by NT56, which must be split into some production.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT56\u2192NT69 NT44 or NT56\u2192NT54 NT8. Let's see which one fits the initial 't27' token.\n\nLooking at 't27', which is generated by NT7, which is NT13 NT36. So 't27' would come from the first part of S, which is NT56. So let's see NT56's productions.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should instead look for possible starting splits.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the beginning of the string and see which non-terminals can produce the earliest token(s).\n\nThe first token is 't27', which is generated by NT7. So NT7 can be broken down into NT13 and NT36. So the first part of the string is t27 (from NT7), which consumes t27, and then we have to break down NT13 and NT36.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck because the next token after t27 is t7, which is NT7\u2192NT13 NT36. So that's a loop: t27 is NT7 producing N13 and N36, then the next token is t7 (which is NT7 again). That doesn't make sense because it would require another loop, which is unlikely in a context-free grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36. So the production for NT7 is two symbols: NT13 and NT36. So when we derive t27, it's splitting into two non-terminals, NT13 and NT36. So the first token after the start is 't27', which is generated by NT7, so the next step is to parse NT13 and NT36.\n\nBut in the string, after 't27', the next token is 't7', which is also generated by NT7. So perhaps the start symbol S is NT56 NT45. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for possible derivations.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo NT56 and NT45 must be split into their terminals.\n\nLet's see N56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 or NT54 NT8.\n\nLooking at the string, the initial tokens are t27 t7 t26 t6 ...

{"custom_id":"request-948","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the task requires. Context-free grammars are defined by productions where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write these productions so that each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that it's quite extensive. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The terminals in the string correspond to these lowercase letters. For example, 't20' is a terminal symbol, so it must appear as a result of a production that directly produces it or through some chain.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t20 t28 t3 t29 t2 t1 t2 t4 t14 t24 t12 t17 t4 t9 t27 t12 t26 t33 t13 t20 t17 t24 t3 t25 t28 t1 t4 t13 t2 t27 t32 t12 t6 t9 t9 t34 t2 t27 t32 t3 t24 t7 t29 t1 t15 t34 t25 t3 t36 t28`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be produced by the given grammar. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the derivation of the string would involve a series of steps where each step breaks down each component into smaller parts until we reach the terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I'll start by looking for terminals in the string and see if they match the terminals defined in the grammar. \n\nLooking at the endpoints:\n- The string starts with 't20'. Checking the grammar, I see that 't20' is a terminal produced by NT25 (from NT29 or NT10). \n- The string ends with 't28', which is a terminal produced by NT26 and NT37, etc.\n\nSo both the start and end have terminals that are in the grammar's terminal set.\n\nNext, I'll try to build a parse tree in a bottom-up approach. Since this is time-consuming, I'll look for patterns or potential issues.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that 't28' appears at the beginning and multiple times in the string. From the grammar, 't28' is produced by NT26 and NT37. Let's see if NT26 is present.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT26 has two productions:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT37\n\nSo, in the string, 't28' must be derived from either of these. Let's see if the substring after 't28 t3 t29 t2 t1 t2 t4 t14 t24 t12 t17 t4 t9 t27 t12 t26' can be broken down into these.\n\nAlternatively, 't20' is produced by NT25, which in turn is produced by NT36 NT46. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n- NT25 \u2192 NT10 and NT28 (Wait, is it NT25 \u2192 NT10 or NT10 is another NT?)\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT25 is present as:\n- NT25 \u2192 NT10 (from some rules). Wait, no, I need to check all rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT25 is not a non-terminal, but rather, the rules where NT25 is on the left. Wait, no, NT25 is on the left in rules like:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT63 NT46\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT37\n- NT32 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n- NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n- NT37 \u2192 NT21 NT22\n- NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list out the rules that have 't28' as a terminal. \n\nWait, no\u2014the terminals are 't1', 't2', ..., 't34', etc. So 't28' is a terminal symbol, and the non-terminals are NT1 through NT71 and others.\n\nSo each occurrence of 't28' must come directly from a rule where the non-terminal produces 't28'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't28'. All terminals are 't1' to 't37' except for some that are single-character like 't5', 't7', etc.\n\nWait, no: Let me scan the grammar:\n\nNo, actually, all the terminals in the grammar are lowercase letters, and each terminal is exactly one character. So, for instance, 't1' is a terminal, 't12' is a terminal, etc.\n\nSo, in the string, every token like 't20' corresponds to a non-terminal that produces it directly. \n\nWait, the key here is to see if each terminal in the string can be directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. If any of them cannot be produced, then the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nLooking at the string: I count the tokens as individual pieces, but some are two-digit numbers. For example, 't20', 't28', 't3', etc.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a production where a non-terminal directly goes to that 'tn' (like 't20' comes from NT25 or other? Wait, no, the grammar only has 't's as terminals, so the non-terminals must produce these 't's.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, there are no rules that directly produce some 't's. For example, is there a rule like NT25 \u2192 t25?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I only see rules where non-terminals are replaced by other non-terminals or terminals, but I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes a single 't' like 't20' or 't28'. Instead, most 't's are direct terminals.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if the non-terminal A can directly produce a terminal a, then the rule is A \u2192 a. So, in this grammar, for example, NT22 produces t2: let's confirm.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nThe rule NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no rule for NT22 directly produces any 't's. Then how does 't20' appear in the string?\n\nWait, then perhaps I'm mistaken in assuming that each 't' in the string must be a direct production from a non-terminal. But that can't be right because in CNF, the terminals can only be produced directly by the rules. So, for example, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, it must have a production like A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I can see rules like NT71 \u2192 t14, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which are non-terminals, but some other rules produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nYes, there are several rules where a non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t25\n- NT8 \u2192 t13\n- NT48 \u2192 t24\n- NT28 \u2192 Not sure, perhaps no.\n\nWait, let's check each rule:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t13\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\nNot an 't' terminal.\n\nWait, let's list all the rules and see which produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t5\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT61 \u2192 t34\n- NT18 \u2192 t32\n- NT35 \u2192 t9\n- NT71 \u2192 t14\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT2 \u2192 t12\n- NT13 \u2192 t24\n- NT34 \u2192 t24\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n- NT54 \u2192 t6\n- NT68 \u2192 t17 (Wait, this is the same as above?

{"custom_id":"request-952","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the grammar is provided with several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like 't3', 't2', etc. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that all production rules be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, each production seems to have two non-terminals on the right side except for 'NT3' -> 't24', 'NT4' -> 't37', and a few others with 't' terminals. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF because all non-terminals produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is generated by this grammar, I can perform a parsing process. However, the string is quite long, so it might be easier to work backwards using a parse tree or apply the pumping lemma. Alternatively, perhaps building a left or right parse tree step by step could reveal inconsistencies.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to parse the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or apply the CYK algorithm, but perhaps manually constructing the parse tree would be more straightforward.\n\nThe given string is: `t3 t2 t4 t32 t14 t5 t13 t32 t14 t10 t36 t3 t21 t6 t5 t29 t5 t12 t27 t13 t24 t13 t13 t0 t13 t10 t14 t15 t33 t28 t9 t36 t1 t24 t24 t13 t13 t33 t17 t26 t14 t1 t29 t25 t7 t3`.\n\nEach symbol in the string is a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the string must be derived by a sequence of such productions, effectively concatenating non-terminals until all terminals are reached.\n\nI can represent the string as a sequence of terminals, and try to see if they can be generated step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S -> NT56 NT45, so the initial production requires NT56 and NT45 to be expanded somewhere else.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into parts that could correspond to NT56 and NT45. Since the string is long, it might require multiple splits, but perhaps I can look for the presence of 't3' as part of NT56 or NT45.\n\nLooking at the first few terminals: t3, t2, t4, t32, etc. Let's see if any of these appear as terminals in NT56 or NT45's productions.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT54 -> NT6 NT45. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So, perhaps I should first figure out the possible derivation of each part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to reverse the process, starting from S and trying to match the string. Let's think recursively.\n\nSince S starts as NT56 NT45, each of these non-terminals must be expanded into a sequence of terminals. So, the string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet's see if I can find the expansion of NT56 in the string. Starting with S, the first production is NT56 NT45, so the string should start with NT56's expansion followed by NT45's.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t3, which might be part of NT56's expansion or NT45's. Let's see which NT in the grammar produces t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 -> NT68 NT46, but that's a two-step non-terminal. Wait, actually, some of the productions have 't' as a terminal on the right-hand side. For example, NT1 -> 't24', NT3 -> 't24', etc.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT3 -> 't24'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT5 -> 't1'\n- NT6 -> 't12'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT8 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't1'\n- NT21 -> 't0'\n- NT22 -> 't12'\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n- NT26 -> 't4' or 't29'\n- NT27 -> 't17'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT31 -> 't4'\n- NT32 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't9'\n- NT36 -> 't25' or 't26'\n- NT39 -> 't21'\n- NT42 -> 't6'\n- NT44 -> 't33'\n- NT45 -> 't4' or 't37'\n- NT46 -> 't4'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT49 -> 't15'\n- NT50 -> 't3' or 't20'\n- NT53 -> Not in the grammar, probably a typo. Let me check the original input.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions are given, so maybe I should look for 't36' in the grammar. NT28 -> 't36' and NT36 has multiple terminals.\n\nLet me note the terminals:\n\nt3, t2, t4, t32, t14, t5, t13, t32, t14, t10, t36, t3, t21, t6, t5, t29, t5, t12, t27, t13, t24, t13, t13, t0, t13, t10, t14, t15, t33, t28, t9, t36, t1, t24, t24, t13, t13, t33, t17, t26, t14, t1, t29, t25, t7, t3.\n\nThis is the string to analyze.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. One way is to see if each part of the string matches the possible expansions.\n\nBut manually checking each production step by step is tedious. An alternative method is to see if the string can be split into pairs of terminals that correspond to NT56 and NT45 expansions.\n\nSince NT56 and NT45 both have different productions, perhaps we can attempt to split the string into two parts, each corresponding to the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut given that the string is 47 terminals long, it's a bit long, so the splitting might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the first few symbols and see which NT production they could come from.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols: t3 and t2.\n\nIs there any production that starts with t3 t2? Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see a production where the first two symbols are t3 and t2. So maybe that's a dead end.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t3 is part of a longer production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT26 can produce t4 or t29, and other NTs have different terminals.\n\nLooking further, is there any production that includes t3 as the first terminal? Yes, for example:\n\n- NT39 -> t21\n- NT35 -> t9\n- NT1 -> t24\n- NT6 -> t12\n- NT7 -> t13\n- NT8 -> t13\n- NT5 <- several have 't' as a terminal, like NT1, NT3, etc.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that produces a t3 as a terminal. Checking the rules again:\n\nI don't see any NT that directly produces t3. The closest is NT727? Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 -> NT68 NT46\n- NT68 -> t3\n- So NT68 -> t3, which is a direct production. Wait, no, in the grammar, it's written as NT68 -> t27.\n\nWait, sorry, looking back, the productions:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nNT613 is not in the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because that means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string is just two tokens: t33 and t4.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) consists of productions of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol is S.\n\nSo, to check if \"t33 t4\" can be generated, I need to see if there are production rules that can lead to producing exactly these two terminals, connected by the start symbol somehow.\n\nLooking at the string, it's \"t33 t4\". Since it's two terminals, I think the string must be derived from a production that directly produces both, or one production that first produces t33 followed by t4 via another production.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, the only way to get multiple terminals is through a tree structure where each internal node is a non-terminal, and each production is either splitting or adding terminals. So for two terminals, the only possibility is a single step production like S \u2192 NTab, where NTab produces t33 t4.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, let's see if any non-terminal has a production that directly leads to \"t33\" and \"t4\". Wait, the grammar only has productions where non-terminals split into two non-terminals or terminals. So a production like NTxy \u2192 t33 t4 would be required, but is that present?\n\nLooking through the production list, I don't see a production where any non-terminal directly produces t33 and t4. Let's check each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45: Does either NT56 or NT45 produce t33 or t4? Let's check NT56: It's NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49? Wait, no, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, but then NT63 is t9, and NT49 is 't15' maybe? Wait, no, looking at NT63 \u2192 't63' is in the rules, wait no.

Maybe another approach: to build the parse tree for \"t33 t4\". Let's see if any production starts with NT that can split into t33 and t4.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there any production where a non-terminal leads directly to t33 and t4? I don't see any.\n\nWait, maybe t33 is produced by NT50 \u2192 t20, but no. Let me check all the terminals.\n\nLooking for 't33' in the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the terminals: 't33', 't4', 't9', 't44', etc. So 't33' is in the terminals, maybe as a direct production.\n\nLooking for NT with a production that includes 't33'. So, are there any NT rules that directly produce 't33'?\n\nLooking at the production list, I don't see any NT producing 't33' directly. All the terminals listed are things like 't9', 't4', 't5', etc. Wait, in the production list, look for 't33' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, but neither contributes 't33'.\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT36 \u2192 't3', but t3 is a terminal as well.\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT18 \u2192 't27'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT59 \u2192 't34'\n- NT50 \u2192 't3' or 't20' depending on the rule.\n\nWait, I don't see any production that introduces 't33' as a terminal. So perhaps 't33' is not present in any of the terminals of the grammar. If that's the case, then the string \"t33 t4\" can't be formed because the grammar doesn't produce 't33' at all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't33' is produced by some non-terminal. Looking again, let me see if any non-terminal can split into 't33' and something else.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nWait, the production NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which seems to be an infinite loop. Hmm, so perhaps there's no way for 't33' to be produced because it's not present in any terminals. Alternatively, maybe 't33' is a result of a long chain of productions. But given the structure of the grammar, if 't33' isn't a terminal at any point, then it's impossible.\n\nSo, given that 't33' isn't a terminal in the grammar's productions, the string \"t33 t4\" can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t5 t17 t4 t29 t4`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the problem. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the first step is to break down NT56 and NT45 into their respective components until I hit terminals.\n\nStarting with NT56, I see from the grammar that NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded. Similarly, NT45 \u2192 NT63 NT46.\n\nI'll need to recursively apply the productions until I can't expand any more non-terminals, checking if the terminals match the given string.\n\nLet's start expanding NT56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNow, expand NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nNow, NT63 \u2192 't9' (terminal).

Maybe I should track each step more carefully.\n\nLet me approach this by considering the entire string and see if I can trace back through the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t5 t17 t4 t29 t4`. Let's see if these terminals can be linked via the productions.\n\nPerhaps starting from the beginning and trying to find a way to split the string into parts that match the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT56 NT45. So the string must be the combination of the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must be the expansion of NT56, and the second part the expansion of NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, what's the structure? Let's see:\n\nt5, t17, t4, t29, t4.\n\nWait, maybe the second part (NT45) is `t4` at the end, but no, that's the fourth and fifth symbols. Alternatively, could there be overlapping splits?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is `t5 t17 t4` and the second is `t29 t4`, but that might not align with the production NT45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider how each non-terminal expands into terminals.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string and see if they can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at 't5' and 't17' first, because they're the first two symbols.\n\nIn the grammar, 't5' corresponds to NT70 \u2192 't5'.

Let's list the terminals and their corresponding 't' labels:\n\n- t5: In the grammar, t5 is from NT70 \u2192 't17' but wait, no, let me check the provided grammar.\n\nWait, let me scan through the grammar entries for the terminals:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' but in the string, we have t5, so I think I need to see if any production ends with t5.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of the productions, I see:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49; then NT48 is on the right, which later goes to t4. But I'm looking for t5.\n\nLooking for where a production can derive to 't5':\n\nLooking at each entry, I see NT70 \u2192 't17', which is too long, but we need t5. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should check each terminal production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal productions are ones where the right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14' (but no t5)\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'?\nWait, let's check NT69: the production is NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Then looking into NT63 and NT49:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n\nWait, so when NT69 is expanded, it goes to t9 and t15. But in the string, we have t5, not t9 or t15. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a terminal that's directly 't5'. Let me go through each production's right-hand side and see if any terminal is 't5'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only single terminals are:\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\nWait, no, looking through the rule definitions:\n\nWait, I'm looking through each production and trying to see where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nLooking at NT70 \u2192 't17'\nNT71 \u2192 't14'\nNT69 \u2192 't5'?\nWait, no. Let me check each entry:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17' (I see that in NT70 \u2192 't17').\n\nWait, NT70 is on the right in some productions, but when is 't5' derived?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for any 't5' in the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\nWait, I don't see any production where the right-hand side is 't5'. So maybe I'm missing it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if any production ends with 't5'. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking at all the productions:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17' \u2192 that's t17, not what we need.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me check each production's right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only single terminals are:\n\nWait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, let me list them all:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't20'\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't45'\n\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't33' (and there's another rule where NT55 \u2192 't44' and then that's in another part)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe in the grammar, there's no production that directly gives 't5' as a terminal. So if the string has 't5', but there's no terminal called 't5', then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production's right-hand side, if it's a single terminal, that's a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo looking through all the rules:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT69 \u2192 no single terminal; it's NT63 NT49.\n\n- NT50 \u2192 't20'\n\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, looking through all of them, is there any 't5'?\n\nWait, in the NT55's rules: wait, NT55 \u2192 't45'? Wait no:\n\nLooking at NT55's rules: \n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nAnd another rule: NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56\n\nSo no, single terminals don't include 't5' at this point.\n\nLooking elsewhere: NT22 \u2192 't0'\n\nLooking at NT18 \u2192 't32'\n\nWait, I'm not finding a 't5' terminal anywhere. So the only way to get 't5' is if some production reduces to it, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that directly derives 't5' as a terminal.\n\nWait a minute. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let's go through each non-terminal and its production rules.\n\nThe grammar is given as S \u2192 NT56 NT45, etc., and the left-hand sides are all single non-terminals, each producing a right-hand side of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking through each production in the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n- NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45\n- NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\n- NT1 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 't0'\n- NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT39 \u2192 't21'\n- NT66 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't26'\n- NT10 \u2192 't28'\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\n- NT59 \u2192 't34'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32'\n- NT1\u2192 No, that's handled.\n- NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\n- NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT47 \u2192 NT7 NT21\n- NT21 \u2192 't32' (Wait, no: NT21's rule is NT18 NT59; 't32' comes from NT18 \u2192 't32'.)\n- NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68\n- NT71 \u2192 't14' (Wait, in another part: NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\n- NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\n- NT50 \u2192 't20'\n- NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-61","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is `t5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. It states that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, every production either generates two non-terminals or a single terminal. That structure might help in parsing the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see several non-terminal symbols that immediately jump out. Some have productions that directly map to terminals, like NT70 \u2192 't17', NT30 \u2192 't17', and so on. Others produce other non-terminals, such as S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which means the start symbol S can generate two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nThe string I'm checking is `t5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and we need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at how 't5' can be generated. Scanning through the productions, I notice that NT69 \u2192 't5' and NT7 \u2192 't13', but 't5' is directly produced by NT69. So, any occurrence of 't5' in the string must come from NT69.\n\nMoving on, the first part is 't5', which is NT69. So, to get 't5', we have to have a production that leads to it. Let's see if there's a way to derive NT69 from somewhere else, but looking at the grammar, NT69 has a production: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So, NT69 is generated by NT63 and NT49. \n\nWait, but in the string, 't5' is the first symbol. So, the start symbol S must start by expanding into NT56 and NT45. Let's check the production for S: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the first step is that S generates two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. \n\nNow, to generate the string, we'll have to see if NT56 can derive a sequence that starts with 't5', or perhaps the NT56 and NT45 each contribute parts of the string. Alternatively, perhaps both NT56 and NT45 contribute to the string, but since the string has six terminals, each part might require multiple productions.\n\nBut wait, the string has six terminals in order: t5, t36, t29, t4, t29, t4. So, each of these must be derived from some sequence of productions. Let me try to see how this could happen.\n\nStarting with NT56: Looking at the productions, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, NT56 generates NT69 and NT44. Then, each of these can be broken down further. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. Let me see:\n\nNT69: NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT8, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nNow, NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should map this out more clearly.\n\nStarting with the entire string:\n\nt5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4.\n\nBut perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of starting from S, maybe I should see if each terminal in the string can be matched to a production chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to parse the string by seeing if it can be decomposed into the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to construct the parse tree, ensuring that each terminal in the string matches a production.\n\nStarting with t5, which I know is produced by NT69.\n\nSo, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nWe can see if NT63 and NT49 can produce the remaining parts. NT63 \u2192 NT34 NT8. NT34 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. NT34 \u2192 NT24 NT24. Wait, in the productions, I don't see NT34 having a rule that leads to a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, NT34 is a non-terminal. Its production is NT34 \u2192 NT24 NT24. So, that's producing two NT24s. Hmmm, and NT24... Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't see NT24 being a terminal; it seems to also produce non-terminals. For example, NT24 \u2192 NT25 NT70? Wait, no, NT24 isn't even listed as a non-terminal in the productions. Did I miss that?\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. The non-terminals are all the NTx where x is a number. Looking through the list:\n\nNT1, NT2, NT4, NT5, etc., but not NT24. Hmm, that's strange. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reread the productions:\n\nLooking through the list again, I see NT24 is not listed. So, the only NT symbols are from NT1 up to NT71, but some like NT24 don't have production rules listed. Does that mean they're terminals? Or perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, in the list, I see entries like NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45, and so on. But I don't see any production rule for NT24. So, maybe NT24 is a terminal? Or perhaps it's a mistake in the listing.\n\nIf NT24 is a non-terminal, it must have some production rule. If not, then it's a terminal. But since I don't see it, perhaps it's a terminal. So, let's assume NT24 is a terminal.\n\nIf that's the case, then NT34 \u2192 NT24 NT24 would produce two NT24s, each being a terminal if NT24 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let me assume all non-terminals except those with productions are terminals. That might be a big assumption, but without knowing all production rules for every NT, this approach might help.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step, seeing if each part can be derived.\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4.\n\nFirst, 't5' must come from NT69. So, S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nThen, perhaps NT56 and NT45 are expanded separately to contribute to the string. Let's see.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, NT56 generates NT69 and NT44. NT69 then generates NT63 NT49. So, from NT56, we have NT63 and NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT34 NT8. NT8 is a terminal (since NT8 \u2192 't13'). So, NT8 is 't13', but in our string, the next is 't36', not 't13'. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but our string starts with t5, then t36, etc. So, perhaps NT56 contributes the initial 't5', and then NT45 contributes the rest. Or maybe NT45 is involved in producing the rest of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45, where NT56 is 't5' through some production, but that doesn't align with the first production of NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a single expansion path.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be generated in one derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can't be generated, so the answer is No. But I need to check carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should trace back from the string.\n\nt5 must come from NT69. So NT69 expands to NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, the next symbols are t36, t29, t4, t29, t4.\n\nWait, perhaps after 't5', the NT49 from NT69 expansion will produce the next terminals.\n\nLet me see: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo, NT49 becomes NT22 and NT66. NT22 \u2192 NT45.\n\nWait, that's only one production. Wait, let me check the production. NT22 \u2192 NT45. So, NT22 is a non-terminal that produces NT45, which could be another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nBut in our string, after 't5', the next is t36, which is a terminal. So, how do we get t36?\n\nLooking back, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in CNF consists of production rules where each right-hand side (RHS) has exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol. But wait, looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions except the start one (S) have two non-terminals on the RHS. The start symbol S produces NT56 and NT45, so that's two non-terminals. That's fine for CNF.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t5 t36 t29 t4 t4 t4`. Each t is a terminal symbol, and the numbers like 5, 36, etc., probably represent different non-terminals in the grammar.

But I need to check each rule.\n\nLet me create a mapping of each non-terminal to its productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I can see which non-terminals expand into terminals and which into non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT69 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals expand into terminals. Let's list them:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't25' and 't70' perhaps? Wait, in the rules, NT36 has a rule NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and another rule NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20. So, NT36 isn't directly a terminal; it expands into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each rule to see if any NT directly maps to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' (so NT70 is a terminal)\n- NT36 \u2192 't25' and NT70? Wait, looking, I see NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70 (is that a rule?), but also NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLet's find all non-terminals that directly expand into terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17' (so NT70 is a terminal)\nNT69 \u2192 't5' (terminal)\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (terminal)\n\nNT45 has a rule \u2192 't4' (terminal).\nNT4 \u2192 't37' (terminal)\nNT39 \u2192 't21' (terminal)\nNT5 \u2192 't1' (terminal)\nNT26 \u2192 't4'\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\nNT71 \u2192 't14' and 't7' (terminals)\nNT22 \u2192 't0'\nNT18 \u2192 't32'\nNT3 \u2192 't24' (terminal)\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\nNT25 \u2192 't10'\nNT35 \u2192 't9' (terminal)\nNT48 \u2192 't24' (terminal)\nNT2 \u2192 't12'\nNT13 \u2192 't24' (terminal)\nNT49 \u2192 't15'\nNT10 \u2192 't28'\nNT36 \u2192 't25' and 't70' (which is terminal)\nWait, wait, looking again:\n\nEach rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, so I'm looking for rules where B or C is a terminal. Wait, for example:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26 (both non-terminals)\n\nBut some have terminals:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (both non-terminals)\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT46 (both non-terminals)\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (both non-terminals)\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (both non-terminals)\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 (both non-terminals except if any terminal here? No, NT55 is non-terminal)\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 (both non-terminals)\nSimilarly, NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8 (both non-terminals)\n\nWait a second, maybe none of the non-terminals expand directly into terminals except those that are terminals themselves. So for example, NT70 \u2192 't17' means that NT70 is a terminal. So when we have a non-terminal that is a terminal, it can be replaced by that terminal.\n\nWait, so in this grammar, most non-terminals (like NT70, NT69, NT63, etc.) are terminals if their production rules have a terminal on the RHS. So, to simplify, any non-terminal that has a production with a terminal on one side can be replaced by that terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that are terminals, meaning they can be replaced by a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' \u2192 so NT70 is a terminal that can produce 't17'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5' \u2192 NT69 is a terminal that can produce 't5'\n- NT63 \u2192 't9' \u2192 NT63 is a terminal that can produce 't9'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4' \u2192 NT45 is a terminal that can produce 't4'\n- NT46 \u2192 't4' \u2192 wait, looking at the rules, does NT46 have any terminal? Let me check:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT13 \u2192 't24', NT24 \u2192 't37', etc. Wait, but looking through all the rules, are there any where a non-terminal's RHS has a terminal?\n\nLooking again, each production in CNF is A \u2192 BC, both B and C are non-terminals except for one case. Wait, in the grammar, do any production rules have a terminal on the RHS?\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nSo, that means when NT70 is derived, it becomes 't17'. Similarly, any instance of NT70 can be replaced by 't17'.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 't5', so any NT69 becomes 't5'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'\nNT45 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, so in this grammar, certain non-terminals are terminals because they have productions that directly produce a single terminal symbol. So when the parser is trying to derive a string, any time it encounters such a non-terminal, that part of the string is fixed.\n\nSo, let's go back to the string: `t5 t36 t29 t4 t4 t4`\n\nWe have six terminals. Our goal is to get this string from the grammar.\n\nLet's try to model the string and see if it can be a result of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n- The first symbol is 't5', which in the grammar is produced by NT69 (since NT69 \u2192 't5').\n\nSo the first part is NT69.\n\n- The second is 't36'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the first expansion must come from S breaking into NT56 and NT45. Then, each of these non-terminals will eventually derive into the terminal string in the provided string.\n\nThe string given is `t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4`. Let me list the terminals in order: t5, t17, t4, t33, t4, t29, t4.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards, or use the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just brainstorming, maybe I can find a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is t5. Looking at the grammar, NT70 \u2192 t5. So, in the first step, after expanding S, one of the parts must derive to t5. But let me trace the chain.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Each of these will expand into some sequence of symbols.\n\nI think I should track the possible expansions. Let me write down the terminals and see if they match any production.\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. The first symbol is t5. Where does t5 come from? Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t5. So, one of the symbols derived from NT56 or NT45 must be NT70 at some point.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Let's see NT22: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. Then NT63 \u2192 t9. Wait, but the string starts with t5, not t9. Hmm, maybe I'm not going in the right direction.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the order. The string is t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string length is 7, so the derivation will have 7-1=6 splits. So, two splits from S into NT56 and NT45, each of which will split further into their components, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string from left to right using the grammar.\n\nLet's consider the string:\n\nt5, t17, t4, t33, t4, t29, t4\n\nSince the first symbol is t5, let's see what can produce t5. Looking at the grammar, I see NT70 \u2192 t5. So, that part must come from NT70.\n\nSo one part is NT70. Let's see NT70's production: NT70 \u2192 t7 or NT? Wait, looking back, the productions for NT70: Oh, wait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t7. So t7 must come from NT70.\n\nSo, the first part is t7 (from NT70), but in our string, the first symbol is t5, which contradicts that because t5 comes from NT70 \u2192 t5, but NT70 also directly produces t7.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a confusion. Let me list all NT70 productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t7\nIs that correct? Or is there another production for NT70? Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nYes, I see NT70 -> t7 is a production (the last line), but I also see NT70 -> t5 in some place?\n\nWait no, looking back, NT50 \u2192 t20, but checking further down, I see:\n\nWait, no, looking through all the productions, I only see NT70 \u2192 t7. So, NT70 can produce either t7 or perhaps other terminals?\n\nWait, no, NT70's productions are:\n\nLooking through all the given productions, I only see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t7.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar entries:\n\nLooking through the entire list, I see lines like:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\n\nNT70 -> t7.\n\nSo, it seems NT70 can only produce t7 directly. So how does t5 come into play?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again. Looking through the grammar:\n\nWait, for example, NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8. So, NT25 \u2192 NT10, etc. \n\nWait, maybe I need to trace the possible expansions more carefully.\n\nWait, let's see: The first symbol is t5, which must come from a production that directly outputs t5, like NT70 \u2192 t5, but according to the grammar, no NT70 produces t5. The only production for NT70 is to t7. So perhaps I'm wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the productions for non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t7.\n\nThat's the only one. So how does t5 get generated? From the given grammar, perhaps it's from NT?\n\nWait, wait, maybe NT70 is derived from another non-terminal that eventually goes to t5, but according to the grammar given, it's only NT70 \u2192 t7. So that can't be. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions. Let me try to list all possible ways to get t5.\n\nWait, perhaps t5 comes from another production. For example, looking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Then NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. So, NT63 \u2192 t9, NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. NT25 \u2192 NT10, etc. I don't see t5 coming from this.\n\nWait, but could it be from NT55? NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 and also NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t5 comes from NT50. Let's see NT50: NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8. Then NT25 \u2192 NT10, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to reconstruct the derivation.\n\nThe string is t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo, the first two symbols would come from NT56 and NT45. Let's check NT56's possible productions and see if they can expand into t5 or t17.\n\nWait, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48.\n\nNT63 \u2192 t9 or NT63's productions.\n\nHmm, but this doesn't seem to get us to t5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider NT70 as part of NT45 or NT56.\n\nWait, let me see NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nWait, NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t4 or NT26's productions, like NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, the string starts with t5, so perhaps one of these, say NT56, must expand to t5 somehow, but from the given grammar, I don't see NT56 producing t5. Let me check NT56's productions: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, unless one of those non-terminals eventually produces t5, which I don't see it happening here, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the first symbol comes from NT45.\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t4 or NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t5, not t4, so that might not fit. Hmm, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the first symbol t5 comes from a non-terminal that isn't directly listed, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll go step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way a context-free grammar is structured, where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, 'a' is a terminal symbol, and B and C are non-terminal symbols. The grammar provided seems to follow CNF since all rules are either combining non-terminals or directly pointing to a single terminal.\n\nThe string I'm given is \"t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t4\". It looks like a sequence of terminal symbols. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nStarting with the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56: The productions for NT56 are NT69 NT44. So NT56 becomes NT69 NT44. Similarly, NT45 is \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo now we have NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49. Let's look at each of these:\n\nNT69: \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44: \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT63: \u2192 t9\nNT49: \u2192 t15\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT69 is \"\u2192 NT63 NT49\" and NT44 is \"\u2192 NT3 NT26\". So let's substitute those:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nNT63 is a terminal: -> t9\nNT49 \u2192 t15\n\nSo now, expanding NT56 NT45 gives us:\n\nNT69 \u2192 t9 (NT49 is t15)\nWait no, that's wrong. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the production for NT56 is NT69 NT44. So S \u2192 NT56 NT45 becomes NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT63 \u2192 t9\nNT49 \u2192 t15\n\nBut when you expand NT69, it becomes NT63 and NT49, which are terminal t9 and t15 respectively. So NT69 \u2192 t9 t15\n\nSimilarly, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26, where NT3 is \"\u2192 NT35 NT55\" and NT26 is \"\u2192 NT36 NT3\".\n\nSo NT44 becomes NT3 NT26 \u2192 (NT35 NT55) (NT36 NT3)\n\nNow, let's expand NT35, NT55, NT36, and NT3:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3 \u2192 (NT46 NT68) (NT3) \u2192 NT46 NT68 NT3\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which we already know is t9 t15 and t17 t4, but since we are expanding NT55 here, it's leading back to the start symbol, which might cause infinite loops. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the top down, starting with S and trying to match the string.\n\nThe string is t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t4.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first symbols after S should be the expansion of NT56 and then NT45.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string, the first symbol is t5. Let's see which non-terminal produces t5.\n\nLooking through the list of non-terminals, when do we get t5? Looking through the rules, I see NT70 -> t17, NT26 -> t4, NT56 -> t33, NT50 -> t20, etc.\n\nWait, wait, let's look again:\n\nIn the list, terminal symbols are represented as 'tX'. So each of these 'tX' are terminals.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17\nNT26 \u2192 t4\nNT56 \u2192 t33\nNT18 \u2192 t32\nNT71 \u2192 t14\nNT20 \u2192 t34\nNT50 \u2192 t20\nNT46 \u2192 t4\nNT36 \u2192 t25\nNT71 \u2192 t7\nNT69 \u2192 t5\nNT8 \u2192 t13\nNT5 \u2192 t37\nWait, wait, let me scan all the rules to find which NT produce t5.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT71 \u2192 t7, but the rule list also includes NT56 \u2192 t33, NT70 \u2192 t17, NT50 \u2192 t20, NT36 \u2192 t25, NT46 \u2192 t4, etc.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17', so when NT70 is expanded, it's t17.\n\nNT56 \u2192 't33', so when NT56 is expanded, it's t33.\n\nWait, but our string starts with t5. Looking through the rules, which NT produce t5?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT70: \u2192 t17\nnt72: \u2192 t4\nNT71: \u2192 t7\nNT56: \u2192 t33\nNT50: \u2192 t20\nNT46: \u2192 t4\nNT36: \u2192 t25\nNT26: \u2192 t4\nNT59: \u2192 t34\nNT18: \u2192 t32\nNT56: \u2192 t33\nWait, does any NT produce t5? Looking through all of them:\n\nAh, I see. NT70 \u2192 t17; no, that's t17, not t5.\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nIn the given grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\nNT69 -> 't5'  <- Aha! Here's NT69 \u2192 t5\n\nSo NT69 expands to t5.\n\nSo, the initial part of the string is t5. So the first non-terminal in the expansion must be NT69 because NT69 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo let's see, in the expansion of S, which is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, the first symbol generated is from NT56 or NT45?\n\nWait no, NT56 and NT45 are both non-terminals, so when you expand S, you need to expand both. But the first symbol in the string is t5, which comes from NT69, but how does that fit into the S expansion which is NT56 NT45.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nEach NT56 and NT45 will expand into sequences of symbols. The first symbol of the expansion would be the first terminal in NT56's expansion, and the first symbol of NT45's expansion would be the next.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t5, which is from NT69. But NT56's expansion is NT69 NT44, because NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT69 is the first non-terminal in NT56's expansion.\n\nWait, no: when you expand NT56, it becomes NT69 NT44. The NT69 is a non-terminal, and when you expand it, it becomes t5. Similarly, NT44 is a non-terminal, which can be expanded further.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t5, which must come from the NT69 expansion in NT56's subtree.\n\nLet me try to model this as a derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nExpanding S: NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT69 NT44) (NT63 NT49).\n\nNow, we can choose to expand each non-terminal in any order, but typically, we perform leftmost expansion.\n\nSo let's expand the leftmost non-terminal first. Let's choose to expand NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 first.\n\nSo after expansion, the string so far is NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, expand NT69 \u2192 t5 NT44 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo now, the string is t5 NT44 NT63 NT49.\n\nNext, expand NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo now it's t5 NT3 NT26 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, expand NT3 \u2192 NT35 NT55.\n\nSo now it's t5 NT35 NT55 NT26 NT63 NT49.\n\nExp"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-96","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string `t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t29 t4` is generated by the given CFG. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. That usually makes parsing easier, but since I'm just checking for generation, I can consider the structure without worrying about parsing algorithms.\n\nThe string in question is `t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t29 t4`. Looking at these, they're all 't' followed by numbers. So I'm thinking each 't' might correspond to some specific production in the grammar. My task is to check if these terminals can be produced by a series of substitutions in the grammar as per CNF.\n\nI notice that the top-level non-terminals are S and NT22, which produce various combinations. The string starts with 't5', which I can look up in the grammar rules. Scanning through, I see NT70 produces 't5' (NT70 \u2192 't5'). So if the first part of the string starts with NT70, that's a possibility.\n\nSo, let's break down the string step by step:\n\n1. 't5': This could come from NT70 \u2192 't5'.\n2. 't36': Looking through, NT36 can produce 't25' or NT6. Let's see, perhaps NT36 is involved. Wait, but in the string, the first 't36' comes after 't5'\u2014so perhaps after NT70, we need NT36 to produce 't36'.\n\nWait, I should map each 't' to its possible source non-terminal. Let's list each token and find possible NTs that can produce them:\n\n- t5: NT70 (from NT70 \u2192 't5')\n- t36: NT36 can produce 't25' or 't6' (looking at the grammar, NT36\u2192 't25' and NT6\u2192't6')\nWait, but in the grammar, NT36 produces 't25' when it becomes 't25' via NT36 \u2192 't25'. Alternatively, NT36 can also go to NT70 (but maybe not). Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. Hmm, right. So NT36 is composed of NT25 and NT70. So the production is NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. Each of these non-terminals can generate more strings.\n\nBut I'm trying to get 't36' in the string. Hmm, perhaps I should check which NTs produce 't36'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT25 \u2192 't10' and NT36 \u2192 't25' and 't6'. Wait, actually, the grammar rules for NT36 are not directly provided. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n- Wait, no NT36 \u2192 't36'? I think I might have missed that. Let me scan more carefully.\n\nWait, no, the provided rules don't have NT36 \u2192 't36' or any terminal. Instead, NT36's productions are:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\nWait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps I should instead approach this by backtracking. Let's start from the end.\n\nThe last token is 't4', which I need to find a production that can produce 't4'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT30 \u2192 't17' which I think is a typo since the string ends with 't4'. Wait, no, the string is 't5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t29 t4'. So the last token is 't4'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT35 \u2192 't9', and NT71 \u2192 't14' etc. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for NTs that produce 't4'. \n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't4' (from NT22 \u2192 't12' seems incorrect\u2014wait, looking back: Yes, I see \"NT22 -> NT13 NT31\" but no NT22 directly producing 't4'.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to conform to that because all the non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) have productions that expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t5 t36 t29 t4 t25 t17 t4 t4\". It's a series of terminals separated by spaces, so each token represents a terminal symbol that must be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe task is to check whether starting from the start symbol S, we can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, S splits into NT56 and NT45. That means the string must start with the expansion of NT56 followed by the expansion of NT45.\n\nSo, the first two symbols must come from NT56 and NT45. Let\u2019s check the string: it starts with t5, t36, t29, etc. So, t5 comes first. Let's see what produces t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT70 \u2192 't5'. So, t5 is produced by NT70. Hmm, so how can NT56 produce something that starts with t5?\n\nWait a second, looking at the productions for NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Let me check what NT69 and NT44 produce.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is a terminal 't9', so that's t9, but it's followed by NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Wait, no, let me correct that. Actually, NT63 is 't9', and NT49 is NT22 NT66. So, that would give t9 followed by NT22 which produces...?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's approach this systematically. Each non-terminal needs to generate a sequence of terminals. So, starting from S, which splits into NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, the first part is NT56's expansion, followed by NT45's expansion. The string starts with t5, which could come from NT70, but that's not directly connected to NT56. So, wait, maybe I need to find a path from NT56 to t5 through the productions.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, the expansion of NT56 starts with NT69 and NT44. Let's see what NT69 produces: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9', and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So, that's t9 followed by NT22 and then NT66.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t5, which doesn't fit with this path. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a connection. Let's check if there's another production leading to t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT70 is the only one that directly produces t5. So, where does NT56 lead to? Let me re-examine the NT56 production. It's NT69 NT44. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, so t9 and then NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, which is NT22 (which could produce 't27' and 't29'?), wait no, let me look again.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should write down the steps.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nWe need to see if NT56 can generate a sequence that starts with t5, t36, etc.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nThen, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So the first part is NT69 \u2192 t9 (NT63 is a terminal) and NT49.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t5, which is produced by NT70. So, unless NT56 can somehow produce NT70, but looking at the productions, it's not the case. NT70 is elsewhere, like NT70 \u2192 t5, but NT56 doesn't produce NT70. That seems problematic.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check NT56 again. Hmm, looking at the production list:\n\nNT56: NT69 NT44\n\nNT69: NT63 NT49\n\nNT63: t9\n\nSo, that's t9, but the string starts with t5, which comes from NT70.\n\nIs there a way for NT56 to lead to NT70? Or maybe I've misread the productions. Let me check the list again to see if there's a connection between NT56 and NT70.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT56 \u2192 anything with NT70. So, NT56 seems to lead to t9 first, not t5. So how does the string start with t5?\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the order is swapped? Let me think: since S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and the production is a leftmost derivation, so we expand NT56 first.\n\nSo, the string would be the concatenation of NT56's expansion and NT45's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT69 NT44 \u2192 which is t9 followed by NT44. NT44 \u2192 t2 (is that possible? Let me check NT44: is there a production for NT44? Looking through the list... Wait, NT44 isn't listed as a non-terminal; maybe I'm confused. Let me check all productions to make sure.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT44 is not listed as a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal? No, because the productions are always two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if NT44 isn't in the non-terminals, maybe it's a terminal. But in the list, I'm looking through, I don't see NT44 as a non-terminal. Wait, the list is a bit extensive, but perhaps I missed it. Let me scan through the list again.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT69 NT44. Then, going down the list: NT56 is towards the top, followed by other non-terminals. Hmm, no, I don't see NT44 as a non-terminal elsewhere. So maybe that's a terminal. Wait, if that's the case, then NT44 would produce a terminal. But looking at the string, after t9, the next symbol is t29, which is t36 followed by t29? I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me take a different approach. Instead of starting from S, perhaps I can look for any path that can generate the entire string in the right order.\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t29 t4 t25 t17 t4 t4.\n\nLet me try to build it step by step, using the possible productions.\n\nThe string starts with t5. Looking for a production that gives t5. The only one is NT70 \u2192 t5. So, to get t5, the string must contain NT70. But how can NT70 fit into the overall structure of the grammar?\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any productions lead to NT70? I see in the grammar: NT70 \u2192 t7, but that's only via production NT71 \u2192 NT7 t17, and some other rules. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t27\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can parse the string step by step.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t5, so the first symbol is t5, which is produced by NT70. So perhaps the leftmost derivation starts with NT70.\n\nBut the string's first symbol is t5, which is from NT70, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So NT56 and NT45 must generate the entire string.\n\nHmm, this suggests a contradiction because S starts with NT56 NT45, but if the string starts with t5, then t5 must come from NT56, which seems impossible given NT56's first expansion is t9.\n\nSo, that would mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol t5 cannot be derived from NT56 NT45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. Maybe the string is being generated as NT56 expanding into something else"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right-hand side. The string is made up of t's followed by numbers, which are probably terminal symbols. The grammar allows these terminals to appear in the string if they match the productions.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules to have a clear view. I see that most of them are of the form NTxxx -> NTyym NTzz. There are a few terminal symbols like 't5', 't36', etc. The initial symbol is S, which goes to NT56 NT45.\n\nThe string given is `t5 t36 t4 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4`. So it starts with 't5', which means I need to find a rule that produces 't5'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT70 -> 't5' and NT69 -> 't5', and also NT56 -> 't33' among others. So 't5' could come from NT70 or NT69.\n\nLet me focus on the start symbol S, which is S -> NT56 NT45. So NT56 and NT45 must be expanded. Looking at NT56's productions: it goes to NT69 NT44. Then NT69 goes to NT63 NT49, etc. I'll need to trace the derivation step by step.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't5'. Let's see which NT can produce 't5'. From the grammar, I notice NT70 -> 't5' and NT69 -> 't5'. So perhaps S has to expand through a path that eventually leads to these.\n\nLet me try expanding S:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT45 -> NT22 NT35\nWait, not sure. Let me see each step.\n\nWait, NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Then NT44 -> NT3 NT26. So NT56 would expand to NT69 NT44, which then becomes NT69 NT3 NT26.\n\nBut perhaps I need to think about the entire string and see if each terminal can be matched by the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse the string backward, looking for productions that match the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t36, t4, t4, then t26, t36, t29, t4, t4.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first symbol is t5. So possible NT70 or NT69.\n\nLet's assume it's NT70 -> t5.\n\nThen the remaining part of the string is t36 t4 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4.\n\nNow, after t5, the next is t36. So perhaps NT57 (but there's no NT57) or maybe NT36. Wait, looking at NT36's productions: NT36 can go to NT25 NT70 or NT47 NT20.\n\nWait, but the next is t36, so maybe NT36 -> t36? No, because NT36 is a non-terminal, not a terminal unless it's one of the rules. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs are terminals. For example, NT69 -> t5, but others are not. So I need to check if NT36 can produce 't36'.\n\nLooking for any rule where NT36 -> t36? No, but perhaps through other rules. Wait, let me check the grammar. Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> NT25 NT70 (twice), or NT47 NT20, or NT68 NT61, maybe others.\n\nWait, no rule has NT36 -> t36. So perhaps after t5 (NT70), the next symbol is t36, which comes from NT36. Hmm, but perhaps not. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is S -> NT56 NT45, and then each NT56 and NT45 expand further until we get the t's.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I can try to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding the NT symbols.\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo S -> NT69 NT44 NT45.\n\nThen, let's expand NT44. NT44 -> NT3 NT26. So now S becomes NT69 NT3 NT26 NT45.\n\nNext, expand NT3. NT3 has two rules: NT3 -> NT68 NT46, or NT3 -> NT3 NT55, or NT3 -> NT25 NT68, etc. Hmm, this might get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to find the order of t's.\n\nThe string is t5, t36, t4, t4, t26, t36, t29, t4, t4.\n\nSo maybe S starts with t5, which comes from NT70 or NT69.\n\nAssuming it's NT70 -> t5. Then the remaining symbols are t36, t4, t4, t26, t36, t29, t4, t4.\n\nThen, after t5, the next is t36, which could come from NT36. Looking at NT36's rules: NT36 -> NT25 NT70, NT36 -> NT47 NT20, NT36 -> NT68 NT61, etc. None of these directly produce t36.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe I need to find NT70 -> t5, then the next t36 is from NT36, so NT36 must be a non-terminal. So let's see if NT36 can produce t36 through expansion.\n\nLooking for any rule that can eventually produce t36. NT36 can go to NT25 NT70, which if NT25 expands, maybe that could lead to t36. Alternatively, NT36 could expand to NT47 NT20, but that doesn't help.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, considering possible expansions.\n\n1. The first symbol is t5. So possible source is NT70 or NT69.\n\nLet's pick NT70 -> t5.\n\nNow the remaining string: t36 t4 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4.\n\n2. The next symbol is t36. So maybe this comes from NT36.\n\nBut NT36 doesn't directly produce t36. So perhaps NT36 is expanded to something that includes t36.\n\nWait, let's look for where t36 appears as a terminal. I see NT68 -> t3, NT48 -> t24, etc., but t36 is not directly a terminal of any NT. Wait, looking back, the initial problem says the string is `t5 t36 t4 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4`. So the second symbol is t36, third is t4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Are the t's followed by numbers, meaning t followed by a digit? So 't5' is a single symbol. So in the grammar, how do these t's appear?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some NTs have terminals. For example:\n\n- NT54 -> NT6 NT45: so NT54 is a non-terminal, as it's on the left.\n- NT71 -> 't14': so NT71 is a terminal 't14'?\nWait, no: in the grammar, rules are written as NTxxx -> RHS, but if the RHS includes terminals, then those are terminal symbols. For example, NT71 could be a production that matches 't14'.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar more carefully. The rules are:\n\nNT70 -> 't5'\n\nNT69 -> 't5' and NT56 -> 't33'\n\nLooking through, other NTs have terminals:\n\n- NT13 -> 't24'\n\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n\n- NT36 -> 't25'\n\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n\n- NT2 -> 't12'\n\n- NT13 -> 't1'\n\nSo these are the NTs that produce terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT26 -> 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-120","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4`. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how context-free grammars (CFGs) work. CFGs consist of a start symbol and production rules that expand symbols into other symbols. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for parsing and for algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I might not need those here.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that the right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions are either two non-terminals (e.g., S -> NT56 NT45) or a non-terminal and a terminal (e.g., NT36 -> 't25' NT70, but wait, actually, looking closer, most seem to be two non-terminals. Let me check: NT36 -> 't26' NT47 and NT46 -> 't4' NT39. Oh, some have terminals, but in Chomsky normal form, terminals should only appear as single symbols, so perhaps I misread. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form requires that productions be either A -> BC or A -> a. So in this grammar, some productions have terminals on the RHS. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the terminals are treated as non-terminals that produce themselves, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should treat the terminals as atomic and that each step can only produce them directly.\n\nWait, the string provided is `t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4`. So all these are terminals, each as a separate token. I think the approach is to generate the string from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step, ensuring that each production correctly leads to the terminals in the string.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of terminals. In a CFG, the derivation starts with the start symbol and applies productions until all are terminals. Each step can replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, but eventually, they must reduce to terminals.\n\nLet me see if I can map the string's structure to the grammar.\n\nThe string is `t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4`. There are 9 tokens, which is a lot, but let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production from S is to NT56 NT45. So S can be replaced by NT56 NT45. Then each of these NTs can be further replaced.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions: NT56 -> NT69 NT44 and NT56 -> NT44 NT56. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Similarly, NT45 -> NT68 NT44 and others.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach this by looking at the string and trying to split it into substrings that match the productions.\n\nLet me list the string again: t5, t3, t4, t33, t4, t25, t3, t4, t4.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of 9 terminals. Let me think about how the grammar can generate such a long string.\n\nEach production step replaces a single non-terminal with two others. So the derivation of the string will involve expanding S into more non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut tracking this for 9 levels is maybe complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to parse the string against the grammar using a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if each token in the string can be generated by some production.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string: t5. Looking at the grammar, terminal 't5' appears in several productions:\n\n- NT70 -> 't5'\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT26 is actually 't4' in one production but 't29' elsewhere? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at each NT rule, let's collect all the terminals:\n\nFor example, NT70 is derived from NT69 and NT35. Wait, in the given rules, there are several where terminals appear as results. Let me list all the given production rules to find where terminals appear:\n\nNT36 -> 't26' NT47 (but wait, is 't26' a terminal?) No, in the context of Chomsky normal form, 't26' must be a terminal, right? Or is it another non-terminal? Wait, that's the confusion. In a CFG, terminals are atomic symbols that cannot be further expanded, so in the given grammar, any rule that has a terminal as part of the RHS must be such that the non-terminal on the LHS directly produces that terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, some productions have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT36 -> 't26' NT47. So perhaps 't26' is a terminal, and NT36 can produce t26, but then NT47 would have to produce something else.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's better to first identify all terminal symbols present in the grammar. Looking through the RHS, the terminals are:\n\n- t5, t3, t4, t33, t4 (again), t25, t3, t4 (again), t4.\n\nWait, that's from the string. But in the production rules, the RHS terminals include:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- t5 appears in NT70\n- t3 appears in NT36, etc.\n- t4 appears in NT36, and many others\n- t33 from NT35 and others\n- t25 appears in NT36 perhaps\n- t26 in NT70, but I'm not sure\n- etc. But I think the string's terminating symbols are the ones that appear in the string: t5, t3, t4, t33, t4, t25, t3, t4, t4.\n\nSo for each of these, I need to see if they can be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- 't5' comes from NT70: NT70 -> 't5' NT18. Or wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for production rules where the RHS includes a terminal:\n\n- NT36 -> 't26' NT47. So 't26' is a terminal.\nBut I don't see 't5' as a terminal. Wait, are there more?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT18 -> 't32'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT8 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't1' (from NT28)\nWait, no, in the grammar, look:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

Let's go through the list:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17' (wait, looking at the given grammar, there's a line: NT26 -> t4, but perhaps the rule is somewhere else.)\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to try to reconstruct the string by applying the productions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string against the grammar, but that would require building a table, which might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the grammar can produce such a string.\n\nWait, an alternative approach: consider the string as a sequence of operations, and see if each token can be aligned with a production.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. Chomsky normal form means each production is either A->BC or A->a, right? So every rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. I'll need to keep that in mind when trying to parse the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So the string must start with t5 and then something from NT56. Wait, looking at NT56 -> NT69 NT46. NT69 is producing t5, and NT46 is t24. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S -> NT56 NT45\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n- Then NT63 is a terminal 't9', NT49 is NT56 -> NT69 NT44, so NT49 would lead us somewhere else maybe?\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a parse tree. Let's see the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5 t17 t4 t24 t25 t13 t6 t3 t4 t4.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nStart with S: NT56 NT45. So that would need to be t5 t4, but looking at the production for NT56 and NT45. Wait, T45 is part of NTT45 -> ... Let's see.\n\nLooking at the NT45 production: NT45 -> NT56 -> NT69 NT44, which then would be t5 (NT69 -> 't5') and then NT44. Looking at NT44: NT44 -> NT3 Nt26. NT26 has two options: t4 or t29. Hmm. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to look for the structure of the string. Let me think about how to break the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the easiest way is to apply Leftmost Derivation or Rightmost Derivation step by step to see if it leads to the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several symbols, but considering the grammar produces a sequence of NTs and terminals. Let me think.\n\nThe string is t5 t17 t4 t24 t25 t13 t6 t3 t4 t4.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S -> NT56 NT45. So the first part of the string should be NT56 generating t5 and the second part NT45 generating t24. Wait, NT45 -> NT56? Or is NT45 a terminal? No, looking back:\n\nWait, no. NT45 is on the right side, but no production seems to have NT45 on the left except maybe from NT35? Hmm.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nEach rule is like NTX->NTY NTZ or NTX->a. So the rule S->NT56 NT45 would mean that S can be replaced by two NTs: NT56 and NT45. But wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the right-hand side should consist of two non-terminals or one terminal. So S is a non-terminal, and each production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, the productions are all of the form A->BC or A->a.\n\nSo S is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT56 and NT45. Then, for each of these NTs, we'll have to replace them ultimately with the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, so the string must be the concatenation of the rewritten NT56 and NT45. Let me think.\n\nSo NT56 -> ... ?\n\nLooking at NT56: According to the grammar, NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo NT56 is replaced by NT69 and NT44. Then each of those NTs will produce in their own right.\n\nNT69: \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 is a terminal 't9'. NT49 is \u2192 NT56 NT44.\n\nWait, circular because NT49 \u2192 NT56 NT44, and NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, which leads back to NT49.\n\nHmm, this seems recursive. Let's see what NT44 does.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 Nt26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26.\n\nNT26 can be 't4' or 't29'. So let's see.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t5, there's t17, t4, t24, t25, etc. So maybe the initial NT56 produces a long string. Let me see.\n\nLet's consider the initial step:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nThen, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 is 't9', so that would produce t9.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT56 NT44.\n\nNow, Nt56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 again, which is t9 followed by NT44.\n\nAnd NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26.\n\nNow, NT26 can be either 't4' or 't29'. Let's say it's 't4' for now.\n\nThen NT26 is 't4', so that would lead to 't4' in the string.\n\nThen NT46 is a terminal 't24' because looking at NT46: wait, no, I think NT46 is a non-terminal. Wait, I need to check all the rule definitions.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT46: Hmm, is there a production for NT46? Let's see. Scanning through the rules:\n\nWait, I don't see a production for NT46 in the given rules. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, NT28 is in production NT28 \u2192 't36' or something? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, no, going back:\n\n- NT26's productions: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 or NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29'.\n\nAh, yes, Nt26 has two options: if one of them is 't4' or 't29'. So in this case, I assumed 't4', so the string would have t4.\n\nSo coming back, the production NT36 \u2192 NT25 or NT47.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to track each step more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to check if each symbol in the string can be matched at each step.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is too long, so maybe I can split it.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t17 t4 t24 t25 t13 t6 t3 t4 t4.\n\nThe first symbol is t5, so the start is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9'. So that would produce t9. But the string starts with t5, so that seems off. Wait no, because NT56 is being replaced by t9 and NT44.\n\nWait, no, wait: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So replacing NT56 would give us NT69's output followed by NT44's output. So NT69 is replaced as t9. Then NT44 is replaced as follows: NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. So NT68 is replaced by t3, then NT46. Wait, but NT46 is a terminal 't24'? No, let me check.\n\nWait, looking for rule definitions:\n\nLooking for NT46: No, I don't see any rules for NT46. So NT46 must be a non-terminal. Wait, no, all NTs either have production rules (\u2192) or are terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing NT46 with another NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check each symbol in the string.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\nt5 is the first symbol. Looking at the grammar, t5 is produced by NT71? Wait, no, let's see the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35.\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3.\n\n- NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68.\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26.\n\n- NT26 has two options: 't4' or 't29'.\n\nWait, this is getting convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this might take a while because the grammar is quite large, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form has productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. So all the productions are either A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to\u7b26\u5408CNF because every rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is \"t5 t17 t4 t1 t26 t13 t34 t3 t4 t4\". Essentially, it's a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. My first thought is to parse this string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the production S -> NT56 NT45. So S must produce two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. But in the string, the first terminal is t5 (which is NT70), but according to the grammar, NT70 is 't17'. Wait, actually, no, looking at the grammar, 't' productions are:\n\nNT70 -> 't17', and in the string, we have 't17', which is produced by NT70. But S's production is NT56 and NT45. So perhaps I need to see where NT56 and NT45 can decompose.\n\nLooking at NT56: the grammar has NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Let me check NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69: production is NT69 -> NT63 NT49. \n\nNT63: NT63 -> 't9' according to the grammar. NT49: NT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t5, t17, etc., so maybe some NTs can be broken down into t's.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But since I'm more familiar with the top-down approach, maybe I should try that.\n\nStarting from S, which is S -> NT56 NT45. So the string must be a combination of the derivations of NT56 and NT45 concatenated together.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t5 t17 t4 t1... Well, t5 is \"t5\", which according to the grammar, is NT71 -> 't5', so t5 is NT71. So, the first element is NT71.\n\nWait, but S -> NT56 NT45. So the first non-terminal is NT56 and the second is NT45. So in the string, the first part would be the derivation of NT56, which may produce some t's, followed by the derivation of NT45, which would produce other t's. But in the given string, all the t's are a single sequence without any NTs, like t5 t17 t4..., so maybe it's possible that NT56 and NT45 each derive into a single terminal symbol. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nThen NT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 -> 't9'. So NT63 is a terminal 't9'.\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 -> NT11? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT1 is 't24', NT2 is 't12', etc. Let me check the non-terminals:\n\nNT56: produces NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69: produces NT63 and NT49.\n\nNT63: is 't9'.\n\nNT49: produces NT22 and NT66.\n\nNT22: is 't4' according to the grammar? Wait, the production for NT22 is NT22 -> NT18? Wait, no, looking back, I think I might be mixing up NT numbers.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nNT22 -> NT18? Let me check. Looking through the list, I see NT22 is defined as NT22 -> NT18, or maybe not. Wait, let me go through the grammar rules step by step.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT56 NT45\n\n- NT22 -> NT63 NT48\n\nWait, so in the grammar, NT22 has a production NT22 -> NT63 NT48.\n\nBut in my case, I'm trying to derive NT56, which leads to NT69 and NT44. Then NT69 leads to NT63 (t9) and NT49. So after NT63, which is 't9', what comes next?\n\nWait, the string starts with t5, which is NT71. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong because S is NT56 and NT45, but the string starts with t5 (NT71), so perhaps the derivation of NT56 and NT45 is not directly leading to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if each non-terminal in the production of S can produce the necessary t's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the possible derivations for each non-terminal. Let's start with S.\n\nS -> NT56 NT45.\n\nSo, the string is parsed as the concatenation of the derivations of NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, let me first see if NT56 can derive a string that starts with t5 or the beginning of the given string.\n\nBut looking at NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nThen NT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 -> 't9', which is 't9'.\n\nThen NT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT22 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT22's productions: I don't see any, wait, is NT22 a terminal or non-terminal?\n\nWait, looking back: NT22 is a non-terminal, as per the grammar, because the start symbol S -> NT56 NT45, and all the productions listed have non-terminals on the left.\n\nSo, NT22 must have productions. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar:\n\n- NT22 -> NT63 NT48\n\nHmm, so NT22 is defined in terms of other non-terminals. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT63 -> 't9' (terminal).

{"custom_id":"request-156","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is `t5 t3 t4 t1 t10 t5 t13 t6 t17 t4 t4`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This means the grammar uses only two symbols on the right side of each rule.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most of the rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, and so on. Some rules directly produce terminal symbols, like NT70 \u2192 't5', NT30 \u2192 't17', etc.\n\nMy task is to figure out if the provided string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying production rules until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe string is `t5 t3 t4 t1 t10 t5 t13 t6 t17 t4 t4`. Let me note that this is a sequence of 11 tokens, each presumably connected by some rules in the grammar.\n\nI should probably work backward from the string to see if I can find a derivation path. Let me list the terminals in the string:\n\n1. t5\n2. t3\n3. t4\n4. t1\n5. t10\n6. t5\n7. t13\n8. t6\n9. t17\n10. t4\n11. t4\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals, so I can start by matching these to the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nLet me see if each of these terminals is defined. Looking through the NT2 to NT71, some are terminals like 't5' (NT70), 't3' (NT3?), wait, I need to check which NT correspond to which terminals.\n\nWait, the NT definitions are such that many NTs map directly to terminals. For example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, wait, let me go through each terminal in the string and see which NT they're mapped to.\n\nBut before that, maybe breaking the string into smaller parts or trying to find if the entire string can be generated by S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of steps from S.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is CNF, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So, the string must be representable as a binary tree (due to Chomsky Normal Form), so the number of symbols in the string should correspond to the leftmost derivation steps.\n\nThe string length is 11. Starting from S, the first step would produce a string of length 2, each subsequent step doubling the length (since each non-terminal can split into two symbols). But wait, that's if you multiply. However, since the string is directly being evaluated, perhaps focusing on the actual production rules is better.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: write down the entire string and see if it can be split into pairs of symbols that match the possible production rules. Or, perhaps look for the non-terminals that can produce these sequences.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5 t3 t4 t1 t10 t5 t13 t6 t17 t4 t4\n\nI can try to split this into a structure where each production is used. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. But wait, in this case, the grammar has several three-symbol productions because some NT rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz, which is two non-terminals. But each rule is two non-terminals to the right, which in CNF would require the left-hand side to be a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in standard CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but sometimes I might be misremembering. But actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So the right-hand side has exactly two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each step, you replace a non-terminal with two symbols (either terminal or non-terminals). This is similar to how the grammar grows the string step by step.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, in the first step, S can produce something like NT56 NT45, which are both non-terminals. Then, each of these can be replaced by two symbols, leading to four symbols, etc. So the total number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps.\n\nBut the given string has 11 symbols, which is odd and not a power of two. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if each step doubles the number of elements, the initial S (count 1) after one step becomes 2, then 4, then 8, 16, etc. So, 11 symbols are impossible because 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 11 is in between.\n\nWait, that can't be right because Chomsky Normal Form doesn't necessarily mean that the length is a power of two. Wait, no, that's only when the string is derived by starting from S and splitting each symbol into two each time. So each step increases the number of symbols by a factor of two. The string length after n steps would be 2^n.\n\nIn our case, the given string is of length 11, which is not a power of two (since 2^3=8, 2^4=16). Therefore, it's impossible for such a string to be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but I might be making a mistake here. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from S (1 symbol), after 1 replacement, you have two symbols. After two replacements, each of those can be replaced, leading to four symbols. Third replacement: eight symbols, fourth: sixteen, etc. So the number of symbols is always 2^n. But 11 is not a power of two between 8 and 16. So it's impossible.\n\nThus, the string cannot be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 11 symbols, which is not a power of two, and since the grammar follows Chomsky Normal Form, each step produces a string of length that's a power of two. Hence, the string can't be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string \"t5 t36 t10 t17 t3 t4 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4\" is generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Since this grammar only has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal, I think I need to perform a tracing method or maybe a top-down parsing approach.\n\nBut wait, maybe a better approach is to reconstruct the parse tree step by step. The string has 11 tokens, so the parse tree should have a certain structure. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So the first two elements in the string should be the results of these two non-terminals, right? Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t5. So, let's check if NT56 produces t5 somewhere. Looking at the productions for NT56: \n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nHmm, so NT69 and NT44. Let's see where NT69 and NT44 can lead. \n\nLooking up NT69: \n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo NT63 and NT49. Let's check NT63: \n\nNT63 \u2192 NT26 NT26.\n\nWait, NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3. \n\nSo NT36 is next. Let's see NT36:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nAnd NT25 is a terminal: NT25 \u2192 t10.\n\nAlso, NT70 is a terminal: NT70 \u2192 t17.\n\nSo the subsequence NT63 becomes NT26 NT26, which becomes NT36 NT36. But wait, the string starts with NT56, which becomes NT69 NT44, which is NT63 NT49 (from NT69). Wait, no, NT69 is NT63 NT49. So NT63 is NT26 NT26, each of which becomes NT36 NT3. So that would give us t36 t3 t36 t3, right? But the string starts with t5, so maybe this path doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me try a different approach. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So the top-level steps should be:\n\n1. NT56 \u2192 ... \n2. NT45 \u2192 ...\n\nLet's trace the string step by step. The string is t5 t36 t10 t17 t3 t4 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4.\n\nThe first token is t5. Let's see which productions can directly produce t5. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't5' except:\n\nNT51 \u2192 't5'? Wait, no, I need to check the productions. Let me scan the list.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't33' and 't44'? Wait, no. Let me check each rule:\n\nWait, NT71 \u2192 't7', NT69 \u2192 't5', NT70 \u2192 't17', NT45 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, look at NT45: NT45 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So NT56 and NT45. If NT56 can produce a sequence that starts with t5, or maybe through another path.\n\nWait, maybe the first part is NT56 making a certain path that leads to t5 as the first token. Let's see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nThen NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT26 NT26.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.\n\nSo, NT26 becomes NT36 NT3, which is terminals t36 and t3. But the string starts with t5, so maybe this isn't the correct path. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token comes from NT56 producing something else. Let's check NT56's production again: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think of the entire parsing process. The first two symbols after S are two non-terminals, which are then expanded.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the Reverse engineering method. Let's look at the string and see if it can be split into symbols that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t10 t17 t3 t4 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4.\n\nSince the start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which are two symbols. The string must be broken into parts that correspond to NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, the first part of the string (let's say up to position n) should correspond to NT56, and the rest to NT45.\n\nBut the entire string is in the form S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the string is split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT56, and the second part is the expansion of NT45.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts. The string has 11 symbols, which is odd, so probably S \u2192 NT56 NT45, with NT45 expanding into a single terminal or something longer. Wait, but NT45 \u2192 't4'.\n\nWait, let's consider that. If S \u2192 NT56 NT45, then NT56 produces the first part, say n symbols, and NT45 produces the remaining 11-n symbols.\n\nBut the string is t5 t36 t10 t17 t3 t4 t4 t25 t3 t4 t4.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 't4' (since NT45 \u2192 't4'). So the last symbol must be 't4', which it is. So the last token corresponds to NT45.\n\nSo the string would be split into the first 10 tokens (positions 1-10) from NT56, and the last token ('t4') from NT45.\n\nWait, no: S\u2192NT56 NT45, so when fully expanded, NT56 becomes a sequence of tokens, and NT45 becomes another sequence of tokens. The entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo the length of the string is 11, so the expansions of NT56 and NT45 must add up to 11. Let's check:\n\nIf NT45 \u2192 't4', then its expansion is 1 token. So NT56 must expand into the first 10 tokens.\n\nSo let's examine the first 10 tokens: t5 t36 t10 t17 t3 t4 t4 t25 t3 t4.\n\nBut wait, the first token is t5. Let's see which NT can produce t5 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, t5 appears in NT45 \u2192 't4' (no), NT70 \u2192 't17', NT69 \u2192 't5' because:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT69 \u2192 't5' because in the list it's written as NT69 -> NT63 NT49, but I might have misread that before. Wait no, let me correct that. \n\nWait, going back through the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for terminals, I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't33', NT50 \u2192 't3'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT71 \u2192 't7'\n- NT48 \u2192 't24'\n- NT63 \u2192 't26'\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT44 \u2192 'nt3 nt26' \u2192 no terminal\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' wait: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure. Let me start by trying to understand the grammar and then see how the string can be generated step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT61, etc.) that produce other non-terminals or the terminals (like t5, t17, etc.). Each production is a two-step transformation since it's in CNF\u2014all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4`.\n\nI think the first step is to find a production rule that starts with S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S must produce two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't5', which corresponds to NT56 \u2192 t5. So the first part is good. So now I need to see what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nBreaking it down, the string after t5 is: t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4.\n\nWait, no, the string is t5 followed by t36, t25, etc. So maybe NT56 produces t5, and NT45 might produce the rest? Or perhaps NT45 can be broken down further.\n\nWait, let me think again. S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so when we start, the string must be generated by NT56 and NT45. So each of these non-terminals should generate parts of the string.\n\nLet's look at NT56. From the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 can split into NT69 and NT44. Each of these will then need to generate their parts.\n\nNow, the string after t5 is t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4. That's 11 symbols. Since S produces two non-terminals, each of those non-terminals will produce some parts, and their concatenation should form the string.\n\nLet me try to see if NT56 and NT45 can produce parts that together make the entire string.\n\nFirst, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT69 and NT44 should, when combined, produce the rest of the string after t5. Let's look at NT69.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT69 splits into NT63 and NT49. Looking at the string, after t5, the next symbol is t36, which is from NT63 \u2192 t36. So NT63 produces t36, which matches the first t36.\n\nSo after NT63 (t36), we have NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So NT49 splits into NT22 and NT66. Looking at the string, after t36, it's t25 t3 t4..., so let's see what NT22 and NT66 produce.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT22 NT61? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 NT61 NT31. Because in the given grammar, NT22's rule is NT22 \u2192 NT61 NT31.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The grammar says NT22 -> NT61 NT31. So NT22 must produce NT61 and NT31. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me list the rules properly for clarity. I might have misread them before.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT22 -> NT61 NT31\n\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31\n\nWait, so NT22 \u2192 NT61 NT31.\n\nBut in the string, after t36, the next symbol is t25. Let's check NT61.\n\nLooking at NT61's rules: NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59, and from the given grammar, NT18 \u2192 t32 and NT59 \u2192 t34.\n\nSo NT61 would produce t32 t34. But in the string, after t36 (the t36 is from NT63), next is t25 t3 t4 t33... Hmm, that doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59, yes. And NT18 \u2192 t32, and NT59 \u2192 t34. So NT61 would produce t32 t34. But in the string after t36, the next symbol is t25, which is from NT22.\n\nWait, maybe I need to break down more.\n\nWait, perhaps NT22 is part of a different split. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, the initial split was S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT69 NT44) followed by NT45.\n\nBut the string after t5 is: t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the total string is a concatenation of two parts: the string generated by NT56 and the string generated by NT45.\n\nSo, NT56 generates \"t5\" followed by something, and NT45 generates the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think step by step through each symbol in the string.\n\nThe string is: t5, t36, t25, t3, t4, t33, t4, t4, t33, t4, t29, t4.\n\nSo 12 symbols in total.\n\nS starts as NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo after NT69, NT49 appears, which then splits into NT22 and NT66.\n\nNow, let's see the string after the first t5:\n\nWe have t36, t25, t3, t4, t33, t4, t4, t33, t4, t29, t4.\n\nWait, the first 't5' is from NT56, then NT69 should produce t36. Let's check: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nLooking at NT63 \u2192 t36, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo after NT63, we have NT49.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT61 NT31.\n\nLooking at NT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59. NT18 \u2192 t32, NT59 \u2192 t34, so NT61 \u2192 t32 t34.\n\nBut in the string, after t36, the next symbol is t25, which is the output of NT21.\n\nWait, perhaps this path isn't correct because the second symbol after t5 is t36, which matches NT63, but the next symbol is t25, which doesn't align with NT61.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another way.\n\nWait, maybe NT49 produces something else. Let me check all the rules for NT49.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the split earlier. Let me re-examine the entire grammar.\n\nWait, maybe instead of NT69 NT44, perhaps there's a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by parsing the string from the start symbol backwards.\n\nBut that might be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can try creating a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string cannot be generated by this grammar because of the symbols not matching correctly, so the answer might be 'No'.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT69 NT44) followed by (NT45).

{"custom_id":"request-174","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar consists of a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is `t9 t15 t3 t4 t1 t10 t17 t13 t34 t17 t4 t4`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule being either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the rules here seem to fit that structure. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules on the left-hand side (LHS) are non-terminals, and the right-hand side (RHS) either has two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is two non-terminals. \n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals. So my task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step. \n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a parsing process, either using a top-down (like recursive descent or using a stack-based method like the CYK algorithm) or a bottom-up approach to see if the string can be broken down using the given rules. But since the grammar is in CNF, which is conducive to recursive descent parsing, especially if we have the necessary lookahead.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is small, maybe I can structure a recursive approach. Let's see. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into the components defined by the productions. \n\nAnother thought: perhaps building the parse tree would help. Each step would involve taking a symbol or two and seeing if they match any production's RHS. But since it's a sequence of terminals, we're trying to see if the entire sequence can be generated by expanding non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals. So when generating, each step from a non-terminal can produce either one terminal or two non-terminals. So during the expansion, each non-terminal can spawn either a terminal and stop, or two non-terminals that then can expand further.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, I think the approach is to model the parsing as trying to match the string against the productions, starting from the start symbol, and at each step expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nSo, let's break down the string: `t9 t15 t3 t4 t1 t10 t17 t13 t34 t17 t4 t4`. Let's list the tokens in order:\n\n1. t9\n2. t15\n3. t3\n4. t4\n5. t1\n6. t10\n7. t17\n8. t13\n9. t34\n10. t17\n11. t4\n12. t4\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar. \n\nLet me start by looking at the production rules for the start symbol S. The production for S is NT56 NT45. So, S starts by producing NT56 and NT45. That means the initial steps would involve expanding NT56 and NT45 into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. Then NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, etc. This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can work my way through this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking at the string and seeing if it can be split into two parts that each correspond to the RHS of a production rule for non-terminals. Each part would be a sequence of terminals that could themselves be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if I can split the string into two consecutive parts (since all productions in CNF are two symbols) such that each part is a terminal sequence that can be generated by some non-terminal, then the string can be generated by that production.\n\nThis sounds like a recursive approach, checking for each possible split, and seeing if the left and right parts can be produced by non-terminals. Let's try that.\n\nThe string has 12 elements. I'll need to consider each possible split point (after 1, 2, 3, ..., 11) and see if the left part can be derived from some non-terminal A and the right part from some non-terminal B, such that either A \u2192 B or A \u2192 X B (but no, in this case, the production is A \u2192 BC, requiring both A and B to be non-terminals). Wait, no: the grammar is CNF, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So when generating, each step can produce two non-terminals (which then must produce their own terminals or non-terminals) or one terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the context of string generation, when using leftmost derivation, the process is to start from S and keep expanding the leftmost non-terminal until all symbols are terminals.\n\nFor example, starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo, derive a string by expanding NT56 and NT45. Each could expand into more symbols.\n\nSo, let's consider a possible approach:\n\n1. Split the entire string into two parts: L1 and L2, each of which must be a sequence of terminals that can be generated by some non-terminals NTxy and NTuv respectively.\n\n2. For L1, find a non-terminal NTxy such that NTxy can generate L1 as a string of terminals.\n\n3. Similarly, for L2, find a non-terminal NTuv such that NTuv can generate L2.\n\n4. Then, if S has a production NTxy NTuv, then we can have S \u2192 NTxy NTuv, which then can generate L1 followed by L2.\n\nSo, for the whole string, the split is in the middle at position 12, so 6 and 6? Or any possible split.\n\nWait, the entire string is 12 terminals. If the production is A \u2192 BC, then the string would be derived as A generating B followed by C. So, the entire string must be a sequence where the entire string is split into two parts (L1, L2), and L1 and L2 can be generated by non-terminals as per their productions.\n\nWait, but that's just the top level production. The string could be generated by intermediate non-terminals as well.\n\nHmm, maybe it's easier to approach this step by step, trying to parse the string from the right or left, using the available production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree by trying possible splits.\n\nLet me take the string and see if I can find splits where left and right could be matched to non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- The string is t9 t15 t3 t4 t1 t10 t17 t13 t34 t17 t4 t4.\n\nLet's consider possible splits of the string into two parts and see if each part can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nFor example, can the entire string be split into two parts:\n\n- Left part: t9 t15 t3 t4 t1 t10 t17 t13 t34 (9 elements)\n\n- Right part: t17 t4 t4 (3 elements)\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is A \u2192 BC. So the entire string would be [L1] [L2], where L1 is the expansion of A, and L2 is the expansion of C, for some production A \u2192 BC.\n\nAlternatively, the production S \u2192 NT56 NT45 requires that S's string is NT56's expansion followed by NT45's expansion.\n\nSo, perhaps I can work backwards, trying to find which non-terminals can generate the left and right parts respectively.\n\nFirst, let's see if the right part, t17 t4 t4, can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's consider right part:\n\nt17 t4 t4.\n\nWait, but each production in the grammar produces two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, etc. Wait no, wait: each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each production produces either two non-terminals or one terminal. But when expanding, each non-terminal step can produce one or two symbols, leading to the entire string as a sequence.\n\nWait, no. Each production in CNF can produce either one terminal (A \u2192 a) or two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC). So when generating, each non-terminal can produce a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. \n\nSo when you have S \u2192 NT56 NT45, that means the string starts with NT56's expansion followed by NT45's expansion.\n\nSimilarly, if NT56 \u2192 something, that could be either a terminal or another pair, etc.\n\nBut in the string given, we have t17 appearing twice, so perhaps that's part of some productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think recursively.

{"custom_id":"request-193","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t9 t9 t2 t6 t36 t25 t17 t4 t4 t33 t4`, and the grammar is a bit complex with multiple productions. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, each production is either a two-symbol left-hand side or a terminal on the right. That makes parsing manageable because each step either combines two symbols or replaces a non-terminal with two others.\n\nThe string has 11 tokens, all of which are terminals ending with 'tX'. I'll list them in order: t9, t9, t2, t6, t36, t25, t17, t4, t4, t33, t4. My goal is to see if these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nOne approach is recursive descent parsing: I'll start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar splits into NT56 NT45. So the entire string should be generated by expanding S into NT56 followed by NT45.\n\nI'll need to check if the string can be divided into two parts: one generated by NT56 and the other by NT45. Let's look up what each NT symbol stands for.\n\nLooking at NT56: From the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So this is another split. I'll need to see if the first part of the string corresponds to NT69 and the second to NT44.\n\nContinuing this way, each non-terminal will split into two, and their corresponding parts of the string must be generated by those non-terminals. If at any point a terminal doesn't match, or a non-terminal doesn't have a production that can generate the required part, then the string isn't in the language.\n\nLet me try to map this out. Starting with the entire string:\n\n1 t9 t9 t2 t6 t36 t25 t17 t4 t4 t33 t4\n\nI think I need to split the string into parts corresponding to the non-terminals at each step. But keeping track of how the string is divided might be complicated. Alternatively, I can parse the string by recursively replacing the non-terminals with their terminals until I get the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the top-down approach with the CYK algorithm, but that might be more time-consuming. Alternatively, since the string is small, maybe I can simulate the parse step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the string should start with NT56 generating some part and then NT45 generating another. The first part is from the start, so let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the entire string as beginning with NT56, which splits into NT69 and NT44. So the first part (NT69) and second part (NT44) must be generated by those non-terminals.\n\nLet's see NT69. Looking up NT69 in the grammar: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT69 splits into NT63 and NT49.\n\nSimilarly, NT44. Looking at the grammar, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo now, the string must split into NT63, NT49, NT3, and NT26 in some order, considering how the productions build up.\n\nWait, maybe I should structure this differently. Each step, the non-terminals generate their own parts, which could themselves split into more non-terminals. So perhaps the string can be represented as a tree where each node is a production, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to map the terminals back to their corresponding non-terminals' productions. For example, t9 corresponds to NT50's production because in the grammar, NT50 \u2192 t25 and other parts. Wait, looking at the grammar, I need to find each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT30 \u2192 t17 (multiple)\n- NT50 \u2192 t3 (from NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8; NT25 \u2192 t10; NT8 \u2192 t13; but wait, NT50's production is NT25 NT8, which would be t10 followed by t13, which is t10t13. But wait, in the grammar, NT50 appears in multiple places. Let me check each place where a terminal is listed.\n\nWait, from the grammar given, the terminals are:\n\nt1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t9, t13, t17, t24, t25, t26, t29, t30, t33, t34, t36, t39, t45, t46, t48, t49, t50, t54, t55, t56, t59, t61, t63, t68, t69, t70, t62, etc.\n\nBut in the production rules, some terminals appear as results of non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t25 t70 (from NT6 and others)\n- NT26 \u2192 t36 t3 (maybe, but looking at the grammar, the actual productions for NT26: Not explicitly listed as a production, but perhaps in another entry. Wait, looking at the grammar, let me search for NT26:\n\nYes, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT15 NT31\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for where NT26 is a production on the right side. Let me scan:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules line by line:\n\n- NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8 \u2192 NT8 is t13, which matches t13 in NT61's production. Wait, no, looking at NT61's production: NT34, which is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of what each non-terminal ends up being.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps create a reverse mapping: which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar, for each production rule where the right-hand side is terminal(s), note the possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n1.

Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has all productions in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either pairs of non-terminals or single terminals. Wait, no, CNF requires the right-hand side to be exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, in this case, some productions might have more than two non-terminals on the right, but looking closely, I don't see any. All the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal when applicable. So, the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals: `t5 t3 t4 t10 t17 t17 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4`. I need to parse this string using the grammar to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must begin with NT56 producing t5 and some rule, then NT45 producing t4 and another rule. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Each production is a rule for a non-terminal, and the string is a series of terminals. I think I need to trace back from the string to see if each terminal can be matched by some production.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step. Let's break down the string:\n\nThe string is: t5 t3 t4 t10 t17 t17 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4.\n\nI'll start from the beginning. The first symbol is t5.

Let me scan through the list:\n\nI see NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, but that's NT55. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, NT56 doesn't produce a terminal directly. Hmm, but in the start symbol, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the first two symbols in the string should come from NT56 and NT45. But wait, in the string, the first symbol is t5. So, perhaps NT56 should produce a terminal t5 and then something else. But looking at the productions, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. That's two non-terminals, so it can't directly produce t5. Hmm, I thought NT55 produces t5, but looking at NT55, I don't see a direct production for t5. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's check all the productions again. I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, the production NT70 \u2192 't5' is in the list. So NT70 can produce t5.

{"custom_id":"request-216","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t5 t36 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t17 t4 t29 t27 t34 t29 t4\". The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals (including the special case that a is a terminal). \n\nFirst, I should recall that the Chomsky Normal Form only allows two non-terminal symbols on the right side of the productions. So every production is either to a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar has terms like S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So each production either results in two non-terminals or a terminal, but in the grammar provided, only some of the productions seem to end with terminals. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17' is a terminal on the right. \n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: t5, t36, t29, and so on. So all these must have been generated by the grammar using the productions.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can try to parse it step by step, building the parse tree or using a top-down approach. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by working through possible expansions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first step is to see if the first part of the string starts with NT56 and NT45. But wait, in the string, after S, we have t5, t36, etc. So I need to see if NT56 and NT45 can expand into the beginning part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT63 \u2192 NT45 (since NT45 is a terminal). NT45 \u2192 't4'. So NT69 would expand to 't4' and something else? Wait, no. NT45 is a terminal, so when expanding NT69, we get NT63 and NT49. NT63 is 't9', and NT49 is... looking at NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Then NT22 \u2192 NT39 NT7, so this might further expand, but perhaps it's getting too deep. Maybe I should track this as I go.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by splitting the string into tokens and then applying the productions step by step. The string is: [t5, t36, t29, t4, t9, t0, t6, t17, t4, t29, t27, t34, t29, t4].\n\nI'll try to see if each part can be generated by the given non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo after expanding S, the string starts with NT56 and NT45. Let's see if the first two tokens match what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nLooking at NT56: Its production is NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 \u2192 NT45. But NT45 is a terminal, which is 't4'. So when expanding NT56, we get NT69 and NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 't4' and something else? Wait, NT69: Let me look. NT69 has production NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 \u2192 NT45, which is 't4', and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 \u2192 NT39 NT7. Then what? NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT20. NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30. NT30 is 't17'. So, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach is better, starting from S.\n\nSo first token in the input is t5. Let's think: which production can generate 't5'? Looking through the grammar, the only terminal 't5' is in NT70 \u2192 't17', but wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nThere's NT70 \u2192 't17'? Or I might have misread.

{"custom_id":"request-217","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string \"t5 t36 t24 t26 t13 t6 t3 t4 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand the structure of the grammar. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The string given consists of a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. Each 't' seems to be a separate token, so the string is effectively a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that some of these 't' strings might be derived from the non-terminals provided. For instance, NT18 is defined as NT1 -> t24, so NT1 produces t24. Similarly, NT71 is defined as NT21 -> t13, so NT21 produces t13. Then, when looking at the string, I see \"t13\" appears early on. That would correspond to NT21.\n\nNext, I need to see how NT21 is used. Let's look for a production rule that has NT21 on the left. In the grammar, I see NT21 -> NT13 NT31. So, NT21 splits into NT13 and NT31.\n\nNow, looking into NT13 and NT31. NT13 is one of the production rules, but I don't see it appearing on the left side of any rule. Maybe it's a terminal or a non-terminal that isn't present as a start symbol. Similarly, NT31 is defined as NT31 -> NT4 NT50. So, NT31 can be expanded into NT4 and NT50.\n\nLooking at NT4 and NT50. NT4 appears in the production rules as NT46 -> NT4 NT4, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, NT4 is part of the string, so maybe it's derived from a non-terminal that has a production rule that includes NT4.\n\nLooking deeper, NT46 -> NT4 NT4. So, from NT46, we can get t4 twice. That would explain the \"t4 t4\" part later in the string. But wait, earlier I thought the string starts with t5. Let's see.\n\nThe string starts with t5. So, which non-terminal produces t5? Looking through the grammar, I see NT71 -> t7 and t14. Wait, looking again, actually, in the grammar, NT71 -> t14, and there's a production NT55 -> NT22 NT61. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me list the productions again to make this clearer.\n\nWait, starting from the string, the first symbol is t5. Looking at the grammar, I see NT13 -> t24 and NT1 is t22. But where does t5 come from? I'm trying to find a production that directly or indirectly produces t5.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT70 -> t7, and another NT26->t4, which might explain some parts. Wait, but where does t5 come from? Maybe I need to see which non-terminals produce t5.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT54 -> nt6 nt45, but that's not producing t5. Hmm, actually, I see that in the productions, there are lines like NT54: NT68 -> t6, etc. Wait, looking again, maybe NT55 has a production, but no, NT55's productions don't produce t5.\n\nWait, looking again, I have to find a production that results in t5. Checking the grammar, I see NT71 -> t14, which is a different t. Then, another rule: NT56 -> t9, so that's t9. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look for any production that directly produces 't5'.\n\nWait, I see NT18 -> t24, NT21 -> t23? No, wait: NT13 -> t24, NT18 is defined as NT18 -> t27. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the terminals:\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t36, t24, t26, t13, t6, t3, t4, t4, t26, t36, t29, t4, t4.\n\nEach of these is a terminal.\n\nLooking up each:\n\n- t5: Maybe NT55 or NT56? Wait, NT55 -> NT56 NT45, which would give two symbols. But looking through the productions, I don't see any direct production of t5 except in NT71 (but that's t14). Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a production.\n\nWait, let me go back. In the given grammar, the production rules are listed with the left-hand side first, followed by the right-hand side. So, for example, S -> NT56 NT45. NT56 -> NT69 NT44, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that directly produces a 't5' symbol. Scanning through all the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT70 -> t7 (no, it's '7')\n- Looking back, maybe it's in a non-terminal like NT55: NT55 -> NT56 NT45 or NT55 -> NT44 NT56.\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44 or NT56 -> NT54 NT61?\n\nWait, no NT in the grammar directly produces t5. That suggests that t5 might be part of a non-terminal production. But looking at the initial string, the first terminal is t5.\n\nSo, how do I get t5? Maybe it's derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t5. But looking through the productions, no non-terminal seems directly to produce t5. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t5 is a terminal that's generated by a non-terminal that has a production involving terminal symbols. For example, a non-terminal that can produce t5 and other symbols.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, do any NTs have an expansion that ultimately reduces to t5? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the initial string's t5 comes from the start symbol S, which expands into NT56 NT45. But I don't see t5 anywhere in those NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should explore the derivation. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT56 NT45.\n\nThen, NT56 can be expanded into NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 can be NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63: Let's see, NT63 is \"NT63 -> NT62 NT70\"? Wait, no, looking back, the productions under NT63 include NT63 -> NT25 NT70. Wait, no, from the grammar list, I see various NTs.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT63, I see NT63 -> NT25 NT70?

{"custom_id":"request-235","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can sometimes lead to terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar and the string. The grammar only consists of non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) except for some parts that seem to have 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminals. The string to evaluate is \"t9 t15 t17 t4 t26 t36 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t4 t4 t4\". \n\nI notice that terminal symbols in the grammar are things like 't9', 't15', etc., so the string is made up entirely of these terminals. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI think a good approach here would be to use a parsing strategy, perhaps applying the productions in reverse. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the leftmost derivation approach would work, but sometimes it's easier to parse starting from the leaves upwards, using a method like top-down parsing with the productions.\n\nBut to make this manageable, maybe I can try to break the string into parts that match the productions. The string has 15 't' symbols, so it's a bit long, but perhaps I can break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which productions lead to terminals. For example, S starts as S -> NT56 NT45. So S produces two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. Each of these can then produce more non-terminals, until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nSo the string starts with 't9', which I'll call symbol 1. I need to find a production rule where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal that can derive 't9'. Looking through the grammar rules, I spot NT69 -> NT63 NT49, and I also see NT69 -> NT56 NT45 (since NT56 is part of the S rule, but wait, looking at NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Wait, no, let's check the grammar again. Oh, I see multiple rules. Wait, let me check if any NT leads to 't9'.\n\nLooking at NT69-> NT63 NT49, but I also see NT55-> NT56 NT45, and NT56-> NT69 NT44. Hmm. I might be getting confused here. Let's check if any NT directly leads to a terminal. For example, looking for NT that produce something ending with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, actually, terminals are those that are defined directly, like NT10 -> 't28', so maybe I can find which NTs lead to those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an approach where I build a parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nWait, the string is ordered, so each part must correspond to the left-hand side of some production.\n\nLet me think: the first symbol is 't9'. So somewhere in the parse tree, there must be a NT that directly produces 't9'. Let me check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49 (doesn't produce a terminal yet)\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT61 -> NT34 NT8\n- NT69 -> NT56 NT45\nWait, is there any NT that directly leads to 't9'? Scanning all the rules, I see NT70 -> 't17', but that's not helpful for 't9'. Looking further, NT35-> NT42 NT3, which doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Maybe a longer production chain leads to 't9'. For example, NT3 -> NT68 NT46, and NT68-> 't3' for example? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT26, which has several rules. One of them is NT26-> 't4', but that's just one symbol. Wait, actually, NT26 has two rules: one is NT26-> 't4', and another NT26-> 't29'. Similarly, NT69 might have a rule that eventually resolves to a terminal.\n\nWait, wait. Let's check NT37: I don't see it in the given grammar. Hmm. Maybe I should list all possible rules that lead to terminals.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT10->'t28'\n- NT18->'t32'\n- NT21->'t13'\n- NT26->'t4' or 't29'\n- NT36->'t25'\n- NT47->'t7'\n- NT48->'t24'\n- NT50->'t3' or 't20'\n- NT54->'t9'\nWait, yes! NT54 -> NT6 NT45, and looking for NT6 and NT45:\n\nNT6: S->NT56 NT45, but wait, NT6 isn't in the rules; I think I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, let me look directly for NTs that directly produce 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at NT54's production: NT54-> NT6 NT45. So if I can have NT54 produce 't9', that would be a possibility. But looking at NT6: since I don't see it in the rules, perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, no NT6 exists. Wait, no, the rules only go up to NT71 or so, but perhaps I'm missing NT6.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an NT called NT6. So maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the rules.

Let me check all NTs for direct terminal production:\n\n- NT3-> 't68' NT46\nWait, NT3's rule: NT3 -> NT68 NT46. Does NT68 or NT46 produce terminals? From earlier, NT68-> 't3'? Wait, no, I think the rules say:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT68 is defined as -> NT28 NT26.\n\nThen, NT28: is that a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT with 't28'\u2014unless NT28 is the same as 't28' as in the rules.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the grammar has a bunch of productions, and the string I'm checking is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the grammar looks like. It looks like each non-terminal (the parts before the arrows) is being broken down into two other non-terminals, except for some that produce terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. The terminals are probably the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe given string is `t9 t15 t17 t4 t36 t4 t4 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4`. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT56 NT45, so the initial derivation should produce something that starts with NT56 and NT45. Each of these might expand into more non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, some of them directly produce terminals like 't9', 't15', etc. For example, NT70 -> 't17' and NT30 -> 't17'. So, I can think that certain paths in the grammar will produce these 't' strings.\n\nI think a good approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if I can break down the string step by step. Let's start:\n\n1. The string starts with t9. So, the first NT must produce t9. Looking at the productions, NT35 -> NT42 NT3. Hmm, that doesn't produce 't9'. Wait, maybe NT69? Wait, NT69 -> NT63 NT49. Neither of those are terminating, so that goes to another split.\n\nWait, maybe NT35 is not leading to t9. Let me check NT70 and NT69. NT69 -> NT63 NT48. No, but NT63 -> 't9'. So, if I have NT63, it directly gives me 't9'. So, if one of the Non-terminals in the initial S splits into NT63, that could produce the first 't9'.\n\nSo, S -> NT56 NT45. Let's see if either NT56 or NT45 can split into something that can produce t9. Starting with NT56: NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Then NT69 -> NT63 NT48. NT63 is 't9', so that could be a path. Similarly, NT44 -> NT47 NT20. Then NT47 -> NT7 NT21. NT7 is 't24'. Wait, that doesn't help because the string starts with t9.\n\nWait, maybe NT56 produces t69 NT44. NT69 NT44. Then NT69 -> NT63 NT48. So, the first part is NT63, which is t9. Then NT44 -> NT47 NT20. NT47 is NT7 -> t24. But our string starts with t9 t15 t17..., so maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT45. NT45 -> NT48 NT5. NT48 can split into NT25 NT39. NT25 -> 't37' or NT39 -> something else? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by breaking down the string step by step. Let's try to parse the string.\n\nThe string is: t9 t15 t17 t4 t36 t4 t4 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4.\n\nLet me try to split it into possible segments that come from the grammar.\n\nStarting with t9. So, we need an NT that produces t9. Looking at the productions, I see that NT35 -> NT42 NT3. Not helpful. Wait, looking at NT63, which directly produces 't9' (NT63 -> 't9').\n\nSo, the first part could be NT63, which gives t9.\n\nSo, S1: NT56 produces t9, but wait, S is NT56 NT45. Wait, maybe S is NT56 NT45, but for the first token t9, we probably need NT63. So perhaps the initial split isn't directly S. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the steps wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the parsing isn't straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nEach symbol in the string is produced by a chain of NTs that split until they hit a terminal. So, the entire string must be built by expanding from S, and each step replaces a symbol with two other symbols until we reach the string.\n\nThis is a top-down approach, trying to build the string from S. Alternatively, the string can be parsed by breaking it down into parts that match the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to model the grammar as a Pushdown Automaton, but perhaps a simpler way is to try to find a derivation path that matches the string.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe first symbol is t9. So, in the grammar, t9 comes from NT63 -> 't9'. So, we can have S -> NT56 NT45, and then one of them produces the t9.\n\nWait, but S is split into NT56 and NT45. So, somehow, one of these must be the NT that produces t9, while the other continues to be expanded to produce the rest of the string.\n\nSo, perhaps S -> NT56 NT45, and NT56 produces t9, while NT45 produces the rest? Wait, no, because NT56 is split into NT69 and NT44, which are both non-terminals, so if NT56 produces t9, then the rest would come from NT45.\n\nBut wait, no. NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Then NT69 -> NT63 NT48. NT63 is 't9', so NT56 can produce t9 followed by NT48 and NT44. But that doesn't make sense because the entire string has t9 as the first symbol. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string must come from a single NT56, but that can't be because NT56 branches into two. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a recursive descent parser approach, trying to match the productions.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules again for clarity:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT48\n\nNT63 -> 't9'\n\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\n\nNT25 -> 't37'\n\nand so on.\n\nNT39 -> NT24 NT15\n\nNT24 -> 't24'\n\nNT15 -> 't15'\n\nHmm, so starting from S, we can expand as:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nNow, NT56 expands to NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT48\n\nNT63 is 't9'\n\nNT48 -> NT25 and NT39\n\nNT25 is 't37', NT39 -> NT24 NT15\n\nNT24 is 't24', NT15 is 't15'\n\nSo, if I look at the expansion, it must start with t9 t37 t24 t15... but our string starts with t9 t15...\n\nSo, this path isn't matching. So perhaps the initial NT56 isn't the one that produces t9.\n\nLet me check the other option: S is also split into NT45.\n\nSo, S -> NT45. Then NT45 -> NT48 NT5.\n\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39.\n\nNT25 is 't37'\n\nSo, that's t37 t24... again, doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Maybe I'm missing other production paths.\n\nLooking back, NT18 -> 't32'\n\nNT19 -> 't29'\n\nWait, maybe another path:\n\nLooking for how to get t15. So, 't15' comes from NT70 -> 't17' but that's not t15. Wait, is there a NT that produces 't15'? From the list of productions, NT70 is 't17', NT36 is 't25' sometimes, but I don't see a production for 't15' directly. Wait, maybe via NT50.\n\nWait, looking at NT50: NT50 can be NT25 NT8, which is 't25' and 't13', or NT54 -> NT6 NT45, which is 't6' and 't9', or NT55.\n\nWait, NT36 -> NT25 NT70.

{"custom_id":"request-259","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that simplifies things a bit. The string to evaluate is `t5 t36 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t24 t13 t26 t36 t4 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form means. It means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol can only produce two non-terminals. Additionally, the grammar doesn't have any productions that produce epsilon, which is important because if there were, that could complicate things.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's all in CNF. Each production is a non-terminal (like S, NT22, etc.) producing two other non-terminals, except for the non-terminals that directly correspond to terminals (the ones ending with 't', like t5, t36, etc.). Those are the terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nNow, the string given has 17 tokens separated by spaces. Since the grammar only has the start symbol S, which starts the derivation, the string should be derived from S through a series of productions. The length of the string should match the structure described by the grammar.\n\nIn CNF, the number of terminals in the string should be one more than the number of productions. So if the string has n terminals, the parse tree will have (n-1) productions. For example, each step in the parse tree replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and this continues until the leaves are all terminals.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 17 terminals. That means, during parsing, there would be 16 productions needed to generate this string. The start symbol S is the root, and each internal node must be a non-terminal that expands into two others. So, the derivation should have 16 steps of expanding non-terminals until all are terminals, resulting in 17 tokens.\n\nNow, looking at the structure of the string: `t5 t36 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t24 t13 t26 t36 t4 t4 t4`. Let's count the number of t's: t5, t36, t4, t4, t9, t15, t17, t4, t29, t24, t13, t26, t36, t4, t4, t4. That's 17 terms, so the string is well-formed in terms of the number of terminals.\n\nNext, I'll try to reconstruct a possible parse tree. Starting from S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, S must expand into NT56 and NT45. Then, each of these can expand further according to their productions.\n\nLet's look at NT56. From the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, NT56 becomes NT69 and NT44. Then, each of these can expand:\n\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (from the grammar)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (grammar production)\n\nSo, tracing this out:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nNow, looking at NT63. From the grammar, NT63 is a terminal (it's t63?), wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT63 has productions to terminals. Oh, looking back, I see that NT63 is produced from NT68 and NT61. Wait, no, hold on. Let's clarify the productions:\n\nWait, no. The non-terminals in the grammar are defined as NT22, NT61, NT69, etc. Each of these non-terminals is defined in the left-hand side, so their productions are on the right. But the terminals are on the right-hand side as well.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out the productions for clarity. Each production is of the form NT -> something. The right-hand side can either be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT63: I think I might have missed its production. Wait, checking the grammar again, under NT63, I see it's not listed. Wait, no, the user might have made a typo. Let me check the grammar structure.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the user provided lines like:\n\nNT63 -> NT68 NT61\nWait, no, looking through all the lines, I don't see NT63 directly. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me scan all productions:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT56 NT45\n...\nLine 8: NT63 -> NT68 NT61\nWait, no, actually, in the grammar, line 8 is NT63 -> NT68 NT61. So yes, NT63 expands into NT68 and NT61.\n\nSo, for example, when NT63 is encountered, it produces NT68 and NT61. Similarly, NT61 has a production to NT18 and NT59. Hmm, but NT18 is a terminal (from the terminal symbols) because in the end, NT18 is mapped to 't27'.\n\nWait, in the terminal list, NT18 is t27, NT26 is t4, etc. So in the string, t27 is present, t4, t18, etc.\n\nSo, now, stepping back, the string s is a sequence of t's, each corresponding to a terminal in the grammar. So each t is a production step that replaces a non-terminal with a terminal. So, for example, t5 is NT5's production, but actually, looking for where t5 is in the terminal list. In the grammar, I see NT70 -> t17, which is one of the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in reverse: from the string, figure out the path through the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t24 t13 t26 t36 t4 t4 t4.\n\nSo, let's note what terminals we have:\n\nt5, t36, t4 (appearing multiple times), t9, t15, t17, t29, t24, t13, t26, t36, t4, t4, t4.\n\nFirst, t5 comes from NT22. Looking at the grammar, NT22 -> t5. So the starting symbol S must first produce NT56 and NT45, which then expand further.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t5, so perhaps the initial NT56 or NT45 must directly produce t5. No, because NT56 is a non-terminal, and in the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 and NT44. So, NT56 would produce NT69 and NT44. So, the first token would be a result of NT69's expansion, which is a non-terminal. So, if the first token is t5, that would have to come directly from NT22, which is one of the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check NT22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT22: NT22 \u2192 t4? Wait, no. Let's go through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the lines, I think I might have missed NT22's production. Let me check:\n\nLine: NT22 -> NT63 NT48.\n\nWait, that's the production for NT22. So NT22 is a non-terminal, and it's replaced by NT63 and NT48. So, the first token t5 can't come directly from NT22; it has to come from a terminal through the productions of the other non-terminals.\n\nWait, then how do we get t5 as the first token? Because in the grammar, only NT1, NT54, NT55, etc., produce t-s. So, for example, NT25 \u2192 t10, but none produce t5 directly, except perhaps NT70.\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17, NT69 \u2192 t5 (I think). Wait, checking the grammar again: no, from the production NT70 \u2192 't17', as per the end list. NT50 is mapped to t3, etc. Wait, in the list:\n\nNT50 \u2192 t3, which is a terminal. So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong; perhaps each non-terminal NTn can produce a terminal 'tn'? Let's see.\n\nLooking back at the grammar lines:\n\nNT50 \u2192 t3\n\nYes, so NT50 is a production that results in 't3'. Similarly, NT54: NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45. Wait, so that's still a non-terminal."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t10 t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t33 t24 t6 t28 t4\", and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. Non-terminals can't be empty, so every step must produce either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45.

Looking through the grammar, NT56 is defined as NT69 NT44, because the production for NT56 is NT69 NT44, I think. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT56, it says NT56 -> NT69 NT44, but then for NT69, looking up the production, NT69's production is NT63 NT49, or is it?

In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is two non-terminals on the RHS, and some like NT60 \u2192 'tsomething' are terminals.\n\nThe string to check contains a series of terminals: t5, t36, t29, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either produces two symbols (non-terminals or a terminal) or a single terminal. However, to generate the string, the grammar must produce exactly the sequence of terminals given through a series of derivations.\n\nI think the approach here is to construct a derivation tree where each step expands a non-terminal into one or two symbols. But since the string is a flat sequence of terminals, I need to see if there's a way to break it down into the parts produced by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by listing the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some NTs go directly to a 't' or 'tX' where X is some number. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT49 -> 't15'\n- NT29 \u2192 I'm not sure, since in the given grammar, NT26 has two possible productions: one is 't4' and another is 't29'. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> NT36 NT3 or NT6\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 is actually in this section:\n\nLooking up the productions, I see:\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me go through the productions:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking at each NT line:\n\nNT25 -> NT10\n\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\n\nWait, but also, looking at the grammar, NT61 has multiple productions. For example:\n\nNT61 -> NT22 NT10\n\nNT61 -> NT18 NT59\n\nSo, NT22 appears as a production in NT61.\n\nLooking again, some NTs produce terminals directly:\n\nLooking through all the RHS, the ones that produce terminals directly are:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS is a terminal (including two terminals). Wait, in the given grammar, the RHS can be two non-terminals or a terminal. For example:\n\nNT7 -> 't13'\n\nSimilarly, NT54 -> NT6 NT45 - that's two non-terminals.\n\nBut some NTs might produce a single terminal, but in CNF, productions can only have two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar allows for production rules that produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, a production must have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see rules like:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t13, which is 't13' on the RHS\u2014so that's a terminal production.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 \u2192 t24, and so on.\n\nSo, to check the string, we need to see if it can be derived by expanding the start symbol S, which is initially S \u2192 NT56 NT45, each of which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 17 tokens: t5, t36, t29, t4, t33, t10, t21, t6, t28, t33, t4, t25, t3, t4, t33, t4, t4.\n\nSince each production in the grammar either adds one or two non-terminals, the total number of symbols in the string should be 17. In a derivation, each step can either replace a non-terminal into two non-terminals (increasing the count by 1) or into one terminal (leaving the count same or replacing a non-terminal into a terminal, possibly increasing or decreasing based on context).\n\nWait, actually, in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with its RHS. If the RHS is two non-terminals, it increases the number of non-terminals by 1, and if it's a terminal, it replaces one non-terminal with one terminal, so the count of non-terminals decreases by 1, but the total symbols increase by 0 (since 1 non-terminal becomes 1 terminal).\n\nWait, let me think again. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So initially, after the first step, we have two symbols: NT56 and NT45. Then, each of these could be expanded further.\n\nThe length of the derived string is the number of terminals in the parse tree's leaves. Each terminal is a single symbol, so the overall string length is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, counting only terminals.\n\nTherefore, for the string to have length 17, the parse tree must have 17 leaves of terminals. To get from the initial S, which after first step gives two non-terminals, to 17 terminals, each non-terminal must eventually expand into one or more terminals.\n\nIn the given grammar, some productions are two non-terminals, which would increase the count. For example, if a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, each of those can potentially expand themselves, leading to a binary tree-like expansion.\n\nBut in this problem, the string's length is 17, which suggests that starting from S, we need to expand in such a way that after all possible expansions, we end up with 17 terminal symbols.\n\nThe key is to see if the given string can be decomposed into the sequence of terminals that would result from such derivations.\n\nAn alternative approach is to test the string by attempting to parse it using the given grammar. Parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm can be used for this. However, since I need to do this manually, I need to look for possible substructures that match the productions.\n\nAnother way is to check from the end of the string backwards, using a parsing strategy where we find possible ways to break down the string into substrings that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string.\n\nThe string is: t5, t36, t29, t4, t33, t10, t21, t6, t28, t33, t4, t25, t3, t4, t33, t4, t4.\n\nLet me attempt to parse from the start.\n\nLooking at the first part: t5.\n\nLooking for productions where the first symbol is 't5'. In the given grammar, NT7 \u2192 t13, NT56 \u2192 t33, NT35 \u2192 t9 (wait, NT35 is in the production. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the productions go from NT35 to... wait, looking at NT35:\n\nLooking through the grammar... No, NT35 is in the production:\n\nLooking back, I see that:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n\nBut that's a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce 't5':\n\nLooking through all the RHS that produce 't5', I think only NT56 produces 't33', NT35 produces NT42 and NT3, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should find which NTs can produce each terminal:\n\nLooking at NT productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t13\n\n- NT26 has two possible productions: one is NT36 NT3 and another is NT29. Wait, in the given grammar, NT26 is:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nAt the top, the grammar starts with various NT rules. Let me find which NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking for any production where RHS is a terminal or two terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t24\n\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n\n- NT69 \u2192 t5\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t17, t7\n\nSo, NT69 \u2192 t5. That's a direct production where NT69 is replaced by 't5'.\n\nThen, if our string starts with t5, that could be a possible first step. So, t5 would be the terminal produced by NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-281","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string to evaluate is \"t9 t15 t3 t4 t33 t12 t28 t5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4 t26 t3 t4 t4\". I notice that it's a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must be a concatenation of the two sequences generated by NT56 and NT45. I'll split the string into two parts based on where these NT56 and NT45 start generating.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, it starts with 't9', 't15', etc. I'll need to see if NT56 can generate the first part, and NT45 can generate the second part.\n\nLet me start with NT56. From the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, I can replace NT56 with NT69 and NT44. Now, I need to see what NT69 and NT44 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT69, I see that NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So, replacing NT69, we have NT63 and NT49. Then NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So now, we have NT22, NT66.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of expanding each rule, perhaps I can trace the string back through the grammar.\n\nEach terminal in the string corresponds to a production of the form Non-terminal \u2192 terminal. The grammar defines many productions for terminals, so I can check each 't' in the string against the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the terminals have multiple productions:\n- t36 \u2192 NT25, t70, NT39, etc. It also has t26, t10, t14, etc.\n\nWait, but each 't' in the string must come from exactly one production rule.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and their possible productions:\n\n- t9 \u2192 NT56\n- t15 \u2192 NT15\n- t3 \u2192 NT63, NT35, NT13, NT7, NT8, etc.\n- t4 \u2192 NT68, NT28, NT17, etc.\n- t33 \u2192 NT36\n- t12 \u2192 NT46\n- t28 \u2192 NT7, t17\n- t5 \u2192 NT71\n- t36 \u2192 NT25, etc.\n- t29 \u2192 NT25, t29 is also a production for NT68 etc.\nBut I think each 't' is mapped to specific non-terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar, each terminal is only on the left side once. For example, t3 \u2192 NT68, NT39, NT47, etc. So each 't' is produced by a specific non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's clarify the grammar rules. The rules are:\n\nFor example, NT36 \u2192 t25, t70, etc.\n\nSo each 't' is a terminal that has multiple productions from different non-terminals.\n\nSo, when parsing the string, each 't' must be matched by a production from a specific non-terminal, and we need to track the corresponding non-terminal.\n\nThe string to parse is: t9, t15, t3, t4, t33, t12, t28, t5, t36, t29, t4, t29, t4, t26, t3, t4, t4.\n\nSo let me write each 't' and think about which non-terminal it can come from.\n\nt9: From the grammar, t9 is from NT56 (S's production) and possibly others. So t9 \u2192 NT56.\n\nt15: I need to see which non-terminal produces t15. Let me check the grammar. Looking through all the rules, I see that none of the non-terminals directly produce t15. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the grammar again:\n\nLooking through each non-terminal's rules:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t24\n- NT34 \u2192 t24\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT21 \u2192 t13\n- NT49 \u2192 t15\nAh, here we go. NT49 \u2192 t15. So t15 \u2192 NT49.\n\nSo after t9, we have t15, which is from NT49.\n\nNext is t3. Which non-terminals produce t3? Let's check:\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\nNT47 \u2192 t7\nNT36 \u2192 t25, t70, etc.\nWait, looking through all the rules, NT4 \u2192 t37, NT28 \u2192 t36, NT66 \u2192 t6, etc. Let me specifically look for t3.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT68 \u2192 t3. So t3 can be produced by NT68. Wait, but earlier in the string, after t15 is t3, but according to the grammar, t3 can be produced by NT68, so that would come after NT68, but NT49 must have been used. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps each t is a leaf in the parse tree. So in the string, each t must come from a production rule where a non-terminal is replaced by that specific terminal.\n\nSo in the string, after t9 (NT56), we have t15 (NT49). Then t3: looking at the possible productions that can generate t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT47 \u2192 t7, NT42 \u2192 t46, NT35 \u2192 t9, etc.\n\nWait, let me check: t3 is produced by NT68, as per NT68 \u2192 t3. So if t3 is from NT68, then the previous non-terminal would have to have produced NT68.\n\nBut in our current context, after t15 is nt... Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this more systematically.\n\nThe string needs to be matched by the parse tree starting from S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo each 't' in the string must be generated by the expansion of a non-terminal in the grammar, starting from NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo the first part of the string must be NT56's derivation, followed by NT45's derivation, with no branching in between.\n\nSo each 't' comes either from NT56's chain or NT45's chain.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts based on NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, the string is: t9, t15, t3, t4, t33, t12, t28, t5, t36, t29, t4, t29, t4, t26, t3, t4, t4.\n\nIf the first half comes from NT56 and the second half from NT45, then let's see.\n\nBut wait, the grammar is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so both derivations are sequential, not in any order. So the string must consist of two parts, the first part being the expansion of NT56 and the second part the expansion of NT45.\n\nTherefore, the entire string is the concatenation of two sequences: one from NT56 and the other from NT45.\n\nSo first, I need to determine if NT56 can derive a sequence of terminals that matches the first part of the string, and NT45 can derive the second part.\n\nLooking at the string, let me try to split it. But how? It's tough because the split isn't necessarily clear. Let me maybe think of each NT separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a parse from the string by starting from S and expanding rules step by step.\n\nBut this might take a long time.\n\nAnother approach is to use memoization or recursive descent parsing, but I need to simulate that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to try to find where each 't' must come from, starting from S.\n\nSo starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo the string starts with NT56's derivation and ends with NT45's derivation, concatenated.\n\nLet me process NT56 first.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo the first 't's must come from NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nSo after NT62 (wait, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49), so now we have NT63 and NT49"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the grammar is in CNF, it's possible that the first NT56 would require two non-terminals, each of which could produce a terminal or a combination.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the first NT56 and NT45. Both parts must generate sequences of terminals.\n\nHmm, but the string is 19 tokens. Let's see how each production contributes to terminal count.\n\nLet me map the productions that directly lead to terminals:\n\nLooking through the list, several non-terminals map directly to terminals:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT18 \u2192 't27' (but that's later in the string)\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' and 't29'\n- NT20 \u2192 't6' and 't34'\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5' (Wait, no: looking at NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Then NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which could produce nt25 nt70 \u2192 t10 t17, but wait, the initial part is t9, so how does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the productions.\n\nWait, looking at NT69: the production is NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nLet me see NT63: NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT25 \u2192 t10. NT70 \u2192 t17.\n\nSo NT63 \u2192 t10 t17, not t9, so NT69 \u2192 t10 t17 t49?\n\nNo, wait, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT49 needs to be broken down as well.\n\nLooking at NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT48 NT25.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should work backwards, trying to see if the string can be split into valid components according to the grammar.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Both NT56 and NT45 must produce parts of the string.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, so each NT69 and NT44 needs to produce their respective segments.\n\nLet's look at the string: first, the first two tokens are t9 t9.\n\nAssuming NT56 starts with t9, but from earlier, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, so NT63 would produce t10 t17, which doesn't match t9. Hmm, so maybe the NT56 isn't the first production? Wait, no: S only gives NT56 and NT45. So perhaps the initial NT56 needs to produce t9 t9 ... but it's getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can't be split in a way that aligns with the grammar. Let me try to see if the grammar can produce this string by breaking it into possible substrings.\n\nWait, the string has t9 appearing four times, t4 appearing several times, t5 once, etc. Maybe I should look for where t9 comes from.\n\nLooking at the productions, the only place I see NT63 producing t9 is in NT63 \u2192 NT68 NT70.\n\nWait, no: looking back, in the productions:\n\nWait, looking for NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. So NT28 is NT28 \u2192 t36.\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT28 \u2192 t36, which could produce a t36 in the string, but the string has t9. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the grammar in CNF: each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So every time we have a non-terminal, it must eventually resolve into a sequence that produces terminals.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string must be split into two parts: part1 (produced by NT56) and part2 (produced by NT45).\n\nLooking at the string length: 19 tokens. If each part is a certain length, perhaps 9 and 10, or 10 and 9, or something else, but 19 must split into two even numbers? Or wait, since each non-terminal can split into two non-terminals or produce a terminal.\n\nBut since S starts with NT56 and NT45, and each is a non-terminal, each can generate a number of terminals. So the total length is the sum of the terminals from both.\n\nWait, let's see the string: 19 tokens. So the sum of the terminals from NT56 and NT45 should be 19.\n\nSo I need to see how each can split the string.\n\nAssuming NT56 starts with the first few tokens, NT45 with the rest.\n\nLooking at NT56's first production step: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nThen NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t9 t9.\n\nSo perhaps the NT63 in NT56's expansion produces t9, but earlier I saw NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which produces t10 t17. Hmm, that doesn't match t9.\n\nSo maybe I'm wrong, and another path exists.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the NT63 production. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for NT63:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nWhich is: NT25 \u2192 t10\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17\n\nSo NT63 \u2192 t10 t17\n\nNot t9. So how does t9 come in?\n\nMaybe NT63 is part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another production for NT70 that leads to t9? Wait, looking back, NT70 \u2192 't17' and 't17' appears in the string as part of the t9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But in this grammar, I notice that some productions have terminals on both sides, like S \u2192 NT56 NT45, but then later there are productions where non-terminals branch into other non-terminals and sometimes terminals, like NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, and NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26, and also some NTs have a terminal and a non-terminal, such as NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT69 \u2192 't5'. \n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar again, it seems that not all productions are strictly in CNF because some have terminals on both sides.

NT13 \u2192 't1'.\n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals have terminals as their productions, like NT22 \u2192 't0', which would mean that when you expand NT22, you get a terminal. Similarly, NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT69 \u2192 't5'. But in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, right? So including terminals would mean it's not in CNF anymore; instead, it's in modified CNF or some other form. So maybe the grammar isn't in proper CNF. But perhaps that's not crucial right now. The main point is that some non-terminals can produce terminals, which is allowed in general CFGs, so the grammar is a context-free grammar, even if not strictly in CNF.\n\nNow, the string given is `t5 t3 t4 t9 t0 t6 t3 t4 t29 t32 t34 t10 t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4`. So, breaking it down into individual tokens, we can consider them as a sequence of terminals, each being part of the string.\n\nSince the grammar is given, I need to see if this string can be generated by recursively applying the productions. Since the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, I think a top-down approach might be complicated, so perhaps a bottom-up approach would be better, or maybe trying to construct a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of symbols and see if it's possible. But that might not be sufficient. Another approach is to see if the given string can be generated by repeatedly replacing non-terminals with their productions until we get all terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a recursive descent parser or some method can be used, but given that it's a single string, I might consider building a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that the string starts with 't5', which is generated by NT70 and NT69. Looking at the NT productions, NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT69 \u2192 't5'. So, 't5' comes from NT69.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't5' from NT69. So we have NT69 in the parse.\n\nThen, what can produce NT69? Looking at the grammar, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So, to get NT69, we need to derive NT63 and NT49.\n\nSo, now we need to derive NT63 and NT49.\n\nStarting with NT63: looking at the grammar, I see NT63 \u2192 't9'. So that's a terminal. So NT63 can be replaced by 't9'.\n\nNext, NT49: looking at the grammar, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So NT49 must be replaced by NT22 and NT66.\n\nNow, we can replace NT49 with NT22 and NT66. So, moving further down, we have NT22 and NT66.\n\nFirst, NT22: looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't0'. So that's a terminal.\n\nNext, NT66: looking at the grammar, NT66 \u2192 't6'. So that's another terminal.\n\nSo, in this first step, starting from NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, which becomes t9 and (NT22 \u2192 t0) and (NT66 \u2192 t6), so 't9 t0 t6'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't5 t3 t4...', but the first part I just did gives 't9 t0 t6', which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the string is 't5', which comes from NT69. So NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo, the next step is to see what comes after 't5'.\n\nWait, no: the string is `t5 t3 t4 ...`. So after 't5', we have 't3 t4 t9 t0 t6...'.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match what I just did earlier; I thought that NT69 produces 't5', leading to something else, but maybe I need to see the full expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a single occurrence, and I need to check whether the entire sequence can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider building a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try this:\n\n1. The string starts with 't5', which is generated by either NT69 \u2192 't5' or NT70 \u2192 't17' or NT22 \u2192 't0', etc. Since 't5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-322","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t9 t15 t17 t4 t17 t4 t25 t17 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t4 t10 t5 t3 t4 t4`. The grammar has a bunch of productions, each of which is either a terminal or a pair of symbols. Since it's CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C, and A are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Each production either consumes two non-terminals and produces one, or it's a terminal. The string consists of a sequence of terminals, so the grammar must derive this string by applying its productions step by step.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens, which suggests that the derivation has to be exactly 18 steps because each production either consumes a non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals, increasing the count by one each time until all are terminals. But looking at the grammar, the initial symbol is S, which starts as S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the derivation starts with S, which becomes NT56 NT45.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT56 and NT45) will need to be expanded further until we reach the terminals in the string. Let me try to see if each of these non-terminals can derive a substring that matches the string.\n\nI'll start by mapping each NT to their productions. It's a bit tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or a path that the string could take.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nt9 t15 t17 t4 t17 t4 t25 t17 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t4 t10 t5 t3 t4 t4\n\nSo it's 19 tokens. Let me count how many steps that would be. Since S starts as two non-terminals, each step replacing two non-terminals would add one more token. Starting from 2 (S), after 17 steps, we'd have 2 + 17 = 19 tokens. So the derivation needs 17 steps, but let's see.\n\nLooking at the production S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string would have to start with the t from NT56 followed by the t from NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So the first part is NT56, which is t9 from NT56? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the NT56 production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and terminal NT56 is 't33'. Wait, no, not NT56\u2014NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, right? But then, in the string, the first token is t9. So maybe NT56 can be further expanded into t9 and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait, let's check NT56's production. From the given grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe I can look for strings that end with certain terminals, like the last part of the string.\n\nThe last tokens are t4 t4. Looking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can derive to t4.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't24'\n\nBut looking for t4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't37' (so it's a terminal 't37'), wait, no. Wait, NT4 doesn't have a direct production to t4. Wait, looking for any non-terminal that can derive a t4.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nWait, in the grammar, each rule is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 'tN' where N is some number.

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a provided context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has specific characteristics that make parsing easier.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string and the grammar to see if I can find a way through. The string is: `t5 t3 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t5 t17 t4 t29 t24 t4 t9 t24 t25 t0 t6 t4`. That's a lot of 't' tokens with numbers, and I'll need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence step by step.\n\nThe grammar consists of a set of production rules. I'll start by listing out some of the key rules that produce 't' tokens because those are the terminals in the string. For example, NT70 -> 't5', NT8 -> 't13', NT3 -> 't24', etc. So, the 't' tokens are generated by certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t5`, which can come from NT70. Then `t3` could come from NT7 or NT35 or NT1. But I'll need to trace how these non-terminals are connected.\n\nI'll try to work backwards from the end of the string, using the concept of parsing. Starting from the right, the last token is `t4`, which can come from NT2, NT36, NT48, or NT4. Let's pick NT4, which would mean the previous production must have produced NT4.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT4 appears in NT12 -> NT46 NT25, so perhaps the last token is part of NT46 or NT25. Wait, no, that might complicate things. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be produced by some non-terminal, and then check the preceding non-terminals to see if they can follow. Let me go through the string one token at a time.\n\nPosition 1: `t5` from NT70. So, the initial symbol S must expand into a sequence that starts with NT70.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S is: S -> NT56 NT45. So, from S, we get NT56 followed by NT45.\n\nLet's see what NT56 and NT45 produce. Looking up the rules:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT45 -> NT63 NT49\n\nBut wait, 't5' is the first token, so if we go S -> NT56 NT45, that means we need the first part (NT56) to produce the beginning of the string.\n\nNT56 produces NT69 and NT44. Now, NT69 -> NT5 NT64 (Wait, no, looking back, the rules for NT69 are NT63 NT49. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but going step by step, NT56 is S's first part. So, from S, when we expand S, the first step is to generate NT56 and NT45. So, S => NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, each of these can further expand. Let me try to see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nBut this might get too complex. Maybe another approach is to see if the string is a leftmost derivation or a rightmost. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, it's not ambiguous, so perhaps it's non-left-recursive, and we can parse it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parse tree, trying to see if the string can be built from the root S by substituting the rules appropriately.\n\nLet's see the string again: `t5 t3 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t5 t17 t4 t29 t24 t4 t9 t24 t25 t0 t6 t4`.\n\nThat's 19 tokens. Starting with t5: that's NT70. So, S must produce something starting with NT70.\n\nLooking at S -> NT56 NT45, so the first part is NT56 and then NT45. That would produce the first part of the string from NT56, but wait, the first token is t5, which is from NT70, not sure about NT56 yet.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Because S -> NT56 NT45, so S would generate a string where the first part is what NT56 produces, and the second part is what NT45 produces.\n\nSo, if S is the start, the first symbol produced is from NT56, and the rest is from NT45.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t5, which is from NT70. That doesn't match NT56, which is S's first part. So, maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, no, S's expansion is NT56 ND45, so the first part is NT56 and the second is NT45. So, the first symbol is what NT56 expands to. But the first symbol in the string is t5, which is NT70. So that doesn't align.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first expansion is incorrect. Maybe the string starts with t5, so looking for a production that starts with NT70, which is in NT70 -> 't5' and some other rules, like NT26 -> 't4' or others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction. Wait, perhaps the entire string is the result of fully expanding the non-terminals starting from S, which is S -> NT56 NT45. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT56 produces and what NT45 produces.\n\nGiven that, the first part of the string must be what NT56 produces, and the latter part what NT45 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, let's split it into two parts. Suppose the first part is generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nBut how long is the string? It's 19 tokens. The string is: t5, t3, t4, t26, t36, t29, t4, t5, t17, t4, t29, t24, t4, t9, t24, t25, t0, t6, t4.\n\nThat's 17 tokens? Wait, count again: 19 tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I should just start expanding S and see if each part matches.\n\nS -> NT56 NT45.\n\nSo, starting with NT56. Let's see what NT56 can produce. NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, NT56 produces NT69 and NT44. Now, let's see what each of these produce.\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nSo, NT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, NT63 -> 't9' and something.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT63 is -> 't9'. So, NT63 is a terminal. So, NT69 would produce 't9' and whatever NT49 produces.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Because in the rules, NT63 can only produce 't9' as NT63 -> 't9'. So, that's a terminal. So, the expansion of NT69 would be 't9' followed by the expansion of NT49.\n\nSimilarly, each of these non-terminals will eventually either produce a terminal or another non-terminal that needs to expand further.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44 => (t9 followed by NT49) (something)\nNT45 -> NT63 NT49 => (t9) (something)\n\nBut wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me map out the NTs step by step.\n\nStarting with the production S -> NT56 NT45, then:\n\n1. Expand NT56 to NT69 NT44.\n   - NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n   - So now, after expanding NT69, we have NT63 NT49.\n   - NT63 -> 't9'.\n   - So NT69 expands to 't9' followed by NT49.\n\n2. Now, what about NT44?\n   - Looking at the rules, NT44 is in NT44 -> NT3 NT26.\n   - So, NT44 expands to NT3 NT26.\n   - NT3 could expand in multiple ways. Let's see, the rule for NT3 is NT36 NT55, but wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, looking back, the rules list:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nWait, that might be it. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the rules for NT56 and NT44.\n\nFrom the rules provided:\n\n- NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-335","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is \"t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t5 t36 t4 t4 t29 t4 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t32 t34 t4\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S, which directly expands to NT56 NT45. So the first thing that happens is S becomes two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Then each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further according to the rules provided.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT56 becomes NT69 NT44. And then each of those, breaking them down:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nSo NT56 expands into two more non-terminals, which themselves expand further. Similarly, NT45 expands into:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nWait, let me look at that again. The grammar has S -> NT56 NT45. So S expands into two parts, NT56 and NT45.\n\nI think the approach here is to first expand S step by step, tracking how each non-terminal leads to terminals or other non-terminals, and see if the entire string can be formed.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t followed by numbers. I notice that many of these t-number pairs are in the production rules as right-hand sides of non-terminals. For example, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT70 \u2192 't17', and NT25 \u2192 't10', etc.\n\nI think it's best to try to parse the string from the top down using the given grammar. Let's break down the string into parts and see if they can be matched by the grammar's expansions.\n\nThe string is: t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t5 t36 t4 t4 t29 t4 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t32 t34 t4\n\nLet me list all the t-values in order and see if I can find a sequence that matches from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first part: t9. Looking through the grammar, the only non-terminals that directly produce 't9' are NT35 and NT70. Specifically, NT35 \u2192 t9, and NT70 also does? Wait, looking back, yes: NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT35 \u2192 t9.\n\nWait, no, let me confirm. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3 (line 18)\nAnd line 35: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. NT46 is t4. So NT3 produces t4 after more expansions. So I'm confused because I thought NT35 was producing t9, but looking again, the lines for NT36: NT36 \u2192 t25 (from NT25 which is t10, so probably not). So perhaps I should check each non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should go step by step for each t-value in the string.\n\nThe first t is t9, which can come from NT35 (since NT35 \u2192 t9) or NT? Let me check all production rules for non-terminals that lead to 't9':\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT7: NT13 NT36 (t13 is from NT13\u2192t24 and NT36\u2192... perhaps leading to t17, but not sure.)\n\n- NT30: 't17' (so doesn't produce t9)\n\n- NT35: NT42 NT3 (doesn't produce t9)\n\n- NT50: 't3'\n\n- NT3: 't4'\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's see each production that directly leads to a terminal 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at NT19? Wait, maybe I should look for NT rules where the RHS is a terminal.\n\nActually, looking through the rules, many non-terminals have productions that are combinations of other non-terminals. The ones that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't14'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25' (from NT25)\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT68 \u2192 't3'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't12'\n- NT13 \u2192 't24'\n- NT49 \u2192 't15'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT30 \u2192 't17'\n- NT26 (also) \u2192 't29'\n- NT70 \u2192 't7'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32'\n- NT39 \u2192 't21'\nWait, no. Wait, the terminals are the 't' followed by digits. So each rule that has a terminal part is something like 't9', 't4', etc.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't14' (line 71)\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' (line 26, but also line 26 again) \u2013 wait line 26 is listed twice? Let me check the rules provided.\n\nLooking at the rules provided:\n\nAt line 26: NT63 \u2192 't9', so 63 is 't9'\n\nOther rules ending with terminals are:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't25' (from NT25, which produces 't10', so NT36 \u2192 't10' and another non-terminal)\nWait, no, line 36 is a production where NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT25 is t10, NT70 is t17. So 't10 t17'.\n\nSo NT36 produces 't10 t17'.\n\nBut the string has 't25' as part of the string, so perhaps NT35, which may produce something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's see if the entire string can be represented by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t5 t36 t4 t4 t29 t4 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t32 t34 t4\n\nSo, each 't' is a terminal, followed by a number. Let's break this down into parts that might fit into the grammar's rules.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo the entire string must start with NT56-derived tokens and followed by NT45-derived tokens.\n\nFirst, let's see how S expands.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo the entire string is built from the concatenation of what NT56 generates and what NT45 generates, possibly.\n\nLooking at NT56's production: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo NT56 expands into NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nSo NT69 expands into NT63 and NT49.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo NT44 is NT3 and NT26.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 is 't3', and NT46 is 't4'.\n\nNT46 is directly 't4'.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 (NT63 NT49) (NT3 NT26) \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26\n\nNow, expanding NT49: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nAnd NT66 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nSo NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT25 NT70.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 NT48 NT48.

{"custom_id":"request-339","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, the string to evaluate is `t9 t0 t6 t36 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t12 t28 t4 t4`. That's quite long, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and looking at the productions, I see that S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string must start with NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with `t9`. According to the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, so the first part comes from NT69 and NT44. Let me see what those produce.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So now I have NT63 and NT49. NT63 is `t9` according to the production rules because look: NT63 \u2192 't9'. Perfect, that's the first 't9' in the string. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So the second part comes from NT22 and NT66. Looking at NT22: it's `t12` because NT1 \u2192 't24' and NT22 is in the production of NT22 \u2192 NT21 NT1, but wait, no, actually looking at the grammar, NT22 is actually a terminal. Wait, no. Let me check the grammar again. NT22 has a production: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48 and also appears as a terminal 't21'? Wait no, none of the NT22 productions are terminals. NT22 is a non-terminal that produces other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, I see ND22 \u2192 NT63 NT48 and also in the terminal list, there's NT18 \u2192 't27', but that doesn't involve NT22.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Let me scan the grammar for terminals called by NT22. Wait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are things like 't9', 't24', 't5', etc. But NT22 is involved in a production: S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and that splits into 't9' and NT44. Then NT44 is NT48 NT3, so NT48 is the next step. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me outline the string and the grammar more clearly.\n\nThe string is: `t9 t0 t6 t36 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t12 t28 t4 t4`\n\nWe have to parse this string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first part: after S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which starts the string with the first part of NT56.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So after 't9' comes NT44.\n\nNow, NT44 \u2192 NT48 NT3. So the next part is NT48 and NT3.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. So after NT48 comes NT25 and NT39.\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10. Hmm, NT10 is not a terminal; wait, looking back at the grammar, NT10 isn't directly listed. Wait, do I have any productions for NT10? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't28' (I think). Wait, in the grammar, it's written as NT10 \u2192 't28'? Wait, looking through the list, I see NT10 has only one production: NT10 \u2192 't28'. So NT10 is a terminal. Okay, so NT25 \u2192 NT10, which is 't28'. So the next part is 't28'.\n\nWait, but earlier, after NT48, we had NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. Then NT25 is 't28', so that's the next token. Then NT39 \u2192 NT4 NT21. So after 't28', we have NT4 NT21.\n\nLooking at NT4 \u2192 't37' per the grammar. So the next part is 't37', but the string after 't28' is 't4'. Wait, that's a problem. So the string after 't9' is t0 t6 t36 t10..., but according to the grammar, after NT44 comes NT48 and NT3, but NT48 splits into 't25 NT39', which is 't28' and then NT39 is 't37'. But in the string, after 't9' comes 't0', not 't28'. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misparsing. Let me try to outline the steps again.\n\nWait, the string is `t9 t0 t6 t36 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t12 t28 t4 t4`.\n\nSo the initial part is S generating NT56 and NT45, which produce 't9' and then NT44. Then NT44 is 'NT48 NT3', so next comes 't28' and then 't37', but the string starts with 't0', which is after 't9'. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the NT48 production. Let me check. NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, yes, and NT39 \u2192 NT4 NT21. So NT48 would produce NT25 and NT39. NT25 is 't28', and NT39 is NT4 NT21, which is 't37'. So the sequence from the grammar would be 't28' 't37' after 't9', but the string starts with 't0' after 't9'. So that doesn't align. Therefore, perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing that the start symbol is S, and after NT56 comes NT45. But the initial part of the string starts with 't9', which is from NT56. Then after NT56, we have NT45, but in the string, after 't9', the next token is 't0', which according to the grammar comes from NT45.\n\nSo let me re-examine: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So after 't9' comes the production of NT45. What is NT45? Let me check. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT45 directly, but wait, earlier I thought S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so NT45 must be a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I see that NT45 is a production. Looking at the grammar:\n\nThe productions include NT45 \u2192 't4' and NT48 \u2192 't24' etc. Wait, but NT45 is a non-terminal?\n\nWait no, looking through the list:\n\nYes, there are NT3, NT6, etc., but looking for NT45, I see that NT45 is a production, but as a terminal. Let me search again. Oh, no, in the given grammar, NT45 is written as 't4'. That is, NT45 \u2192 't4'. So NT45 is a terminal, right? Wait, but according to the grammar rules, non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals. So if NT45 \u2192 't4', then NT45 is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible. Because in the grammar, the right-hand sides are all either 'something' (i.e., terminals) or a pair of non-terminals. So if NT45 can produce a terminal, it's a terminal. But that can't be because S is a non-terminal and S \u2192 NT56 NT45 would mean a mixture of non-terminals and terminals on the RHS, which is not allowed for CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form, which only allows A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So that suggests that in this grammar, some non-terminals are producing terminals, which is allowed because a production can have terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t17 t4 t36 t4 t4 t9 t9 t2 t6 t17 t4 t29 t4 t29 t33 t10 t17 t17 t4 t4`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. My job is to figure out if this string can be derived from the grammar. \n\nFirst off, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. So, every production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. That's important because it tells me that to check the string, every step in the derivation should be either replacing a symbol with two others or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, it's composed of 21 't's followed by numbers, like `t5 t17 t4 ... t4`. Each of these is a terminal symbol because they all end with 't' followed by a number, unlike 'S', 'NT22', etc., which are non-terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string's length can give me a clue about the number of productions that would have been used. I know that for a string of length n, the corresponding parse tree would have n-1 nodes of expansion, and thus the number of steps in the derivation would be n-1. But more importantly, for a string of length m, each non-terminal derivation can split into two, so the grammar can only generate strings where the number of terminal symbols in a production is a power of two. Wait, actually, in CNF, the string length must be 2^k for some k because each step doubles the number of symbols except when a terminal is added.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. In CNF, each production rule replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either both non-terminals or one a terminal and one non-terminal. But actually, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, it's either A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a single terminal. So each production can only replace a non-terminal with exactly one terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nSo, in the derivation, each time a non-terminal is replaced, it's either split into two non-terminals, increasing the count by one, or replaced by a terminal, ending the chain for that node. So the entire string is built by a series of such replacements. \n\nBut wait, for the length of the string, if it's a single non-terminal expanding to two terminals directly, the length increases by one each time a non-terminal is split. So starting from a single non-terminal S, the maximum length of the string would be 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Let's see how long the string is here. The string has 20 't's, but looking closely, it's 21 symbols because each 't' part is a single symbol. So the string has length 20 (wait, no, let me count: t5, t17, ..., t4. So each 't' is followed by a number, each being a separate symbol, so the entire string is 20 terminal symbols? Wait no, looking again: the string is written as `t5 t17 t4 t36 t4 t4 t9 t9 t2 t6 t17 t4 t29 t4 t29 t33 t10 t17 t17 t4 t4`. Let's count them: that's 20 symbols. So 20 terminals.\n\nIn a CFG in CNF, the number of terminals in a string derived from S must be 2^n for some n because each split doubles the number of symbols, except when a terminal is produced. Wait, no. Wait, no, because in CNF, each non-terminal can only expand to exactly one terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, starting from S, after each production, the number of symbols (terminals plus non-terminals) increases by one each time a non-terminal is split. So the maximum number of terminals is 2^k, where k is the number of splits. But the string here is length 20, which is not a power of two. The powers of two around 20 are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). So since 20 isn't a power of two, it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string of length 20 in CNF. Therefore, the answer must be 'No'.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, no, because each production in CNF can produce either two non-terminals, so each split increases the count by one. So if the initial symbol S can split into two, then each of those can split again, etc. So the total number of terminal symbols would end up being 2^k, where k is the number of splits starting from S. But in this case, the string has 20 symbols, which isn't a power of two. So that's a red flag.\n\nWait, another way: in a derivation from S, the number of terminals produced depends on how many times a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. Each time a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, the number of symbols doesn't increase. But when it's replaced by two non-terminals, the count increases by one each time. So starting from 1 (S), after each split, the count increases by 1 if the production is a non-terminal split into two non-terminals. \n\nBut this leads to the conclusion that the number of terminal symbols is 1 + the number of splits that produce non-terminals. Wait, this might not hold because each production can vary. Let me think: Each time a non-terminal is split into two non-terminals, the count increases by one. If any of those are split into terminals, the count doesn't increase. So the total number of terminals is equal to the initial count (1) plus the number of splits that result in two non-terminals. Each such split contributes one more terminal. So if the total terminals are N, then N = 1 + (number of splits that produce two non-terminals). But each split of a non-terminal into a terminal doesn't affect the count. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe key point is that in a CFG in CNF, the number of terminals in the derived string must be at least 1 and can be any positive integer, but more importantly, if the grammar is fully expanded each time, the number of terminals would have to be a power of two. However, in this case, the string length is 20, which isn't a power of two. That suggests that it's not possible to derive this string using a grammar in CNF because the length isn't compatible. \n\nBut wait, does that hold true? Because the grammar might not require all non-terminals to fully expand. Maybe some non-terminals produce terminals immediately without expanding further. In that case, the string can have a length that's a sum of powers of two. For example, suppose the string has a part that comes from S \u2192 A B, where A and B are non-terminals that each produce one terminal, so the total would be 2. Alternatively, A could produce 2 terminals and B could produce 4, making 6. But in this case, 20 can be represented as 16 + 4, so 16 from one branch and 4 from another.\n\nWait, that's possible. So perhaps the string can be formed by grouping splits. For example, if part of the derivation splits into two, each of which further splits, leading to 4, 8, 16, etc., terminals, but in our case, 20 is 16 + 4, which are both powers of two. So perhaps it is possible. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is constructed by multiple splits in parallel, leading to lengths that add up as powers of two. For example, the leftmost derivation can produce a certain number of terminals, and the rightmost derivation another, but they can combine. However, I'm not entirely sure. \n\nAnother approach is to look for any obvious contradictions in the string. For example, if any of the terminals cannot be produced by any non-terminal, that would make the string invalid. So I should check if each terminal in the string is present as a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are all the symbols that appear in the productions as 'a's. From the grammar provided:\n\n- t5, t17, t4, t36, t9, t2, t6, t17, t4, t29, t4, t29, t33, t10, t17, t17, t4, t4.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, I need to check if each of these terminals is present as a terminal symbol in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-357","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding what's given.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, all the rules on the left side have two non-terminals, except the last few where it seems to have a mix, but wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions should have exactly two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. Hmm, let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar provided has some rules with two non-terminals, others have three? Or is it that some are mixed?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar as given, I see multiple rules like S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is two non-terminals. NT61 can go to NT34 NT8, which is two non-terminals, another can go to NT63 NT49. Oh wait, but others like NT66 \u2192 NT70 NT62? No, let me check the given grammar again.\n\nWait, no, the grammar as presented seems to have all productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two symbols, either non-terminals or a mix. Wait, no, for example, looking at the rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT2 NT10\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n\nHmm, wait, actually, in the provided grammar, most rules are two non-terminals, but there's one that's three? Wait, let me check again. Oh, wait, looking at the top-level grammar, I see S -> NT56 NT45, which is two non-terminals. All other productions are in the format NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, which are also two non-terminals.\n\nThe only terminals are when a production like NT3 \u2192 't24' or NT53 \u2192 't5' etc., but wait, looking more closely, in the grammar, the right-hand side can either be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, the string is a sequence of terminals: t5 t3 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t9 t0 t6 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4 t27 t34 t25 t17 t4 t4.\n\nSo we need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting with S.\n\nThe grammar is in CNF, so the parsing would be straightforward for an CYK algorithm, but since the string is given, I can approach it by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe length of the string is 20 terminals. Let's note that the grammar may have rules that directly produce single terminals, which could be key in breaking down the string.\n\nLet me look for which non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at the rule NT3 -> 't24'\n\nSimilarly, NT69 -> 't5'\n\nNT50 -> 't3'\n\nNT46 -> 't4'\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT59 -> 't34'\n\nNT21 -> 't13'\n\nNT8 -> 't13'\n\nWait, but some of these are not unique. For instance, NT70 appears in two rules, both leading to 't17' but in different productions. Hmm, no, wait, no, some rules might have the same right-hand side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals produce the same terminal. So, for example, NT70 \u2192 't17' in two different production rules. That's possible since CNF allows multiple productions.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to try to find which parts of the string can be generated by looking at the right-hand sides.\n\nAlso, the start symbol is S, and it produces NT56 and NT45. So any derivation starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nTherefore, the string must be a concatenation of two parts, each generated by NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts, but looking at the string, maybe 10 elements each, but actually, perhaps the lengths can vary as long as each part is derived from the respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in any case, let's think of the entire string as generated by S, so it's split into two, each generated from NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo first, let's see what each of these non-terminals (NT56 and NT45) can produce.\n\nLooking at NT56: From the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nThen, what about NT69? NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nSo, NT69 and NT49 may produce more non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in CNF, the length of the string can give us the number of productions in the parse tree.\n\nWait, for a string of length n, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree is n-1 (for a tree structure with n leaves and n-1 internal nodes). But since each internal node is a production, each internal node combines two symbols. So for a string of length 20, there are 19 productions, meaning 19 internal nodes. That's a lot, so maybe that's why we'll need to look for the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the given string and try to match each terminal by finding a production that directly produces it, tracing back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the first symbols in the string correspond to the roots NT56 or NT45.\n\nNT56: Its only production is NT69 NT44. So the first symbol of any string derived from NT56 must come from one of the productions of NT69 or NT44.\n\nLooking at the first terminal in the string: t5.\n\nIs 't5' produced by either NT69 or NT44?\n\nLooking up NT69 rules: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So it produces NT63 and NT49.\n\nNT44 \u2192 Look through the rules. Looking at the production for NT44: from the given grammar, I see NT44 isn't directly producing a terminal. Wait, let me check the entire list again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nWait, for NT44, search for 't44' or similar. Wait, in the grammar, in the production for NT44, I don't see 't44' as a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT45 \u2192 't4' (from the production NT45-> t4)\n\nWait, so maybe 't44' is another terminal. Wait, looking through, perhaps in another rule.\n\nWait, let me see. Looking through the given rules:\n\nLooking for 't44':\n\nIn the rules, I see NT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT71 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, no 't44' seems to be missing. That's confusing because if NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, then to get a terminal, NT44 must produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules for any that directly produce 't44'. Scanning through the list:\n\nLooking through each rule, for example:\n\nLooking at NT64: Hmm, no, the highest number seems to go up to NT71.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nWait, no. Hmm. Maybe I've overlooked it.\n\nWait, in the given rules, it's possible that some rules might produce a terminal, but did I miss it? Let me see.\n\nWait, in the provided list, NT56: \"NT56 -> NT69 NT44\"\n\nLooking at NT44 in the rules: The closest is NT44 in another rule? Wait, I'm not seeing any rule for NT44 except the production NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which isn't directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe NT44 is an intermediate that can produce a terminal. Wait, looking through the rules, is there any NTX \u2192 't44'?\n\nLooking through the string, perhaps I missed. Wait, maybe NT44 is a mistake. Or perhaps it's another non-terminal, but perhaps I overlooked it.\n\nWait, moving on, perhaps I should check if 't5' can be produced by NT69 or NT44.\n\nLooking up NT69's rules: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT49: looking at the rules, NT49 can produce NT22 NT66 or 't15'.\n\nWait, looking at the rule NT49 -> NT22 NT66 and also NT49 -> 't15'.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t5 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t25 t36 t29 t4 t33 t4 t4`.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Each production starts with 'S', so I'll start from the top.\n\nThe first production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, the string starts with NT56 and NT45. Let's look at the string: it starts with 't5', which is likely NT56 (since NT56 -> t5 as per the grammar). So the first part is 't5', which matches NT56.\n\nNext is NT45. Looking at the grammar, NT45 appears in multiple rules, but let me check. From the rules, NT45 is the right-hand side of NT56 (-> t5, NT56) and NT1 (S's production is NT56 NT45). Let me confirm NT45: the grammar has NT45 as a terminal, so NT45 is 't4'. So after 't5', the next is 't4', which should be the next part.\n\nWait, the string is `t5 t36 ...` but the next is 't36'. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the string.\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t25 t36 t29 t4 t33 t4 t4.\n\nWait, starting with t5, then t36... But from S's production, it's NT56 and NT45. So after NT56 (t5), NT45 should produce t4. But the string starts with t5, then t36. That doesn't fit. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the order wrong. The production is S -> NT56 NT45. So the first symbol should be NT56, then NT45. But NT45 can be a non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar rules, some right-hand sides are terminals, some are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. Wait, no. In fact, in CNF, each production is A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So in the given grammar, the productions are all in the form of non-terminals breaking down into two non-terminals, except for the ones where a terminal is present, like NT70 -> 't5'. So, some of the rules are terminals.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, some rules have terminals, so the entire grammar might include both terminals and non-terminals. So, the top-down approach would be to see if we can apply the production rules starting from S, replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides until we get all terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nNow, NT56 and NT45 can each be expanded further. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT56: in the grammar, there's NT55 -> NT56 NT45, which is one rule. Also, NT56 -> t5. So if NT56 is a terminal (since it has a production that results in 't5'), then NT45 must be another non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT56 has a production NT56 -> t5, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT45 has several productions, including NT45 -> t4, but let's check if NT45 is ever a terminal.\n\nWait, I need to check each NT. Looking for any production where NT produces a terminal. For example, is there an NT that directly goes to 'tX'? Let's scan:\n\nLooking for right-hand sides that are terminals (i.e., not starting with NT):\n\n- NT70 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't27'\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't29'\n- NT20 -> 't6'\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT49 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT36 -> 't25'\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't13'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT50 -> 't20'\n- NT48 -> 't2'\n- NT18 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't12'\n- NT13 -> 't1'\n\nSo, several NTs are terminals: NT70, NT30, NT18, NT26, NT20, NT63, NT45, NT1, NT59, NT21, NT49, NT68, NT28, NT66, NT36, NT70 (again), NT69, NT8, NT56, NT50, NT48, NT18 (again), NT35, NT22, NT2, NT13.\n\nSo, when expanding S, which is NT56 followed by NT45. Wait, no: S is NT56 NT45, so it's a production of S as a combination of two non-terminals. So, when expanding, we replace NT56 and NT45 with their respective right-hand sides, which could be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting with S:\n\nFirst step: Replace S with NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, let's replace NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 can be replaced by 't5' because one of its productions is NT56 -> t5. So the first part of the string starts with 't5', which matches the beginning of the given string.\n\nNext, NT45: We need to see which production NT45 uses. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT45 has a production to 't4' (NT45 -> t4). Also, looking back, in the grammar, there's NT56 -> t5, NT1 -> t24, but for NT45, is there any production leading to another NT? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT45 -> another NT production except possibly in the longer productions. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT45 has a production to 't4', so NT45 is a terminal.\n\nSo, replacing NT45 with 't4', which is the second element after 't5' in the string. So now the string after two steps is t5 t4.\n\nWait, but the actual string starts with t5 t36 t26..., which doesn't match. Hmm, this suggests a problem. Because according to the grammar, S leads to NT56 and NT45, which should be replaced to 't5' and 't4', making the sequence start with t5 t4, but the given string starts with t5 t36. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's productions. Let me double-check. Each production in the grammar starts with 'A ->', where A is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals, except for those that produce terminals. So, for example, NT56 can be 't5' or other NTs, but in the given string, the first part after S is t5, which matches NT56 -> t5.\n\nWait, no. Perhaps I got the order wrong. Let me re-express S's production: S -> NT56 NT45. So the first symbol of the string should be the expansion of NT56. According to the grammar, NT56 can be t5 or other combinations. So in this case, to get the first symbol as t5, NT56 must be replaced by t5, leaving NT45 to be replaced by t4, which is correct.\n\nBut in the given string, the second symbol is t36, not t4. So that's a problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the string.

{"custom_id":"request-382","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t9 t9 t24 t6 t3 t4 t36 t10 t5 t17 t4 t4 t29 t33 t10 t17 t36 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4`. \n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of CFGs where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given seems to follow CNF because each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for some that have terminals. Wait, no, actually, some produce two terminals, which might not be exactly CNF. Looking at the rules, some have two terminals, like NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26, but others have three, like NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it says it's in Chomsky normal form, so perhaps I should focus on the structure rather than the terminals.\n\nThe string consists of t9, t9, t24, etc., which are terminals. So, to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if each step of the derivation can produce the correct sequence of terminals.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string by reversing the derivation steps. That is, start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string step by step. The start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. So, the string must start with either NT56 or NT45. Looking at the string, the first token is t9. Let me check which production from NT56 or NT45 can lead to t9.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 \u2192 NT18 NT59, and NT59 \u2192 NT50 NT17. Wait, I'm getting a bit lost here. Maybe I should break down each non-terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' in the string corresponds to a production. For example, t9 could be derived from NT69 via NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 \u2192 followed by producing t6 from NT63? Wait, looking at the productions, NT63 \u2192 't6' directly. So, if NT63 is part of the derivation, we can get t6.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be broken down according to the grammar. Each 't' is an terminal in Chomsky Normal Form, so each step in the derivations should correspond to these terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the yield of the grammar, which is the set of all strings that can be derived. However, given the complexity of the grammar, that might not be feasible manually. Instead, let's try to analyze if each part of the string can be matched by the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t9 t9 t24 t6 t3 t4 t36 t10 t5 t17 t4 t4 t29 t33 t10 t17 t36 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4.\n\nI notice that some terminals are repeated, so perhaps there are multiple paths. But each step must follow the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the first part. t9 could come from NT69 or NT55 (since NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, but I'm not sure if that's the right path). Alternatively, NT69 is produced by NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' can be matched by some rule, and then see if the sequence of rules can cover the entire string without leftovers.\n\nLet's list out all the production rules that have terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 'n't63\n- NT30 \u2192 't'17\n- NT18 \u2192 't'27\n- NT26 \u2192 't'4 or 't'29\n- NT63 \u2192 't'6\n- NT44 \u2192 't'3\n- NT59 \u2192 't'3\n- NT36 \u2192 't'25\n- NT1 \u2192 't'24\n- NT71 \u2192 't'14\n- NT25 \u2192 't'10\n- NT10 \u2192 't'28\n- NT33 \u2192 't'33 (wait, actually, looking back, the rules have NT33, but I might be getting confused because of how they're written. Let me scan each rule properly.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT6 \u2192 'n't1 NT22, so 6: 't'12\nNT24 \u2192 't'24 (I think, looking at NT48 \u2192 't'24, and NT1 \u2192 't'24)\nWait, looking for all rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't12' (from S \u2192 NT56 NT45; but S is S, so maybe not)\nWait, let's list each rule that has 't' in them.\n\nLooking through all rules, the ones that have terminals are:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't'25\nNT63 \u2192 't'6\nNT44 \u2192 't'3\nNT3 \u2192 't'68 't'46\nWait, but 't'68 and 't'46 are terminals.

Let me go through the rules systematically.)\n\nEach rule's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't12'\n\nLooking at rule NT6: NT6 \u2192 't1' NT22\n\nWait, in the initial provided grammar, the rules are listed as:\n\nEach line is a production in the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, to find all rules that end with a terminal, I need to look for the right-hand sides that are single terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't1' NT22 \u2192 But wait, the problem is in the way it's written. For example, \"NT6 \u2192 't1' NT22\" would imply that NT6 produces 't1' followed by NT22, which can't be a terminal. Or is it 't'1 and NT22? Or perhaps it's 't'12, as per NT6 \u2192 't1' NT22. Hmm, it's a bit unclear because the notation might be combining digits. Alternatively, perhaps it's 't12', but that would be written as 't12'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, one of the rules is NT6 \u2192 't1' NT22, which would mean that NT6 can produce 't1' followed by NT22. But that would not result in a terminal, because NT22 is a non-terminal. Wait, unless NT22 can expand into something that includes a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I must be misinterpreting. Perhaps it's written as NT6 \u2192 't'1 and NT22. But I think the way the problem lists the rules is that all non-terminals on RHS are separated by spaces, and any that are not, are terminals. So, for example, NT6 \u2192 't1' would mean NT6 produces the string 't1', but given the way it's written, perhaps each production is broken down as A \u2192 B C"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-393","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side except for the start symbol. The string to evaluate is `t5 t3 t4 t25 t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t29 t4 t4`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. So the derivation should start with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Each of those non-terminals can further break down into smaller pieces. The NT symbols eventually expand into a series of 't' symbols followed by numbers. \n\nThe string provided has 21 't' terms, each concatenated with numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule adds one symbol to the left-hand side, so the number of steps in the derivation will be equal to the depth of the tree. The starting symbol S will produce two symbols, each of those will produce two more, and so on until the maximum depth is reached. But in this case, I think the number of symbols in the string will determine the depth. \n\nThe length of the string is 21 symbols. Each step of the production adds one more level, but since it's a binary tree (each non-terminal splits into two), the number of tokens generated from S is 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Wait, let me think about this. For a string of m symbols, we need a derivation of length m. Since each production adds one token, except for the initial symbol S which might have two.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, each non-terminal (like NT56, NT45, etc.) eventually breaks down into a series of 't' terms. Each 't' term is a symbol, so each step is a binary split. So the number of tokens generated should be 2^k, where k is the number of splits from the start.\n\nLet's count the symbols in the string: t5, t3, t4, t25, t36, t25, t3, t4, t33, t24, t13, t4, t9, t0, t6, t36, t26, t3, t4, t4, t29, t4, t4. Wait, actually, the string has 21 't's and numbers, so each token is a separate element. So it's a list of 21 elements.\n\nNow, in a binary tree derivation, the number of leaves is equal to 2^k. For example, starting with S, which is one non-terminal. Split into two (level 1), each splits into two (level 2), and so on until we reach the leaves, which are the 't' terms.\n\nSo 2^k = 21? Wait, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 21 is between those. That's not possible because the number of 't's should be a power of 2. So 21 is not a power of 2, so the string length doesn't fit the structure of the grammar. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check again. The string has 21 symbols. So the depth would require that 2^k equals 21, but since 21 isn't a power of two, that's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial derivation is different. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the tokenization. Let's count the exact number of tokens to see:\n\nThe string is: `t5 t3 t4 t25 t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t29 t4 t4`\n\nCounting each individual token: it's 21 't's and numbers. So 21 characters in the string as a list. Which is 21 elements. Since 21 is not a power of two, the derivation can't produce that exactly because each split doubles the number of tokens. So for n tokens, n must be 2^k.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nStep-by-step explanation: The grammar generates strings where the number of 't' tokens must be a power of 2, as each non-terminal splits into two. The given string has 21 tokens, not a power of 2, so it can't be generated. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t9 t9 t2 t6 t36 t4 t4 t3 t4 t5 t17 t4 t25 t36 t4 t4 t24 t6 t28 t4 t33 t29 t4`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. This helps because during the parsing process, like with the CYK algorithm, we can efficiently check if the string is in the language by looking at the grammar rules.\n\nBut wait, the string given is a sequence of terminal symbols, no non-terminals. So I need to figure out if there's a way to derive this string step by step using the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each production either combines two non-terminals or introduces a terminal symbol. Since the string has 21 tokens, each corresponding to a terminal, I'm thinking that each terminal must be produced directly by some rule, or generated through a series of steps.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly correspond to a single terminal. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17', NT26 \u2192 't4', NT36 \u2192 't25', etc. So some terminals are terminal symbols in the grammar. But many are not directly, so I need to trace how they're derived.\n\nBut hold on, because the string is composed entirely of terminal symbols, it must be that each symbol in the string can be rewritten through the grammar's rules, ending with the entire string being produced from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the grammar is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S's production is two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Each of these can be broken down further.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nSo starting from S, the first step would be to replace S with NT56 and NT45. Let's track each part:\n\nNT56 becomes NT69 and NT44.\nNT69 becomes NT63 and NT49.\nNT44 becomes NT3 and NT26.\n\nNow NT3 isn't directly a terminal; wait, does NT3 have a rule? Looking back, yes: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. So NT3 expands into two more non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 is a non-terminal. Its production is NT56 NT45 \u2192 but that's part of the start symbol. Wait, no, NT45 is a non-terminal, so its production isn't given directly. Wait, actually, the start is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, but NT45 itself isn't directly defined here. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which are both non-terminals. So each NT56 and NT45 needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking back, NT56's production is NT69 NT44, and NT45 produces NT56 NT45 \u2192 wait, no, that would be a recursive production. So perhaps I need to see if there's any mistake here.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces NT56 NT45. NT45, looking at the list, has a production NT45 \u2192 NT56 NT45. Oh, that's a problem. If NT45 \u2192 NT56 NT45, that's a recursive definition. That would mean that NT45 can only be expanded infinitely, which isn't allowed. So unless there's another production for NT45, perhaps this is a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT56 NT45 is not actually present. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8\n- NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT45 (Wait, is that a typo?)\n\nWait, no, the user provided a long list of rules, let me check:\n\nFrom the beginning, the grammar seems to have:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nThen,\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n\nBTW, there's also:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nAnd NT45 \u2192 is there a production? I see NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT45, which might be a mistake, but elsewhere:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see NT45 having a production except possibly in NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 and NT56 \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me see the production rules again:\n\nFrom the user's list:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo NT56 is defined, but NT45 is also present, but it's defined as NT56 NT45? Or is that a different NT45?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to list the non-terminals and their production rules clearly.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-422","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar, which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t5 t3 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t33 t27 t34 t33 t4 t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t29 t2 t6 t28 t29 t4`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the rules seem to fit this form, so I'm good there.\n\nNext, the task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string consists of a series of terminals, so I need to find a way to split this string into the non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, I need to see if the string can be broken into two parts that correspond to NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nLet's list out the string as tokens for easier handling: [t5, t3, t4, t33, t2, t6, t28, t33, t27, t34, t33, t4, t9, t9, t24, t6, t17, t4, t29, t2, t6, t28, t29, t4].\n\nFirst, I need to match the first part of S, NT56, to the start of the string. Looking at the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, the first part (before the first NT45) must start with NT69 and then have NT44.\n\nBut looking at the terminal string, we start with t5. Let's see which non-terminal produces t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT70 \u2192 't5'. So, one possibility is that NT70 produces t5. But NT56 needs to produce something else.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see which non-terminals can produce the first few symbols.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, let's check how t5 can be derived. NT70 \u2192 't5', so t5 is the start of NT70. So, if NT56 is supposed to produce NT69 NT44, let's see if NT69 can produce t5.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT69 has rules: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 and NT69 \u2192 NT5 NT45. So, can NT69 produce t5? Looking at the productions, NT5 is present as a rule, but none of the rules directly produce t5 except NT70. Wait, NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49, and NT1 \u2192 't24', etc. I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the entire string step by step, using the grammar to see if it can be divided accordingly.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be represented as the concatenation of two parts, each generated by NT56 and NT45 respectively.\n\nLet me see. The string is 24 tokens long (count them: 24 t's). Since each production may consist of two non-terminals, each generating certain tokens, maybe the string is split into two parts of about 12 tokens each.\n\nWait, but NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, which are two non-terminals. So, the first part of the string (starting with NT69) and the second part (NT44). Similarly, NT45 would generate something.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to parse the string from left to right, starting with the start symbol and seeing if each production leads to the next token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be matched by a series of productions that start from S and split into the necessary components.\n\nWait, let me try a step-by-step approach.\n\nThe string is: t5 t3 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t33 t27 t34 t33 t4 t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t29 t2 t6 t28 t29 t4.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string should be divided into two parts: the first part generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nLooking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, the first part of the string should be NT69 and the second part NT44.\n\nNow, let's see if the start starts with t5. The first terminal is t5, which would come from NT70 (since NT70 \u2192 t5). So, is NT69 producing t5? Looking at NT69's rules: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 and NT69 \u2192 NT5 NT45. So, NT69 can go to NT5 NT45. Now, does NT5 generate t5? Let's check NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49. NT1 \u2192 't24', so NT5 \u2192 't24' NT49. NT49's rules are: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 and NT49 \u2192 NT43 (I think I'm missing some rules, maybe NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 and NT46 NT68 or something else. Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66? Yes, from earlier entries: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo, NT49 produces two non-terminals. Wait, maybe I should make a list of all the non-terminals and their rules to better track this, but I don't have that here, so I need to proceed carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach with the string divided into two main parts, NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me first see what NT56 produces. Since NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, let's see what NT69 and NT44 produce.\n\nNT69: options are NT63 NT49 or NT5 NT45. NT5 is NT1 NT49, which is 't24' NT49. So, if NT69 takes the path NT5 NT45, then NT69 becomes 't24' (from NT5) and then NT45.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by recursively applying the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write out each step in terms of the grammar.\n\nLet's attempt that.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, S generates a string that starts with NT56 and then NT45. So, the overall string should be the concatenation of NT56's derived string and NT45's derived string.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must come from NT69 and NT44.\n\nNT69 can be NT63 NT49 or NT5 NT45.\n\nLet's consider the first alternative: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63's productions: NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nNT70 \u2192 't5', which is the first token in the string. So, if NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, then the first part would start with 't5' from NT70.\n\nWait, no: NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, so NT25 is a non-terminal, and NT70 is 't5'. So, when NT63 is expanded, it would produce the sequence of NT25 followed by 't5'. \n\nBut in our string, the first token is 't5', so that would correspond to NT70, which is a single terminal. So, perhaps NT70 is used directly. But NT70 is only a terminal, so to get 't5', it must be a result of NT70. So, for the first part, we have:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70 \u2192 something 't5'.\n\nBut NT25's rules are NT25 \u2192 't22' (I think from earlier entries, NT25 \u2192 't10' seems wrong. Wait, no, looking back: wait, in the grammar, NT25 actually has multiple productions: looking through, I see NT25 \u2192 't10'? Or was that NT22?\n\nWait, I think I'm making a confusion here. Let me re-express the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT25 has a rule: NT25 \u2192 't10' (I think earlier I said NT26 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 't29').\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT25 \u2192 't10', but in the provided rules:\n\nLooking through"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit because all rules are of two types: ones that produce two non-terminals and others that produce a terminal.

Let me scan through the rules and collect all terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT8 -> 't13'\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT36 -> 't25', 't70'\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT71 -> 't7'\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT3 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT50 -> 't3'\n- NT18 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't9'\n- NT68 -> 't3', 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT54 -> 't6'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT10 -> 't28'\n- NT36 -> 't25', 't70'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT50 -> 't20'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT49 -> 't15'\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT71 -> 't7'\n- NT20 -> 't34'\n- NT47 -> 't21'\n- NT26 -> 't4', 't29'\n- NT13 -> 't24'\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT15 -> 't10'\n- NT34 -> 't24'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n\nSo, compiling all the terminal symbols from the grammar:\n\nt1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t7, t9, t10, t13, t15, t17, t20, t21, t24, t25, t28, t29, t32, t33, t34, t45, t48, t49, t50, t56, t68.\n\nWait, from the rules, I don't see 't22', 't26', 't36', etc., as terminals. So, in the provided string, I have t9, which is present; t15, present; t17, present; t4, present; t5, present; t3, do we have that? Wait, in the rules, do any terminals have 't3'? Let me check. Wait, the grammar doesn't have any terminal production that goes to 't3'. Looking through the rules, I don't see 't3' as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking through all the rules again, do any of them produce 't3'? Let's see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't25', 't70'\n- NT3 -> NT68 NT46 \u2192 but that's a non-terminal, so 't3' is produced by NT3, which is a non-terminal. Is that allowed? Wait, no, because in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals. In this case, NT3 is a non-terminal, so it can't directly produce a terminal. Therefore, 't3' would not appear as a terminal in the string unless it's somehow generated indirectly, but I think the grammar doesn't have any production for a non-terminal that produces 't3' as a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see a rule like NT3 \u2192 't3'. Instead, NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, which means NT3 can only produce non-terminals, so it can't generate a terminal 't3' directly. Thus, if the provided string contains 't3', it's not possible unless it's derived from some other path, which seems unlikely. But looking at the string, there's a 't3' near the beginning. Let me check the string list again:\n\nThe string is: t9, t15, t17, t4, t5, t3, t4, t29, t4, t5, t3, t4, t29, t24, t4, t9, t24, t1, t25, t13, t34, t15, t29, t4.\n\nSo the string includes 't3' which is at position 5 and again at position 9. But wait, the grammar doesn't have any production that directly produces 't3' as a terminal. Therefore, 't3' would not appear in the string produced by this grammar. So that might already rule out the possibility, making the answer 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me look again at the rules: Do any non-terminals directly produce 't3'? For example, NT3 is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, so it can't produce a terminal. So 't3' can't appear in any derived string starting from S,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-434","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT22, NT61, etc.) that expand into other non-terminals or terminals (denoted by 't' followed by a number). Each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which makes sense for CNF because each production has exactly two non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t5 t17 t4 t33 t27 t34 t17 t4 t5 t17 t4 t29 t4 t10 t7 t36 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t4 t4`.\n\nI remember that in CNF grammars, it's often efficient to parse the string from the leaves up, using a method like CYK parsing. However, since I'm only supposed to give a yes or no, maybe there's a quicker way without going into full parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT8 -> 't13'\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT70 (multiple times in different productions)\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT50 -> 't3'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n\nEach of these non-terminals expands into a single terminal symbol except for the ones that are more complex, like S -> NT56 NT45. So, I can build a parse tree starting from S, which expands into NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me see if the string can be broken down into the expansions allowed by S.\n\nThe first part of the string is t5 t17 t4 t33 t27 ... Let me see which non-terminals expand into t5, t17, t4, etc.\n\n- t5 comes from NT56 and NT69 (since NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT56 is part of S's expansion).\nWait, actually, I should list the expansions that produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT70 -> t17\n- NT63 -> t9\n- NT45 -> t4\n- NT4 -> t37\n- NT28 -> t36\n- NT66 -> t6\n- NT70 -> t17 (multiple times)\n- NT71 -> t14\n- NT50 -> t3\n- NT69 -> t5\n- NT1 -> t24\n- NT25 -> t10\n- NT35 -> t9\n- NT9 comes from NT35, which is in the string as t9.\n\nWait, but let me try to see each step.\n\nSince S is the start symbol, it splits into NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT56 also could be NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56, but let's see the first parts.\n\nThe first symbol is t5. Looking at the grammar, 't5' comes from NT69 and NT56. Wait, NT56 leads to NT69 and NT44. But NT69 leads to 't5'. So, for the first symbol t5, we must have NT69 derived from somewhere.\n\nBut S starts with NT56, which goes to NT69 and NT44. So the first step would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo S's expansion starts with NT69 and NT44. But the first symbol in the string is 't5', which comes from NT69. That's good so far.\n\nThen, the next part is 't17', which can come from NT70.\n\nWait, but wait, after S \u2192 NT56 NT45, NT56 becomes NT69 and NT44. So the next step in the parse would have two parts: NT69 and NT44. Then, NT69 expands to 't5', and then the next symbol is 't17'.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 't5 t17 t4 t33...'. So after t5, we have t17. So after NT69 (which is 't5'), what comes next is NT44, which then must expand to t17. So let's check if NT44 can expand to t17.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT44 that directly leads to a terminal. Let me check the rules again:\n\nNT44 is mentioned in NT69's production (S-> NT69 NT54 or something? Wait, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT55 -> NT44 NT56\n- NT44 -> NT3 NT26\n- NT26 can lead to t4 or t29.\n\nSo, NT44 expands into NT3 and NT26. Let's see what happens:\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\n\nThen, NT3 can be part of other productions, such as:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\nNT68 -> 't3' as per the given rules.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT68 -> 't3' so t3 is one possibility. But in the string after t5, we have t17, which doesn't match t3. Alternatively, NT26 leads to t4 or t29. So let's see:\n\nNT26 can be 't4' (from the rule NT26 -> T4) or 't29' (from NT26 -> t29). But wait, looking back at the given rules, NT26 has two productions:\n\n- NT26 -> t4\n- NT26 -> t29\n\nSo, if NT26 is t4, then NT44 becomes NT3 and NT44 expands to t4 if NT26 is t4.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline the parse more clearly.\n\nThe string starts with 't5', which comes from NT69.\n\nAfter that, we have 't17'. So, after NT69 produces t5, the next part in the string is 't17', which must come from the expansion of NT44.\n\nSo, from NT44 -> NT3 NT26. Then, NT3 expands into something, and NT26 expands into something else.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT3 can expand into NT68 NT46, and NT68 -> 't3'.\n\nWait, but in the string after t5 and t17, we have t4, which doesn't correspond to 't3'. So perhaps that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the expansion.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo, S becomes NT69 NT44 NT45.\n\nNow, NT69 is 't5', so the next part is NT44.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nThen, NT3 -> NT68 NT46\n\nNT68 -> t3, which is a terminal. So 't3' would be the next symbol, but in the string after 't17' we have 't4', not t3. So that path doesn't continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT44 can expand differently, but according to the rules, NT44 only expands into NT3 and NT26, which don't lead directly to 't17'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT44 is part of S's expansion, but maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me try to see the entire expansion from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT45 (from the initial rule, NT45\u2192 NT56 NT45, but that's in the same production as S's initial expansion. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nThe initial S is S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nFrom S, it's NT56 on the left and NT45 on the right.\n\nThen NT56 expands to NT69 and NT44, so S becomes NT69 NT44 NT45.\n\nNow, NT44 expands to NT3 and NT26.\n\nThen, NT44 becomes NT3 NT26, so S is NT69 NT3 NT26 NT45.\n\nThen, NT69 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make things a bit easier because we can use standard parsing techniques like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can find another way without getting into that complexity.\n\nThe goal is to check if the string `t9 t15 t17 t4 t9 t0 t6 t3 t4 t25 t36 t10 t5 t36 t26 t17 t4 t33 t12 t28 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4` can be derived from the given grammar. Let me list out the productions and see how they can derive the terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backward from the highest symbol in the string. Looking at the string, the first symbol is 't9'. Let me check if there's a production that starts with 't9'. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9', so that could be a starting point. So, the first part of the string, 't9', comes from NT63.\n\nSo, t9 comes from NT63. Now, looking at the grammar, NT63 has the production NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT25 produces 't10' and NT70 \u2192 't17'. So, 't9' (NT63) -> 't10' (NT25) and 't17' (NT70). In the string, the next symbol after t9 is t15, so that seems a bit tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me structure this more clearly. The string starts with t9, then t15, t17, etc. So, the derivation would likely involve looking at how these terminals can be produced.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the beginning. So, the first symbol is t9. That must come from NT63, which is in the production NT63 \u2192 t9 NT25 (assuming NT63 has a production to t9 and NT25). Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT63's production is:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT63 is defined as NT25 NT70. But the symbols for NT25 and NT70 are not directly terminals for 't's. Instead, I need to look through the productions for NT25 and NT70 to see where they can derive 't's.\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking through the grammar, several NTs lead to 't's. For example, NT63 \u2192 t9 NT25, but then NT63's production is shown as NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70. Wait, no, actually, I need to clarify. Let me list out some of the productions for clarity.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT63 -> NT25 NT70 (from NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which is a production in the grammar)\nNT25 \u2192 t10\nNT70 \u2192 t17\n\nSo, NT63 can derive t10 and t17, but in our string, the first symbol is t9, not t10 or t17. Hmm, that's a conflict. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the productions. Let me look again. Oh, I see NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70 is one production, but I also see NT63 can be t9 via another production. Let me scan all productions for NT63:\n\nLooking back:\n\nYes, among the productions, I see:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70 (that's the definition in the grammar)\nNT63 \u2192 NT70 NT46? Wait, no, sorry, let me find NT63. From the provided grammar, I see several NTs but not directly NT63 with a production that has 't9' except let's check:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT63 is defined as NT25 NT70, but the t9 is from NT63 as part of another production?\n\nNo, looking through the grammar, I think all NTs are in the left-hand side of productions, and terminals are only on the right when they appear. Wait, no, in the given grammar, some NTs have productions that include terminals, like NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which is not a terminal because 't3' is a terminal, but they write it as NT35 -> NT42 NT3 (where 3 is a terminal). Wait, no, actually in the grammar provided, all the NTs on the RHS are NTs except some, like 't3' is a terminal. So to clarify, each production is either two NTs on the RHS or a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3: that would imply that NT35 can derive a terminal 't3' as well as combinations of NTs. So, in the given grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, for each symbol, I need to check if I can derive the given string step by step.\n\nLooking at the given string: t9 t15 t17 t4 t9 t0 t6 t3 t4 t25 t36 t10 t5 t36 t26 t17 t4 t33 t12 t28 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t9. So, I need to see if any production starts with t9. Looking through the grammar, the productions that lead to terminals are various NTs.\n\nFor example, NT69 \u2192 t5? Let me check: looking through the grammar, NT69's productions are:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, for example, NT56 \u2192 t33; NT39 \u2192 t21; NT26 \u2192 t4; wait, but t9 seems to be from NT63.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.\n\nBut then, in the string, the first symbol is t9. So how? Because NT63 can only produce t9 in another context.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given grammar, NT63's production includes a terminal only in one direction. Let me check each production for NT63:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t17\nNT69 \u2192 t5\nNT35 \u2192 t9\n\nWait, no, for example, NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which as a terminal is 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

The string is: `t9 t0 t6 t17 t4 t10 t7 t36 t29 t4 t5 t17 t4 t29 t24 t4 t9 t24 t24 t10 t7 t13 t6 t0 t6 t4`.\n\nFirst, I'm a bit rusty on how to approach this. I remember that since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two others, which might eventually become terminals.\n\nThe string starts with `t9`. Looking at the productions, `t9` corresponds to `NT39`: NT39 -> NT63 NT44. Wait, no, looking back, the productions are listed in the grammar. Let's check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking for `t9`, I remember that NT39 goes to `t21` and `t24` (since in the grammar, NT39: NT63 NT44 is not shown, but looking through the productions, I see that NT39 -> NT63 NT44 isn't there. Wait, let me re-read the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\nNT70 -> 't5'\n...\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n...\nLooking through, for example, NT69 -> NT63 NT49, which is 't5' (from the string). Wait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal productions to map them.\n\nWait, the grammar has several rules ending with terminals, like:\n\nNT70 -> 't5' (from line NT70 -> 't5')\nNT30 -> 't17' (from NT30)\nNT18 -> 't27' (from NT18)\nNT26 -> 't4' (from NT26)\nNT1 -> 't24'\nNT59 -> 't34' (from NT59)\nNT50 -> 't3' (from NT50)\nNT3 -> 't36' (from NT3)\nNT68 -> 't3' (from NT68)\nNT48 -> 't24' (from NT48)\nNT28 -> 't36' (from NT28)\nNT4 -> 't37' (from NT4)\nNT22 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't12'\nNT13 -> 't1'\nWait, let's cross-reference each terminal in the string with the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string starts with `t9`, so I need to find which NT produces 't9'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT39 -> NT63 NT44: Does this produce 't9'? Let me check NT63 and NT44. NT63 is in the grammar as NT63 -> 't9'. So NT63 produces 't9'.\n\nSo `t9` comes from NT63, which is part of NT39's production. Therefore, the first step in the derivation must have started with NT39 leading to NT63 NT44.\n\nSo first, NT39 is rewritten as NT63 NT44.\n\nNow, NT63 is 't9', so that's fine. Then NT44. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT44 directly, so perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, in the grammar list, I see:\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT44. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for '44' in the nodes: Yes, line NT55 -> NT44 NT56\n\nBut that leads to NT44, but NT44 is not a terminal. So NT44 must be further expanded. Let's see the productions for NT44.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there any NT44? It seems not. Because in the list, I see lines like NT55 -> NT44 NT56, NT54 -> NT6 NT45, etc.\n\nSo perhaps NT44 is produced by some other non-terminal. Wait, no, NT44 is a non-terminal and must be derived. So the production chain starts with NT44, which must be expanded into two other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT44, so perhaps NT44 is actually a terminal. Wait, but I should double-check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for NT? I don't see any NT rule ending with '44'. So perhaps NT44 must be further broken down. Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the initial step, NT39 leads to NT63 NT44. NT63 is a terminal 't9'. But NT44 must also be a terminal or derived from some non-terminal.\n\nSo, looking for NT44 in the grammar: In the list, I don't see NT44 -> anything. So perhaps NT44 must be broken down further. Thus, NT44 must have a production that leads to two non-terminals. But without seeing that, maybe NT44 is a terminal, but in the given grammar, no NT is '44'. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe NT44 is the same as NT45, or perhaps I have to re-examine the grammar. Let's check all productions starting with NT4... For example:\n\nNT44: I don't see any rule where NT44 is the left-hand side. Only NT55 -> NT44 NT56, so NT44 must themselves be a non-terminal. So NT44 must be expanded into two non-terminals. So for NT44, perhaps there is a production I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me go through the grammar line by line to find NT44.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions:\n\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n- NT35 -> NT42 NT3\n- NT70 -> 't5'\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT61 -> NT34 NT8\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n- NT53 -> NT42 NT35 (Wait, I don't see NT53's production)\n- NT54 -> NT6 NT45\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT26\n- NT61 -> NT18 NT59\n- NT21 -> NT49 NT31\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT36\n- NT8 -> NT45 NT5 (Wait: NT8 is 't13')\n- NT50 -> NT25 NT8\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45\n- NT49 -> NT22 NT66\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT26 (Wait: NT68 is 't3')\n- NT48 -> NT25 NT39\n- NT3 -> NT68 NT46 (So NT3 is 't36')\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT49\n- NT36 -> NT47 NT20\n- NT47 -> NT7 NT21\n- NT42 -> NT46 NT68\n- NT71 -> NT69 NT35\n- NT31 -> NT4 NT50\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45 (Wait: I thought NT55 was in CNF, but is there another rule for it? So NT55 has two productions: NT55 -> NT56 NT45 and NT55 -> NT44 NT56. So NT55 can be either NT56 NT45 or NT44 NT56.\n\nSo for NT44, since it's a non-terminal, it must have a production like A -> BC. But I don't find any NT44 in the list, unless it's part of some other expansion. Wait, perhaps NT44 is the same as NT45, but looking further, NT45 is in multiple productions. So without a production for NT44, I might be stuck here. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, maybe NT44 refers to NT44 itself, but no. Hmm. Let's try another approach.\n\nWait, another possibility is that I might have misread the grammar rules. For example, let's see the full list again.\n\nLooking for NT44, perhaps I'm not seeing it because it's part of another rule. Wait, let's see line by line:\n\nAll NT rules:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\nNT48 -> NT25 NT39\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is \"t9 t0 t6 t36 t4 t4 t5 t36 t10 t7 t3 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4 t33 t32 t34 t29 t4 t29 t4\", and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the structure of the grammar. Looking at the productions, every non-terminal on the left is split into two non-terminals on the right, except when they produce terminals like 't9' or 't5'. So, the starting symbol is S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must be generated by expanding NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me break down the string. It starts with 't9 t0 t6 ...'. I know from the grammar that NT56 can produce either 't33' (since NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and NT69 \u2192 't5', NT44 \u2192 't33'), or through other routes. Wait, looking at NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9', and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, which is 't22' and NT66 \u2192 't6'. So NT49 is 't22 t6'. Therefore, NT69 is 't9 t22 t6', and NT44 is 't33' (from NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 and then other terminals). Wait, maybe I should track this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar, working from the start symbol S and trying to match each part. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation corresponds to a leftmost parsing strategy.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens, so the parse tree must have a structure that, when flattened, results in these 27 tokens. Each production splits into two, so the number of symbols should double each time we apply a production. But given the terminals and non-terminals, it's tricky.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't9'. Let's see which NT produces 't9'. From the grammar, NT70 \u2192 't17', NT69 \u2192 't5', NT63 \u2192 't9', NT21 \u2192 't13', NT8 \u2192 't13', NT1 \u2192 't24', NT34 \u2192 't24', NT2 \u2192 't12', NT13 \u2192 't24', NT28 \u2192 't36', NT36 \u2192 't25', etc.\n\nLooking at NT56: it can produce 't33' (if NT44 is 't33'), or via NT69 NT44. Wait, let me think again.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. From the grammar:\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (from production NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49). NT63 is 't9'. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 (from NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66), and NT66 \u2192 't6'. So NT49 is 't22 t6', making NT69 't9 t22 t6'. However, wait, in CNF, each production must split into exactly two symbols. So maybe I'm misunderstanding NT69 and NT44.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is splits into exactly two symbols. So let me re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (two non-terminals), which could then be broken down further if they have productions that don't produce terminals. So NT63 is 't9' (since NT63 \u2192 't9'), and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 can be NT21 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if each token can be matched by a terminal produced by a non-terminal in the grammar, and then check how the leftmost symbols can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the string as the leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first two symbols must come from the leftmost NT56 and the left NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't9'. So NT56 must produce the first 't9'. If NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, then NT69 would produce 't9' and NT44 would come next. Wait, but NT69 is a non-terminal, so that can't be. Alternatively, NT56 could directly produce 't33' if there's a production like NT56 \u2192 t33, but looking back at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT56 directly produces a terminal except through longer chains.\n\nWait, perhaps NT56 can go through other productions. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions from NT56, the only one is NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. No terminal is directly produced. So from NT56, the first token must come from NT69 or NT44. So NT69 must produce 't9', which is possible because NT63 is 't9'. So NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, which means NT63 is 't9', so the first token 't9' is from NT63. Then, NT49 must produce the next part. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT56 producing 't33', which is 't33' from NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and then NT44 produces 't33'... Wait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look at each non-terminal and map which terminals they can produce. For example:\n\nNT56 can produce:\n- 't33' if NT44 produces 't33'. But NT44 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. NT3 can produce things, but maybe it can lead to terminals. Let me check NT3.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46. NT68 \u2192 't3', and NT46 \u2192 't4'. So NT3 -> t3 t4. Therefore, if NT3 is on the left, it can produce 't3 t4'. But does any non-terminal directly produce a terminal? Yes, some do.\n\nLooking at NT70 \u2192 't17', NT49 \u2192 't22 t6' (from NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 and NT66 \u2192 't6'), NT45 \u2192 't4', NT21 \u2192 't13', etc.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to see if the string can be split into segments corresponding to the productions.\n\nThe string is: t9 t0 t6 t36 t4 t4 t5 t36 t10 t7 t3 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4 t33 t32 t34 t29 t4 t29 t4.\n\nI notice the string ends with multiple 't4's, which could come from productions that generate 't4's. For example, NT28 \u2192 't36', NT66 \u2192 't6', NT47 \u2192 't21', etc. Maybe the last few t4's come from branches where NT22 or another NT produces t4.\n\nAnother approach is to start from the beginning and see if I can find a chain.\n\nFirst token is t9. Which NT can produce t9? NT63 \u2192 t9, and also any NT that can derive to t9. Looking at NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and since NT63 is t9, so if NT69 is on the left, it can contribute t9.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the start production: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first part is NT56, which must derive to the first token, which is t9.\n\nBut NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So the first part must derive to t9, so NT69 must produce t9, which comes from NT63 as part of NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So that part is t9, then after that comes NT44 from NT56.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be t9 and the next part from NT44. But the string after t9 is t0. So t0 is the second token. But NT56's NT69 is t9, so the second token comes from NT44.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-479","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, so I'll need to analyze how each t-number is generated by the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. It's a collection of production rules where each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right. That means it's a binary tree structure, and each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two. Since the provided string is quite long, I'm going to need to parse it step by step, replacing non-terminals with their expansions until I reach the terminals.\n\nLet me start by writing down the string: `t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t36 t10 t5 t3 t4 t4 t10 t7 t17 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t29 t4 t4`.\n\nI notice that the string is all terminals, so the derivation path would replace each non-terminal step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nI need to map each symbol in the string to the appropriate production. For example, t9 might correspond to a production like NT9 -> some combination that ends with t9. I'll need to look through the production rules to see how each t-number is generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a variety of non-terminals, like S, NT22, NT63, etc. Each of these non-terminals has productions that split into two other non-terminals.\n\nLet me pick one t9 and see which NT it comes from. Looking through the rules, for instance, NT25 has a production NT25 -> NT10. Also, NT35 -> NT8 and NT3.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules. Looking for where t9 appears. For example, NT35 -> NT8 NT3. And in the rules, NT35 is said to go to NT42 NT3. Hmm, maybe I should map each symbol.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start with the leftmost symbol t9. Let me see which NT can generate t9.\n\nLooking through NT63: has a rule NT63 -> NT25 NT70. Similarly, NT70 -> t17. So NT63 can generate t25 and t17.\n\nWait, but t25 isn't in the string. Hmm, alternatively, maybe NT25 has a production. Let's check NT25: Its production is NT25 -> NT10, but no, wait, NT25's production is not given here. Wait, looking through the provided rules, I see NT25 -> NT10. So does NT10 have a production that leads to something else? Wait, looking through the rules, NT10's production isn't provided in the initial list. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the provided rules are all the production rules, so if I can't find NT25's production, maybe I'm mistaken. Wait, in the grammar, under NT25, looking at the provided rules, I see NT25 -> NT10. So then NT10's production isn't listed; perhaps NT10 is a terminal. But looking at the string, there's a t10, which would correspond to a non-terminal NT10. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree. Since it's a CFG in Chomsky normal form, each production has two symbols on the right. So the string can be viewed as a series of leaves in a binary tree.\n\nBut since the string is a series of t's and numbers, I need to see for each number, which non-terminal it's derived from, starting from the root.\n\nWait, the grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So S -> NT56 NT45. Then each of those NTs would produce other NTs, until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of t symbols, so we're dealing with the lowest level of the derivation, after all non-terminals have been expanded to terminals.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct possible derivations.\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT56 NT45. Then each of these NT56 and NT45 would need to expand to generate the corresponding t symbols.\n\nLooking at NT56: Its production is NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So NT56 would split into NT69 and NT44.\n\nLooking at NT44: The production is NT44 -> NT3 NT26. So NT44 would split into NT3 and NT26.\n\nContinuing with NT3: From the rules, NT3 has a production NT3 -> NT68 NT46.\n\nNT46 -> NT7 NT21. So NT46 splits into NT7 and NT21.\n\nNT21 -> NT49 NT31. NT7 -> NT13 NT36; NT31 -> NT4 NT50.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step using a top-down parsing method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string is a concatenation of expansions of some NTs. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with two t9s, so maybe two copies of the same subtree. Let me look for where t9 could come from.\n\nt9 could be generated by a subtree where a non-terminal expands to something ending with t9. Looking at the production rules, perhaps NT69 -> NT63 NT44. Then NT63 has a production NT63 -> NT25 NT70. NT70 -> t17. NT25 -> NT10, which we saw earlier.\n\nWait, not matching. Alternatively, maybe NT9 is something else.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, maybe NT35 -> NT8 NT3. NT8 -> t13, and NT3 -> NT4 NT46, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the t numbers. t9 appears at the 2nd and 13th positions, which are symmetrical, so perhaps they are from the same NT.\n\nLooking at the first t9: Where does it come from? Let's see:\n\nIf I look for the production that ends with t9. For example, NT63 -> NT25 NT70. NT63 would produce two non-terminals. So if someone needs to get a t9, maybe it's part of a longer production chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t9 is generated by multiple steps. Let me map the sequence.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to check each t number and see if there's a path from the root to that t.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a series of transitions. The string is a sequence of t's; each t is a terminal, so each should be derivable from a single non-terminal. So each t must be the last symbol in the expansion of some NT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each t corresponds to a specific NT. For example, t9 could be produced by NT25, as in S -> NT56 NT45 -> NT56 (expands to something ending with t9) and NT45 (expands to something ending with t9).\n\nWait, let's try that:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45.\n\nIf NT56 expands to ... and ends with t9, and NT45 also ends with t9, then the string starts with t9 t9, that could make sense.\n\nSo let's explore NT45.\n\nLooking at NT45: Its production is NT45 -> NT22 NT26. So NT45 splits into NT22 and NT26.\n\nNT26 can be either NT36 or NT29, but looking at the string, there are t26 terms\u2014 no, wait, the string has t29, but not t26.\n\nWait, the string has t29, but no t26, so perhaps that's not the case. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the string includes t10, t21, t6, etc. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for patterns in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be broken down into tokens that correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which can parse strings for CFGs. But that might take a while, given the string's length.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for possible leftmost derivations.\n\nStarting with S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT45 -> NT22 NT26.\n\nThen, NT69 -> NT63 NT44.\n\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26.\n\nContinuing, this is too lengthy. Maybe it's better to look for any possible loop or contradiction. But perhaps it's easier to note that the number of symbols must match the derivation steps.\n\nWait, the string has 26 symbols. Let's count the number of non-terminals in the start. Each step, NTs split into two more, so the number of NTs in the parse tree would"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t3 t4 t33 t24 t4 t24 t9 t24 t6 t33 t32 t34 t4 t9 t15 t36 t4 t4 t29 t29 t4`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the productions go from S down to various non-terminals, each expanding into two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nMy goal is to see if the given string can be derived starting from S using these production rules. To do that, I can attempt to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is given, I might need to reverse-engineer the derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would help, but with 27 tokens, that's quite long. Maybe another approach is to represent the grammar as a set of non-terminals and their productions, and see how the string can be broken down into those production steps.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals: t5, t36, t25, t3, etc. Each of these seems to correspond to a single terminal in the grammar. So, I'll go through each token in the string and try to see how they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to process the string step by step, starting from the beginning, trying to match the productions that lead to these terminals.\n\nLet me begin:\n\n1. The first token is t5. Looking at the grammar, where does t5 come from? Checking all the productions for terminals, I see that NT70 \u2192 't7', but that's not matching.

Wait, let me check each terminal.\n\nI'll list each terminal symbol in the string and see where they come from:\n\nt5: Looking through the grammar, I see NT45 \u2192 't4' (from NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, which produces t4.

So the string starts with NT63's production.\n\nLooking at NT63: in the grammar, NT63 \u2192 't3'?\n\nWait, looking:\n\nYes, I see that NT36 \u2192 't25' is one option.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT36 has a production of NT25 NT70, which further splits into 't10' and 't7', but that's not a 't' terminal. Alternatively, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a concatenation of t-s, each being a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but given that the grammar is small, maybe I can proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, each word must come from a production, possibly preceded by other productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should attempt step-by-step.\n\nFirst, the string is: t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t3 t4 t33 t24 t4 t24 t9 t24 t6 t33 t32 t34 t4 t9 t15 t36 t4 t4 t29 t29 t4.\n\nLet me list them as a list for ease of reference.\n\nI need to see if this can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: t5.\n\nWhich NT produces t5?

{"custom_id":"request-498","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if this string is generated by the given grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. My string has a bunch of 't' symbols followed by numbers, like 't9', 't15', etc. \n\nFirst, I think I need to parse the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules. The string is: `t9 t15 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t24 t25 t13 t34 t36 t24 t10 t5 t13 t6 t3 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t4 t4 t33 t29 t4`.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S -> NT56 NT45, the string must start with two symbols that can derive to t9 and t15. Let me look at the productions for NT56 and NT45. \n\nLooking at NT56: It has productions like NT69 NT44, NT55 NT45, etc. And NT45 is in the grammar as NT25 NT39. So if S is NT56 and NT45, then each of those needs to derive to a string starting with t9 and t15 respectively.\n\nWait, no. Because S is NT56 NT45. Each NT... would derive to a sequence of 't's. So the entire string would be a series of t's. But looking at my string, it starts with t9, which is a terminal, so it must come from a production that directly has 't9'. Let's check the NT56 productions. \n\nLooking at NT56: The productions include NT69 NT44 and NT55 NT45. Also, looking at the terminals, NT69 is 't5' and NT44 has entries like NT3 NT26. Wait, but the string starts with t9, which is 't9'. Looking at all the non-terminals, I see NT35 -> NT42 NT3, and NT70 -> 't7', but I don't see any NT that directly gives 't9'. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the NT entries again. Oh, NT35 has NT42 NT3. NT42 is in the grammar: NT42 -> NT46 NT68. NT68 is 't3'. So NT42 would be something like NT46 NT68, which then becomes t3, etc. Hmm, maybe 't9' comes from NT35. But wait, NT35 -> NT42 NT3. So does that mean NT35 would derive a string like t3 followed by something else? But the string starts with t9, which is 't9'. \n\nWait, let's look for all NTs that directly produce a terminal. For example, NT63 -> 't9', NT69 -> 't5', NT6 -> 't1', and so on. So if I have an NT that can produce 't9', that would be useful. Looking at the NT entries, NT63 is 't9', so if an NT can derive to NT63, that's t9. Similarly, NT34 -> 't24', etc.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't9', which would mean the leftmost NT must be NT63. So let's see if NT56 can derive to something that starts with NT63.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions: NT56 -> NT69 NT44, NT55 NT45, etc. Let's take NT56 -> NT69 NT44. NT69 is 't5' as well, but that doesn't help since the string starts with t9. Alternatively, if NT56 can produce something that starts with NT63 NT..., but I don't see a direct production for NT56 leading to NT63.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to parse the string from the right using the grammar, starting from S. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: 't9 t15 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t24 t25 t13 t34 t36 t24 t10 t5 ...'. Let's see, 't9' comes from NT63, 't15' comes from NT50 perhaps? Wait, NT50 is 't3', but t15 is 't15', which is not a terminal. Oh, wait, 't15' must come from an NT production that leads to it. Let's check the NTs again.\n\nLooking at the NT entries, I see NT45: 't4' and NT25: 't28', NT7: 't13', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: Each production is a combination of two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So the string must be a concatenation of terminals resulting from such productions. \n\nLet me list out all the NTs that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT34 -> 't24'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT36 -> 't25' (in one production)\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT50 -> 't3' for some productions but 't5' for another?\nWait, NT50 has two productions: NT55 NT8 and NT25 NT4. So NT50 can produce 't25' and 't4', or something else?\n\nWait, maybe I need to list all NTs that directly produce a terminal:\n\nLet me go through each NT in the grammar:\n\n1. NT63 -> t9\n2. NT69 -> t5\n3. NT34 -> t24\n4. NT68 -> t3\n5. NT36 -> t25 (in one production)\n6. NT25 -> t10\n7. NT45 -> t4\n8. NT1 -> t24\n9. NT59 -> t34\n10. NT50 -> t3 and t5? Wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, the grammar includes lines like NT50 -> NT25 NT8 and NT55 NT4. So NT50 can't produce t5 directly. But looking for NTs that directly produce a terminal. Hmm:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- NT63: 't9' \u2705\n- NT69: 't5' \u2705\n- NT25: 't10' \u2705\n- NT45: 't4' \u2705\n- NT34: 't24' \u2705\n- NT68: 't3' \u2705\n- NT36: 't25' \u2705\n- NT25: 't10' \u2705\n- And others? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT7 -> 13 and 36: 't13' and 't25' \u2705\n- NT13 -> t13 \u2705\n- NT35 -> 't9' \u2705 (Wait, no: NT35 is producing NT42 and NT3, which derive to more NTs, except looking at the production list, I don't see NT35 directly producing a terminal. Wait, wait: NT35 is in one production as NT42 NT3. So NT35 would produce something that eventually goes to NT42 and NT3, which themselves may derive to more NTs. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, NT35's production is ND35 -> NT42 NT3. NT42 is NT46 NT68, which is 't3' and 't3'. So NT35 -> NT42 NT3 -> (t3) (NT46? Wait, NT46 is 't4'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT63 -> 't9', then the next is t15, which would come from NT50, but NT50's productions don't produce 't15' directly. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet me try to parse the string piece by piece.\n\nThe string is: t9 t15 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t24 t25 t13 t34 t36 t24 t10 t5 t13 t6 t3 t4 t4 t4 t33 t29 t4.\n\nLet me list the terminals in order: 9,15,17,4,36,29,4,24,25,13,34"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-494","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure this out step by step. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing, and it constrains how the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that the start symbol is S. The first rule is S -> NT56 NT45, which means the start symbol will produce two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. So, the initial step is generating a combination of these two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: 't5 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t29 t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t4 t33 t4 t24 t26 t7 t17 t6 t3 t4 t4'.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, each part of this string is either a non-terminal that eventually produces this terminal through a series of expansions or it's an immediate production.\n\nSince all terminals must be expanded directly, the only way a string can be generated is if every terminal symbol in the string matches the rules of the grammar. That is, each 'tX' must be produced directly by some production rule ending with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are rules where each non-terminal produces two non-terminals or a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT20 -> 't34', but wait, that's a non-terminal producing a terminal? Wait, no, NT20 -> 't28' is stated in the rules. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see NT20 -> 't28'. So NT20 produces 't28', but in the string, I don't see 't28' appearing. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the initial rule is S -> NT56 NT45. So each of these NTs will produce their children until they reach terminals.\n\nLet me list down the terminals present in the string:\n\nt5, t17, t4, t36, t29, t4, t29, t9, t9, t10, t21, t6, t36, t25, t3, t4, t4, t4, t33, t4, t24, t26, t7, t17, t6, t3, t4, t4.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these to see if there's a production rule that directly produces them. That is, does each 'tX' exist as a terminal in some NT rule on the right-hand side?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17' (Yes, t17 exists)\n- NT56 -> 't9' (Yes)\n- NT45 -> 't4' (Yes)\n- NT35 -> 't9' (Yes)\n- NT7 -> 't13' (Wait, t13 is not in the string. Wait, in the string, I see t21, t17, etc. Let me check each occurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's check each 'tX' in the string against the grammar rules to see if it exists as a terminal in any production.\n\nLooking at the given rules, the terminals present are:\n\nt9, t5, t17, t4, t29, t36, t25, t3, t44, t6, t28, etc. From the rules:\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal terms.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT70 -> 't17' \u2192 yes\nNT69 -> 't5' \u2192 yes\nNT50 -> 't3' \u2192 yes\nNT20 -> 't28' \u2192 yes\nNT25 -> 't10' \u2192 yes\nNT18 -> 't32' \u2192 yes\nNT34 -> 't24' \u2192 yes\nNT68 -> 't3' \u2192 yes\nNT26 -> 't4' \u2192 yes (Multiple times)\nNT61 -> 't27' \u2192 yes (Wait, t27? Wait, I don't see t27 in the string. Let's check the string again: no t27, so that would be a problem. Wait, but in the rules, NT61 -> 't27'? I should check if 't27' is present in the string.\n\nWait, in the string, let's list all the t's:\n\nt5, t17, t4, t36, t29, t4, t29, t9, t9, t10, t21, t6, t36, t25, t3, t4, t4, t4, t33, t4, t24, t26, t7, t17, t6, t3, t4, t4.\n\nI don't see 't27' in the string. But in the grammar, NT61 -> 't27'. So, any occurrence of t27 in the string would require that rule. Since the string doesn't have 't27', does that mean the string is invalid?\n\nWait, but let's check the string again. Wait, looking through the string, I see t21, t26, t7, etc. But no t27. So, if any 't27' comes up, the grammar can't produce it, but the string has t21, t26, etc. So unless t27 is generated through some other means, like via NTs that expand into it, but in this string, it's not present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string uses a production where 't27' is part of a non-terminal, but that's not an option here because the string only has 'tX' as terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each 'tX' must be directly produced by a production. So for the string to be in the language, every 'tX' in the string must be a terminal that has a production rule ending with that 'tX'. \n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nThe terminals present are:\n\nt5, t17, t4, t36, t29, t3, t9, t25, t4, t6, t28, t10, t32, t24, t26, t7, t13, t21, t34.\n\nWait, in the string, the terminals are t5, t17, t4, t36, t29, t4, t29, t9, t9, t10, t21, t6, t36, t25, t3, t4, t4, t4, t33, t4, t24, t26, t7, t17, t6, t3, t4, t4.\n\nWait, t33: is that a terminal in any production? Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT33. Wait, in the rules, is there any production that ends with 't33'? Looking through the given rules, I don't see that. So if the string has t33, but the grammar doesn't have a rule for t33, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, so let's check if each 't' in the string is present as a terminal in the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list all 'tX's in the string and check each:\n\nt5: Yes, NT70 -> t17; Wait, no, t5 is from NT69 -> t5. So t5 is present.\n\nt17: Yes, NT70 -> t17.\n\nt4: Yes, multiple places.\n\nt36: NT61 -> t27 is present, but that's a different t. Wait, no, NT61 -> t27, which would produce t27, but in the string, I see t36 and t26.\n\nWait, in the string, t36 occurs. So, is there a rule where a non-terminal expands to 't36'?

{"custom_id":"request-519","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and a single terminal or non-terminal on the right. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t36 t4 t4 t24 t24 t26 t15 t37 t10 t13 t6 t15 t37 t3 t6 t17 t4 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that CNF grammars are useful for parsing with algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, manually applying the parsing steps might be error-prone, so perhaps looking for specific patterns or trying to decompose the string step by step.\n\nEach production rule starts with a capital letter, and the terminals are 't' followed by numbers. The non-terminals are labeled NT followed by numbers or are 'S'. Since the grammar doesn't directly produce terminals except those with letters 't', the decompositions will involve non-terminals until we reach these 't' terminals.\n\nI notice the string starts with `t5`, which corresponds to the production rule `NT70 -> 't5'`. So, I'll start by replacing the first `t5` with NT70.\n\nNow, the remaining string after `t5` is `t36 t4 t4 t24 t24 t26 t15 t37 t10 t13 t6 t15 t37 t3 t6 t17 t4 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4`, which is 28 tokens long.\n\nLooking at the initial part, after `t5`, the next terminal is `t36`. I'll check the productions for NT36. From the grammar, NT36 has two rules: `NT36 -> NT25 NT70` and `NT36 -> NT47 NT20`. I'll pick the first one, replacing `t36` with NT36, which expands into NT25 and NT70.\n\nNow, the string becomes `t36 t4 ... t3 ...`, which comes from NT25 and NT70.\n\nWait, actually, each step involves replacing a terminal with a non-terminal, and that non-terminal can be expanded further. It's a bit complex without parsing step-by-step, so maybe I should construct possible derivations or check if all terminals can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the string as a sequence of terminal symbols and see if they form a valid parse tree according to the grammar. However, doing this manually would take a lot of time.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar by following the productions. Each 't' corresponds to a specific non-terminal, so I can map each 't' to its associated non-terminal.\n\nFor example:\n- `t5` comes from NT70\n- `t36` comes from NT36\n- `t4` comes from various NTs like NT4, NT10, etc.\n\nSo, the string can be broken down into a sequence of non-terminals, each expanded step by step until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nI can try to reverse engineer the string by starting from the end and seeing if each terminal can be matched.\n\nStarting from the end of the string:\n- The last few tokens are `t3 t4 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4`.\n- Let's see which non-terminals can produce these. For instance, `t3` could be NT3 or another rule, but looking at the productions with 't3', I see NT36 -> ... which includes `t3` in the string. Wait, the productions for 't3' might be in NT36.\n\nWait, looking back, the string has a `t3` earlier. It might help to map each `t` to which NT it comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, each terminal has exactly one production. For example, `NT70 -> 't5'`, `NT36 -> 't3'`, etc. So, each `tN` corresponds directly to a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the string can be represented as a sequence of these NTs:\n\nt5 (NT70) t36 (NT36) t4 (say NT4) t4 (NT4) t24 (NT24) t24 (NT24) t26 (NT26) t15 (NT15) t37 (NT37) t10 (NT10) t13 (NT13) t6 (NT6) t15 (NT15) t37 (NT37) t3 (NT3) t6 (NT6) t17 (NT17) t4 (NT4) t36 (NT36) t26 (NT26) t3 (NT3) t4 (NT4) t4 (NT4) t4 (NT4) t5 (NT70) t3 (NT3) t4 (NT4) t4 (NT4) t4 (NT4).\n\nWait, but each `tN` directly maps to a specific NT. For example, `t5` is NT70, `t36` is NT36, `t4` could be multiple NTs like NT4, NT10, NT22, etc.\n\nSo, the problem is that `t4` is ambiguous because multiple NTs can produce 't4'. Therefore, the parsing could branch into different possibilities.\n\nTo determine if the string is valid, we need to check if there exists at least one parse tree that generates the string.\n\nGiven the length of the string, which is 40 symbols (including the initial `t5`), and the way the grammar is structured, it might be feasible to find a valid derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of a right-linear or left-linear grammar, but since it's CNF, it's strictly context-free with each production having two non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into a hierarchy that fits the productions. For example, starting from the start symbol S, which is NT56 \u2192 NT56 followed by NT45. Wait, no, looking again: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Let me check the grammar: Yes, S is defined as `S -> NT56 NT45`. So, each S derivation starts with NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, the entire string must be a combination of the expansions from NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are `t5 t36 t4 t4`. Let's see how that could be formed.\n\nFrom NT56 and NT45. Let's consider NT56 and NT45 separately.\n\nNT56 has productions like NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and so on. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT56 is not directly defined, but S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so NT56 and NT45 will be part of the expansion.\n\nLet me try to see what expansions NT56 and NT45 could produce.\n\nStarting with NT56:\n\nLooking at the productions from NT56, I don't see any direct rules listed, but maybe NT56 is a non-terminal that can be broken down further. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nLooking back: The grammar is defined as a series of productions. For example:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT55 -> NT44 NT56\n...\nWait, I think I need to reconstruct the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT56 NT45. Then, looking at NT56, it's defined as NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Similarly, NT54 -> NT6 NT45. So, I think the grammar can be broken down as:\n\nThe start symbol S splits into NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT56 and the expansion of NT45.\n\nTherefore, the string should first expand NT56, followed by NT45's expansion.\n\nLooking at the initial part of the string, `t5 t36 t4 t4 t24 t24 t26 t15 ...`, I can check if the beginning of this part matches the expansion of NT56.\n\nWait, but no, because NT56 is a non-terminal that can expand into other non-terminals, which in turn expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a production from NT56, which starts with `t5`.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT70 is defined as `NT70 -> 't5'`. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT56 production leads to NT69 and NT44. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT69 (from the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-517","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. The grammar given seems to be in CNF because every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or the last rule with S \u2192 something terminal. Wait, actually, S seems to produce NT56 and NT45, which are non-terminals. Then there's a chain of productions leading to the terminal symbols 't' and numbers. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's and numbers: t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t36 t24 t10 t7 t15 t37 t10 t4 t24 t0 t6 t6 t17 t4 t4 t25 t36 t26 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4. It looks like every symbol is a terminal except for the non-terminals like NT56, NT22, etc. So my task is to parse this string according to the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if the string can be broken down into the symbols of the grammar, starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or maybe apply the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. However, since the grammar is quite large with many non-terminals, manual parsing might be tedious.\n\nLet me see how the start symbol S is defined: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the first two symbols generated must be NT56 and NT45. Looking at the string, the first two symbols are t9 and t9. Wait, but t9 is a terminal. But in the grammar, t9 is a production rule, not a terminal. Let me check the grammar. Looking back, I see a rule: NT70 \u2192 't5'. But I don't see 't9' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the grammar structure.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the non-terminals lead to terminals. So some of the rules, like NT70 \u2192 't7' or NT70 \u2192 't17', so t7 and t17 are terminals. Similarly, other non-terminals produce terminals or other non-terminals. So 't9' would be a terminal if there's a rule NTsomething \u2192 't9'. Looking through the grammar, for example, NT69 \u2192 't5' is a rule, but I don't see a rule that produces 't9'. Hmm, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The grammar's rules have some like NT68 \u2192 't6', NT36 \u2192 't25', NT70 \u2192 't17', etc. So the terminals in the grammar are things like 't9', 't10', etc. But in the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't9'. Let me scan through all the rules.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't7' and 't17'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4' and others\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' and 't6'\n\nWait, hold on. There's a rule NT63 \u2192 't9'. So in this case, 't9' is a terminal because it's produced by NT63. Similarly, 't10' must be produced by some other non-terminal. Looking through, I see NT21 \u2192 't13' and others. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify if 't9' is a terminal or not. If there's a production rule that has 't9' on the right-hand side, then it's a terminal. Looking back, the rules include NT63 \u2192 't9', which means that when NT63 is expanded, it directly produces 't9'. Therefore, 't9' is a terminal because it's a production of a non-terminal, so 't9' is a terminal in the string.\n\nSo the string starts with t9 t9 t10 t21..., which would correspond to terminals if those are the terminals in the grammar. But wait, 't9' is produced by NT63. So in the string, when we see 't9', it's considered a terminal if NT63 can produce 't9'. So to parse the string, I need to see if the entire string can be broken down into the symbols (non-terminals) that expand into the given string.\n\nGiven that, let's start from the start symbol S, which is NT56 NT45. So the first two symbols in the string must come from the expansion of NT56 and NT45, respectively. Looking at the string, the first two symbols are t9 and t9. So, for this to be correct, NT56 must produce 't9' in the first position, and NT45 must produce 't9' in the second position.\n\nLooking up the production rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 or NT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, let me see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 is a non-terminal that when expanded, gives NT69 and NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 't5' according to the rule NT69 \u2192 't5'. So the first symbol after NT56 would be 't5'. But the first symbol in the string is t9. So that doesn't fit because NT56 would expand to 't5' as the first symbol, but the string starts with t9.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the string, the first two symbols are t9 and t9, but S \u2192 NT56 NT45 would require NT56 to produce the first symbol as t5, but the string starts with t9. Therefore, this suggests that either the string is invalid, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the grammar ever produces 't9' as a terminal. Looking back, NT70 \u2192 't7' and 't17', NT69 \u2192 't5', NT63 \u2192 't9', and others. So 't9' comes directly from NT63. So, perhaps the string starts with NT63, but how?\n\nWait, no. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is a non-terminal that produces NT56 and NT45. So the first symbol in the expansion must be the first part of S, which is NT56, and then the second part is NT45.\n\nSo, if NT56 starts with 't5' (from NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 \u2192 't5' and ...), then the string can't start with 't9'. Therefore, perhaps the string isn't in the language. But that seems too quick. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait another thought: maybe NT21 \u2192 't13', which is a terminal. Also, looking through the rules, I can see that NT9 isn't mentioned, but I don't think any non-terminals directly produce 't9' except NT63. So, for the string to start with t9, the first symbol must come from NT63. But how can that happen when the start symbol is S, which expands to NT56 and NT45. So, unless somehow NT56 and NT45 can both produce 't9', but looking at their production rules, NT56 starts with NT69 NT44, which would produce 't5' first. So, I don't see how the first symbol can be 't9'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe I need to consider that S expands to NT56 NT45. So, in the first step of the expansion, the string would be constructed as NT56's expansion followed by NT45's expansion. So, if NT56 can produce 't9' as its first symbol and NT45 can produce the rest, then maybe that's possible. But let me check NT56's production.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 't5'. So the first symbol is 't5', not 't9'. Therefore, the first symbol in the string can't be 't9' because S's expansion starts with 't5'. Therefore, the given string starts with 't9', which is the first symbol. So, unless S can expand differently, but according to the grammar, S can only expand into NT56 NT45, and NT56's expansion doesn't allow producing 't9' as the first symbol.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with t9, which cannot be generated by NT56, which produces the first symbol as 't5'.

The string is `t5 t36 t24 t24 t25 t15 t37 t3 t6 t13 t34 t3 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t24 t4 t24 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t29 t33 t4 t29 t4`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This is helpful because it simplifies the analysis as each step in a derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So, the initial derivation starts with NT56 and NT45. Each of these can be further broken down into other non-terminals until we reach terminals, like 't5', 't36', etc.\n\nLet me start by seeing if each component in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't5'. Looking at the rules, I see NT56 \u2192 t33, but NT56 is also part of S. However, the first step is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the string starts with t5. Wait, what's the rule for NT56? There's a rule NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT49 is in another rule, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. Hmm, I need to see if this can lead to 't5'.\n\nWait, looking further, there's NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 and NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56. Maybe starting from NT55? Let me see. Alternatively, NT56 is connected to NT69, which is connected to NT63, etc. But looking at the string, the first symbol is t5, which must come from NT56 \u2192 t33, but in the string, the first symbol is t5, not t33. Hmm, that might complicate things because NT56 is producing t33, but in the string, we have t5 first. Maybe I should check the NT50 production because NT50 \u2192 t3, but it's also part of other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's map the string and see if each token can be mapped through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are all 't' followed by a number. I need to check which NT rules produce t followed by numbers.\n\nLet me create a list of all NT rules and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 t3\n- NT56 \u2192 t33\n- NT55 \u2192 t36 (since NT55 can go to NT56 NT45, which is NT56 \u2192 t33 and NT45 \u2192 t4, so NT55 \u2192 t33 t4, which is t33 t4, not t36. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, maybe NT55 can produce other terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NTs that produce t followed by a number:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t13 (from NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, then NT46 \u2192 t4, NT68 \u2192 t17, but also perhaps other routes)\nWait, NT3 has a chain: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46 \u2192 t17 t4. So NT3 can produce t17 t4, which is t17 t4, not t13. But there's another rule: NT13 \u2192 t24. Wait, maybe NT3 also has NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which could lead to more steps.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NTs that produce t numbers:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 t9\n- NT34 \u2192 t24\n- NT36 \u2192 t3 t25 (from NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which is NT25 \u2192 t10 and NT70 \u2192 t17 \u2192 t10 t17 \u2192 t17 t10, but wait, earlier rules: NT70 can also go to 't17' and other paths.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to find which NTs can produce each t...:\n\nLooking for t followed by a number:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 t9\n- NT26 \u2192 t25 or could be NT26 \u2192 t4 or t29. Wait, NT26 can go to t4 or t29.\n\nSimilarly, NT70 can go to t17, which is 't17 t7' in another rule (wait, NT70 is 't17 t6' in one of the rules). Or wait, let me check specific rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT26 has two rules: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and NT26 \u2192 NT4 NT50. Wait, actually, looking at the rules given, I see:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I have to see each production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor NT26: \n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 \n- NT26 \u2192 NT4 NT50\n\nThen, looking into those:\n\n- NT36 has a rule that goes to t's, like NT36 \u2192 t25 NT70, etc.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved. Since the string starts with t5, let me see which NT can produce t5.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t5. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each rule to see if any produce t5.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 t5 directly. So maybe t5 can only be produced by a terminal that I didn't account for. Wait, but the rules provided don't include t5 as an output. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35, and NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68, which leads to t6 via NT68? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe t5 is produced by some NT, but I can't see it in the given rules. So perhaps the grammar doesn't have a production that outputs t5, meaning the string cannot be generated. But that can't be because the grammar starts with t5 somewhere.\n\nWait, looking again: in the string, the first token is t5. So, there must be some NT in the grammar that produces t5 directly or via other rules.\n\nLooking for any NT that produces t5:\n\nLooking through the grammar's rules:\n\nNo production rule for any non-terminal directly gives t5. Wait, but hold on: looking at NT71's rule is NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 \u2192 NT49 NT31. Hmm, no t5 there. Alternatively, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. NT56 \u2192 t33? Or perhaps via other routes.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me cross-reference the string with the grammar. Since the string starts with t5, which must come from some NT. But none of the rules produce t5 directly, so perhaps the answer is 'No' because t5 cannot be generated.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem statement says that the string may or may not be generated by the grammar. But perhaps I'm missing a step where t5 is part of a longer production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a NT that indirectly leads to t5. Let me check NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 or NT44 NT56.\n\nIf NT55 leads to NT56 and NT45, then NT56 is 't33' and NT45 is 't4', so NT55 would produce t33 t4, which is 't33 t4'. But the string starts with 't5', which isn't 't33 t4', so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check each rule step by step for each token.\n\nThe first token is t5. None of the NTs directly produce t5, so perhaps the grammar cannot produce t5 at all. But the initial string starts with t5, so that would imply that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me check again: maybe there's a rule I missed that produces t5. Looking through all the rules provided... Hmm, no clear rule that produces 't5' directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t5, which isn't produced by any NT, so it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, I have to consider that sometimes the same NT can be produced via multiple steps.

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's part of the language defined by this grammar. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That helps in parsing because it simplifies the application of the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTyz. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which fits the pattern A \u2192 BC. Then, some non-terminals expand into terminals like NT70 \u2192 't5' or NT69 \u2192 't5'. Okay, so terminals are the leaves, and non-terminals are the internal nodes.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t33 t12 t28 t10 t5 t36 t26 t3 t4 t4 t36 t4 t4 t10 t7 t17 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t33 t27 t34 t4`.\n\nLet me start by identifying how the string could be formed using the given grammar.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar can be replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived through the productions.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the possible productions.\n\nStarting with the first symbol 't5'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT70 \u2192 't5'. So, that's a possible production. Now, the next symbol is 't17', which is represented by NT30.\n\nBut wait, NT30 only appears in NT21 \u2192 NT49 NT50, wait no, looking back, I see NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT31, and NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50, but is there a production for NT30? Wait, I see that NT30 is defined as producing 't17'. So, NT30 \u2192 't17'. So maybe the production chain starts with NT70 and NT30.\n\nSo the first part is possible: NT70 -> 't5' and NT30 -> 't17'. That matches the first two symbols.\n\nNow, the next symbol is 't4'. Looking for possible derivations. The third symbol is 't4' after 't5' and 't17'.\n\nI think I need to track how each symbol is derived. Wait, perhaps instead of starting at the top, I should try to see if each terminal can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to reverse the process, starting from the initial symbol S and trying to expand it into the string.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to use a parsing strategy, like the CYK algorithm, but that might be too time-consuming manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if each symbol can be matched in the grammar. Let's see what each symbol corresponds to.\n\nt5 is NT70.\n\nt17 is NT30.\n\nt4 is NT22 \u2192 't4'? Wait, looking back, NT22 \u2192 't4' according to the grammar. So NT22 produces 't4'.\n\nBut in the string, the sequence starts with t5, t17, t4, and so on.\n\nWait, but the initial symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So the string must be the concatenation of the two non-terminals expanded by NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, so the entire string must be the expansion of S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Therefore, the string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the string is t5 t17 ... corresponds to NT56 producing t5 and NT45 producing t17, but that seems off because the string is longer, so each non-terminal must expand into a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see what the entire string looks like. The string is 34 tokens. Let me count the number of symbols:\n\nt5, t17, t4, t33, t4, t33, t12, t28, t10, t5, t36, t26, t3, t4, t4, t36, t4, t4, t10, t7, t17, t4, t5, t3, t4, t4, t33, t27, t34, t4. So 34 symbols.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT56 NT45, the string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT56 and NT45. So the first part from NT56 should generate the first half, and NT45 generates the second half.\n\nWait, but 34 is even, so perhaps each non-terminal expands into 17 terminals.\n\nBut 34 is even, so maybe NT56 generates the first 17 symbols and NT45 the next 17.\n\nLet me check what NT56 and NT45 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (from the given rules)\n\nThen NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to try to see if each symbol in the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an iterative approach, trying to find a possible parsing sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for each symbol in the end of the strings and match the right derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to construct a parse tree from the string and see if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLet's try to parse the string symbol by symbol.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which is NT70. So NT70 must be in the left-hand side of a production that produces t5. Looking at the grammar, NT70 \u2192 't5'. So that's a leaf.\n\nThe next symbol is t17, which is NT30. So NT30 \u2192 't17'.\n\nSo the first two symbols come from NT70 and NT30. But S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the initial S expansion must involve NT56 and NT45, which would start with t5 (from NT70) and t17 (from NT30). Wait, but that's not matching because S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and perhaps NT56 would produce the first part, and NT45 the second.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with t5 (NT70) and t17 (NT30). But S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so perhaps the expansion is that S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and each of those produces some sequences. But the initial symbols are t5 and t17, which would correspond to NT56 producing t5 and NT45 producing t17, which doesn't make sense because NT56's production is NT69 NT44, and NT45 is 't4' as per the grammar. Wait, looking back, NT45 appears in S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and also in S being on the left side. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT44 is used in NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nAnd NT26 has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and NT26 \u2192 't6'.\n\nHmm, perhaps too long. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the entire string can be generated by S by expanding all non-terminals into terminals.\n\nWait, given that the string is long, perhaps a better way is to see how the string could be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols:\n\nt5 (NT70), t17 (NT30), t4, t33, t4, t33, t12, t28, t10, t5, t36, t26, t3, t4, t4, t36, t4, t4, t10, t7, t17, t4, t5, t3, t4, t4, t33, t27, t34, t4.\n\nWait, the first part is 't5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t33 ...'\n\nLet me see what each of these symbols could be generated by.\n\n- t5 is NT70.\n- t17 is NT30.\n- t4 is NT22.\n- t33 is NT55 (since NT55 produces NT56 NT45, and perhaps one of them produces t33).

{"custom_id":"request-558","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is quite long, so I'll need to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the grammar rules to understand how non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. The entire string is composed of a series of 't' tokens with numbers, and I'm guessing each of these corresponds to a production rule terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the left side of the arrows can expand into either two non-terminals or a combination that eventually leads to terminals. The string is a sequence of 't' tokens, so each 't' must be generated by a specific production rule.\n\nLet me scan the right-hand sides of the grammar rules to see which produce a single terminal. From the rules given, I notice that some non-terminals do expand to 't's with numbers. For example, NT70 -> 't17', NT31 -> 't28', etc. But no rule directly produces a single 't' without a number. Wait, that's a problem because the string has 't's without any numbers attached. That might mean the grammar doesn't produce the string as is because each 't' in the string must come from a specific production.\n\nWait, looking closer, the productions on the right side of the grammar are combinations, like S -> NT56 NT45, which would expand into a combination of non-terminals leading to terminals. So each 't' in the string must be generated by a terminal that's the result of applying a production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production on the right is a combination like NT69 -> NT63 NT49, which means each NT in that combination can further expand. So the overall string is a series of 't's, each corresponding to specific terminals from these expansions.\n\nWait, but the grammar rules have non-terminals that expand into pairs of non-terminals, and each of those can further expand. So the string must be generated by a sequence of these expansions. The entire string needs to be a derivation starting from S.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, meaning all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the rules, some have a on the right side, like NT70 -> 't17', so they are indeed a -> single terminal rules. Others produce two non-terminals, like S -> NT56 NT45, and NT61 -> NT22 NT59.\n\nSo each step of the derivation would break down the non-terminals into their respective components. Therefore, the string is a terminal string that must be formed by fully expanding all non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string, I need to see if it can be matched by a series of production applications starting from S and eventually resulting in the given string.\n\nThis is going to get complicated because the string is 43 tokens long, which would require a lot of expansion steps. Maybe I can look for a pattern or see if each 't' can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be formed by recursively expanding the non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is: t5 t36 t29 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t17 t4 t29 t5 t17 t4 t33 t27 t34 t36 t29 t4 t17 t4 t4 t33 t4 t33 t29 t33 t27 t34 t4.\n\nEach 't' in the string corresponds to a specific production rule where NT -> 'tN', like NT70 -> 't17'. So each 't' is a terminal that needs to be matched by a specific production.\n\nBut wait, let's check the grammar rules. Do any of them have 't' as the last symbol in the expansion? For example, looking at NT25 -> 't10', NT28 -> 't36', NT39 -> 't21', NT50 -> 't3', etc. Wait, I see NT23 isn't mentioned, but I'm looking for any NT that directly produces a single 't' followed by a number. Wait, no, the right-hand sides of the grammar rules are combinations like NT56 -> NT69 NT44. Not terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, only the right-hand sides that have 't' followed by a number are for NTs that produce a terminal plus a number. Wait, but in the rules given, none of them have a single 't' without a number on the right side. For example, NT70 -> 't17', so that's a production where NT70 becomes 't' followed by 17. Similarly, NT1 -> 't24', etc.\n\nSo, in that case, each 't' in the string must be matched by a NT production. So for example, the first 't5' could be NT70 -> 't17'? Wait, no, 't5' would need an NT that ends with 't5'. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT that ends with 't' and then a number matching exactly 't5'. Looking through the rules, none of the right-hand sides are just a single 't5'. All 't's are followed by a number, but perhaps the production is like NT70->'t17', meaning NT70 is replaced by t17, which suggests that 't17' is a single token. So each 'tN' in the string must come from a production where NT -> 'tN'.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then each 'tN' in the string must be exactly matched by an NT that can produce 'tN'. Let's check each 'tN' in the string and see if such a production exists.\n\nLooking at the rules, the right-hand sides have:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT59 -> 't34'\n\nNT25 -> 't10'\n\nNT36 -> 't25'\n\nNT69 -> 't5'\n\nNT17 -> 't4'\n\nNT71 -> 't14'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides:\n\nNT70 -> 't17' (yes, NT70 produces 't17')\n\nNT69 -> 't5' (no, NT69 -> 't5')\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT69 -> 't5'.\n\nYes, NT69 is replaced by 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT50 -> 't3' (from NT50 -> 't3').\n\nWait, but wait, looking through the rules, here are some:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT69 -> 't5'\n\nNT50 -> 't3'\n\nNT25 -> 't10'\n\nNT36 -> 't25'\n\nNT28 -> 't36'\n\nNT71 -> 't14'\n\nNT21 -> 't13'\n\nNT34 -> 't24'\n\nNT1 -> 't24'\n\nNT59 -> 't34'\n\nNT45 -> 't4'\n\nNT3 -> 't24'\n\nHmm, so each 'tN' corresponds to a specific NT production where NT -> 'tN'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, each token is a 't' followed by a number. Let's check each 'tN' to see if it's present as a production in the grammar.\n\nThe string has: t5, t36, t29, t4, t26, t36, t29, t4, t17, t4, t29, t5, t17, t4, t33, t27, t34, t36, t29, t4, t17, t4, t4, t33, t4, t33, t29, t33, t27, t34, t4.\n\nSo:\n\nt5 is allowed by NT69 (NT69->'t5')\n\nt36 is allowed by NT61 (NT61->'t36'? Wait, no, let's check each 'tN':\n\nLooking for any NT that produces 't36'. Do we have any NT that has a production NTXX -> 't36'? Looking at the rules, I don't see NT61: 't36' (looking through, seems NT61's first rule is NT61->NT34 NT8, so that's non-terminal. Wait, I think I should list all 'tN' and see if any NT production ends with 'tN'.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a path through the grammar that results in this entire string. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, but given the time, perhaps I can determine if each 'tN' is present in the grammar as a production.\n\nWait, let me list each 'tN' and see if any NT in the grammar produces exactly 'tN'.\n\nThe"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-559","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t9 t9 t2 t6 t36 t29 t4 t26 t36 t25 t17 t4 t33 t32 t34 t3 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t4 t4 t4 t33 t17 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar's structure. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one on the right, or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, the top-level rule is S -> NT56 NT45. So the process will likely involve breaking down S into these two components.\n\nEach of these NTs (non-terminals) has their own productions. For example, NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and so on. The process involves checking whether we can derive the entire string by applying these productions step by step.\n\nThe approach here is to reverse-engineer the process. Starting from the beginning, S must generate a string starting with NT56 and NT45. Each of these is a non-terminal, so we'll substitute them until we reach terminals only.\n\nLet's start by splitting the string into parts that could correspond to the NT56 and NT45 parts. The total length of the string is 35 tokens, but since both NT56 and NT45 might contribute equally or not, we'll need to consider possible splits.\n\nLooking at NT56 and NT45, I'll need to see if their productions can generate substrings of the given string. For NT56, possible productions include NT69 NT44, which would mean we need to split the string into parts matching NT69 and NT44.\n\nSimilarly, NT45 could have multiple productions, such as NT63 NT46, NT25 NT39, etc. Each of these would lead to different possible splits of the string.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a pattern or a way to match the string with the grammar by recursively checking each production. Alternatively, since the string is provided, maybe there's a way to parse it back up the grammar.\n\nGiven the length of the string and the possible non-terminals, it's likely that each step involves expanding a non-terminal into two others until all are terminals. So, the process is iterative, expanding each non-terminal until the entire string is consumed.\n\nHowever, doing this manually without a parser would be time-consuming. So, perhaps I can look for patterns or common tokens to trace back through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't9'. Looking back to the grammar, which terminals are 't' followed by numbers. Scanning the grammar, I see NT70 -> 't17', NT30 -> 't17', NT18 -> 't32', NT27 -> 't24', etc. The first two 't9's might correspond to NT35 -> 't9' and NT70 -> 't17' (though not directly matching, so I might be mistaken).\n\nAlternatively, considering NT56 -> NT69 NT44, which then NT69 -> NT63 NT49, and so on. Each step would require matching these productions in the string.\n\nBut this manual process is error-prone and time-consuming. Since the string is 35 tokens, each step would halve the problem, but without any shortcuts, it would take many iterations.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each token can be part of a production. For example, each 't' token must be the result of a terminal production, meaning they must be terminal symbols. So, any token that's not a terminal would not be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but all the tokens in the string are 't' followed by numbers. Looking back, the grammar lists NT36 -> 't25', NT34 -> 't24', etc. So 't9' appears in NT35 and NT70, as well as others. So, 't9' is a terminal, meaning that at some point, NT35 or NT70 would produce it.\n\nBut the string starts with 't9 t9', which would require that the first production from NT56 and NT45 both generate 't9' as the first token. So let's think: NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT45 could be something that starts with 't9'.\n\nWait, NT45 has rules like NT63 NT46, NT25 NT39, etc. None of these directly result in a 't' immediately. Hmm, wait no: looking back, some NTs have terminal symbols as their productions.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm mixing up NTs and terminals. Let me see: the grammar is given with rules like S -> NT56 NT45, and each NT69's production includes other NTs and one terminal in some cases. For example, NT61 -> NT34 NT8, where 8 is a terminal (since NT8 -> 't13'). So, in the string, any 't' token is a terminal.\n\nSo, 't9' is a terminal, produced by NT70, NT64, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking at all the productions where the right-hand side has a terminal token (looks like those are the terminal symbols):\n\n- NT61 -> NT34 NT8\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT26\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't29' (another 't26')\n- NT36 -> 't25'\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT31 -> 't50' (I think 't50' is a terminal, but in the string, it's 't34', etc.)\nWait, the string has 't34', which corresponds to NT34->'t24', so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, what are the terminals? It seems that the terminals are the 't' followed by a number, as all other non-terminals produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo, every 'tX' is a terminal, and other tokens (like 'NTxxxx') are non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, each 't' token is a terminal, which must be the result of a production from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting from S, we have NT56 and NT45. Let's break them down.\n\nNT56: Looking at its productions, one is NT69 NT44. So, we'll substitute NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT45: Looking at its productions, one is NT63 NT46, another is NT25 NT39, etc. Let's see what NT45 could produce as the first token. The string starts with 't9 t9 ...', so perhaps NT45 -> a production that starts with 't9'. Looking at NT45's rules: NT45 -> NT63 NT46, NT1 -> 't24', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the first 't9' in the string to see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only 't9's appear in NT35 and NT70, and possibly others.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT61 -> NT34 NT8: 't9' is produced by NT35, which is not in this production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me list out all the terminals in the grammar to see all possible 'tX's.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT36 -> 't25'\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT26 -> 't4' or 't29' (wait, looking back, the rule is:\n  NT26 -> NT36 NT3 or NT26 -> NT29.

The string is a sequence of tokens, each either 't' followed by a number or a non-terminal symbol. The grammar is quite extensive, and the string is quite long, so I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either a single terminal, or a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. So, looking at the grammar, S starts with NT56 and NT45. The string starts with 't9 t15 t3 t4 t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t26 t36 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t25 t17 t4 t4 t10 t5 t36 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4'. \n\nThe first token after S is t9, so I need to see how 't9' is generated. Looking at the grammar, I spot NT94 -> NT95 NT54 and NT35 -> NT42 NT3, etc. Wait, but wait, in the grammar provided, I don't immediately see a production that directly generates 't9'. Oh, actually, looking back, there's a production NT68 -> 't3', and NT70 -> 't17', and others, but 't9' must come from a specific non-terminal. Let me check the bottom of the grammar: NT70 -> 't17', NT68 -> 't3', NT69 -> 't5', etc. Hmm, looking for 't9': I see NT65 is a possible non-terminal, but looking at the given productions, there's no NT9 in the initial productions. Wait, actually, the first few rules are S-> NT56 NT45, then NT22->... down to various NTs. Let's see which non-terminals have 't9' as their production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT61 -> NT34 NT8. Hmm, and NT18->'t27', NT26->'t4', NT39->'t21', etc. Wait, maybe I'm missing a rule. Oh, wait, in the last part, I see NT70-> 't17', NT68->'t3', NT69->'t5', NT56->'t33', and others. Wait, looking for 't9', I remember that in the grammar, NT63 has a production: NT63 -> 't9'. So perhaps one of the non-terminals leads to t9 through NT63.\n\nWait, but looking through the productions, I see NT63 is mentioned as a production multiple times, like NT22->, but I don't see NT63 in the initial rules. Oh wait, looking at the grammar, I see several entries that go to 't9': Looking through the entries, for example, NT63 appears in some productions, like NT22->, but looking at all the options, let's see:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\nNT34 -> 't24'\nNT68 -> 't3'\nNT61 -> NT34 NT8\nNT2 -> NT12\nNT26 -> 't4'\nNT36 -> 't25'\nNT6 -> NT1 NT22\nAnd further down, I see:\n\nNT61 -> NT22 NT10\nNT64 -> NT25 NT69\nWait, maybe I'm missing a rule where NT63 is directly generating t9.

Hmm, maybe it's higher up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start building a parse tree for the given string. The string is t9 t15 t3 t4 t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t26 t36 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t25 t17 t4 t4 t10 t5 t36 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S expands into NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t9, which must come from a production that ends in t9.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT63->t9, so perhaps the first production is NT63. Let's assume that S -> NT56 NT45, and NT56 expands into something that produces t9.\n\nWait, but NT56 is a non-terminal. So, I need to find a production for NT56 that leads to t9.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. That sounds a bit intimidating, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a context-free grammar is. It consists of a start symbol (here it's S) and a set of production rules. Each production rule breaks down symbols into combinations of other symbols. Some symbols generate strings of terminals (like 't' followed by numbers), which are part of the language the grammar defines.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's fully in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either S -> AB or A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. This form is helpful for parsing algorithms, but I don't need to use any for this problem. Instead, I just need to see if the string can be derived using these rules.\n\nThe target string is: `t9 t15 t36 t29 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4 t17 t4 t29 t9 t15 t36 t29 t4 t24 t25 t13 t34 t17 t4 t4 t4 t29 t4`.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. That means each of these terms must be generated by a production rule that expands to that terminal. For non-terminals (like NTx), they will expand into other non-terminals or a terminal and non-terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step. Alternatively, I can work backwards, starting from the string and trying to find matches using the reverse of each production rule. Since the string is pretty long, maybe working backwards will be more efficient.\n\nBut before diving into that, perhaps I should list all the production rules and see what terminals are present in the string to focus on. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT26\n- NT61 -> NT18 NT59\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45\n- NT70 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT50 -> NT25 NT8\n- NT48 -> NT25 NT39\n- NT39 -> NT21 NT6\n- ... and so on.\n\nThe terminals in the string are: t9, t15, t36, t29, t4, t5, t36, t29, t4, t5, t3, t4, t4, t4, t17, t4, t29, t9, t15, t36, t29, t4, t24, t25, t13, t34, t17, t4, t4, t4, t29, t4.\n\nSo, I need to find non-terminals that can produce these terminals.\n\nI should probably create a list of which non-terminals generate which terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see rules like N68->t28 t26, N61->t18 t59, N50->t25 t8, etc.\n\nBut perhaps more systematically:\n\nEach production rule either is of the form A->BC or A->t, where t is a terminal.\n\nSo for each non-terminal A, I can list all the possible terminal strings it can produce in one step. For example:\n\nLet me try to parse the string by looking for the earliest possible matching productions.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a long string, maybe I can traverse it step by step, making sure that at each step, the current position in the string can be matched by some production.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nBut first, let me see if the first symbol of the string is a terminal: it's t9. I need to find a production rule where the start symbol (S) can derive t9 as part of a larger production. But S has two rules: S->NT56 NT45 and NT56->NT69 NT44, and NT44->NT3 NT26, etc. So S can't directly produce t9, because S is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side of S's production is two non-terminals.\n\nWait, so S is the start symbol, which is a non-terminal. So the first step would be that S expands into NT56 NT45. Now, both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so I have to process each of them.\n\nNT56 can be expanded into NT69 NT44, and NT44 can be NT3 NT26.\n\nWait, but let me write out the structure.\n\nSo the first symbol t9 must come from one of these branches. Let's see:\n\nIf S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the first part is NT56, which is NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 -> NT25 NT70.\n\nNT70 -> 't5' or 't7'?\n\nWait, looking back, NT70 has two productions:\n\nNT70 -> 't5' and NT70 -> 't7'.\n\nSo NT70 can be 't5' or 't7'.\n\nSo back to NT63: NT63 -> NT25 NT70, which can be 't5' or 't7'.\n\nThen NT25: NT25 -> 't10'.\n\nSo NT63 can expand to NT25 (t10) and NT70 (t5 or t7), so the combination would be t10 and t5 or t7. But since NT63 is followed by NT44 in NT56's production, which I'm tracking.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting lost. Let me try to construct the first few steps.\n\nS is the start, which expands to NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 expands to NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 expands to NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63: NT25 NT70.\n\nNT25: 't10'.\n\nNT70 can be 't5' or 't7'.\n\nSo NT63 becomes 't10' and either 't5' or 't7', making 't10 t5' or 't10 t7'.\n\nThen, NT44 is 'NT3 NT26':\n\nNT44: NT3 NT26.\n\nNT3: NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68: NT28 NT26.\n\nNT28: 't36'.\n\nNT26: NT4 NT10 (looking at the rules, wait, NT26 is: NT26->'t4'?

Oh, so NT26 can be 't4' or 't29', which complicates things.\n\nWait, the rules for NT26: from the list, NT26 has two productions:\n\nNT26 -> 't4' and NT26->'t29'.\n\nSimilarly, NT46: looking through the rules, NT46->'t4'.\n\nSo let me retrace:\n\nS->NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56->NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69->NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63->NT25 NT70.\n\nNT25->t10.\n\nNT70 can be t5 or t7.\n\nThen NT44->NT3 NT26.\n\nNT3->NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68->'t28' and NT46->'t4'.\n\nSo NT68 is 't28', NT46 is 't4', so NT68 NT46 is 't28 t4'.\n\nWait, but NT68 is 't28' or is that an NT that can expand to multiple things? Wait, NT68 is a non-terminal, so in this case, NT68 would expand to 't28 t26' because NT68's rule is NT68->NT28 NT26. Oh wait, no, the production for NT68 is NT68->NT28 NT26, which both are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-597","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the grammar structure. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, I see some productions like NT56 -> t33. Wait, hold on. Is that allowed in CNF? Because in CNF, the right-hand side should be two non-terminals. But here, some productions have terminals on the right. That's confusing because typically in CNF, the productions only involve non-terminals. So maybe this grammar isn't in proper CNF, but the user says it is. Hmm, perhaps it's a variant, so I'll proceed assuming it's correct.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is `t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t36 t4 t4 t3 t4 t29 t33 t36 t10 t17 t17 t4 t4 t33 t4 t10 t7 t36 t29 t4 t33 t10 t21 t6 t28 t33 t4 t4`. That's a series of terminals, all lowercase letters, which I assume are the terminals defined in the grammar.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me note that the grammar starts with S -> NT56 NT45. So the initial parse would involve expanding S into two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nI'll start by mapping the string to see if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few terms are t9, t9, t10, etc. Let me list them:\n\n1. t9\n2. t9\n3. t10\n4. t21\n5. t6\n6. t36\n7. t4\n8. t4\n9. t3\n10. t4\n11. t29\n12. t33\n13. t36\n14. t10\n15. t17\n16. t17\n17. t4\n18. t4\n19. t33\n20. t4\n21. t10\n22. t7\n23. t36\n24. t29\n25. t4\n26. t33\n27. t10\n28. t21\n29. t6\n30. t28\n31. t33\n32. t4\n33. t4\n\nThat's 33 terms. Now, looking at the grammar productions, some produce terminals, others produce non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT56 -> t33. So the first production of NT56 is t33. But the string starts with t9, not t33. Hmm. Wait, that might be an issue. Let me check: NT56 has a production NT56 -> NT69 NT44. But also, it has NT56 -> t33. So there are two options for NT56.\n\nWait, but wait, in CNF, all productions should be two non-terminals except for the terminals, but in this grammar, NT56 has a production that produces a terminal, which is allowed in CNF because CNF can have productions that produce terminals, perhaps in certain cases. Wait, no, actually in standard CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. So if a production has a terminal, it wouldn't fit CNF. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nBut given that the user says it's in CNF, I must proceed. Maybe some of the NTs can produce terminals, and others cannot. So perhaps the string can be broken down by matching the productions that replace non-terminals with terminals.\n\nLet's look for terminals in the string to backtrack.\n\nAnother approach is to analyze how the string can be constructed. Since S expands to NT56 NT45, I need both of these to produce strings that, when concatenated, equal the given string.\n\nSo, the string must be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nLooking at the first few characters of the string: t9, t9, t10, etc. Let's see if any non-terminal expands to t9, t10, etc.\n\nLooking up the productions:\n\n- NT13 -> t24\n- NT34 -> t24\n- NT7 -> t13\n- NT8 -> t13\n- NT68 -> t3\n- NT21 -> t13\n- NT49 -> t15\n- NT36 -> t25\n- NT69 -> t5\n- NT56 -> t33\n- NT70 -> t17\n- NT30 -> t17\n- NT50 -> t3\n- NT48 -> t24\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT49\n- NT4 -> t37\n- NT28 -> t36\n- NT66 -> t6\n- NT36 -> t25\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT56 -> t33\n- NT36 -> t25\n- NT70 -> t17\n- NT30 -> t17\n- NT50 -> t3\n- NT18 -> t32\n- NT35 -> t9\n- Wait, looking at NT35: NT35 -> t9. So that's one production producing a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 -> t5, NT30 -> t17, NT50 -> t3, NT22 -> t0, etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to look for non-terminals that can produce the terminal in question.\n\nSo for the string starting with t9, let's see if any production of an NT ends with t9. From the grammar:\n\n- NT35 -> t9\n- NT39 -> t21\nWait, no, NT39's production is t21? Or does it produce t21 as a result? Wait, NT39 is a non-terminal, looks like NT39 -> t21. Or wait, no: Wait, the grammar is in the form NT39 -> t21, meaning it directly produces t21.\n\nWait, no: the grammar shows NT39 -> t21, so it's a production that directly replaces NT39 with t21. Similarly, NT35 is a production that replaces with t9.\n\nSo for t9, the possible NTs that can produce it are those with a production NT35 -> t9, and perhaps any others? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT35 -> t9\n- NT48 -> t24\n- NT18 -> t32\n- NT34 -> t24\n- NT5 -> NT1 NT49\n- NT4 -> t37\n- NT28 -> t36\n- NT66 -> t6\n- NT36 -> t25\n- etc.\n\nSo only NT35 can produce t9.\n\nTherefore, the last generated string has to come from NT35.\n\nNow, looking back at the string, the last part is ending with four t4's. So the second part (NT45) would have to produce something ending with t4 four times.\n\nBut wait, NT45's productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to check if NT45 has any productions that result in t4s. Or perhaps not directly. Let me check the grammar.\n\nGrammar includes several NT45 and NT46 productions:\n\n- NT46 -> t4\n- So NT46 can produce t4. But NT45's productions?\n\nLooking for NT45, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar entries:\n\n- NT48 -> t24\n- NT54 -> NT6 NT45\n- NT45 -> ... Hmm, the grammar shows NT54 -> ... but looking for NT45:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rows, I don't immediately see a production for NT45 except in NT54 -> NT6 NT45. Maybe that's a typo or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\nYes, one of the productions is NT54 -> NT6 NT45. So that's a production of NT54 into NT6 and NT45. But that doesn't directly help. However, someone else produces t56: NT56 -> t33.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the grammar and perhaps each line represents a production rule.

{"custom_id":"request-599","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it by following a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. A context-free grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form if every production rule is of the form S \u2192 AB or A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols. Wait, now I'm confusing myself with symbols. Oh, right, in CNF, the start symbol is only on the left, and each production on the right side has exactly two non-terminals, except for the base cases where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all the production rules are indeed in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for a few. Wait, no, wait. Let me check. Oh, some rules produce terminal symbols, like NT70 \u2192 't5', so that's a production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Okay, so the grammar seems to be in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t5 t36 t10 t7 t3 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t26 t36 t25 t17 t4 t5 t36 t26 t3 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t4 t4 t24 t13 t4 t27 t34 t4 t4`.\n\nBut wait, I'm noticing that after t5, it's t36, which might correspond to a production like NT36. Let me see if I can reconstruct the parse tree for this string or see if it follows the production rules.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm. Since the grammar is in CNF, CYK should work perfectly here. Let me recall how CYK works. CYK is used to determine whether a string is generated by a CFG in CNF. It builds a table where each cell [i, j] represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j in the string.\n\nOkay, so the string has 38 tokens. Let me break it down into individual components, each representing a terminal (like 't5') or a non-terminal (like NT36). Wait, no, in the grammar, NTs are all non-terminals that can produce other NTs or terminals. So each symbol in the string could either be a non-terminal that directly produces that symbol, or be part of a chain of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each token in the string to a possible non-terminal that can produce it. Alternatively, look for a sequence of productions that can generate the entire string.\n\nLet me see the end of the string, as sometimes working backward can be helpful. The last token is t4 t4. Looking at the grammar, which rules produce t4? Let's check the production rules for NT28 \u2192 t36 NT26, etc. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps working forward.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from the initial symbols. The start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S can produce two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. Each of these, in turn, break down into other non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to see if the string can be broken down into applicable productions step by step. Let me try to see.\n\nLooking at the string's first tokens: t5 t36 t10. Hmm, I know from the grammar that NT70 \u2192 t5 and NT36 \u2192 t10 (from rule NT18 \u2192 t32, but that's not a terminal). Wait, looking again, NT18 has the production NT18 \u2192 NT49 NT36, and looking for NT18, in the rules I see NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, but NT70 \u2192't5' so perhaps NT36 can produce t5 if other conditions are met.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me try to map each part of the string to the grammar.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5. From the rules, NT70 \u2192 t5. So in order to get t5, we need NT70 to be a part of a production that eventually leads to t5. Looking at the rules, NT70 can break into NT28 NT26 or NT69 NT5. Wait, the rules for NT70: looking at the grammar provided, I see that NT70 \u2192 t5, right? Let me check the initial list. Looking through, yes, NT70 \u2192't5', so NT70 can directly produce t5.\n\nSo the first token is t5, which would come from NT70. So in the parse tree, we would have a leaf node NT70 \u2192 t5.\n\nNow, the string is t5 t36 t10 t7..., so after t5 comes t36, t10. Hmm, how can we get t36 and t10 after t5? Well, perhaps the NT70 (which produces t5) is part of a production that also produces other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the way the grammar is set up, each rule on S or other non-terminals branches into two non-terminals, each of which can further branch until they hit terminal symbols.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and NT45 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Wait, but looking at NT56: according to the rules, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56 would branch into NT69 and NT44. Similarly, NT45 branches into NT63 and NT49.\n\nWait, then looking at that, perhaps each production splits into two, and each of those splits again.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t5, which is from NT70, perhaps the initial production must be one that is part of a higher-level non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is to look for a way to get the first symbol as t5, which is NT70. So from where else does NT70 appear? Looking at the grammar, I see that one of the rules is NT70 \u2192 t5, so that's a terminal production.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5, so the first non-terminal in the parse tree must be something that produces NT70, which in turn produces t5.\n\nSo perhaps the starting symbol S would have to lead into NT70 somewhere down the line.\n\nWait, but S's initial production is NT56 NT45, which I don't see a direct link to NT70. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial tokens form a path down the parse tree. Let me try to see.\n\nLooking at the string: t5, t36, t10, t7, t3, t4, t4, t5, t3, t4, t26, t36, t25, t17, t4, t5, t36, t26, t3, t4, t33, t2, t6, t28, t4, t4, t24, t13, t4, t27, t34, t4, t4.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to split the string into parts and see if each part corresponds to sequences of productions.\n\nWait, but this is taking a while, and I'm not very systematic. Maybe I should try the CYK algorithm step by step.\n\nBut first, to apply CYK, I need to have a matrix where rows represent starting positions and columns represent ending positions of substrings, and each cell contains the non-terminals that can generate that substring.\n\nWait, let's note that each token in the string can be a terminal 't' followed by a number, or a non-terminal 'NT' followed by a number. So first, I need to separate them and map each token to a non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, all the productions produce non-terminals on the right side except for those that directly produce terminals on the right. For example, NT70 \u2192 t5, so t5 corresponds to NT70's production ending with t5.\n\nSo in terms of the string, every symbol is either a non-terminal (like NT36) or a terminal (like t5).\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of symbols, each of which can be a non-terminal or a terminal, depending on the grammar.\n\nNow, using CYK, we build a table where each cell (i, j) (where i <= j) represents the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring from position i to j.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Initialize the table for each position (i, j) where j = i + 0, i.e., each single symbol, with any non-terminals that can directly produce that symbol.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t9 t0 t6 t17 t4 t24 t24 t10 t7 t9 t15 t4 t3 t17 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4 t17 t4 t4 t33 t17 t6 t7 t17 t34 t36 t4 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, I should map each terminal symbol back to their corresponding non-terminal symbols using the grammar. That way, I can see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I'll list each terminal and its leading non-terminal:\n\n- t9: NT70 via NT70 \u2192 't9'\n- t0: NT1 \u2192 't0'\n- t6: NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- t17: NT23 (but wait, there's no NT23.

NT26 -> NT36 NT3 (line 28 of the list)\n... Then later, line 59: NT26 -> t4\nWait, that can't be. Each production can only have one rule unless it's a non-grammar.

That suggests a possible error, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe NT26 has two rules: one produces a non-terminal, and another produces a terminal, but that would mean the non-terminal has a epsilon production, which isn't shown here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in transcribing the list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently: each production rule in CNF is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So any production that has two terminals would not fit CNF, which each production can only have at most one terminal on the right-hand side. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the rule A \u2192 a is allowed.\n\nWait, looking at the initial list, perhaps I mistyped or misread some of the lines.

So I should check each non-terminal for the possible production to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT36 has multiple productions, all of which result in other non-terminals except for two where it goes to 't25' and 't70'? Or is it that some rules for NT36 are to terminals?\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar:\n\nI see NT36 -> NT25 NT70, NT36 -> NT47 NT20, NT36 -> 't25' and 't70'? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Looking at the list, for each non-terminal, the rules are written one after another.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should start by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the entire string should be derived from NT56 NT45.\n\nBut since both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, each will produce their own sequences.\n\nLet me see NT56 and NT45's productions.\n\nLooking at NT56:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nThen, looking at NT69:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT44\n\nWait, no, earlier in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list, NT69's productions:\n\nNT69 -> NT63 NT44\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nSo NT56 can go to NT69 NT44.\n\nNow, NT69 goes to NT63 NT44, so S becomes NT63 NT44 NT45.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think in terms of leftmost derivation. Let's try to parse the string.\n\nBut parsing 39 tokens manually would be time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to look for inconsistencies, such as a token in the string that's not present in any non-terminal's productions or cannot be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't9' early on. Let's check where t9 comes from.\n\nIn the grammar, the only t9 appears in NT36's productions: Wait, let me see.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has NT36's rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT36:\n\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check the entire list again.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me look carefully for where 't9' is a product.\n\nIn the given grammar, the rules where a terminal is produced are:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3\n\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nWait, that's it! So, the only way to get a 't' token is via NT42-> t3 or NT46 -> t4, etc.\n\nWait, no, NT42 is part of NT35's production: NT35 -> NT42 NT3. So NT35 can produce two non-terminals. \n\nWait, but looking for t9 in the string, which is the first token. So how do we get t9?\n\nLooking at the production rules, the only places where t9 is a result are for NT36. Wait, in the production NT36->'t25' and 't70'? No, looking again.\n\nWait, I think I might have a misunderstanding.

NT36 -> NT25 NT70\n2. NT36 -> NT47 NT20\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing other productions for NT36. Let me check the entire grammar again for NT36.\n\nAh, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\n\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\n\nBut then also at the end:\n\nNT36 -> 't25'\n\nWait, no, that's not a production because in the grammar, each rule is a production, so I think the string in the problem is just a list of tokens, and the productions are defined as the left-hand side being a non-terminal and the right-hand side being a sequence of symbols.\n\nWait, I think I need to represent each rule correctly.

{"custom_id":"request-635","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of t<something> tokens, like t5, t36, etc. I remember that Chomsky normal form has productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side except for the start symbol, which can have a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar and see what the start symbol is. The start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT56 NT45. So whatever comes out of S must break down into NT56 and NT45.\n\nNext, I'll break down the string they gave me. The string is: t5 t36 t4 t4 t33 t32 t34 t17 t4 t29 t33 t25 t36 t25 t36 t29 t4 t4 t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4 t4.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of tokens. Since each production in the grammar except for S can produce two non-terminals, and S initially gives NT56 and NT45, maybe I can work backwards from S.\n\nI'll start by mapping the grammar rules to see how I can get these t<values> from the non-terminals. Each non-terminal is a variable, and each rule is a way to expand it into two other non-terminals or perhaps some terminals directly.\n\nWait, maybe instead of working top-down from S, I can parse the string step by step, trying to match each part to the rules. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for context-free grammars in CNF. But setting up CYK might take a while, especially for a long string.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to see if the string can be decomposed into the right non-terminals. Let's consider the first symbol t5. Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT70 -> 't5', so that's how we get t5. So maybe the first part of the string comes from NT70, which splits into something else.\n\nWait, let me think. The string starts with t5, which is generated by NT70. So the first part must be a terminal, which means that in the parse tree, the root would have to derive a terminal at the top level if there's only one production. But in this case, the string is longer than just one symbol, so maybe the initial production S starts, and each of its components (NT56 and NT45) then derive parts of the string.\n\nI should try to parse the string as a series of production expansions. Let me see if I can start from the initial symbol S and see if I can match the string.\n\nS -> NT56 NT45\n\nSo the entire string is a derivation of S, which is two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo the string should start with NT56 and then NT45, but interleaved with another symbols. Wait, but in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so perhaps each symbol in the string comes from a terminal in some expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I need to see if each t<value> in the string corresponds to a production. For example, t5 corresponds to NT70->t5, so maybe the string is built by expanding NT70 to t5, then some other parts. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to look for the path of the string through the grammar.\n\nLet's take the string and try to split it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t4 t4 t33 t32 t34 t17 t4 t29 t33 t25 t36 t25 t36 t29 t4 t4 t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4 t4.\n\nI'll write it as a list of tokens: [t5, t36, t4, t4, t33, t32, t34, t17, t4, t29, t33, t25, t36, t25, t36, t29, t4, t4, t5, t36, t25, t3, t4, t4, t9, t15, t17, t4, t29, t4, t33, t4, t29, t4, t4].\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. The first symbol is t5, which comes from NT70: NT70 -> t5. So the NT70 must be expanded at the first step.\n\nBut NT70 is a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the numbers with the variable identifiers. In the grammar, the non-terminals are like NT22, NT61, etc., each with production rules. NT70 is a non-terminal, but looking through the productions, I can't see any rule for NT70 except for NT70 -> 't17'. Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking again, at the grammar rules:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nOh, so NT70 is a production that directly outputs 't17'. So that would make t17 the terminal for NT70.\n\nSo in the string, we have t5, t36, etc. The first token is t5, so let's see where t5 comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT70 -> 't5'? Wait, no. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that produces 't5':\n\nMaybe NT18 -> t27, NT1 -> t24, NT56 -> t33, etc. Wait, in the rules provided, I'm only seeing:\n\nWait, in the given rules, for example:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT70 -> 't5' ?\n\nWait, I don't see NT70 -> 't5' in the provided grammar. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's look again.\n\nLooking at the list of grammar production rules:\n\nI don't see any NT70 except as the left-hand side in the rule, which goes to 't17'. So it seems like NT70 only produces 't17'. So if the string has a t5, where does t5 come from?\n\nLooking again, NT1 has NT1 -> NT63 NT7. But where does t5 come from? Let me check all the rules again for any NT that directly produce 't5'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nHmm, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly gives 't5' except perhaps NT18:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT36 -> 't25' and so on.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar rules line by line:\n\nS: S->NT56 NT45.\n\nNT22: NT22->NT63 NT48.\n\nNT61: NT61->NT34 NT8.\n\n... (many rules follow)\n\nLooking for 't5' in the productions: The only rule I see that mentions t5 is NT71->t14, NT44->t5, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT45->t4.\n\nBut I need t5. Looking further, I see:\n\nNT18->t27,\n\nNT1->t24,\n\nNT56->t33,\n\nNT59->t34,\n\n... and also, looking at the end:\n\nNT71 -> 't14',\n\nNT48 -> 't24',\n\nNT44->t5,\n\nWait, I see: NT44->t5. So NT44 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't5'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nLooking here: \"NT44 -> t3\".\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps in the end:\n\n... NT31 -> NT4 NT50,\n\n... NT56 -> t33,\n\n... NT28 -> t36,\n\nWait, let me go back to the grammar list to find 't5'.\n\nWait, the line: NT44 -> t3 is under another context. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see rules like:\n\n\"NT44 -> t3\" is under NT47?

{"custom_id":"request-636","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where each right-hand side is exactly two non-terminals, except for the base cases which produce terminal symbols. So, all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each rule except the ones that directly terminate with terminals starts with a non-terminal and has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, and so on. The last few rules, like NT70 \u2192 't5' and others, are the terminals. So the grammar is in CNF, which is good because that makes parsing and generation easier.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is: `t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t17 t4 t3 t4 t10 t7 t3 t4 t33 t4 t3 t4 t4 t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t25 t17 t4 t33 t24 t4 t24 t15 t33 t29 t4`.\n\nThis string is a sequence of terminals, each of which is a 't' followed by a number. From the grammar, I can see that these terminals are the results of the productions terminating in terminals. So each 'tX' corresponds to a rule where a non-terminal immediately produces that terminal. For example, NT70 \u2192 't5' means when NT70 is expanded, it produces 't5'.\n\nMy goal is to see if, starting from the start symbol S, the entire string can be generated by applying the productions in reverse (since parsing builds the string from the start symbol, but here I'm trying to see if the string can be rewritten using the productions).\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't9', I need to find a production that produces 't9'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3 and NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. Wait, no, that doesn't help.

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by this context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, and every production has two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. That should make things a bit easier because CNF has specific parsing methods, but I'm more focused on whether the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: \n\nt5, t3, t4, t3, t4, t4, t9, t9, t10, t21, t6, t36, t10, t7, t3, t4, t4, t33, t4, t10, t5, t17, t4, t33, t4, t5, t3, t4, t26, t36, t4, t4, t12, t28, t4, t4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that the start symbol is S, and it's defined as S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the start symbol expands into two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45. \n\nEach of these non-terminals might have their own productions. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46. It seems like the non-terminals are expanding into other non-terminals, which eventually lead to terminals like 't12', 't17', etc.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to map each token in the string back to a production in the grammar. Each 't' token is a terminal, so we need to find a production that directly outputs that terminal when the non-terminals are expanded.\n\nLet me look through the productions to see how the terminals appear as results.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8. NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5. NT45 seems to go deeper into other NTs. I'm not sure if this is useful yet.\n- NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which gives us 't70', but 70 is not in our string.\n- NT70 is defined as 't17', which is in our string, so maybe NT70 is relevant for that part.\n\nWait, I notice that NT70 \u2192 't17', so that's a terminal. That's one of the tokens in the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT69 \u2192 't5', which is another token.\n\nLet me try to identify which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and then NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. Hmm, 44 doesn't directly produce a terminal. But wait, NT69 \u2192 't5' as per the productions. Also, NT44 has NT3 \u2192 NT35 NT55, which leads into more NTs. Not sure.\n\nWait, I have a list of productions where NTx is defined as a terminal. For example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't10' (from NT25 \u2192 NT10 't28'? Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking again: \n\nNT25 \u2192 't10'? Let me check.\n\nNo, actually, looking through the productions:\n\nI see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT70 is 't17', and NT25 is 't10'.\n\nWait, but NT25 is defined elsewhere as NT25 \u2192 't10'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the productions:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't10' (from the line: NT25 \u2192 't10'). So NT25 produces 't10'.\n\nSo, if a production results in NT25, that becomes 't10'.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8 \u2192 't10' and NT8 \u2192 which is NT45 NT5.\n\nWait, NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5. Then, NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46, and NT46 is 't4'.\n\nSo, let me see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5.\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46.\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3', and NT46 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo, NT8 becomes 't3 t4'.\n\nBut wait, NT8 as a production is NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5.\n\nThen, NT45 \u2192 NT68 NT46 \u2192 't3 t4'.\n\nSo NT8 becomes 't3 t4'.\n\nWait, but in the productions, NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49. Let me find that.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nYes, there's NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49.\n\nAnd NT1 \u2192 NT24 't24'.\n\nWT, so NT5 becomes NT1 NT49, which is 't24' and NT49.\n\nBut NT49 is defined as: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nAnd NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48.\n\nAnd NT63 \u2192 't9'; NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39.\n\nAnd NT25 is 't10'; NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT70.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30.\n\nNT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35.\n\nND69 \u2192 't5'; NT35 \u2192 NT9.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to parse the string step by step, I can look for the entire parse tree or use the fact that each production is a symbol and check if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nWait, the string length is 43 tokens. Each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the parse tree for a string of length N would have N leaves, and the number of nodes would be 2N-1. So, for 43 tokens, the parse tree would have 85 nodes. But I doubt I can handle that manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each 't' in the string is derived from some NT, and see if the sequence of 't's can be produced by combining the NTs.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs and their definitions:\n\n1. NT70 \u2192 t17\n2. NT69 \u2192 t5\n3. NT63 \u2192 t9\n4. NT25 \u2192 t10\n5. NT36 \u2192 t25 t70\n   - t25 is NT25 \u2192 t10; t70 \u2192 t17. So NT36 \u2192 t10 t17.\n6. NT48 \u2192 t25 t39\n   - t25 \u2192 t10; t39 \u2192 NT21 NT70. NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT30. NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35, which is t5 and NT35. NT35 \u2192 NT68 NT49. NT68 \u2192 t3; NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 \u2192 t9; NT66 \u2192 t6. So NT35 \u2192 t3 t6. Then, NT21 \u2192 t5 t3 t6; NT70 \u2192 t17. So NT21 NT70 \u2192 t5 t3 t6 t17. Therefore, NT48 \u2192 t10 (from t25) t5 t3 t6 t17 \u2192 't10 t5 t3 t6 t17'.\n7. NT44 \u2192 nt3 nt26\n   - NT3 \u2192 NT35 nt55. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled, maybe I should track specific paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check each 't' in the string and see if there's a corresponding NT.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5, t3, t4, t3, t4, t4, t9, t9, t10, t21, t6, t36, t10, t7, t3, t4, t4, t33, t4, t10, t5, t17, t4, t33, t4, t5, t3, t4, t26, t36, t4, t4, t12, t28, t4, t4.\n\nLet me list the 't's and see if any of them are directly produced by the NTs.\n\nLooking for 't9':\n\nIn the grammar, NT63 \u2192 't9'.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars such that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes parsing more straightforward, but for the purpose of this problem, I just need to figure out if the given string can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that all nonterminals (like NT and T) are broken down into other nonterminals until they reach the terminals (like 'tX'). The start symbol is S, and the production for S is NT56 NT45. So the string must be the leftmost derivation of this production.\n\nI need to analyze the string and see if it can be generated step by step from S. The string is quite long: t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t17 t4 t17 t4 t3 t4 t29 t33 t17 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t29 t33 t27 t34 t3 t4 t4 t33 t33 t4 t29 t33 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4.\n\nWait, but let me look again. The grammar has nonterminals like NT56, NT55, etc., which have productions that split into other nonterminals. Each of these nonterminals has specific productions, such as NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45, NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 or NT44 NT56, etc.\n\nI think the best approach is to start with the top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string token by token. Alternatively, since the string is long, maybe I can analyze the structure of the grammar and the possible sequences to see if the string makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the possible sequences of nonterminals expanding into the terminals. For instance, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then I need to see if NT56 and NT45 can generate the starting tokens of the string.\n\nLooking at NT56, the productions are:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT56 \u2192 NT6 NT45\n\nSo NT56 can split into either NT69 and NT44 or NT6 and NT45. Looking at the string, the first token is t9. Let's check the productions that result in t9.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT45 \u2192 t4, NT70 \u2192 t17, NT69 \u2192 t5, and NT35 \u2192 t9. Oh, here's NT35 \u2192 t9. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t9, so how do we get t9?\n\nWait, perhaps the production for NT35 is NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3, which then leads to t9. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3.\n\nNow, NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26.\n\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I need to look for any nonterminals that directly produce a terminal symbol matching the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see which nonterminals directly produce 't'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT35 \u2192 t9\n- NT22 \u2192 t0? Wait, no, 't22' is a token, but the grammar's NT22 has a production? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT22 \u2192 NT1 NT21. So perhaps NT22 is used in the middle of the string. The string starts with t9, so I'm trying to see how to get t9 from somewhere.\n\nLooking at NT35: it has a production NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for nonterminals that produce 't3' or 't9' directly.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66\n- NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49\n- NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39\n- NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT63\n- NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\n- NT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\n- NT36 \u2192 NT47 NT20\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see the string starts with t9 t9. So perhaps the production NT35 \u2192 t9 can be used, but then how do we get the next t9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the count of certain terminals makes sense. For instance, in CNF, each production appends exactly one terminal or splits further. But in this case, it's more complex because each nonterminal may consist of two nonterminals until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Then NT45 can produce t4, so the first token might be t4, but the string starts with t9. So that's a problem. Alternatively, NT45 might produce a nonterminal that produces t9.\n\nWait, looking at NT45 \u2192 t4. That means NT45 directly produces t4, so the start string would have t4 as the second token if S \u2192 NT56 t4. But the first token is t9, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me double-check: S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Now, each of these nonterminals can expand further.\n\nLooking at NT56: it can go to NT69 NT44 or NT6 NT45.\n\nIf we take the first branch, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 t5, and NT44 \u2192 t3? Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT44 doesn't appear in the list, but wait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT44: let me check. Hmm, in the grammar provided, the nonterminals like NT44 aren't directly producing terminals. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t36\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n- NT26 \u2192 t29\n- NT20 \u2192 t6\n- NT20 \u2192 t34\n- NT46 \u2192 t4\n- NT39 \u2192 t21\n- NT21 \u2192 t13\n- NT49 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t3\n- NT36 \u2192 t25\n- NT70 \u2192 t17\n- NT45 \u2192 t4\n- NT18 \u2192 t32\n- NT35 \u2192 t9\n- NT70 \u2192 t7\n- NT71 \u2192 t14\n- NT25 \u2192 t10\n- NT36 \u2192 t26\n- NT10 \u2192 t28\n- NT71 \u2192 t7\n- NT20 \u2192 t34\n- NT46 \u2192 t4\n- NT39 \u2192 t21\n- NT22 \u2192 t0?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the initial step.\n\nLet me try to draw the derivation tree.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 has two productions: NT69 NT44 and NT6 NT45.\n\nLet's choose the second option: NT56 \u2192 NT6 NT45.\n\nNow, NT6 and NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT6 \u2192 NT1 NT22.\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 NT1 nt22.\n\nThen NT22 \u2192 NT1 nt21.\n\nSo far, the expansion is S \u2192 NT6 NT45 \u2192 NT1 NT22 NT45 \u2192 NT1 NT22 NT45.\n\nWait, this seems messy, as each expansion could produce more nonterminals, and I have to track each down to terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-682","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, Chomsky Normal Form actually specifies that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, I see all the productions are either two non-terminals on each side, like S -> NT56 NT56, or they produce a terminal like S itself? Wait, no, looking closely, the initial rule is S -> NT56 NT45. So S is replaced by two non-terminals. But then, looking further, there are rules like NT70 -> 't5', which indicates terminals. So that's good because terminals are the end of derivations.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t9 t9 t2 t6 t3 t4 t36 t4 t4 t4 t33 t17 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t33 t4 t4 t24 t13 t29 t5 t3 t4 t29 t17 t4 t3 t4 t29 t33 t4 t33 t29 t4`. That's a long string, but each token separated by spaces. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing. But I'm not very familiar with implementing CYK, so maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be constructed step by step by looking at the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that lead to terminals:\n\n- NT70 -> 't5'\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT65 -> 't24' (Wait, looking back, I don't see NT65. Let me check the productions again.)\nWait, the productions include NT3 -> 't24', NT5 -> 't37', NT1 -> 't24', etc. So each rule eventually leads to a terminal, either directly or through other non-terminals.\n\nSo each symbol in the string must eventually be derived from these terminal symbols. The string is t9, t9, etc., so I need to check if t9 can be derived from any non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT9 ->... Wait, no, let's look. The NT68 production is nt68->t3. NT68 also appears in other productions, like NT36->nt26 naively, but let me check all the definitions.\n\nWait, the NT69 production: NT69 -> NT63 NT49. NT63 is 't9' because NT63 -> 't9'. So NT69 can produce 't9' when NT49 is resolved.\n\nLooking at NT49: NT49 -> NT22 NT66. NT22 -> 't4' (from NT22->t4). NT66 -> 't6' (from NT66->t6). Wait, is that correct? Wait, in the rules, NT66 is listed as NT66 -> t6? Let me check again.\n\nIn the given rules, looking for NT66: Yes, I see NT66 -> 't6'. So that means NT66 produces 't6'.\n\nBut wait, NT66 also appears in other places, like NT48->nt25 nt39, not directly relevant here.\n\nSo going back to NT49: 't4' (from NT22) and 't6' (from NT66). So NT49 -> t4 t6, which is 't4t6'. So when we look at NT49, it produces 't4t6', which is not 't9'. Wait, but earlier I thought NT69 produces 't9' through NT63->t9.\n\nWait, let me correct that: NT69 produces NT63 and NT49. NT63 is 't9', and NT49 is 't4t6', so NT69-> t9 t4t6, which is like 't9t4t6'. But in our string, it's 't9t9...', so that might not fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to find which non-terminals can produce the required terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt9, t9, t2, t6, t3, t4, t36, t4, t4, t4, t33, t17, etc.\n\nStart from the beginning.\n\nFirst symbol is t9. So which non-terminals produce 't9'? Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT63 -> 't9' and NT68 -> 't3'. Also, NT2 -> t12. Is NT18->t32, which is not. Let's check all NTs that produce 't9' or other relevant terminals.\n\nWait, in the rules:\n\n- NT63 -> t9\n- NT36 -> t36 can also produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nThe rules include:\n\n- NT63 -> 't9'\nSo NT63 directly produces t9.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 -> 't4'. So if we have t4, it must be derived from NT22.\n\nNow, looking at the production rules that involve t9, t17, etc.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string, the first token is t9, which is produced by NT63.\n\nSo, we start with NT63.\n\nSo, the first step is:\n\nS -> NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, each of these must be derived.\n\nLooking at NT56 and NT45.\n\nNT56 has multiple productions. Let's find one that produces 't9'.\n\nLooking through NT56:\n\nNT56->NT69 NT44.\n\nSo if nt56 is derived as NT56 -> NT69 NT44, then each part must be analyzed.\n\nNow, NT69 is defined as NT63 NT49, which is t9 and ... Let's see, NT49 is NT22 NT66, which is t4 and t6. So NT69 -> t9 t4 t6, which is a 3-token sequence: 't9t4t6'.\n\nBut in our string, we have 't9 t9' as the first two tokens, which doesn't match 't9 t4 t6'.\n\nAlternatively, looking for other NT56 productions. Let\u2019s see if there's another way NT56 can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT56:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45\n- NT55 -> NT44 NT56\n- Does NT56 have any other productions? Checking: Only the first one. So NT56 must be nt56 -> nt69 nt44.\n\nThen, nt69 is nt63 nt49, which is t9 and t4t6, so t9 t4 t6.\n\nSo our string starts with t9, so maybe the way is:\n\nS->NT56 NT45.\n\nLet's see what NT45 produces. Looking at NT45: NT45->t4. So that's fine.\n\nSo now, S produces nt56 (which is nt69 nt44) and nt45.\n\nSo nt69 is t9 t4t6, and nt45 is t4.\n\nBut then, S would expand to t9 t4t6 t4. But the string starts with t9 t9, which doesn't match.\n\nSo that's a problem. Maybe we're going down the wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial rule is S->NT56 NT45.\n\nLet\u2019s explore NT56->..., but let's see all its productions.\n\nWait, looking at the rules for NT56:\n\nNT56->NT69 NT44.\n\nThat's the only production for NT56. So NT56 must produce NT69 followed by NT44.\n\nThus, if our start is S->NT56 NT45, then NT56 produces nt69 and nt44, leading to 't9 t4 t6' (because NT69 -> t9 t4 t6 and NT44 -> t4). Wait, no: NT44 is derived from... looking at NT44's rules. Oh, wait NT44 is only in higher productions.\n\nWait, no: NT44 is a non-terminal. Its productions are:\n\nNT44->NT3 NT26.\n\nSo NT44 would have to be decomposed into NT3 and NT26. NT3 is t24.\n\nSo NT44 would"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and one on the right, or a terminal symbol on the left and two non-terminals on the right. Wait, no, actually in CNF, the productions are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So this grammar fits that structure because all productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string we have to evaluate is a series of 't' terms followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, it seems that each 't' is part of certain productions. My first thought is to parse the string according to the grammar step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt5 t17 t4 t9 t0 t6 t17 t4 t29 t27 t34 t1 t24 t26 t0 t6 t37 t20 t6 t14 t17 t6 t36 t25 t36 t29 t4 t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t32 t34 t4 t4.\n\nI think the approach is to find a path from the start symbol S to this string. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is the start, and it's replaced by NT56 and NT45. Each of these NTs must then be replaced, eventually producing the terminals that make up the string.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions. Each NT in the grammar can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So, each NT is either a terminal or another production. Since the string consists entirely of terminals, each NT in the derivation must eventually produce a terminal symbol.\n\nI should look at each NT and see what they can expand into. For example, NT56 can expand to NT69 and NT44. Looking at what NT69 and NT44 produce... NT69 can stay as NT69 and NT44 or produce a terminal 't5'. Wait, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So both have to be expanded. NT63 is another NT that needs to produce terminals.\n\nThis seems quite complex because the string is long, and the grammar has many non-terminals. The string starts with t5, which is NT63's production, as NT63 \u2192 NT69 NT46, but wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT63 has multiple productions, such as NT63 \u2192 NT69 NT46 and also NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, but NT63 is part of NT56's expansion, which is t33 (from NT56 \u2192 t33? Wait no, NT56 is part of the initial expansion.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me take it step by step. Each symbol in the string is either a terminal or derived from a production that eventually leads to a terminal. So, starting with S, which is Nt56 NT45. So, the string has to be a sequence of terminals generated by NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few terms are t5, t17, t4, t9, t0, etc. So, let's see the first part. The initial part is t5 t17 t4. So, starting with NT56, which should produce t33, but in our string, the first 't' is t5. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT56 produces a terminal t something. Wait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for production from NT56. The rules given include:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- ...\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT56 production:\n\nIn the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nWait, so NT56 can't produce a terminal directly. So that's a problem because the string starts with t5 as the first symbol, which is a terminal, but if NT56 expands to another two NTs, then how does the string begin with a terminal?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, wait, the grammar might have other productions. Looking through the entire grammar, I see:\n\nNT45 is part of S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nBut in the grammar, does NT45 produce a terminal? Let me scan for NT45's productions.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39,\n\nNT4 -> 't37', but that's another NT.\n\nWait, do any of the NTs directly produce a terminal like 't5'?\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't27', NT21 \u2192 't13', NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29', NT36 \u2192 't25', etc., but none produce 't5'. Wait, maybe the 't5' is part of NT50, but in the grammar, NT50's productions are:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT54 NT8,\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT25 NT4,\n\nWait, but looking further, I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nBut I'm trying to find where 't5' comes from. Oh, looking here:\n\nThe grammar has NT56 \u2192 't33'? Wait, no, the production is NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So no. But wait, looking deeper, I see NT1 \u2192 't24', NT59 \u2192 't34', NT71 \u2192 't14', etc. But 't5' isn't directly appearing in any of the NT productions. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, looking through all the NTs, I don't see any NTs that produce 't5' as a terminal. So how can the string start with 't5'? Unless I've misread the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check the list again. The grammar rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44,\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8,\n\nWait, is 't5' present as a terminal in any production? Scanning through, I see:\n\nLooking at all 't' productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (from NT63 rules),\n\nNT48 \u2192 't4' (from NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39, but then NT25 \u2192 t10? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, NT25's production is given as NT25 \u2192 NT36 NT39.\n\nLooking further, NT36 can produce 't25' or other things.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach: can the 't5' in the string come from NT23 or something? But I don't see that in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't5'? Let me look:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT with a \u2192 't5'. The closest is NT18 \u2192 't27', NT21 \u2192 't13', NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29', etc.\n\nWait, does that mean that the string starts with 't5', but there's no corresponding production for that NT? That would immediately mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because there's no rule that emits 't5' from any NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the entire list of grammar rules:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9',\n\nNT61 \u2192 various.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49,\n\nLooking back, is there any rule that emits 't5' as a terminal?\n\nWait, looking at all the 't's:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17',\n\nNT6 \u2192 't12',\n\nWait, the number after each 't' is a number, but the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produces 't5'. So, if the string has the first symbol as 't5', that would require that NT56 or some NT that expands to a terminal starts with 't5', but I don't see that.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first 't' is 't5', but there's no rule allowing any NT to produce 't5' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That simplifies things a bit because in CNF, the derivation tree is a full binary tree where each production only splits one non-terminal into two, which relates to the string length and the number of derivations.\n\nFirst, let me parse the grammar provided. It consists of a set of productions where non-terminals (like S, NT1, NT2, etc.) produce a combination of other non-terminals. The terminals in the grammar are 't' followed by numbers, like 't5', 't17', etc. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals:\n\n`t5 t17 t4 t10 t7 t36 t10 t5 t3 t4 t3 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t10 t21 t6 t28 t4 t33 t17 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t29 t33 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4`.\n\nSo, the string has 36 tokens. Since it's in CNF, the leftmost derivation starts with the start symbol S and each step replaces one non-terminal with two others. The total number of symbols in the string should be 2^n where n is the number of derivations, but since the string is a series of terminals, the end of the derivation should result in all non-terminals being expanded into terminals.\n\nIn CNF, the length of any string generated is 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. But the string here has 36 symbols, which is not a power of 2 (since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64). Wait, that's a problem. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the production rules allow for some structure that isn't purely binary, but given it's CNF, all productions result in two symbols. So the only way to get a terminal is through a production that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. So each step doubles the number of symbols. But in practice, the number of terminals can vary but must be related to the initial symbols. However, the key thing is that the number of terminals generated through a series of derivations will be 2^n where n is the number of steps. So for n steps, the string length would be 2^n. But 36 isn't a power of two, which suggests that perhaps the string isn't in the language because it's impossible to derive a string of length 36 through CNF derivations. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here because the string is a sequence of terminals, and the derivation could involve some non-terminals that expand into a certain number of terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar can produce strings of varying lengths as long as they conform to the structure.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production replaces one non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. So starting from S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is two symbols. Then each of those can be non-terminals that produce two more each, leading to four, then eight, etc. But any terminal in the string would have to come from a production where the non-terminal directly expands into a terminal. However, looking at the given grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17', and others like NT69 \u2192 't5', NT56 \u2192 't33', etc.\n\nSo the key point is that to reach a terminal, a non-terminal must have a production that ends with a terminal. So for the string given, it's a series of 't' followed by numbers. Each of these must correspond to some terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut let's check what non-terminals produce what terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\nNT69 \u2192 't5'\nNT56 \u2192 't33'\nNT71 \u2192 't14' (Wait, but in the given grammar, I see NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35, which then would go on to produce 't5' and something else. Or does it have a direct terminal? Let me check.)\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, let me list out the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3 \u2192 Wait, no, that's NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. Hmm, that's two non-terminals. Let me check each production:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT25 NT8 \u2192 NT25 and NT8\nNT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8 \u2192 NT25 and NT8\nNT25 \u2192 NT10\nNT45 \u2192 't4' (Yes)\nNT10 \u2192 't28' (Wait, is NT10 a terminal or a non-terminal? Looking back, the grammar doesn't list NT10 \u2192 something; instead, it's used as a production in NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, and others. So I think NT10 is a non-terminal. Wait, looking through all the productions, does any production have a NT10 on the right-hand side?\n\nYes, for example, NT66 \u2192 NT10, so NT66 is a non-terminal. So the only terminals are those directly produced by non-terminals, such as 't5', 't17', etc.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I find:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT50 \u2192 't3' (Wait, looking at the grammar again: NT50 is involved in several productions, but does it ever directly produce a terminal?\n\nLooking through the productions, the only direct terminals are:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't33' (Yes)\nNT35 \u2192 't9' (Wait, does NT35 have a production that goes to a terminal? NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. Both NT42 and NT3 are non-terminals, not terminals. So NT35 doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, let me go through all non-terminals and check which ones have direct terminal productions:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' \u2192 terminal\n- NT69 \u2192 't5' \u2192 terminal\n- NT56 \u2192 't33' \u2192 terminal\n- NT55 \u2192 NT22 NT66 \u2192 non-terminals\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8 \u2192 non-terminals; but does NT25 or NT8 produce terminals?\n\nFrom the grammar, I need to check NT45 \u2192 't4', which is a terminal. So NT45 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't4'. Similarly, other non-terminals may produce terminals:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't25', 't39', etc.? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39 \u2192 non-terminals, but NT25 and NT39 may produce terminals or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT69 \u2192 't5'\n- NT56 \u2192 't33'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- Any others?\n\nLet's check NT25 \u2192 NT10, which is used elsewhere, but isn't a terminal. Similarly, NT45 \u2192 't4' directly.\n\nOther terminals:\n\nLooking again, are there any others?\n\nNT2 \u2192 't12'\nNT13 \u2192 't24'\nNT34 \u2192 't24'\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\nNT25 \u2192 non-term\nNT22 \u2192 non-term\nNT4 \u2192 't37'\nNT28 \u2192 't36'\nNT7 \u2192 't24'\nNT1 \u2192 't24'\nNT59 \u2192 't34'\nNT70 \u2192 't17' (already counted)\nNT69 \u2192 't5' (counted)\nNT56 \u2192 't33'\nNT45 \u2192 't4'\nAre there any others?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 Not listed as a terminal, so probably not.\n- NT33 \u2192 Not a terminal in any production.\n- So the terminals are 't4', 't5', 't17', 't33', 't12', 't24', 't3', 't36', 't25', etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't5'\u2014which is directly produced by NT69 \u2192 't5'. The second is 't17' from NT70 \u2192 't17'. The third is 't4' from NT45 \u2192 't4', and so on.\n\nSo each terminal in the string must be the result of a direct production where a non-terminal expands to that 't' + number.\n\nNow, for"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-700","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t5 t17 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t17 t4 t29 t5 t17 t4 t29 t29 t4 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t36 t4 t4 t4 t33 t4 t10 t21 t6 t28 t4 t4.\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar's terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and some other symbols. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals like NT1, NT2, etc., produce terminals, but some produce other non-terminals.\n\nLet me list out all the terminals present in the grammar:\n- t5, t17, t4, t36, t29, t8, t7, t13, t27, t26, t6, t9, t56, t45, t33, t42, t39, t35, t54, t68, t61, t69, t70, t6, t30, t18, t34, t71, t25, t7, t36, t70, etc.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should parse the grammar correctly. Each production ends with a terminal, which is a word starting from 't' or sometimes just 't' with numbers. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17' etc.\n\nThe string given has a sequence of t's followed by numbers. So each token in the string is of the form 'tX', where X is a number.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step using the productions. Since the string is quite long, it might be time-consuming, but maybe I can find a pattern or figure out the structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string using the grammar. Each token in the string corresponds to a production. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, we need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nLooking at the structure of the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. So S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nEach of these NTs (Non-terminals) produce other terms. Let's see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT45 \u2192 NT4 NT5\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 (NT69 NT44) (NT4 NT5)\n\nEach of these would expand further. Let's see what NT69 and NT44 produce.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\nSo S becomes: NT69 NT44 NT4 NT5 \u2192 (NT63 NT49) (NT3 NT26) (NT4 NT5)\n\nContinuing:\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9' (terminal)\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\nSo now: NT63 \u2192 t9, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, NT4 \u2192 t4 (from NT4 \u2192 't4')\nNT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49 (since NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can represent the entire derivation as a tree, but given the string's length, it might take too long. Alternatively, I can approach the problem by parsing the string using the grammar's productions.\n\nParsing strategies include methods like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a more manual approach, maybe I can try to match the string token by token.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the first part is NT56 and then NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 t9\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t5, not t9. So if S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 starts with NT69 (which is t9 in t69...), but the string starts with t5. That seems to be a conflict.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: in the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'\n\nSo the initial expansion of NT56 is t9 followed by NT44, which is NT3 NT26.\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nNow NT3 is NT36 \u2192 't36' ?\n\nWait, NT3 is actually NT50 \u2192 NT69 NT44 again? Wait, no, looking back, NT50 is \u2192 NT25 NT8, but the initial NT56 is \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules produce other non-terminals, and some produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nBut in the initial S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which then breaks down into NT56 being \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9'\n\nSo S \u2192 t9 NT44 ... But the string starts with t5, which is much later.\n\nThis suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps the first non-terminal in S is NT56, which leads to t9, but the string starts with t5.\n\nThat indicates a potential problem. Maybe the initial step is correct, but perhaps I'm missing some steps. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t5, which is the result of NT5 \u2192 't5' or another non-terminal. Let me check the grammar for NT5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45.\n\nBut wait, NT5 \u2192 ...

Perhaps I should list all the non-terminals and their productions to see if I can find a way to get to t5 in the string.\n\nThe string starts with t5, so somewhere in the derivation, we must have a production that produces 't5'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nWhich non-terminals produce 't5'?\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't33' and 't4'\n- NT45 \u2192 't44' has some productions, but 't5' isn't directly a terminal of any, except perhaps through non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait: Let me check each rule for NT.\n\nLooking at NT5:\n\nWait, in the list of grammar rules, I don't see a NT5 \u2192 't5'.

The string is `t9 t15 t36 t1 t26 t14 t17 t34 t17 t4 t4 t36 t29 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t4 t26 t17 t4 t33 t4 t9 t9 t10 t21 t6 t3 t4 t26 t36 t29 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier to parse, especially with algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since this is a thought process, I'll try to manually find a derivation path.\n\nChomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a context-free grammar where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all productions seem to fit this structure, confirming it's in CNF.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, which likely correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. Each production is a combination of two non-terminals. My task is to see if the string can result from a series of such productions.\n\nI'll start by identifying the longest possible non-terminals that match the terminals in the string. However, the string is quite long, and manually trying each production might be time-consuming. Perhaps I can look for some patterns or key nodes.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 can produce 't4' and 't29'. Similarly, NT17 can produce 't14' and 't17', among others. I notice that 't9' appears multiple times and is produced by several non-terminals, like NT69, NT56, NT55, NT36, and others.\n\nLet me try to backtrack from the string's end. The string ends with `... t33 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4`. So, the last part is t33 followed by t4 and t4. Let's see if any production ends with these.\n\nLooking at NT26: `NT26 -> NT36 NT3` and `-> t4`. Wait, NT26 can produce 't4' (as seen from NT26 -> t4), so perhaps the last few symbols can be derived from NT26.\n\nWait, let me check NT26's productions: In the grammar, I see that NT26 -> NT36 NT3 and -> t4. Also, looking at NT26, other productions like NT26 -> t29 (I think I saw that in the provided rules; NT26 -> t29 is listed). So, the last part is t33 t4 t4 t33 t4 t4.\n\nHmm, trying to find a non-terminal that can produce 't33 t4 t4'. Let me check NT33. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT33, but maybe another non-terminal can produce that sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps NT57 is a typo, and I'm supposed to look at existing nodes. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me take a step back.\n\nInstead of looking at the end, let's start from the beginning. The first symbol is t9. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't9'? Let's see:\n\n- NT50: produces 't25', 't8', and 't3' (based on rules like NT50 -> NT25 NT8, and others have 't8' and 't3' as terminals). So perhaps NT50 can produce 't37' (if I'm not mistaken, but that's 't37'\u2014maybe looking at that wrong).\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't27'\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't29'\n- NT20 -> 't6'\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT50 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't24'\n- NT34 -> 't24'\n- NT68 -> 't3'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT49 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't17'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT70 -> 't17' (I see this twice, but that's correct)\n- NT69 -> 't5'\n- NT8 -> 't13'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT50 -> 't20'\n- NT48 -> 't2'\n- NT18 -> 't32'\n- NT35 -> 't9'\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT71 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't10'\n- NT36 -> 't26'\n- NT10 -> 't28'\n- NT71 -> 't7'\n- NT20 -> 't34'\n- NT46 -> 't4'\n- NT39 -> 't21'\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT2 -> 't12'\n- NT13 -> 't1'\n\nFrom this, the non-terminals that produce 't9' are:\n\n- NT63, because NT63->'t9'\n- NT35, because NT35->'t9'\n\nOther non-terminals with 't9' are NT18? Wait, no, NT18 is 't27'. So only NT63 and NT35 produce 't9'.\n\nSo the first symbol is t9, which must come from NT63 or NT35.\n\nLet's consider NT63 first. Looking at the grammar, NT63's production are:\n\nLooking for NT63's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT63 -> NT8 NT46, and also NT66 -> 't6', NT26 -> 't4' and 't29'. Wait, in the provided rules, I don't see an NT63 production explicitly listed, but I can check.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, so I need to carefully check each rule. Let me go through the rules line by line:\n\nThe user's grammar:\n\nLooking for NT63, I see lines like NT69 -> 't5', NT8 -> 't13', NT56 -> 't33', etc. I don't see a rule for NT63, so perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong. Therefore, maybe the first symbol t9 is from NT35, since looking at the rules, NT35 -> 't9' is one of its productions.\n\nWait, in the rules, looking for NT35:\n\nYes, I see NT35 -> NT42 NT3. But NT42 is another non-terminal. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I think I should list all the non-terminals and their possible replacements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for sequences of non-terminals that can generate the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm is the way to go, but considering the string is quite long, perhaps a better approach is to look for possible structures.\n\nLet me consider that the first symbol is t9, which must come from either NT63 or NT35.\n\nIn the rules, NT35's production is NT35 -> NT42 NT3. So, from NT35, we can get two symbols: the output of NT42 and the output of NT3.\n\nSimilarly, NT63's production is NT63 -> NT8 NT46. NT8 is a terminal 't13' and NT46 is a terminal 't4'.\n\nWait, in the rules, I think I see:\n\nNT46 -> 't4'\n\nWait, wait, looking back, I might have missed some rules. In the provided rules, let me check:\n\nLooking for 't4' terminals, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT8 -> 't13' (no, that's 't13')\n- NT46 -> 't4' (I think I might have noticed that earlier)\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT18 -> 't32'\n- NT36 -> 't26'\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT21 -> 't13'\n- NT48 -> 't24'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT66 -> 't6'\n- NT20 -> 't6' (is that correct?

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing techniques like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to trace possible derivations.\n\nBut manually expanding this might be complex. Perhaps a better approach is to reverse-engineer the process. The string starts with t5 and ends with t4 t4 t4. Looking at the grammar, t5 is produced by NT70, which in turn is produced by NT61. So the string must go through NT61.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5, which comes from NT70. NT70 is derived from NT61 via production NT61 \u2192 NT26 NT36. Wait, no, looking back at the productions:\n\nNT70 has a production: NT70 -> 't17', so NT70 \u2192 t17. So the initial 't5' must come from NT70, meaning the start symbol S must derive through a chain of productions that ultimately produce t5 at the root.\n\nBut let me check the provided productions again. Looking through the NTs, I see NT70 \u2192 't17', which would produce t17. But the string starts with t5, not t17. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT70 has another production: NT70 \u2192 't7'. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, I check the lines:\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I find NT70 has NT70 -> 't17' and also NT70 -> 't7'. So two options: NT70 can be either 't17' or 't7'. Wait, but in the string, it starts with t5, which isn't directly produced by NT70. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the start non-terminal S is being used to produce t5 at the end. Let's see: the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 and NT45. So the first step is S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, let's look at NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT45 (but no, NT63 is actually NT63 \u2192 something else. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT63: NT63 \u2192 NT45. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me go line by line:\n\nThe grammar provided has:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\n... [many others]\nNT63 -> NT45? Or not? Wait, in the initial list, I see:\n\nLooking through, NT63 \u2192 't9', no, let me find each NT:\n\nLooking through the lines, for NT63, it's this:\nNT63 -> 't9' (from the line NT63 -> 't9').\n\nWait, no, the user provided a list where some lines have non-terminals, like NT63 -> NT45, etc. Let me check the user's grammar input again:\n\nThe user wrote the grammar lines, each line is like S -> NT56 NT45, etc. So it's in the form of NTX -> Y Z or NTX -> 'term'.\n\nSo for NT63, looking through each line, I see: \"NT63 -> NT45\" and \"NT63 -> 't9'\". So actually, NT63 can produce either NT45 or 't9'. Similarly, other NTs have similar options.\n\nWait, maybe my initial parsing was wrong. So let's be precise: for each NT, we check if it's a two-step production (NTX -> Y Z) or a terminal production (NTX -> 'term').\n\nSo for example, NT70 has two productions: NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT70 \u2192 't7'. So it's a two productions, but they produce different terminals. That's confusing because typically, each non-terminal would have one production, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the input, or maybe it's correct that NT70 can go to either t17 or t7. Alternatively, perhaps the productions are listed in a way that allows multiple possibilities.\n\nBut if that's the case, then in the string, the initial t5 might have to come from some NT that can derive t5. Let me see how t5 is generated elsewhere.\n\nLooking through, I see NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50 and maybe other productions, but also NT31 \u2192 NT50. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's look for t5 in the grammar. t5 appears in several places as a terminal:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't9' and 't25', etc., but looking specifically for t5, I see:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar lines, for example, NT26: NT26 \u2192 't6' and 't29', etc. Wait, but I don't see any NT directly producing 't5' except possibly looking again.\n\nWait, looking through each line, I see NT70 has 't17' and 't7'; NT55 has 't44' and 't56'; NT50 has 't25' and 't3'. NT36 has 't9', 't25', etc. Looking further, I see NT3: NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46 and also NT3 \u2192 something else? Wait, no, I think NT3 can produce NT68 NT46, or perhaps NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5, but I'm not seeing a direct 't5' production. Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, looking through all the lines, I think 't5' only appears in NT1 \u2192 't24', but that's 't24', not 't5'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at all the lines again. Let me search the grammar for any NT production that includes 't5' as a terminal. Looking through the lines:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5: Wait, this is NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5. So that's a production: NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT5.\n\nWait, so NT3 can produce NT55 and NT5. But is NT55 a terminal? Let's see: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 and NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56. So those are both NT productions.\n\nWait, but does any NT produce 't5'?

{"custom_id":"request-742","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t9 t9 t2 t6 t17 t4 t33 t24 t6 t28 t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t4 t33 t24 t4 t9 t24 t26 t15 t10 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t4\". \n\nFirst, I need to recall how Chomsky Normal Form works. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure makes it easier to parse strings and generate them, often using a stack-based approach but that might not be my concern here.\n\nBut in this case, instead of writing a parser, I might need to trace the derivation of the string step by step. The string consists of a series of terminal symbols (t's with numbers), so I need to see if these terminals can be generated from the non-terminals using the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's extensive with all these production rules. My first thought is to see if I can build a parse tree for the string, ensuring that every terminal in the string is matched by some production. Since the string is quite long, it might be tedious, but perhaps I can look for patterns or key production rules that would help me.\n\nI should start by identifying how the terminals are generated. For example, some terminals are directly produced by non-terminals. Take NT56 \u2192 t33, as given. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 t24. So, t33 and t24 are directly generated. However, not all terminals are directly produced. Some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, leading to a chain until a terminal is produced.\n\nTo approach this, I might start from the beginning of the string and see if I can find a production that can lead to the first few symbols. The first symbol is t9. So, looking at the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals produce t9.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT56 -> t33, but that's 't33' at the end, maybe not helpful for 't9'.\n- NT35 -> NT42 NT3. 't9' wasn't directly produced here.\n- NT36 -> NT25 NT70, and NT36 is also directly T24. But maybe that's a detour.\n- Wait, let me see: looking for NT that produce t9.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT35 -> NT42 NT3. NT42 isn't t9, but NT3 is 't24's parent. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, somewhere in the grammar: Let me check NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (or could produce t5. Because NT49 also has a \u2192 t15. Hmm, maybe NT49 can produce 't15' eventually. But that's getting far.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at NT35 again: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. If NT42 leads to somewhere, but NT3 is t24. Perhaps not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's look at the first symbol 't9' in the string. To produce 't9', which non-terminals directly produce it? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3 (but 't9' is not here)\n- NT15 \u2192 NT70 \u2192 't7' (not 9)\n- Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. But NT63 \u2192 t9. So NT69 can produce t9. Oh, so NT69 \u2192 t9 is not directly, because NT69\u2192NT63 NT49, so NT69 can derive t9 through NT63 \u2192 t9.\n\nWait, actually, NT63 produces t9. So a production such as NT69 -> t9 would be missing, but instead, it's NT63 -> t9, so NT69 must go through NT63 and then to t9.\n\nSo, for the first 't9' in the string, it must come from some production that eventually leads to t9, which is via NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, then NT63 \u2192 t9.\n\nSo for the first t9, let's see which non-terminal it can come from. So perhaps S can produce NT56 and NT45. So S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So if the entire string starts with NT56 or NT45. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t9, so maybe one of the non-terminals produces t9.\n\nWait, no, the production S\u2192NT56 NT45 would mean that S derives into two non-terminals, both of which must be expanded into strings. But the string is a flat sequence of terminals, so perhaps the order doesn't matter, but the count must match.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to represent the string as a series of non-terminals that ultimately derive into the correct terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the start symbol S: S-> NT56 NT45, so each string generated by S must be the concatenation of the strings derived by NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut looking at the string provided, it's 41 symbols long, so that would mean that NT56 would derive a string of k symbols, and NT45 would derive a string of (41 -k) symbols, for some k <=41.\n\nBut looking at NT56 and NT45, their production rules are:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 t9\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nSo NT56's derivation would be:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\n\u2192 NT63 NT49 NT44\n\n\u2192 t9 NT49 NT44\n\nNow, NT49 \u2192 t15\n\n\u2192 t9 t15 NT44\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\n\u2192 t9 t15 NT3 NT26\n\nNT3 \u2192 t24\n\n\u2192 t9 t15 t24 NT26\n\nNT26 \u2192 t4 (in one case) or NT29 in another (but I see NT26 \u2192 t29 as well? Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT26 \u2192 t4 and also NT26 \u2192 t29.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t4\n\nAh, so in the rule for NT26, it's either t4 or t29?

{"custom_id":"request-741","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals, making it easier to parse, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm. But wait, I'm not sure if I can use CYK here since I'm just supposed to determine existence manually, but maybe I can structure my thoughts.\n\nFirst, I should look at the string and see how it might break down into the non-terminals in the grammar. The string is: `t9 t0 t6 t3 t4 t3 t4 t29 t5 t17 t4 t4 t17 t4 t33 t4 t9 t15 t3 t4 t4 t4 t33 t4 t10 t17 t17 t4 t9 t9 t24 t6 t36 t4 t4 t29 t4 t33 t4 t4`. That's a lot of tokens, most of them are 't' plus a number. Looking at the grammar, many NTs are converting into 't' with numbers, so maybe the entire string is a derivation from the start symbol S, which produces NT56 and NT45.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be constructed by the rules. Let's start from the top:\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string should be made by concatenating the strings generated by NT56 and NT45. So the entire string is the combination of NT56's derivation and NT45's.\n\nLooking up NT56 in the grammar: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So NT56's string is NT69's string and NT44's string, concatenated.\n\nNow, NT69: from the rules, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT69's string is NT63 and NT49.\n\nNT63: NT63 \u2192 't9' (direct production), so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, NT49: let's see, in the grammar, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. So NT49's string is NT22 and NT66.\n\nNT22: From the rules, NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. So NT22's string is NT63 (which is 't9') and NT48.\n\nNT48: NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. So NT48's string is NT25 and NT39.\n\nNT25 \u2192 't10' (direct production). NT39 \u2192 't21' (direct production). So NT48's string is 't10 t21'.\n\nPutting this together, NT22's string is 't9 t10 t21'.\n\nThen, NT49's string is NT22 (which we now know is 't9 t10 t21') and NT66. Now, looking at NT66: in the grammar, NT66 \u2192 't6'. So NT49's string is 't9 t10 t21 t6'.\n\nSo, going back, NT69's string is NT63 (t9) + NT49 (t9 t10 t21 t6). So NT69 produces 't9 t9 t10 t21 t6'.\n\nNow, going back to NT56: NT69 (t9 t9 t10 t21 t6) + NT44. What's NT44?\n\nLooking at NT44: NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. So NT44's string is NT3 and NT26.\n\nNT3: NT3 \u2192 NT33 (because NT3 is listed as producing NT3 NT55 and NT55, but wait, looking again: the grammar for NT3 is \"NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\", wait no, wait: wait, the lines for NT3 are not in the initial lines, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, the grammar's rules are listed as follows (truncated for brevity, but I think the user provided a list of rules). So looking back, I see that NT3 has a production: NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55? Wait, no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar has a lot of entries. For example, NT3 is listed as several rules, but looking at the full list, I see that NT3 has the rule NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55. That's a problem because that would mean it can't terminate\u2014it's a recursive rule that goes infinitely. Or is there a way for it to terminate?\n\nWait, actually, in the full list:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT3 is given as multiple productions, including NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which suggests that NT3 can split into two NT3s and another NT55? That seems like it would cause loops because NT3 would require another NT3, leading to infinite recursion.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check:\n\nLooking back through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55\nNT5 -> NT1 NT49\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\nNT47 -> NT7 NT21\nNT42 -> NT46 NT68\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\nNT31 -> NT4 NT50\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT39 -> NT21\nNT47 -> NT7 NT21\nNT42 -> NT46 NT68\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\nNT31 -> NT4 NT50\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nWait, perhaps I got the NT3 rules wrong. Let me see: in the initial part of the grammar, the first rules for NT3 are:\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55\nNT50 -> NT3 NT22\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I didn't list all the rules. Let's re-examine the provided grammar:\n\nThe grammar rules start with:\nS -> NT56 NT45\nNT22 -> NT63 NT48\n...\nLooking through the rules until I find NT3:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT3 -> NT3 NT55\nNT5 -> NT1 NT49\nNT36 -> NT25 NT70\nNT47 -> NT7 NT21\nNT42 -> NT46 NT68\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\nNT31 -> NT4 NT50\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT39 -> NT21\nYes, so NT3 has the rule NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55, which is potentially problematic because it can't terminate. But wait, when can NT3 reach a termination?\n\nLooking further, NT3 also has NT3 -> NT25 NT70, but NT25 has a production NT25 \u2192 't10', so if NT3 can reach that, it can terminate. So the question is, does the grammar allow NT3 to derive into something that doesn't involve another NT3?\n\nAh, I see. NT3 also has NT3 \u2192 NT25 NT70, which is a terminal production. So perhaps, depending on the derivation path, NT3 can produce a string of terminals. But then, why is NT3 also given as NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55? That seems like it's part of the same NT3 rule, which would allow for alternative productions.\n\nWait, no, in the context-free grammar, each rule is an alternative. So each line defines a production, but each production is an alternative. For example, NT3 has:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55\n\nand\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would mean NT3 can split into NT3 and NT55, or into NT25 and NT70. So if a derivation for NT3 can eventually reach a string where all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, then it's a valid string.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the key is to see if the given string can be parsed by the grammar, regardless of loops, as long as at least one derivation path exists that terminates in all terminals.\n\nBut wait, the production NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 is an issue because it can cause infinite recursion. If that production is used, NT3 can't terminate unless it eventually uses another production. But since the NT3 rule allows for another option, it might be possible to have a derivation path that doesn't use the problematic production.\n\nSo perhaps, for the purposes of this analysis, I can proceed under the assumption that the grammar can derive the string, focusing on the paths that avoid the problematic recursive production (NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55).\n\nNow, let's go back to the string. The initial part is 't9', which comes from NT63.

{"custom_id":"request-754","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, this seems a bit complex because the grammar is quite large with many non-terminals and productions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string that needs to be evaluated. The string is `t5 t3 t4 t36 t29 t4 t29 t9 t15 t36 t4 t4 t1 t10 t17 t13 t6 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t10 t7 t3 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4 t4`.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My approach should be to build the parse tree for the given string and see if it's derivable from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's recall that in CNF, the entire derivation starts with the start symbol, and each step introduces exactly two non-terminals on the left side. However, given that some productions have terminals, it might be more straightforward to look for direct derivations.\n\nI notice that the start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT56 NT45 (S \u2192 NT56 NT45). So, the initial parse would involve generating two parts: one from NT56 and one from NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. Let's see which production rule results in t5. Scanning through the productions, I see NT70 \u2192 't7', NT71 \u2192 't14', NT69 \u2192 't5', and NT50 \u2192 't3', NT68 \u2192 't3', etc. Wait, actually, a quick scan shows NT68 \u2192 't3' is under 't3', but for t5, I remember NT69 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Then, looking for t5, NT63 \u2192 't9' (from NT63 \u2192 't9'), which doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the productions. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the string starts with t5. Looking for terminals in the grammar:\n\nND69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 \u2192 which resolves to 't9' and other things. Hmm, maybe I should trace back. Let me cross-reference the given string with the productions to see how they can be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse-engineer the string, checking each token and seeing if there's a production that can directly generate it.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't5'. In the grammar, NT69 \u2192 't5'. So, maybe this is from NT69.\n\nBut NT69 is derived from NT63 and NT49. So, the production is NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, the next step is to see if NT63 can produce a terminal. Looking at NT63's productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT69 NT46. Hmm, that's two non-terminals. Alternatively, NT63 \u2192 't9' \u2013 wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT63 having a production that ends with a terminal except for the given:\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Yes, the productions include NT63 \u2192 't9'. So, that's a direct terminal. So, if we have NT63, it can produce 't9'.\n\nBut in NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, so after NT69, we need to have both NT63 and NT49.\n\nWait, but the first token is t5, which is from NT69. So the first part of the string is t5, which comes from NT69. Then, the next part should be what NT69 produces. But NT69 is NT63 NT49. So, we need to see how the string continues.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe a better way is to map the string to the grammar's rules step by step.\n\nLet me note that each time a non-terminal is encountered, it must expand into a sequence that leads to terminals consistent with the string.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nThus, the string starts with t from NT56 and t from NT45.\n\nWait, in the string, the first part is t5. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 produces t5, and NT45 produces the rest.\n\nWait, or perhaps it's the other way around. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me see which production for NT56 leads to a t5. Looking at the grammar, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, or NT56 \u2192 NT33? Wait, actually, looking back: NT56 productions include NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56, etc. Wait, I think I may have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, I'll list out all the productions for each non-terminal, making sure I don't miss any.\n\nStarting from S, it's S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. NT26 has two productions: NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and NT26 \u2192 NT22 NT10.\n\nHmm. The string starts with 't5', which is likely produced by NT69, as NT69 \u2192 't5' directly.\n\nWait, NT69 \u2192 't5' is a production. Wait, yes, looking back at the grammar: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. Wait, no, the production for NT69 is NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. There's another production for NT69, which I thought was NT69 \u2192 NT55. Wait, let me check.\n\nNo, the grammar has: \n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 \n\nand \n\nNT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56 \n\nplus \n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45 \n\netc.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT55 -> NT44 NT56\n\nWait, so NT55 also appears elsewhere?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I got confused. Let me list all the NT55 productions:\n\nYes, lines in the grammar:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT55 -> NT44 NT56\n\nSo, NT55 can expand into two NTs. Looking for t5 in NT55's expansion: there's another NT68 \u2192 't3', NT71 \u2192 't14' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't5'. So, we need to find a path from the start symbol S down to this terminal. \n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nSo, the first symbol from NT56 and the second from NT45. Or maybe the other way around? Wait, no, the order is determined by the production. So, the string will start with the symbols from the first non-terminal in S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo, suppose the first part is generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is 't5', which is likely from NT56.\n\nSo, how does NT56 produce 't5'? Looking up NT56's productions, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nThen, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nThen, NT63 \u2192 't9' (direct production) or maybe other options.\n\nWait, if NT63 can produce 't9' directly, then NT69 would need to produce 't9' followed by something else? No, because NT63 is the next in the chain.\n\nWait, no, for NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, both NT63 and NT49 must be resolved first.\n\nSo, starting with NT69, which expands to NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 \u2192 't9' directly from its production.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nSo, NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nNow, NT22 \u2192 't0' directly (looked up: NT22 -> 't4'), no, wait, the grammar for NT22 is NT22 -> 't4'.\n\nWait, no, looking back: NT22 is an NT, and in the given grammar, I see NT22 -> NT4 NT50.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should approach this more methodically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the steps.\n\nThe string starts with t5.

The string to evaluate is:\n\n`t9 t9 t24 t6 t17 t4 t36 t4 t4 t5 t3 t4 t29 t24 t13 t10 t5 t3 t4 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t29 t4 t33 t24 t4 t9 t24 t25 t15 t29 t33 t4 t4`\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, which makes parsing possibly easier with algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But maybe I don't need to go into that depth.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is the start symbol, and it's derived from two non-terminals: NT56 and NT45.\n\nMy approach would be to see if the given string can be broken down according to the productions in the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals that eventually derive into these terminals.\n\nI think a systematic way would be to start from the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string. Since S \u2192 NT56 NT45, the string must start with whatever NT56 produces and then whatever NT45 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two parts are t9 t9. So I need to see if NT56 can produce t9 and NT45 can produce t9. But looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\nNT45 \u2192 NT68 NT24...\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t9, which might come from NT56 or another non-terminal. Let me check the rules for NT56:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nSo NT56 can't directly produce 't' anything. It only goes further. Let me see what NT69 does. Wait, but in the string, it starts with t9, so does any non-terminal produce t9?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, let's look at NT35: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3. NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68. NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3. NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. NT70 \u2192 't5'. Hmm, so NT70 can produce t5.\n\nBut in the string, I'm seeing a lot of t's, but maybe there's a way for non-terminals to eventually produce them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string using the grammar. Each 't' is a terminal, so each occurrence must be generated from a non-terminal that has a production leading to that 't'.\n\nWait, but looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first step is to split the string into two parts, one that NT56 will generate and another that NT45 will generate.\n\nSo, for example, if the string starts with a part generated by NT56, which could then produce t9, and the rest by NT45, producing the remaining t9 and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the structure in the string. The string starts with t9 t9. So perhaps the first part is t9 from NT56 and the second t9 from NT45? But I need to see if NT56 and NT45 can produce t9.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any direct production for a non-terminal to produce t9, except maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that non-terminals can produce sequences of terminals. So perhaps NT56 can be expanded multiple times until it produces a sequence of terminals, including t9.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use a parser or at least try to see if the string can be segmented according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to note that each non-terminal has a specific production, and each 't' occurs because some non-terminal can derive it.\n\nWait, for example, NT70 \u2192 't5', so t5 is coming from NT70. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 't28', wait, no, looking back, I think I might have some confusion here.\n\nWait, for example, NT70 \u2192 't5' and NT36 \u2192 't25' etc. Wait, but in the grammar rules provided, some NTs have terminals as their productions.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't25' as per one of the rules: NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70 \u2192 't25' ?\n\nWait, no, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT56 is part of the start symbol, so it goes into further production.\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nHmm, not helpful yet.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to see if the given string can be broken down into parts that each correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire string is long, but maybe individual 't' symbols can be matched by specific non-terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the grammar may generate strings where certain patterns occur, perhaps involving sequences of t's with numbers that can be traced through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but I need to construct the grammar's parse table first.\n\nBut since I might not have time to do that, maybe I can look for the start symbol and see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for sequences that match the grammar rules.\n\nFor example, looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo, S derivations start with NT56 NT45, which each will contribute parts of the string.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t9 t9.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are t9 t9. So perhaps NT56 produces t9, and NT45 also produces t9.\n\nBut I don't see a direct rule where a non-terminal produces t9. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT44: Not sure. Wait, perhaps NT44 \u2192 NT22 NT6?\n\nWait, let's check NT44: There's a production NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, but looking for NT44:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should consider what each production leads to.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps some non-terminals can only produce specific 't's, so if a part of the string contains a 't' that cannot be produced by any non-terminal, then the string is not generated.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT70 \u2192 't5', NT26 \u2192 't4', NT36 \u2192 't25', etc.\n\nBut in the string, let's check any 't's with numbers. The string has t9 twice, t6, t17 multiple times, etc.\n\nWait, are there any 't's that cannot be produced by the grammar? For example, if any 't' in the string isn't covered by any production, the string isn't in the language.\n\nLooking at the given rules, every terminal seems to be accounted for. For example:\n\n- 't9' might be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t9. So t9 must be part of a larger derivation. So perhaps t9 is part of the result of some non-terminal's expansion.\n\nBut maybe t9 is a 'leaf' node in the parse tree. So perhaps t9 can only come from a non-terminal that can derive it. But since there's no direct production, perhaps the derivation must go all the way down.\n\nBut without knowing what NT56 and NT45 can produce, it's hard to say. Maybe I should trace a possible derivation.\n\nSuppose S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT36\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10 NT26\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't28' (but in the string, 't28' isn't present, so perhaps that's not relevant)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too detailed.

{"custom_id":"request-774","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string starts with several t's and numbers, and I have to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that Chomsky normal form (CNF) typically has rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to be in CNF because each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nThe string to check is: t9 t0 t6 t36 t1 t26 t13 t34 t36 t4 t4 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t33 t27 t34 t3 t4 t10 t7 t36 t29 t4 t33 t4 t27 t34 t1 t1 t10 t5 t7 t17 t34 t13 t6 t17 t4 t4.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string from the start symbol, S, and see if we can derive the string step by step using the given productions.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the first symbol in the string is 't9'. Looking at the grammar, the rule that produces 't9' is NT36 -> t9. So, 't9' comes from NT36.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT36 has another production: NT36 -> t25 NT70 or NT47 NT20. Hmm, no, actually, looking again, the rule for NT36 is \"-> t25 NT70\" and \"-> NT47 NT20\". Wait, no, the grammar provided has:\n\nLooking back, I see that NT36 has two rules:\nNT36 -> t25 NT70\nand\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\n\nBut in our string, the first symbol is 't9', which is only produced by NT36 as NT36 -> t9. But in the grammar, is there such a rule? Wait, looking at the grammar again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the rule NT36 has:\n\nFrom the user's grammar:\nNT36 -> t25 NT70\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\n\nBut there's also a rule NT36 -> t25 NT70, NT36-> NT47 NT20. Wait, maybe I missed that in the initial list. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. Wait, let me check the grammar provided again.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT36, it says:\n\n\"-> NT47 NT20\"\n\nAnd also:\n\n\"-> t25 NT70\"\n\nWait, but 't9' is not directly produced by NT36 in the grammar. Hmm, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that under NT36, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, under NT36, the user provided:\n\n\"-> t25 NT70\",\n\"-> NT47 NT20\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, under NT25, it says NT25 -> t10, etc. But under NT36:\n\nWait, the user wrote under \"NT36 -> t25 NT70\" and \"NT36 -> NT47 NT20\". So, wait, that's correct. So, 't9' would only be produced by NT36 if there is a production NT36 -> t9, which there isn't. So, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me recheck the grammar provided by the user.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT36 -> t25 NT70\" and \"-> NT47 NT20\".\n\nI don't see a production for NT36 that results in 't9'. Hmm, that would mean that the first step cannot produce 't9', because 't9' isn't an option. So, perhaps the string isn't generated by the grammar. But wait, that seems a bit too quick. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking for 't9'. Let me check the productions for NT36 again.\n\nLooking through the list, under NT36, I see:\n\n\"-> t25 NT70\"\n\nand\n\n\"-> NT47 NT20\"\n\nSo, no, there's no production that produces 't9' for NT36. Hmm, that's a problem because the first symbol is 't9'. So, perhaps the string can't be generated by the grammar. But before I jump to conclusions, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar:\n\nThe user's grammar has:\n\n\"-> NT7 -> ...\", and under NT36, I think I might have misread. Let me go through each line carefully.\n\nWait, under NT25: \"-> t10\", etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't9' production:\n\nWait, I think I found that under NT36, there is a production that results in 't9'. Looking through the list:\n\nHere's the list:\n\nNT66 -> t6\nNT69 -> t5\n...\nWait, perhaps not. Let me go line by line until I find 't9'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\nAt line 7: NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n\nWait, then at line 13: NT63 -> t9\n\nSo, 't9' is the production for NT63. Therefore, the string starts with 't9', which comes from NT63.\n\nAh! So I might have confused NT36 with NT63 earlier. So, the first step is S -> NT56 NT45.\n\nThen NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nSo, S => NT56... => (NT69 NT44) NT45.\n\nThen, let's see: NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and then NT69 -> NT63 NT49, and NT44 -> ...? Maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try to build the string backward, using the empty string and seeing if we can derive it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can start from the string and see if we can decompose it into the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't9 t0 t6 ...'. Since 't9' is from NT63, perhaps the first part is NT63 generating 't9', then the next symbol is 't0'. Hmm, but 't0' isn't in the grammar. Wait, do any non-terminals produce 't0'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't0' in the productions, perhaps under some NT. Let me scan the productions:\n\nLooking through, I see under NT12: NT12 -> t1, but not 't0'. Hmm, I don't see any production that results in 't0'. Hmm, that suggests that after t9, the next symbol 't0' can't be generated by any NT rule. So, perhaps the string can't be derived.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the first symbol is t9, which comes from NT63, and then what produces t0? There's no production for that. So, that would mean the string can't be generated because after 't9', the next 't0' is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping t9 to NT63. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the user's grammar has a production: NT63 -> t9 under line 13, so yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the string starts with 't9 t0 ...' which would mean after NT63, the next symbol is 't0'. But looking through the grammar, no non-terminal produces t0. So, that means the string can't be generated by this grammar because the second symbol is 't0', which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-777","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form and I need to check if the given string is generated by it. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has all productions in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that most of the productions are non-terminals breaking down into two non-terminals, except for some like NT70 -> 't17' and others where a terminal is directly used. Wait, no, actually, looking again, some non-terminals do have terminals on their right side. For example, NT70 -> 't17', which is a terminal. Oh right, in CNF, the rules can have terminals on the right, but they can only be single terminals, not strings. So that's okay.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's and numbers, all connected by spaces. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of expansions using the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the start symbol is S. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must start with whatever NT56 and NT45 can generate. So, starting with S, the leftmost symbol is S, and it expands into NT56 and NT45. Then each of those can expand further, and so on, until terminals are reached.\n\nSo, let's break down the string. It starts with 't9', which I need to see if any of the non-terminals expand into 't9'. Looking through the productions, I see several NTs ending with 't' followed by numbers. For example, looking at NT70 -> 't17', NT36 -> 't26', NT39 -> 't21', etc. So, 't9' must come from some NT production.\n\nWait, let's look for 't9' in the productions. Scanning down, I see NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, but that's non-terminal. No, more importantly, I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. Wait, maybe looking through all the terminals.\n\nWait, the given string is: `t9 t0 t6 t36 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t4 t4 t1 t25 t0 t6 t37 t10 t4 t24 t15 t6 t3 t4 t5 t17 t4 t10 t5 t17 t4 t24 t6 t28 t4 t33 t32 t34 t26 t17 t4 t4`.\n\nWait, looking for 't9' \u2014 I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, but does any NT69 or NT44 produce 't9'? Looking through the productions, I don't see NT69 producing a 't' terminal. Let me check more thoroughly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the productions that have terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 \u2192 but no, that's non-terminal. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT70 -> 't17', NT63 -> 't9', NT45 -> 't4', NT68 -> 't3', NT36 -> 't25', NT70 -> 't17', NT61 -> 't27', etc. Wait, NT70 is written as NT70 -> 't17', and that's in the production list.\n\nWait, let me see. NT70 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't17'. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 't9', NT45 \u2192 't4', NT68 \u2192 't3', NT36 \u2192 't25', etc.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the first token is 't9'. So, the first part of the string must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't9'. Looking at the productions, I see that NT70 doesn't produce 't9'. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see NT63 \u2192 't9', so perhaps that's the one. Because NT63 directly translates to 't9'. So, if the string starts with 't9', that could come from NT63.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the first step is S \u2192 NT56 NT45, expanding into those two non-terminals. So the string must start with whatever NT56 and NT45 can generate.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. If the string starts with 't9', that would have to come from NT63 expanding into 't9' as the first symbol. But S's expansion starts with NT56 and NT45. So if the string starts with 't9', it would have to come from one of those non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because in the grammar, S \u2192 NT56 NT45, which is a production that replaces S with those two non-terminals. So the leftmost symbol becomes NT56, and then NT45. So the derived string must start with whatever NT56 can generate, followed by whatever NT45 can generate.\n\nWait, but in the string provided, it starts with 't9'. So the first symbol is 't9'. But according to the grammar, the first symbol must come from NT56, as S \u2192 NT56 NT45, so the first part of the string is whatever NT56 can generate.\n\nSo, does NT56 produce 't9' directly? Looking at NT56's productions: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, or does it? Wait, looking at the given grammar, NT56 is listed as: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, no NT56 produces a terminal. Instead, several non-terminals produce t's.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines provided, the production for NT56 is: NT\\56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, according to the list.\n\nWait, let's re-examine that. The grammar is given as a list of lines, each starting with a NT production. Let's list the relevant productions:\n\nLooking through the productions provided:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9' (line: NT63 -> 't9')\n- NT70 -> 't17' (line: NT70 -> 't17')\n- NT45 -> 't4' (line: NT45 -> 't4')\n- NT68 -> 't3' (line: NT68 -> 't3')\n- NT36 -> 't25' (line: NT36 -> 't25')\n- NT70 is also 't17' (line: NT70 -> 't17')\n\nWait, but for NT56, I see that in the list, lines starting with NT56 are not explicitly present except for one line: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (probably, but looking at the list, I see that line: NT56 -> NT69 NT44 is in the grammar, but does NT69 or NT44 produce a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list, the NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, which is line: NT69 -> NT63 NT49. So that's non-terminal. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, line: NT49 -> NT22 NT66.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 is a non-terminal that can produce 't9' (line: NT63 -> 't9'). So perhaps in the expansion of NT63, it can directly produce 't9'.\n\nWait, but let's get back. So S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string we're evaluating starts with whatever NT56 and NT45 can produce. The given string starts with 't9', so 't9' must come from one of these non-terminals. But since the first part is 't9', the first non-terminal in the expansion is NT56, and it must produce 't9' as the first symbol.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see NT56 producing a terminal. All the productions for NT56 are non-terminals. So, unless NT56 expands into a series that eventually produces 't9', but perhaps it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

{"custom_id":"request-802","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should help in parsing.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t5 t17 t4 t9 t9 t2 t6 t17 t4 t36 t25 t17 t4 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t4 t5 t3 t4 t17 t4 t26 t17 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t26 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4 t10 t5 t36 t29 t4 t4`. It's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, all starting with 't'. There are 58 tokens in total.\n\nNow, the grammar has a top symbol S, which starts as S -> NT56 NT45. Let me break that down: S is the starting symbol, and in the first production, it's rewritten into two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. So, in the parse tree, S will have two children: NT56 and NT45.\n\nEach NT is a non-terminal, and they each expand into two non-terminals according to their production rules. Some of these non-terminals expand directly into terminals (like 't5', 't17', etc.), and some will further break down.\n\nTo validate the string, I need to see if it's a possible derivation from S. It's a bit tricky, but maybe I can approach it by checking the structure of the string according to the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the string. Each 't' seems to be a terminal symbol. Since each production in the grammar can only have up to two symbols on the left, the derivations of any non-terminal will produce an even-length string, considering all expansions. But wait, the string's length is 58 tokens, so 58 is even, which might fit, but I need to check more carefully.\n\nAnother approach is to recursively check if the string can be divided into two parts that each conform to the grammar. Since S's first production is NT56 NT45, perhaps the entire string can be split into two parts: the first part corresponding to NT56 and the second to NT45. Both parts must themselves be valid.\n\nSo, let's consider the first split. The string is 58 tokens; if I try to split it into two equal parts, each would be 29 tokens. The first 29 tokens would correspond to NT56's expansion, and the next 29 to NT45's expansion.\n\nTo proceed, I need to find out what NT56 and NT45 produce. Let's look at their productions:\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT44 -> NT3 NT26\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\nNT68 -> NT28 NT26\nNT26 -> NT36 NT3\nNT36 -> NT47 NT20\nNT47 -> NT7 NT21\nNT21 -> NT71 NT30\nNT71 -> NT69 NT35\nNT35 -> NT24 NT68\nNT68 -> NT23 NT6 (Wait, NT68 -> 't3', because looking at the productions, NT68 has two options, one of which is 't3'.)\n\nHold on, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe it's better to work step by step.\n\nLooking at NT56: it produces NT69 and NT44. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT69 -> NT56 NT44\nWait, that seems circular because NT69 refers back to itself. So NT69's production is NT56 NT44, which again refers back.\n\nThis could be an infinite loop, but I think since NT56 and NT44 are on the right, the derivation needs to eventually reach terminals.\n\nWait, but NT56 also produces NT69 NT44, which references itself. So maybe this could lead to an infinite recursion, which isn't useful. Alternatively, perhaps one of the paths leads to a terminal eventually. Let me check NT69 again.\n\nNT69's productions:\nNT69 -> NT56 NT44 (which is circular) or NT63 NT49.\n\nOh, right, there are two options for NT69. One loops back, and the other is NT63 and NT49. NT63 is a non-terminal, and so is NT49.\n\nLet's explore the second option for NT69: NT63 NT49.\n\nNT63 -> NT25 NT70\nNT70 -> 't17'\nSo NT63 produces NT25 and NT70, which is a terminal. So combining NT63 and NT49, let's see what happens.\n\nNT63: NT25 NT70 -> NT25 t17\nThen, NT49's production is NT22 NT66.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to map out a possible expansion.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider that the entire string starts with t5, which is from NT7's production: looking at the grammar, NT7: NT13 NT36, and other options, but one of them is NT1 -> 't24' but that's not matching t5.\n\nWait, wait. Looking at the terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through the grammar, several non-terminals expand to 't' followed by a number. For example:\n\nNT56 -> 't33' when NT36 expands, but I'm getting lost here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the number of 't's corresponding to each non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be split into two equal parts, each corresponding to NT56 and NT45.\n\nThe string is: t5 t17 t4 t9 t9 t2 t6 t17 t4 t36 t25 t17 t4 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t4 t5 t3 t4 t17 t4 t26 t17 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t26 t3 t4 t29 t4 t4 t10 t5 t36 t29 t4 t4\n\nIf S is NT56 NT45, the first part (29 tokens) is NT56's expansion, and the second part (29 tokens) is NT45's expansion.\n\nLet me check what NT45 expands into. Looking at the grammar, NT45 has:\n\nNT45 -> NT48 NT6 (I think, because I see 't6' under NT1: NT1 -> 't24'). Wait, looking at the grammar, NT45's production is not listed directly, but perhaps from other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT55 -> NT56 NT45 is one production, and NT56 -> NT69 NT44 has another. So maybe NT45 is a terminal or a non-terminal? I'm getting confused because many non-terminals expand into two others until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, in the list, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT70 -> 't17', NT31 -> 't24', NT22 -> 't4', etc.\n\nSo perhaps the start symbol S will eventually produce a string of terminals, and the question is whether this particular string is one of those possible strings.\n\nBut to determine that, perhaps I can try to parse the string using the grammar, step by step.\n\nLet me list the tokens:\n\n1. t5\n2. t17\n3. t4\n4. t9\n5. t9\n6. t2\n7. t6\n8. t17\n9. t4\n10. t36\n11. t25\n12. t17\n13. t4\n14. t4\n15. t33\n16. t2\n17. t6\n18. t28\n19. t4\n20. t5\n21. t3\n22. t4\n23. t17\n24. t4\n25. t26\n26. t17\n27. t4\n28. t5\n29. t36\n30. t29\n31. t4\n32. t26\n33. t3\n34. t4\n35. t29\n36. t4\n37. t4\n38. t10\n39. t5\n40. t36\n41. t29\n42. t4\n43. t4\n\nWait, that's 43 tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-799","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I'm dealing with here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol S, which can produce a terminal directly. All non-terminals are in the left-hand side, and all terminals are single characters.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like `t5 t17...t0`. Each 't' is followed by a number, and these correspond to symbols in the grammar. So, for example, 't5' in the string corresponds to the non-terminal NT56 in the grammar because when I look at the productions, NT56 produces 't5' when it's a terminal (I see the rule `NT56 -> NT69 NT44`, and then each of those eventually leads to terminals like 't5'). Similarly, 't17' might correspond to NT61 or another non-terminal.\n\nBut actually, looking closer, the terminals 't5' appear in the rules where NT56 and NT55 produce 't5'. The grammar has multiple rules where NT25, NT22, etc., produce 't' followed by a number. So each 'tX' in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal that eventually derives that terminal symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all the terminals and see which non-terminals produce them. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see which grammar rules produce them.\n\nThe string goes like this:\n\nt5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4 t33 t24 t4 t9 t1 t26 t9 t2 t6 t5 t17 t4 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t25 t36 t4 t4 t4 t26 t17 t4 t4 t29 t4.\n\nWait, that's a lot of symbols. Let me list each one:\n\nBreakdown of the string into individual terminals:\n\nt5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t5 t3 t4 t33 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4 t33 t24 t4 t9 t1 t26 t9 t2 t6 t5 t17 t4 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t25 t36 t4 t4 t4 t26 t17 t4 t4 t29 t4.\n\nSo that's 43 symbols. Each symbol is a terminal in the grammar. Now, I need to map each of these terminals to their respective production rules. For example:\n\n- 't5' might come from NT56 or NT55 because looking at the rules, I see NT56 -> NT69 NT44, but NT69 is another non-terminal, and NT44 also produces terminals 't3' and 't26' perhaps? Wait, no. Alternatively, looking through the rules more carefully, I see NT56 -> ... and NT54 -> NT6 NT45. Hmm.\n\nActually, each non-terminal might correspond to certain terminals. Let me go through each term symbol and see which non-terminal can produce them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this by reversing the process: starting with the string and see if each symbol can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parse tree, starting with the start symbol S and trying to expand it into the string. But given the complexity, that might be challenging.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a path through the grammar that can produce all these symbols in sequence. Since each production in CNF splits the string into two parts, perhaps I can break the string into parts that match the possible derivations.\n\nWait, maybe using dynamic programming could help. In CYK parsing, we can determine if a string is in the language by checking if each substring can be derived from some combination of grammar rules.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, CYK parsing should be feasible. However, manually doing CYK parsing for a string of 43 symbols would be time-consuming, but I can try to outline the steps.\n\nFirst, the string is: t5, t17, t4, t33, t4, t5, t3, t4, t33, t4, t33, t4, t4, t4, t33, t24, t4, t9, t1, t26, t9, t2, t6, t5, t17, t4, t29, t4, t9, t0, t6, t36, t25, t36, t4, t4, t4, t26, t17, t4, t4, t29, t4.\n\nLet me try to see if each symbol corresponds to a non-terminal that can be derived, and whether the string can be split into two parts each of which can be derived from the left-hand side of a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting from the start symbol S -> NT56 NT45. So S splits into NT56 and NT45. Then, each of these non-terminals will split into their own non-terminals.\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nNT45 is in the grammar as NT45 -> NT25 NT39.\n\nWait, let me find all the production rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT45 -> NT25 NT39\n\nSo, the first step is S -> NT56 (A) NT45 (B). Now, A and B each split into two non-terminals.\n\nLet's first work on A: NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nThen, A will split into NT69 and NT44.\n\nEach of these further split into their respective non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, B: NT45 -> NT25 and NT39.\n\nLooking for production rules for NT25 and NT39.\n\nNT25 -> NT10 NT4.\n\nSo each step involves expanding into more non-terminals until we reach the terminals, where each terminal matches a specific non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all rules are of the form A -> BC, so each non-terminal can only expand into two non-terminals at each step. The parse tree would be a binary tree.\n\nGiven that, the string must be a concatenation of terminals obtained by expanding the non-terminals two at a time.\n\nThis might get complicated, but perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the sequence can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some symbols can only be produced by certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\nt5: From NT56 or NT55 (but I don't see NT55 in the rules... Wait, in the rules, I see NT55 -> NT56 NT45, but that's from NT55.

Let's make a list of all non-terminals that can produce each 'tX' symbol.\n\nFor example, 't5' is in NT56 and NT55: looking at the rules, NT56 -> NT69 NT44 and NT55 is defined as another rule. Wait, in the given productions, let me find where 't5' is derived.\n\nLooking at the rules, 't5' appears in:\n\n- NT54 -> NT6 NT45, where NT45 can derive 't5'? Wait, NT45's rules: NT45->NT25 NT39. So if NT25 leads to 't28' or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting too deep.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at each 'tX' in the string and see if I can find a non-terminal that can produce that, and then see if the rest of the symbols can correspond to the parse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the initial production S can be split into parts that match the string.\n\nS -> NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, NT56 -> NT69 NT44.\n\nNT69 -> NT34 NT8 (from the rules).

{"custom_id":"request-818","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, maybe with something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm manually trying to parse the string, I'll have to do it differently.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t9 t0 t6 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t17 t4 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t33 t4 t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4`.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it's a sequence of 't' tokens with numbers, like 't9', 't0', etc. So each token is a combination of 't' followed by a number. The grammar seems to have these 't' productions, each in the form NTxx \u2192 tyy, where x and y are numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals produce these 't' tokens. For example, the rule `NT70 -> 't5'` means whenever NT70 is encountered, it's replaced by 't5'. Similarly, `NT69 -> 't6'` and `NT56 -> 't33'`, etc.\n\nSo the approach is to try to parse the string starting from the top-level non-terminal S.\n\nThe first rule is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is replaced by NT56 and NT45. Each of these can be non-terminals or terminals. So we need to see if the string can be split into two parts: one that starts with NT56 and another with NT45.\n\nLet me break down the string into two parts. The entire string is t9 t0 t6 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t17 t4 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t33 t4 t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4.\n\nBut S is NT56 NT45. So the string should be divided into two parts after t9 t0... up to some point, and then the remainder should start with NT45.\n\nSo let's try to split the string into two parts that each correspond to NT56 and NT45.\n\nFirst, NT56 \u2192 't9' followed by NT45. Let's see: the first symbol is 't9', which matches NT56 \u2192 't9' (from the rule NT56 -> NT50 NT45, but wait, that's two non-terminals, but in the string, it's 't9', so directly produced as a terminal. So NT56 \u2192 't9' is correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar: yes, NT56 -> 't33' is one of the rules, but wait, in the grammar, NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and NT69 -> 't6', NT44 -> NT3 NT26, which might produce more 't's. But maybe there's a direct rule for NT56. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules: I see NT56 -> 't33'. Wait, let me double-check the grammar. Yes, I see:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\nNT56 -> 't33'\nSo NT56 can directly produce 't33'. But wait, the first symbol in the string is 't9', so that can't be it. Wait, no, actually, looking further: the string starts with 't9', which is part of NT69 (since NT69 -> 't6'). But wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NT rules that directly produce 't' terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT70 -> 't5'\nNT69 -> 't6'\nNT56 -> 't33'\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45, but that's a production to two non-terminals.\nNT71 -> 't14'\nNT18 -> 't32'\nNT35 -> 't9'\nNT70 -> 't7'\nNT71 -> 't7'\nWait, no, looking again, I see NT70 -> 't5' and NT70 -> 't7'?\n\nWait, checking the grammar again:\n\nThe rule is NT70 -> 't17'? No, let me re-examine all the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, 't' productions are as follows:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\nNT30 -> 't17'\nNT18 -> 't32'\nNT26 -> 't4' and 't29'\nNT19 might not be there.\nNT25 -> 't10'\nNT13 -> 't24'\nWait, I need to list all NT rules that directly produce a 't' token.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal's production:\n\n- NT70 -> 't5', 't7', 't17' (from the rules listed: NT70 -> 't17'\nWait, wait, looking back, the rules:\n\nNT70's rules:\n- NT70 -> 't17'\nYes, so NT70 produces 't17' directly.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT35 -> NT42 NT3 (not a terminal)\nNT61 -> NT18 NT59; not terminal.\nBut looking further, NT56 produces 't33' directly.

Let me confirm.\n\nYes, from the rules:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'.\n\nSo the NTs that directly produce 't' tokens are:\n\n- NT22 -> 't0'\n- NT35 -> 't9'\n- NT56 -> 't33'\n- NT69 -> 't6'\n- NT70 -> 't5', 't7', 't17'\n\nWait, but look: NT70's rules include:\n\nNT70 -> 't17', yes, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't9', which must be produced from a rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only way to get 't9' is from NT35 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't9', which is 't9' from NT35.\n\nNow, the rest of the string must be a production from the other part of S's rule, which is NT45.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So the string must be split into two parts: the first part is from NT56 (which is 't9'), and the second part from NT45.\n\nSo after the first 't9', the remaining string is: t0 t6 t17 t4 t36 t29 t4 t17 t4 t4 t5 t36 t29 t4 t33 t2 t6 t28 t33 t4 t5 t17 t4 t26 t3 t4 t33 t4 t4 t4 t4 t4.\n\nWait, actually, the entire string is 't9' followed by 't0 t6 t17 t4 ...' up to the last 't4's.\n\nSo, let"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-822","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I have to decide whether it fits the grammar or not.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies the analysis of the grammar, especially in terms of parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm not using a parser, I'll need a different approach.\n\nThe grammar is given with multiple production rules for non-terminals, each expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. The string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t9 t0 t6 t36 t10 t5 t36 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t4 t4 t29 t2 t6 t28 t4 t36 t4 t4 t33 t32 t34 t5 t3 t4 t4 t24 t13 t24 t25 t15 t37 t20 t6 t36 t4 t4 t33 t29 t4`.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the start symbol is S, which produces NT56 NT45. Each of these non-terminals can be expanded further until we reach terminals. So, the string must be the result of expanding S using these production rules until we get all terminals.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to see if each token in the string can be matched by the bottom-up expansion of the grammar. Essentially, I'll check if the string can be derived from S by reversing the production rules.\n\nStarting from the given string, the first step is to check if the whole string can be generated by S. The start symbol S is NT56 NT45. So, the string should start with whatever NT56 produces and end with whatever NT45 produces, or vice versa, depending on how the expansion goes. Hmm, actually, since S is NT56 NT45, the first production is a combination of two non-terminals. So, the string must start with the first non-terminal's expansion and end with the second's.\n\nBut wait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so it must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT56 and NT45. Therefore, the string must split into two parts: the first part is NT56 expanded into some string of terminals, and the second part is NT45 expanded into another string of terminals. So, the entire string is the concatenation of these two.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of t's and numbers. Let me split it into two parts based on the NT56 and NT45 production. Wait, but NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals, so their expansions would produce terminal strings. So, the entire string must be the result of NT56 expanding to, say, a sequence ending with certain terminals, and then NT45 expanding to the rest.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, the string as a whole is a concatenation of two terminal sequences generated by NT56 and NT45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is split into the expansions of NT56 and NT45, with the entire string being the combination.\n\nSo, I can approach the problem by checking if the string can be divided into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT56 and the second by NT45.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's 43 tokens long. That's a lot. It might be easier to try to see if the string can be broken down step by step by reversing the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production is a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string can be built by starting from the smallest units (terminals) and trying to combine them according to the grammar rules. Essentially, it's like checking if the entire string can be parsed top-down using the given productions.\n\nI should also note that all the production rules for non-terminals lead to terminals or further non-terminals. So, each non-terminal production eventually terminates when it can produce a terminal.\n\nI think a systematic way would be to check if each token in the string can be matched by the terminal symbols in the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and expanding as necessary.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe string is: t9 t0 t6 t36 t10 t5 t36 t29 t4 t9 t0 t6 t36 t4 t4 t29 t2 t6 t28 t4 t36 t4 t4 t33 t32 t34 t5 t3 t4 t4 t24 t13 t24 t25 t15 t37 t20 t6 t36 t4 t4 t33 t29 t4.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, let's try to split the string into two parts: [Part1] and [Part2], where Part1 is generated by NT56 and Part2 by NT45.\n\nBut how long are NT56 and NT45's expansions? Without knowing exactly, but perhaps I can look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that each production for non-terminals always ends in a terminal. So, each non-terminal's expansion must end with a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT56's productions: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 or NT69 NT44 \u2192 other non-terminals. Wait, wait, actually, looking at the initial grammar:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nBut NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT44 has multiple productions. Wait, maybe I should map the dependencies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the sequence starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t9, t0, t6, t36, etc. Let's see if these correspond to any non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT36 has several productions, such as NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, NT6 \u2192..., and NT36 \u2192 NT67 NT26?\n\nWait, wait, I'll list the NT36 productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the productions are:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking for NT36:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, no, looking through the productions:\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70\n\nYes, and NT10 is defined as NT10 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT10 \u2192 t28.\n\nWait, not sure. Let me see: looking for NT36.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, one of the productions is NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70. So, NT36 can become NT25 NT70. Then, each of those non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nBut perhaps this is taking too long. Another approach is to see if each token in the string matches a terminal in the grammar. The grammar defines many terminals, so perhaps each token corresponds to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar's initial productions:\n\nMany have 't' followed by a number, like 't1', 't2', etc. From the provided grammar, I see terms like t1, t2, t3, etc. So, the string is a series of such t's.\n\nSo, each token in the string is a terminal in the grammar, so I just need to check if the entire string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, the entire string must be the concatenation of the strings generated by exactly half the non-terminals when expanding S (assuming S generates exactly two non-terminals which then generate the entire string).\n\nWait, but in the initial S, it's NT56 NT45, so the entire string must be the concatenation of NT56's expansion and NT45's expansion.\n\nSo, I can split the string into two parts: the first part should be generated by NT56, and the second by NT45.\n\nBut I don't know how to split the string yet. Maybe I can check the start symbols of NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait, that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can see what NT56's expansions produce. For instance, looking at the NT56 production, it's NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.

A CFG consists of a set of production rules. Each rule has a left-hand side (LHS) which is a non-terminal symbol and a right-hand side (RHS) which is a combination of terminal and non-terminal symbols. The string is generated by starting with the start symbol (in this case, S) and applying production rules until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar structure, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for parsing because it simplifies the grammar into a specific structure that can be handled by algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut since I'm not going to use a specific algorithm but rather try to parse the string manually, I can work through the production steps step by step.\n\nThe grammar provided has non-terminals like S, NT22, NT61, etc., and terminals like 't5', 't36', etc. My goal is to break down the string into these components, starting from S and seeing if it can derive the given string.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, according to the production rule S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must be formed by concatenating the two parts generated from NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the string, I can split it into two parts that should correspond to the results of NT56 and NT45. However, this might get complicated because each non-terminal can have multiple production rules, leading to branching derivations. Instead, perhaps I should approach this step by step, looking for how each non-terminal can derive its part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a bottom-up approach, starting from the given string and trying to reduce it by matching production rules. Let's see if that's feasible.\n\nThe string starts with 't5', which is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, which terminals are present and in which non-terminals. For example, 't5' appears as a terminal in NT68: NT68 \u2192 't3', 't6'; NT56 \u2192 't33', 't4'; NT70: 't17', 't7'; NT69: 't5'; and so on.\n\nWait, I see that 't5' is a terminal in NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, where maybe NT49 produces 't5'? But looking at NT69's production: it's NT63 and NT49, which are non-terminals. So 't5' must come from NT69, but how? Or wait, maybe 't5' is directly a terminal somewhere else.\n\nLooking back, NT76 isn't in the grammar, but looking at NT69: is it NT69 \u2192 NT65 NT22? Wait, no, the grammar provided doesn't have that. Wait, in the grammar, it's written as NT69 -> NT63 NT49, which are both non-terminals. Then, NT63 is a non-terminal that eventually produces 't3' and 't6' or something else?\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that each non-terminal in the grammar eventually resolves to terminals through a series of productions. So, I can build a tree for each non-terminal by substituting each production until I reach terminals.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the parse tree will have S as the root with two children: NT56 and NT45. Each of these will have their own parse trees.\n\nI need to see if the given string can be generated by expanding S into NT56 and NT45, each of which generate their own parts.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is 't5'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce this.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only place 't5' appears as a terminal is in NT70: NT70 -> 't17', 't7'. Wait, no, 't5' isn't in NT70. Let me scan all the rules.\n\nLooking at each production for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT68: 't3', 't6'\n- NT65: 't17', 't7'\n- NT31: 't4', 't50'\n- NT50: depends on other rules, but not directly 't5'\n- NT69: NT63 NT49 \u2192 but NT63 and NT49 are non-terminals, so need to see their productions.\n\nWait, so maybe 't5' is produced by NT50, but in the grammar, NT50's productions include NT25 NT8 and NT54 NT4. Neither of those seem to directly produce 't5'. Wait, no, NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45. NT45 \u2192 't4', 't5'. Oh, so NT45: NT45 \u2192 't4' 't5'.\n\nSo, if a non-terminal produces NT45, then that part of the string would be 't4 t5', right? So, in the given string, anywhere that is preceded by something that leads to NT45, we'd expect to see 't4 t5'.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't5', which doesn't fit 't4 t5' right after. But wait, maybe 't5' is part of a larger sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 't5' is part of a chain where one non-terminal derives another sequence ending with 't5'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should track the entire derivation step by step. Let's try to parse the given string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So, the string must be split into two parts: part generated by NT56 and part by NT45.\n\nLet's start by checking if the entire string can be broken down into two parts. The string has 66 tokens. We need to see if it can be divided into a part for NT56 and a part for NT45.\n\nBut this might get complicated because each non-terminal could have multiple production options, leading to different breakdowns. Perhaps a better approach is to go step by step, trying to reduce the string.\n\nBut maybe it's impossible without getting lost in the complexity. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated by repeatedly applying the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal corresponds to a specific terminal string.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals might be cycles, meaning they can only produce a specific string, but perhaps they have a specific pattern of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to take the given string and see if each token can be matched by the grammar's terminals in a way that fits the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the string consists of a sequence of terminals, we can see if each token can be mapped to a terminal in at least one production rule. \n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt5, t36, t4, t4, t10, t17, t36, t4, t4, t5, t17, t4, t29, t24, t13, t9, t15, t36, t10, t17, t17, t4, t4, t4, t4, t3, t4, t33, t4, t17, t4, t29, t9, t0, t6, t17, t4, t4, t4, t33, t33, t4, t33, t4, t4.\n\nI need to check if each of these terminals can be generated by any non-terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar, every non-terminal eventually resolves to terminals. So, each terminal in the string must appear as a terminal in some production.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, the terminals present include t5, t36, t4, t10, t17, t29, t24, t13, t9, t15, t33, t3, t0, t6, t7, t8.\n\nEach of these must appear in the grammar as terminals in some production.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- t5 appears in NT69: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. And perhaps NT49 eventually leads to t5? Or NT63 may lead to t5.\n\nWait, in NT63, looking at the productions:\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70.

{"custom_id":"request-839","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, so I'll need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure might help me parse the string using a top-down or bottom-up approach, or maybe the CYK algorithm. But since the grammar is small, maybe I can apply a recursive descent parser or just parse step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's given with non-terminals (like S, NT22, etc.) and terminals involving 't' followed by numbers. The string starts with 't5 t3 ...' and ends with '...4 t29'. Each 't' is probably a leaf in the parse tree, corresponding to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach would be to write out the parse tree or at least keep track of the symbols as I expand non-terminals. Since the string is quite long, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the productions.\n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol is S, which in the grammar expands into NT56 NT45. That means the entire string should be generated by a sequence starting with NT56 and NT45.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't5 t3 ...'. Checking the production for NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Let's see, after NT56, the next symbol should be NT69 and NT44. But in the string, the first few are 't5 t3', which would require checking if NT56 can lead to 't5'... Wait, no, because the first symbol in the string is 't5', which would correspond to the first component of NT56's production.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't5'. Looking at NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So after the 't5' from NT69, the next would be NT44. But the string starts with 't5 t3', which would suggest 't5' is NT69 and 't3' is NT44. But looking at the grammar, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. Wait, that doesn't directly give 't3', because NT26 can expand into 't4' or maybe others. Let me check: NT26's productions include NT28 NT26 \u2192 which I think is a typo. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\nNT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 and probably 't4'.\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal symbols:\n\nLooking at the productions, terminals are cases like 't5', 't3', 't4', 't33', etc. So each production on the right side can involve these terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the root S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the root is S with two children: NT56 and NT45.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't5', it must come from NT56, which expands to NT69 NT44. The first symbol after S is 't5', which should come from the first symbol of NT56, which is NT69. So let's check NT69's production: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nThe first symbol is 't5', so maybe NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and 't5' is from NT63. Looking at NT63: NT63 \u2192 't9'. So 't5' isn't matching because NT63 \u2192 't9', so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The first symbol in the string is 't5'. So perhaps the first NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, and 't5' is from NT44. Let's check NT44's productions: NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. So NT44 can produce 't5' if NT3 or NT26 has a production that gives 't5'.\n\nWait, if NT44 is 't5', that's not correct because NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT55 or NT3 \u2192 't24' via NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49, but I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's list out the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I'll note which non-terminals expand directly into terminals.\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9' (so when NT63 appears, it produces 't9')\n- NT48 \u2192 't24' (from NT48 \u2192 't24')\n- NT22 \u2192 't0' (from NT22 \u2192 NT22 \u2192 't0')\nWait, no, looking at the productions: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. So NT22 can't produce 't0' directly. It produces two non-terminals, but one of them could produce a 't'. So perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the entire string to have exactly two symbols after each non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to reconstruct the entire string as a concatenation of symbols from the grammar. Let me think about what the string is:\n\nThe string is: `t5 t3 t4 t33 t24 t4 t9 t1 t25 t9 t2 t6 t3 t4 t4 t9 t9 t2 t6 t36 t24 t26 t15 t37 t20 t6 t36 t29 t4 t5 t17 t4 t9 t15 t36 t29 t4 t29 t4 t29 t4 t4`.\n\nThat's 40 symbols. Now, considering that each non-terminal expansion in CNF either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string length should be 2^n - 1 where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's see how the number of symbols relates to the grammar. Each step in the grammar could potentially add symbols or merge two non-terminals into one. So for a string of length m, it needs to have m-1 splittings. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps it's better to check if all the symbols in the string are present in the terminals of the grammar. Wait, the grammar lists terminals as 't' followed by numbers. Let me list all terminals in the grammar:\n\nFrom the productions:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. So 't59'? Wait, no, wait: in the grammar, NT56's expansion is to NT69 NT44, and later, looking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce terminals like 't5' (NT7), 't3' (NT31?), etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't' terms in the grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the grammar, the 't' productions are:\n\n- NT63 \u2192 't9'\n- NT45 \u2192 't4'\n- NT25 \u2192 't10'\n- NT36 \u2192 't25'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT8 \u2192 't13'\n- NT18 \u2192 't32'\n- NT15 \u2192 't17' (NT71 \u2192 't17' etc.)\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Let me look through the entire list of productions:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT55 \u2192 NT44 NT56 | NT45 NT61\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26 | NT36 NT26\n- NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n- NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT6\n- NT22 \u2192 't0' (No, looking back: NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, but other NT's produce 't's.

{"custom_id":"request-861","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, each starting with capital letters on the left and combining other symbols on the right. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers, like `\"t5 t17 t4 ...\"`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how strings in CNF are generated. CNF has production rules where each rule replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. Each terminal in the string is generated directly by some non-terminal. So, the entire string is generated through a series of expansions, starting from the start symbol, which in this case is S.\n\nThe given string starts with \"t5\" and ends with \"t4\". Each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol, meaning these are the ones being directly produced by the grammar. So, I need to find if each of these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, S, which immediately expands into NT56 NT45. So, each S derivation starts with NT56 and NT45. Now, I need to see if each of these can produce the corresponding \"t\" tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT56 -> NT69 NT44\n- NT45 -> NT63 NT49\nSo, after the first expansion, we have NT56 NT45 => NT69 NT44 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to produce the corresponding 't' tokens. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst NT69: Looking at the production rules, NT69 -> NT63 NT49. So, NT69 expands into NT63 and NT49. Both of these seem to produce 't' tokens.\n\nNT44: From the rules, NT44 -> NT3 NT26. NT3 and NT26 both produce 't' tokens. Wait, looking at NT26, there's a rule NT26 -> NT36 NT3. But in some cases, NT26 could expand to 't' or other symbols. Let me check NT26's productions:\n\n- NT26 -> NT36 NT3 (both NT36 and NT3 produce 't's)\n- Also, in the given rules, there are multiple NTs that produce 't's directly, like NT6 -> 't1' and NT28 -> 't36'.\n\nWait, but I might be overcomplicating. Each non-terminal should eventually produce a terminal symbol through expansion.\n\nLet me consider the entire string and see how the expansion proceeds. Each symbol in the string must come directly from a production of a non-terminal, so I can work backwards, reconstructing the grammar rules that would generate each part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree step by step, starting from S and expanding until I get the entire string, checking if each step matches the given tokens.\n\nLet me try a different approach: for each 'tX' in the string, find which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nFrom the production rules, each non-terminal has production rules. Some directly produce a 'tX' without going further:\n\n- NT6 -> 't1'\n- NT28 -> 't36'\n- NT26 -> 't4' (NT26 -> 't4')\n- NT26 can also expand to NT36 NT3, but in other examples, NT26 can go directly to 't4'.\n\nLooking at the string: the first few 't's are t5, t17, t4, t3, t4, t33, etc.\n\nSo, t5 is produced by NT50? Let me check:\n\n- NT50 -> NT25 NT8\n- And NT8 -> 't13'\n- Also, NT50 -> NT54 NT45\n- NT54 -> NT6 NT45 and NT45 is involved.\n\nWait, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should check each step of expansion.\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 (since NT56 expands to that)\nNT45 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\n\nNow, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49.\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26.\n\nSo now, the string starts with NT69 and NT44. Let's see how each can produce the first 't's.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to match the string to the grammar, step by step.\n\nGiven the string: \"t5 t17 t4 t3 t4 t33 t4 t25 t17 ...\"\n\nLooking at the first 't5', which must come from a production of the form NT \u2192 't5'. Checking the rules:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 ..., but let's see NT5: I don't see a NT5 production. Wait, the string has 't5', so where can that come from?\n\nLooking through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26. NT28 produces 't36', but in the rules, NT28 \u2192 't36', yes. So if NT28 \u21d2 't36', then perhaps not directly 't5'. Alternatively, NT70 \u2192 't17', NT54 \u2192 't6'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT59 \u2192 't34', but in the rules, NT59 is produced by some NT? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, many have a mix. Maybe it's easier to see which non-terminals produce each 't'.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't36'\n- NT26 \u2192 't4' (direct production)\n- NT26 can split into NT36 NT3, which may further split, but ultimately producing 't's like 't36' and 't1', so multiple 't's from NT26.\n\nBut how do we get 't5'? Looking through the non-terminals:\n\nLooking for NT that can produce 't5'.\n\n- NT71 \u2192 't14' and 't7' (from NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35; NT69 \u2192 't5' as ND)\nWait, let's check NT71: NT71 \u2192 NT69 NT35, and NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should look for where 't5' comes from in the rules directly.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT61 \u2192 't27' (from NT31 \u2192 NT4 NT50; NT50 \u2192 't3' so that's not 't5').\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, does any NT directly produce 't5'?\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't0' (from S \u2192 NT56 NT45, and NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44; NT22 is then expanded further)\n- NT18 \u2192 't27' (from NT42 \u2192 NT46 NT68; NT46 \u2192 NT4 NT26, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check each rule:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces 't5':\n\n- Looking through the list, I see NT70 \u2192 't17', but no NT that directly produces 't5'. Hmm. So maybe 't5' comes from a longer expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the initial expansion path includes a non-terminal that can produce 't5'. Let me check.\n\nEarlier, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26. So S's expansion is NT69 NT44 \u2192 NT63 NT49 NT3 NT26. Then NT63 and NT49 and NT3 and NT26 each need to produce their corresponding 't' symbols.\n\nBut wait, where does 't5' come from? Maybe in the initial step, one of these non-terminals produces 't5'.\n\nWait, let's check the production rules for NT6 and NT50.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't5', except possibly through another path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-881","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar and the string we're evaluating. The grammar consists of a series of production rules, all of which are in CNF. Each rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left-hand side and two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S. The string provided is a sequence of tokens ending with 't34', which suggests that the string consists of terminal symbols.\n\nFrom thegrammar, I notice that there are several NT (non-terminal) symbols like S, NT22, NT61, etc. The string we're evaluating looks like it's built up using the right-hand sides of these production rules, replacing non-terminals step by step until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to perform a leftmost derivation. Starting with S, each production step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with its right-hand side until only terminals are left.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, the initial step is to replace S with NT56 and NT45. Now, I need to process these NT56 and NT45.\n\nFrom the grammar, I'll find their production rules. \n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\nSo, NT56 is replaced by NT69 and NT44. \n\nNT44 is another non-terminal. Checking the grammar, NT44 -> NT3 NT26. \n\nContinuing, NT3 is a non-terminal, but wait, in the string, I see 't3', so it must be a terminal. Let me check the grammar. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT68 NT46\nBut wait, in the given string, we have 't3', not 't68 t46'. Hmm, that suggests that maybe I made a mistake. Because according to the grammar, NT3 can't directly produce 't3'; it produces NT68 NT46. So perhaps this indicates a problem. Alternatively, maybe there's a chain of productions that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me see if any NT symbol directly produces a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I should scan all the production rules to find any NT that directly expands into a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT70 -> 't17'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't27'\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't29' (this might be a typo, but assuming it's correct)\n- NT20 -> 't34'\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT50 -> 't3' ... wait, NT50 -> 't3'? Because looking back, the grammar has:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided earlier, I see:\n\nNT50 -> NT25 NT8\nBut then, looking for NT50 in the string, there's 't50'? Wait, no, the string doesn't have 't50', but in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, some of the productions produce t's with numbers. Let me list them:\n\n- NT70 -> 't7'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't27'\n- NT26 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't29' (possibly a typo, since NT26 appears twice)\n- NT20 -> 't34'\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't24'\n- NT59 -> 't34'\n- NT50 -> 't3' (Wait, is that correct? Or is it NT50 -> 't3' or 't70'?)\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, the line says:\n\nNT50 -> NT25 NT8\n\nBut in the string, I see 't50' isn't in the string, but it's not, the string has 't5' (from 70), but maybe 't50' isn't present. Let me check the given string:\n\nThe string is: t5 t36 t29 t4 t36 t10 t7 t17 t4 t4 t1 t10 t17 t9 t24 t6 t37 t24 t0 t4 t37 t6 t3 t4 t5 t36 t25 t36 t4 t4 t4 t9 t9 t24 t6 t3 t4 t33 t4 t33 t27 t34 t29 t4 t29 t29 t4\n\nWait, actually, 't50' isn't present. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-877","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. Context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined by a set of production rules, and the string in question must be derived from the start symbol, S, through a series of replacements based on these rules. Each step in the derivation must follow the productions exactly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's presented in a way that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols. Additionally, some of these productions have terminal strings as their right-hand sides. Specifically, several symbols end up being directly linked to 't' followed by a number, like 't5', 't4', etc.\n\nThe given string is: `t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t3 t4 t33 t12 t28 t33 t4 t17 t4 t29 t33 t33 t32 t34 t25 t36 t26 t17 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4 t33 t4 t26 t36 t4 t4 t33 t24 t4 t24 t15 t4`.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string step by step and see if each terminal symbol corresponds to some production in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, so I think the right approach is to try to build the parse tree from the string, seeing if each terminal can be matched by an appropriate production, moving from the left to the right or using a recursive descent approach.\n\nBut parsing the string directly might be complicated because I need to know where each production leads. Alternatively, I can try to look at the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be derived from S using the given rules.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the structure of the grammar and the string might help. I notice that the start symbol S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is split into two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45. Each of these needs to generate a part of the string. So, the string starts with t5, which is linked to NT45 or another non-terminal. Let me check the NT45 production. Looking at the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT22 NT7, right? So NT45 expands into NT22 and NT7.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar again. NT45: Yes, line 55: NT45 -> NT22 NT39. Wait no, line 55 is NT49 -> NT22 NT66. Wait, looking through the grammar: Let me list some of the key productions.\n\nWait, for NT45: Looking at the lines:\n\n- Line 55: NT45 -> NT22 NT39? Wait, no. Let me check all lines:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar. The user provided the entire grammar, so perhaps it's better to list all the productions, but that's time-consuming. Instead, I can note that NT45 \u2192 NT22 NT39? No, actually, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT45, I see line 55: NT49 -> NT22 NT66. So perhaps I misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, lines are numbered from 1 onwards. For instance, line 55: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66.\n\nHmm, maybe I should create a mapping of each non-terminal and their productions to have a clear view.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string and see if it can be constructed by the grammar. The string starts with t5, which is in NT56's production? Let me see.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT65 is not present; instead, terminals are in forms like 't5', 't3', etc. I need to check each production that results in these terminals.\n\nWait, for example, in the grammar, 't5' is in NT56's production. Wait, looking back, I see NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. Then, NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and so on. Wait, perhaps it's better to track how each terminal is derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the start symbol S and trying to see if we can build the string step by step. But that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that in Chomsky Normal Form, the minimal way is to split the input into the number of symbols equal to the length derived from the start symbol.\n\nWait, the number of symbols in the string is significant. The string has 71 tokens because I can count each 't' followed by a number as a separate token. So, the string has 71 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will require the string to be split into a structure compatible with the grammar. \n\nWait, in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the derivation tree is a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string must have length equal to the number of non-terminals in the derivation chain plus one. Alternatively, more accurately, the string's length is variable, but the derivation can be constructed by always choosing the correct productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about whether the string can be parsed back into the grammar. So, for each terminal in the string, we can see if it corresponds to any production in the grammar, and if so, which non-terminal it comes from. Then, recursively check if the subsequences can also be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to simulate a recursive descent parser.\n\nLet me try to outline a possible parsing approach:\n\n1. Start with the string: T = t5 t36 t25 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t3 t4 t33 t12 t28 t33 t4 t17 t4 t29 t33 t33 t32 t34 t25 t36 t26 t17 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t4 t33 t4 t26 t36 t4 t4 t33 t24 t4 t24 t15 t4.\n\n2. Check if the first symbol matches any production on the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nSo the first two symbols must be the expansions of NT56 and NT45.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production of S is a split into two non-terminals. So the beginning must be NT56 NT45. So the first symbol should come from NT56 and the next from NT45.\n\nLooking at T[0], it's t5. So let's see which NT produces t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nBut t5 isn't directly in that. Wait, 't5' is in NT56's production? Let me check all NTs that produce t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT56's production isn't t5. Wait, let's check all NT and their productions for terminals.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 'tX' where X is a number.\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' (line 73)\n- NT69 \u2192 't5' (line 80)\n- NT70 \u2192 't17'\n- NT61 \u2192 't27' (line 113)\nWait, the lines are extensive, but perhaps key NTs that directly derive 't's are:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26 (line 38: NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26)\n- NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49 (line 55: NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49)\n- NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66 (line 80: NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66)\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each NT to their productions with terminals:\n\nAfter reviewing all productions:\n\nHere's a list of NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT68 \u2192 't3' (line 73)\n- NT69 \u2192 't5' (line 80)\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' (line 75)\n- NT61 \u2192 't27' (line 114)\n- NT8 \u2192 't13' (line 104)\n- NT22 \u2192 't0' (line 33)\nWait, but 't0' isn't in the string.

{"custom_id":"request-898","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a bunch of 't' tokens with numbers, like \"t9 t15 t36 ...\". Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, meaning each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT56 NT45. So the starting point is the combination of these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT56 and NT45... I need to see where they go. NT56 is in a rule that produces NT69 NT44. And NT45 is in another rule, let's see... the first line after the grammar is S -> NT56 NT45, so I need to figure out NT45's production.\n\nWait, scanning through the rules, I see NT54 -> NT6 NT45, and NT55 -> NT56 NT45. But I'm not seeing a direct production for NT45. Hmm, maybe I'm jumping too fast. Let's list out all the NTs and see their productions.\n\nLet me go through the grammar step by step. Starting with S: S \u2192 NT56 NT45.\n\nNow, finding where NT45 and NT56 go. Looking for NT45 in the rules: I see NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. So NT45 could be part of that. But I also need NT56's production. Looking through, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT56 NT45 \u2192 NT69 NT44 NT45. Now, I need to find NT69, NT44, NT45. Let me see NT69: the rule is NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So NT69 becomes two non-terminals.\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT70 \u2192 't5'. Wait, NT70 is a terminal because in the last line, NT70 \u2192 't17'. Oh, no, wait: looking back, the last few rules show that some NTs are terminals. So NT26 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 't29', etc. So 't' tokens are actual terminals, and the NTs are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string to see how many tokens there are. The string is: t9 t15 t36 t1 t25 t15 t37 t10 t4 t9 t24 t26 t9 t24 t6 t6 t17 t4 t4 t17 t4 t29 t5 t17 t4 t3 t4 t29 t33 t17 t4 t29 t33 t9 t15 t36 t4 t4 t29 t2 t6 t28 t4 t33 t24 t13 t4 t4.\n\nCounting these tokens: let's see, 1,2,... up to 43 tokens? Hmm. Each production step in the grammar would generate more tokens. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production introduces two non-terminals, and the entire string consists of terminals (t followed by numbers). So perhaps the grammar represents a derivation where each non-terminal breaks down into two parts, and this continues until only terminals are left.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be the result of substituting the non-terminals down to the terminals. So, perhaps each step doubles the number of tokens, but through substitutions.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to parse the string top-down using the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach, like checking if the string can be reduced to S using inverse productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to see which strings can be generated by the grammar and whether the given string matches one of them.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many NTs are associated with specific terminals, like NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29', etc. So, perhaps the string is built by combining these 't' tokens in a specific order.\n\nWait, the grammar has about 20 NTs, each pointing to specific others. Maybe the string can be split into substrings that match the NT productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built recursively, starting from S and breaking down into NT56 and NT45, each of which breaks down into more NTs until we end up with the terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The entire string is:\n\nt9 t15 t36 t1 t25 t15 t37 t10 t4 t9 t24 t26 t9 t24 t6 t6 t17 t4 t4 t17 t4 t29 t5 t17 t4 t3 t4 t29 t33 t17 t4 t29 t33 t9 t15 t36 t4 t4 t29 t2 t6 t28 t4 t33 t24 t13 t4 t4.\n\nI'll start from the first token: t9. Looking back at the grammar rules, which NT produces 't9'? Looking through, I see NT63 \u2192 NT25 NT70, and NT25 \u2192 NT10 NT something. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that directly produce 't9':\nLooking through the rules, I see NT39 \u2192 NT21 NT24. Hmm, no t9. Let me check more.\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 't9': Let's see, for example, NT36 \u2192 NT25 NT70, but NT70 is a terminal. Wait, no, NT70 \u2192 't17' perhaps? Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT26 \u2192 't4' or 't29', NT25 \u2192 NT10 NT something, NT25 \u2192 NT10 NT something else. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't4' (multiple times), and NT26 has another production: NT26 \u2192 't29'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me look for which NTs produce 't9':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT61 \u2192 NT34 NT8, no 't9'. NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39? Not sure. NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, which goes to NT63 NT49 and NT44.\n\nWait, perhaps 't9' comes from NT25. Let me check NT25's productions:\n\nLooking back, NT25 is not directly listed, but I see NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39 and maybe others. Alternatively, perhaps NT25 is a terminal, but no, NT25 is part of the grammar, probably non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't9'.

{"custom_id":"request-895","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. CNF is helpful for certain algorithms, like the CYK parser, but since I'm doing this manually, I need a different approach.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol, it's S. The first production is S -> NT56 NT45. So, S must generate two parts, each starting with NT. The string starts with t5, which is generated by NT70 (from NT70 -> 't17'). Wait, no, looking back, in the string, it's 't5 t36...'\n\nWait, the string starts with 't5', which is generated by NT70? Wait, no, looking at the NT rules: NT70 -> t17. So how is t5 generated? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT56 -> t33. So t5 is generated by NT56. Wait, no, in the string it's 't5' as the first token. Wait, no, looking again: the first node after S is t5. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT70 -> t17, but where is t5 generated? Let me check the NT rules:\n\nLooking for t5: There's NT56 -> t33, but that's t5? Wait, no, wait, I'm looking at the string that has 't5', so in the string, the first token is t5, which must come from a production that generates t5.\n\nWait, the NT rules include:\n\nNT70 -> t17\n\nNT56 -> t33\n\nHmm, but the string starts with 't5'. So where does t5 come from? Let me check each NT production that ends with t5.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT70 -> t17: so t70 is t17\n\n- NT56 -> t33 (which is NT56 producing t33, which is t5? Wait, no, t33 is 't5'? Let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the string: it's 't5 t36 t29 t4 t33...'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some of the productions end with t's, like NT56 -> t33, which is 't5', right? Because in the string, t5 is the first token.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the mapping is different. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nNT rules:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t32\n\nNT26 \u2192 t4\n\nNT22 \u2192 t0\n\nNT2 \u2192 t12\n\nNT13 \u2192 t1\n\nNT34 \u2192 t24\n\nNT3 \u2192 t36\n\nNT45 \u2192 t4\n\nNT68 \u2192 t3\n\nNT61 \u2192 t18, etc.\n\nWait, some of the NTs produce t's directly. So for example, NT22 \u2192 t0, but the string starts with t5, so that's not NT22.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t5, which must come from an NT production that ends in t5. Let me see the NT production:\n\nLooking through each NT rule, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't7' (from NT70 -> 't17', wait no, wait, the grammar is given in the text as:\n\nNT55 -> NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nNT55 -> NT44 NT56\n\nNT49 -> NT22 NT66\n\nNT56 -> NT69 NT44\n\nAnd then lower down:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nHmm, looking through all the NT productions to see which ones produce 't5':\n\nLooking through the entire list, the only t's are:\n\nt1 ~ t36, t4, etc. Wait, no, looking at the end:\n\nLooking at each NT production, the right-hand side includes some t's:\n\nFor example, NT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me go through each line:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, so if an NT rule produces 't17', then to get 't5', I must find an NT production that produces 't5', but I don't see any in the given grammar. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, the user pasted the grammar with lines like NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, and then some lines like NT70 \u2192 't17', NT31 \u2192 't17', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT70 \u2192 't17' and NT31 \u2192 't17'. So that means these NTs produce t17, not t5. So where does t5 come from? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the user's grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nNT70 -> 't17'\n\nNT30 -> 't17'\n\nSo those produce t17, but I don't see any NT production that produces 't5' in the given grammar. That seems like a problem because the string starts with t5.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check all the NT productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t36\n\nWait, no, 't36', no t5.\n\nWait, no NT in the provided grammar ends with 't5', except maybe I'm misunderstanding the mapping. Wait, perhaps in the grammar, some NTs are abbreviations for producing t's, but perhaps 't5' is a node that has multiple productions, but in the list, I don't see 't5' being produced. Maybe the string has a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nAssuming the string starts with t5, but in the grammar, there's no NT that directly produces t5. Therefore, unless the string is incorrect, the grammar can't produce it. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the T rules are different. Wait, the grammar only has NT productions, but perhaps t5 comes from a non-terminal that produces t5 through some steps. Let me check the NT productions again:\n\nLooking for t5: none of the NT rules directly produce t5. The NT rules are all combinations of other NTs. For example, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26, and so on. None of these have a terminal, except when they have a t5, but looking through the provided NT rules, I don't see any NT that ends with a t5.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT68 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT70 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, none end with t5. So if the first token is t5, it's impossible unless I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is supposed to start with NT56, which produces t33, which would be 't5' (since t33 is the 33rd token? Wait, no, the string is a sequence of t tokens: t5, t36, t29, etc. So I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe the initial S is producing NT56 and NT45. So let's step through this.\n\nS \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, which again can go on.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to build the tree step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to attempt to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each production in CNF is two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So in the string, each 'tX' must have a corresponding NT production that ends with that tX, and then each step combines those accordingly.\n\nWait, but as I saw earlier, the string starts with t5, but the grammar doesn't have a production for t5. So that seems impossible. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the grammar lines.\n\nLooking at the grammar, lines like:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, which would produce t3 when NT36 \u2192 't25'? Wait, no, looking through the NT rules, NT36\u2192 't25'.\n\nWait, but the string has t5 as the first token. Since the grammar doesn't have an NT producing t5, the start symbol S can't generate t5.

{"custom_id":"request-915","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding what I have.\n\nThe grammar consists of a set of production rules that start with the start symbol S and expand into other symbols. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except the symbols that are terminals, which seem to be the 't' followed by numbers or single letters like 't5', 't17', etc. Wait, no\u2014I should check each production to see which symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that some symbols like 't9', 't24', etc., appear on the right-hand side (RHS) of the rules. These are probably terminals because they're leaves in the parse tree. The other symbols are non-terminals, like S, NT22, NT61, etc.\n\nThe input string is a sequence of these terminals: `t9 t9 t24 t6 t36 t10 t5 t36 t25 t17 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t4 t12 t28 t33 t4 t4 t3 t4 t24 t26 t7 t17 t6 t17 t4 t33 t4 t33 t33 t27 t34 t1 t24 t25 t5 t9 t17 t34 t13 t6 t36 t29 t4 t4`.\n\nI'm a bit confused because in some cases, the same terminal appears in multiple productions, but each terminal is fixed. So, to check whether the string is in the language, I need to see if it can be derived starting from S by expanding non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nFirst, I should note that in CNF, the grammar is set up such that each production is either a single non-terminal producing two non-terminals, or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. But looking at the given grammar, every production on the RHS is two non-terminals. So, this is a strictly binary expansion. That means each string in the language will have a structure where the number of symbols is a power of two, because each expansion of a non-terminal doubles the number of symbols. But wait, is that always the case?\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, meaning each non-terminal A expands into two symbols. But if those symbols are non-terminals, they can further expand. So the total number of symbols in a derived string can vary, not necessarily a power of two, but built by successive binary expansions. However, the provided string's length is 48, which is 48 symbols. Let me check if 48 is a possible number of symbols from the grammar.\n\nEach application of the productions increases the count by 1 each time a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. Wait, no. Actually, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so each expansion doubles the number of symbols each time. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. In CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, which means one non-terminal expands into two. So, each expansion step takes a non-terminal and replaces it with two symbols. If those symbols are also non-terminals, they can be expanded further.\n\nThe length of the string starts at 1 (the start symbol S) and increases as each non-terminal is replaced by two. So, the length after k expansions would be 2^k. But that's only if all non-terminals are replaced. However, if some non-terminals are not replaced (i.e., they are terminals), they contribute to the length. Wait, no, in CNF, non-terminals can only expand into other non-terminals, not terminals. Wait, but looking at the given grammar, some of the productions have terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, looking back, for example, NT70 \u2192 't17'. That is a terminal. So, in this grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree. So, for example, if S can be replaced by two non-terminals, which in turn can be replaced by either non-terminals or terminals, eventually leading to a string of terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, not all non-terminals produce terminals; for example, S \u2192 NT56 NT45. Both NT56 and NT45 are non-terminals that likely produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, the process of expanding each non-terminal until you reach terminals will eventually build the string.\n\nBut this string is 48 symbols long. I'm not sure if that's compatible with the grammar's expansion rules because the expansion is such that each replacement doubles the number of symbols (if the non-terminals are not terminals), but if some produce terminals, the counts might not be the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the given string backward, using the grammar, to see if I can derive it starting from S.\n\nThis is a top-down approach. Starting from the start symbol S, and trying to match the string from the end.\n\nBut let's see. The string ends with 't4'. So, perhaps the last symbol in the string is 't4'. Now, we should find a production that ends with 't4' as the last symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me find rules where the RHS can produce 't4' as the last symbol. For instance, looking for a rule A \u2192 X Y, where Y is a terminal, specifically 't4'.\n\nLooking at the given productions, I see:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8: this would produce NT25 followed by NT8. Not helpful.\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT3 NT26: ends with 't26' which doesn't match.\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't27' ... hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, looking for any production where one of the RHS symbols is 't4'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example:\n\nLooking at NT2 \u2192 NT48 NT66, and NT48 \u2192 NT25 NT39. NT25 \u2192 NT10 NT39, and so on. I don't see 't4' in any of the RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me check all the NT rules for 't4':\n\nLooking at the given RHS, the right-hand sides, I see:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, there's a rule NT26 \u2192 t4. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nWait, no. Looking again:\n\nWait, the rules are given as:\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT28 NT26\n\nNT61 \u2192 NT18 NT59\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT49 NT31\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT36\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT45 NT5\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT36 NT3\n\n...\n\nWait, looking for any NT that directly produces 't4' as a terminal. Hmm, wait, is 't4' an terminal or a non-terminal?\n\nWait, in the production rules, if a symbol appears on the RHS without being followed by another NT, like NT26 \u2192 t4, is that possible?\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is directly replaced by 't4' except in the very beginning. Wait, in the given grammar, let's see:\n\nIs there any NT \u2192 t4? Or does any production have 't4' as an RHS?\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only t's with numbers I see are:\n\nt9, t24, t6, t36, t10, t5, t36, etc.\n\nWait, looking again at the rules:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46\n- NT46 \u2192 t4\nWait, yes, look at NT46 \u2192 t4. So, NT46 is a non-terminal that can produce 't4' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT39 \u2192 t21.\n\nAlso, looking back: NT26 \u2192 t4. Wait, no, earlier I thought NT26 was a non-terminal, but let me check the grammar. Looking at the list again:\n\nThe last rule is:\n\nNT46 \u2192 t4\n\nAlso, in NT29's rule, I don't see any, but looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at all NT22, for example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT63 NT45\n\nAnd in NT22, is there a direct production? Not that I see. So, let's make a list of all non-terminals that can produce 't4':\n\nFrom the production rules:\n\n- NT46 \u2192 t4\n\nAlso, perhaps NT39 \u2192 t21. Wait, I'm not so sure. Wait, NT39's production is NT39 \u2192 t21, so NT39 can produce t21, which is another terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t4 in any RHS:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nWait, in NT22's production: NT22 \u2192 NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-917","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which makes it a bit systematic. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and S produces NT56 and NT45. Each of these seems to be a non-terminal that further breaks down into two other non-terminals. For example, NT56 -> NT69 NT44, and so on. Each of these non-terminals eventually resolves into a terminal symbol, like 't5' or 't17', or sometimes another non-terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols. It's quite long, so I need to find a way to parse it through the grammar. Either I should attempt to apply the grammar's productions step by step to see if I can derive the string, or I can try to construct a parse tree.\n\nGiven the complexity of the string, it's impractical to perform a manual step-by-step derivation without any errors. Alternatively, I can check each production rule to see if each part of the string matches the left-hand side of a rule or can be broken down accordingly.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string from left to right, making sure at each step that the current substring can be derived from one of the non-terminals. I can use a recursive descent parser or a similar method, but doing this manually would take a long time.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that the string starts with 't5', which appears as a terminal in multiple productions. For example, NT70 -> 't5', and NT69 -> 't5', among others. So the string starts with either of these. Let's see: in the given string, the first symbol is 't5', so let's see if it arises from NT56 or any other non-terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the start symbol S -> NT56 NT45. So the first two symbols of the string must come from NT56 and NT45. So the first symbol is 't5', which is 't5' perhaps from NT56, but let's check. NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So from NT56, we get 't5' from NT69? Wait, NT56 is broken down into NT69 and NT44.\n\nWait, let me correct. When you have a production like NT56 -> NT69 NT44, the NT56 non-terminal can produce two non-terminals that then expand into symbols. So the entire string is built by breaking down each non-terminal into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo for the start: S -> NT56 NT45. So the first part is NT56, and the second is NT45.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT45 is: let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT45 -> NT45 is not present. Wait, I should look for all NT45 productions. Scanning, I see:\n\nWait, no, let me search for NT45. Hmm, the grammar provided seems extensive. Let's look for NT45 in the productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45\n- NT25 -> NT10\n- NT55 -> NT44 NT56\n- NT45 -> NT39 NT21\nWait, actually, looking again, let me scan through all productions:\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me re-examine the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking through each production for NT45. Scanning each line:\n\n- NT55 -> NT56 NT45\n- NT25 -> NT10\n- NT69 -> NT63 NT49\n- NT21 -> NT71 NT30\n- NT49 -> NT22 NT66\n- NT68 -> NT28 NT26\n- NT61 -> NT18 NT59\n- NT21 -> NT49 NT31\n- NT70 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't17'\n- NT18 -> 't27'\n- NT26 -> 't4' and also 't29' \u2014 two productions for NT26\n- NT63 -> 't9'\n- NT45 -> 't4' and also 't24' \u2014 two productions.\n\nOh, okay, so NT45 has two productions: NT45 -> 't4' and NT45 -> 't24'.\n\nSo when S expands to NT56 NT45, the first part is NT56, and the second is NT45. \n\nLooking at the string again: the first symbol is 't5', which could be from NT70, but in the production, NT56 -> NT69 NT44. So perhaps the initial 't5' is from NT70, but how does that connect with S which uses NT56 and NT45.\n\nWait no, S is NT56 NT45. So the production for S is NT56 followed by NT45. Each of these is a non-terminal that can expand.\n\nSo the initial part is NT56, which expands to NT69 and NT44.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't5 t36...', so the first symbol 't5' must come from either NT56 or NT45. But NT56 is first, as per S->NT56 NT45.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The production for NT56 is NT69 NT44, so NT56 -> NT69 | NT44? No, wait, the productions are split into binary, so NT56 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT69 followed by NT44. So, to expand NT56, we replace it with NT69 and NT44, each of which may be terminals or further expanded.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is 't5'. Looking at NT69's productions: I see NT69: NT63 NT49.\n\nWait, maybe I should check each symbol step by step. Let's consider S as NT56 NT45. So the first part is NT56, which is NT69 and NT44.\n\nLet me list the productions for each NT:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49\n\nNT63 \u2192 't' or NT70?\n\nWait, no. NT63 is in the grammar as a production, but in the provided grammar, for example, NT63 is part of the left-hand side of some rules. Let's look for NT63's production.

{"custom_id":"request-939","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which simplifies things a bit.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in a CNF grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, all productions are either directly generating a terminal or combining two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the productions are combinations of two non-terminals, except the ones where a terminal appears. Each non-terminal on the left side can be expanded into two non-terminals on the right. Some of the right sides directly give a terminal, like NT70 \u2192 't5'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals connected by spaces: \"t5 t36 t29 t4 t3 t4 t36 t4 t4 t4 t9 t15 t17 t4 t29 t24 t10 t17 t5 t4 t17 t36 t29 t4 t17 t6 t17 t4 t9 t9 t2 t6 t36 t4 t4 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t25 t3 t4 t33 t24 t13 t33 t4 t29 t4\".\n\nI think the approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can derive the entire string step by step. Alternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, using the CYK algorithm might be an option, but given the size of the grammar, that could get complicated. Alternatively, maybe building a parse tree or checking step by step would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string in terms of the non-terminals and see if each terminal in the string can be matched by a production in the grammar's terminals.\n\nAnother idea is to check if each terminal in the string can be generated by some production, and whether the entire string can be covered by such productions. That is, for each terminal in the string, ensure that there is a production rule that directly produces it, and that the preceding and following symbols can be matched accordingly.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions except for the terminals require that the left side can be split into two parts. So, perhaps each terminal or non-terminal in the string must correspond to exactly one production step.\n\nSo, let's break down the string:\n\nt5, t36, t29, t4, t3, t4, t36, t4, t4, t4, t9, t15, t17, t4, t29, t24, t10, t17, t5, t4, t17, t36, t29, t4, t17, t6, t17, t4, t9, t9, t2, t6, t36, t4, t4, t4, t4, t5, t17, t4, t25, t3, t4, t33, t24, t13, t33, t4, t29, t4.\n\nEach of these must be matched by a production from the grammar. Let's go through each token and see if it has a corresponding production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are all the 'tX' strings, except for the non-terminals. So each terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule where A \u2192 a. Let me check each:\n\n1. t5 \u2192 NT70\n2. t36 \u2192 ?\n3. t29 \u2192 ?\n4. t4 \u2192 ?\n5. t3 \u2192 ?\n6. t4 \u2192 ?\n7. t36 \u2192 ?\n8. t4 \u2192 ?\n9. t4 \u2192 ?\n10. t4 \u2192 ?\n11. t9 \u2192 ?\n12. t15 \u2192 ?\n13. t17 \u2192 ?\n14. t4 \u2192 ?\n15. t29 \u2192 ?\n16. t24 \u2192 ?\n17. t10 \u2192 ?\n18. t17 \u2192 ?\n19. t5 \u2192 NT70\n20. t4 \u2192 ?\n21. t17 \u2192 ?\n22. t36 \u2192 ?\n23. t29 \u2192 ?\n24. t4 \u2192 ?\n25. t17 \u2192 ?\n26. t6 \u2192 ?\n27. t17 \u2192 ?\n28. t4 \u2192 ?\n29. t9 \u2192 ?\n30. t9 \u2192 ?\n31. t2 \u2192 ?\n32. t6 \u2192 ?\n33. t36 \u2192 ?\n34. t4 \u2192 ?\n35. t4 \u2192 ?\n36. t4 \u2192 ?\n37. t4 \u2192 ?\n38. t5 \u2192 NT70\n39. t17 \u2192 ?\n40. t4 \u2192 ?\n41. t25 \u2192 ?\n42. t3 \u2192 ?\n43. t4 \u2192 ?\n44. t33 \u2192 NT48? Wait, the grammar has NT33 \u2192 t4, but wait, in the grammar, 'NT33' doesn't exist. Wait, looking back, the grammar has 'NT33' as a production? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see rules like NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45, etc., but I don't see any NT33. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, the only 't33' terminal is in the production NT50 \u2192 NT25 NT8, but that's not a production for NT33.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nIn the grammar, I see that NT33 isn't present on the left side of any production, but on the right side, like in 'NT45 \u2192 t4', but that's not a production; it's a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the rules are on the left, so all the left-hand side are NTs. Looking for 't33' in the left side: I don't see any NT with 't33' as a right side, so that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake because in the grammar, 'NT3' has a production to 't4' as NT3 \u2192 NT68 NT46, NT46 \u2192 NT26 NT39, etc. Maybe 't33' is a typo? Alternatively, perhaps 't33' refers to another NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again: looking through the grammar, I see 'NT20 \u2192 t6', 'NT25 \u2192 t10', 'NT39 \u2192 t21', etc. Hmm, I don't see any NT with a production to 't33'. Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's meant to be 't21' or 't22'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar does not have a production for 't33', so the string cannot be generated because of that terminal. But wait, the string ends with 't4', but the 34th token is 't4', which is okay.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user meant 't3' somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the string, it's 41 tokens.

That's good because it simplifies some parsing tasks.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t36 t29 t4 t36 t4 t4 t4 t5 t17 t4 t17 t4 t33 t4 t29 t5 t17 t4 t5 t3 t4 t29 t4 t29 t9 t0 t6 t36 t29 t4 t26 t3 t4 t4 t3 t4 t29 t5 t3 t4 t4 t33 t24 t13 t33 t4 t29 t29 t4`.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, I notice that all non-terminals are on the left side, and the terminals are on the right. Each production either expands into two non-terminals or is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll check if the grammar contains all the terminals present in the string or if some are undefined. Scanning the string, I see terms like 't5', 't36', 't29', 't4', etc. Now, looking through the grammar, each of these must be terminals if they appear on the right side without any following non-terminals. For example, NT70 \u2192 't17' so 't17' is a terminal.\n\nSince all the terminals in the string are defined in the grammar (like t5, t36, etc.), that's a good sign.\n\nNext, I'll try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Parsing can be tricky, but maybe I can find a pattern or use the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, a top-down approach might be feasible.\n\nLet's consider the first part of the string: 't5 t36 t29 t4...'\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is made up of NT56 and NT45. Each of these non-terminals needs to expand into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nStarting with NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44 and NT54 \u2192 NT6 NT45. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49, and NT55 \u2192 NT56 NT45. Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for known terminals and see if they correspond to the first few symbols.\n\nWait, NT26 \u2192 't4' is a terminal. So if NT26 appears, it produces 't4'. Let's see if any of the non-terminals lead to 't4'.\n\nLooking at NT45, in the grammar, NT45 \u2192 NT22 NT5. NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48, NT63 \u2192 't9', NT48 \u2192 't24'. So NT45 can expand to 't9' and some other non-terminals that might produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, NT26 is a terminal 't4', so if the string starts with 't4', but in our case, the first symbol is 't5', so maybe NT56 or NT54 can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking at NT56, it's not a terminal, and the terminals in NT56's productions are in NT69 (NT63, NT49), which don't directly produce terminals like 't5'. Wait, NT48 \u2192 't24', so maybe NT46 is another one.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's list all the terminals in the string and see if each can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the string corresponds to a sequence that can be built from the grammar. The grammar seems a bit complex, but maybe certain parts can be identified.\n\nAnother idea: find the shortest derivation or check for any obvious patterns. For example, looking for repeated structures or seeing if the string can be split into parts that match known productions.\n\nWait, looking at the first few symbols: 't5 t36 t29 t4...'. Let's see, 't5' must come from some NT. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66, and NT21 \u2192 NT71 NT31. Looking for 't5', let me check if any non-terminals produce 't5'.\n\nYes, NT70 \u2192 't5' and NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49. So 't5' can be from NT70 or NT5.\n\nLooking at NT5 in the grammar: NT5 \u2192 NT1 NT49. NT1 \u2192 't24'. NT49 \u2192 NT22 NT66. NT22 \u2192 NT63 NT48. NT63 \u2192 't9', NT48 \u2192 't24'. So NT5 can produce 't24' and 't9', but not 't5'. Therefore, 't5' must come from NT70, as it's directly the terminal.\n\nSo the first 't5' is from NT70. Now, after NT70, the next symbols are 't36 t29 t4...'. So after NT70, which is a terminal, the next symbol must be the next non-terminal expanding.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT56 and NT54 are the start symbols. Wait, looking back, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT56 NT45. So S is split into two non-terminals, NT56 and NT45.\n\nTherefore, the string must be a concatenation of these two. So perhaps the string starts with something that can come from NT56, followed by something from NT45.\n\nBut the string starts with 't5', which is from NT70. But NT56 and NT45 do not produce 't5' directly. Therefore, this suggests that the string might not be generated by the grammar because the first symbol 't5' doesn't fit into either NT56 or NT45's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parsing is more complex, but given that NT56 and NT45 are the roots, the string must come from their concatenation. So, perhaps the string starts with some production of NT56, followed by some production of NT45.\n\nWait, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44. NT69 \u2192 NT63 NT49. So 't5' could be part of NT56's expansion. But NT69 is not a terminal, so if the string starts with 't5', perhaps that is produced by NT56's terminal, but that doesn't seem to fit because NT56 expands into NT69 and NT44, both non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example, NT56 \u2192 NT69 NT44, meaning that NT56 must produce 'something' that starts with NT69 and ends with NT44, but NT69 is not a terminal, it's another non-terminal. Therefore, the first symbol of the entire string must be from NT56 or NT45.\n\nBut NT56's first symbols are NT69, which isn't a terminal, so the string's first symbol is 't5', which isn't from NT56, so this might mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some way the string starts with a concatenation of two non-terminals that together produce 't5'. But looking at the grammar, the only way two non-terminals can combine is through their productions.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the string can't be split into two parts where each corresponds to NT56 and NT45.\n\nLet me count the symbols. The string has 73 symbols. Wait, no, looking at the string again, it's a long list of symbols, but each is separated by spaces. Let me count them:\n\nIt's 73 symbols. Since each production in the grammar is two non-terminals or a terminal, the total number of symbols should be 2^n +1, but that's only if it's a leftmost derivation. For this string, 73 symbols is odd, which isn't possible unless the last step is producing a terminal. But 73 is an odd number, and each step either adds 1 for a terminal or 2 for two non-terminals. So 73 is 2*36 +1, which would require 36 steps, ending with a terminal. So maybe possible.\n\nBut regardless, back to the point. The string starts with 't5', which is a terminal.
